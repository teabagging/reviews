The broadcast was so good, and I had heard that there was an import recording of the show, that I was actually looking for that CD. Since I couldn't find it, I had to \\"settle\\" for Slow Down. Now I wish I hadn't waited. Keb Mo takes you form the Delta to Jump Blues and everywhere in between. This is not a purists blues CD, but rather one that will appeal to the masses.

The screw on the spiral slicer does not pull itself through as it's supposed to do and the hole that you put your finger in to turn it is small and hurts. It just spun in place unless I put pressure on the screw while turning. Then it sliced until the screw was flush with whatever you were slicing and spun in place.

The other production company seems to be one guy with a camera... you get the idea.It looks like it could have been shot over a single weekend during Spring Break in Daytona. Most of the time is spent on 2-3 wet t-shirt contests. You hear neither the music and voices of the live event nor some choice music or songs, what soundtrack there is consists of 2-3 techno beats repeated over and over (likely a royalty-free selection).There are a few cute girls in it, but they're not worth the poor camera work and home-movie production values.

Anyway, if you have already seen Exorcist Beginning than you may find this a bit lengthy. Regardless, this version came out before the other prequel and did okay in terms of a story though the scare factor is almost non-existent. Dominion is mainly about the earlier years of Father Merrin from the original exorcist movie. Things don't get intense until the very end and I honestly prefer Exorcist Beginning over this. The stories between the two are almost exactly the same. Plus, the dvd features are lacking and the deleted outtakes aren't that good. It is interesting that the same actor who played Merrin in Dominion went on to play Merrin in the other prequel as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist\\" (2005)","review":"This is a good movie.

I am tired of viewing films that have profanity occupying 10% or more of the total movie dialogue. The screen writers spared us the \\"potty mouth\\" on this film.The movie also does a decent job of depicting the reality of spiritually dark, demonic forces and their harmful effects on human beings. I watched it over and over again. It gives a great portrayal of how Father Merrin becomes \\"The Exorcist.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"BETTER LEFT ALONE","review":"While Paul Shrader's typically lush, original version of the Exorcist prequel is infinitely better than Harlin's incoherent mess, it is still an exercise in futility. The original Exorcist has spawned nothing but srangely dense, difficult to swallow meanderings that have nothing to do with the heart, soul and terror of the original. It's as if the screenwriters and directors of all of these sequels and prequels and offshoots missed the commercial appeal of the first and only decent Exorcist movie: it was a basic, well-told story of good versus evil. It made the devil real. It was scary. Though there are moments in Dominion that have a strange, poetic beauty to them, the movie starts out in debt - it has no compelling story to tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"I bought this film the same day I bought the Renny Harlin version.

I tried to ignore the horrible CGI FX used. I mean, for God's sake why would you CGI a snake?!? They have camels in this movie, could they not get a snake from somewhere?? The CGI hyenas, snake, and other special FX are pretty horrible. It does have a couple of interesting ideas that are kinda shocking (e.g. the cripple boy's appearance, that little baby skeleton, and the maggot baby). I started feeling this movie was taking too long to get to the point around 40 minutes before the movie was over. The storyline was good, but it could have been explained in a shorter time. The acting seemed to get worse as the movie progressed. I am going to check out the other Prequel to the Exorcist. I heard that Dominion was the better of the two Exorcist prequels, but I am scared to think the other is worse than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"It really is that bad","review":"Yes, the other reviewers were right. The studio bosses were right. But as someone who feels The Exorcist is one of the true masterpieces of cinema I needed to see what Schrader made anyway.... Lemme tell ya - you CAN miss this version.This version of the film is a completely boring, thematic re-hashing of the original Exorcist. The faithful priest and the questioning priest. The innocent who's possessed. Oh, what an insult!Of the two versions of the Exorcist Prequel (which I have seen both), I prefer the Harlin version. It was an okay film. Not great. But the saving grace for Harlin's version was he let Vitto Sorranto do his thing with the cinematography and we got some truely memorable shots! But in this version Vitto is held back and could be mistaken for some amatuer.Anyway, thats my take. On the whole, the series began and should've ended with \\"The Exorcist - The Version You've Never Seen\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Word Description: Stink Bomb.","review":"This movie stinks on so many levels I don't know where to begin. The biggest offense of this film is that it is just not scary - tedious, stupid and predictable would be a better description, but certainly not scary. The acting is wooden, dialog stilted and the special effects laughable. I've seen community theater productions with better set designs than this turd of a movie. My brother recommended this film and I'm still not speaking to him. If this is supposed to be the better of the two prequels to the original Exorcist I can't even begin to imagine how awful Renny Harlin's other prequel (Exorcist: The Beginning) must be. I now understand why the studio executives at Morgan Creek pitched this stinker overboard before it was even finished! Hell, it took two whole days just to get the smell out of my house that this movie made. Director Paul Schrader has proven the only thing worse than demonic possession is boredom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Casper is scarier.","review":"Casper is scarier than this junk.As you may know, there was some problem during the shooting and the director was replaced, so I heard, and they wound up making two movies. Well I saw the first one last year and it was decent. Not scary, just decent. Well today I saw this Dominion movie, and I can see why they fired the director. I can only picture the director showing this dud to the studio executives, and after the movie ended and the lights went off, one of the execs turned to the director and said \\"Didn't anyone tell you this was supposed to be a scary movie?\\"I saw it on DVD and still walked out a few times to go to the bathroom and check my email. Without a doubt, not only was this one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but should get an award for making a jackass out of me for renting the almost-same movie twice.An Oscar should definitely go to the marketing geniuses behind releasing a movie made from the scraps of another movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"It needs less then one star","review":"I believe after The Exorcist 2, The Exorcist series just stedily went down hill. Pt 3 lost its fear factor; The Beginning lost its fear factor and lacked good effects; Dominion had no fear factor at all, the effects sucked, the plotline was not original and it was boaring, the acting was poor, and the movie was about an hour too long. If you want to see movies with great possession scenes check out The first two Exorcist movies, Stigmata, The Exorcism of Emily Rose, or American Haunting. Don't watch this even if it comes on the tv, you'll be waisting your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dominion, to be watched for comparison only","review":"If you are a true fan of the Exorcist, watch this strictly for comparison vs. what was released in it's place, and how it ties in with the original. I was extremely disappointed with this movie and even though Exorcist: The Beginning has it's flaws, it's far better. This movie fails miserably in plot/content, acting, and effects to name a few. It will easily be forgotten with Exorcist 2&3. It should have been released as a bonus disk with The Beginning as originally planned, but was shelved for good reason. Rent, don't buy, and try not to fall asleep as I did twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"The most horrifying thing about this movie is that I spent money to watch it. This movie is not scary at all. It's tedious and predictable. The writing is sub par and now I understand why the studio rejected this version to remake a second version. I've seen the 'qualified' theatrical release (Excorcist: The Beginning) and that one is better than this waste of celluloid. Both of them are nowhere as good as the first two Excorcist movies of course. Anticipating that I would be scared sooner or later, I kept watching, but boy was I wrong! This movie is just plain lame. If you want to watch, just don't expect much from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Godawful!

It didn't offer anything that the beginning did not. In fact, I didn't even finish watching it. I think Uwe Boll (who is, no doubt, the worst director of all time..that's a whole new topic) could have done better. (actually, probably not.

I watched the live action TV show, couldn't get enough of the cartoon, had all the action figures, comics, puzzles, stickers, and anything else they made back in the day!If you are an old school Hulk fan like me, then THIS SHIRT IS FOR YOU! It's styled after the old \\"underoos\\" t-shirts that were popular with 70s/80s kids and has a vintage (YES IT REALLY IS FROM THE SEVENTIES) screen print, that looks great. The shirt quality itself is also great. The shirt is a nice cotton/poly blend and the ringer colors are sharp bright \\"HULK GREEN\\". The shirt is a brand new, modern shirt, with the vintage logo.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUSIC FAN","review":"TRACK LIST:1. Sleigh Ride-Ferrante and Teicher 2.

He already has a Victorinox Swiss Army watch and likes the brand. He really liked the combination of the orange dial and black rubber band on the divemaster 500 watch, so I was searching everywhere for a good deal on my limited budget. The watch is a hefty, high quality, Swiss timepiece. The watch box & packaging is excellent. It shipped very fast and the price was incredible for a new, under-warranty Victorinox."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAJOR DEFECT","review":"Its a beautiful well built watch but with a major defect. The screw on crown is a total SCREW UP ! . After adjusting the time or date , when the crown is pushed in and screwing it down to locked position it starts to move the hour and minute hands of the watch. Doing some research in the internet it seems this is a common problem even for new Victorinox Divemaster watches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cast Recording!!!","review":"This Japanese cast recording is actually to celebrate the 10th anniversary of PHANTOM in Japan and is also the version from The Shiki Theatre(the're the purple, red, yellow, and green squares in the OBI). Im happy to say that this is my favorite Japanese recording out of the other two.Kiyotaka Imai is an excellent Phantom, and even though he's not as good as Yuichiro Yamaguchi(even though they sound alike)he does give a great performance. Rumy Iryo's Christine is wonderful,she sounds like both,the first Japanese Christine(Rioko Nomura)and the second(Kyoko suzuky),This is the only Christine that can make her voice soars,and she does something fantastic with her voice the last 16 seconds of the tittle song,its really great,buy it, you'll enjoy it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"do NOT waste your money","review":"this cost seven dollars for a few paragraphs that is just a review .

I created a great layout that looked fabulous on screen. But unless you have an Epson printer, it is very difficult to print out a great copy. My hp deskjet could not handle the supplied photo paper, so a friend printed on his Lexmark for me. It worked better, but still had a few problems. More paper should be included in the package in case of printing problems because after several printing problems, we ran out of paper and I could not find the same photo paper in any store; I ended up buying a second package just to get more of the same paper.Next time, I will make a book using the ofoto site -- much more professional looking (2-sided) and just as cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very simple to use, good results","review":"Storyline can be created easily. Captioning is easy. Took about 3 hrs to put togther a 20 page storyline, caption and print the pages. Ability to zoom and pan photos is useful.

Would like to see more themes and the ability to have an introduction page primarily based on text. Refill kits (without the s/w) would be great as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book but could still be better","review":"I recently purchased and completed my first book using StoryTeller. It was fun to produce, a bit tedious and labor intensive but the result was a beautiful book.It would be nice if the book could use two-sided paper and thus look more like a real book. That might be difficult to accomplish. On the other hand it would be easy to offer more than one font for captions, titles and such. It would also be nice to have more control with captions such as italizing or underlineing individual words. The buyer should be aware that this produces a very large file and even a fast computer is slowed considerably.Regardless of minor drawbacks, I think it is a great product and I'll probably buy several to use as very personalized Christmas gifts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epson StoryTeller","review":"This product is the best and easiest scrapbook kit I have ever used.

I was intrigued to learn that Emilio had written and directed it himself.Having recently seen Emilio, Demi, et al in \\"St. Elmo's Fire\\", I was anxious to view this film. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's interesting to note the scenes that Emilio *directly* borrowed from the film in which his father starred with Sissy Spacek - \\"Badlands\\". The premise of the movie is different, but the story does revolve around a young couple \\"on the lam\\". I say \\"Bravo!\\" to Emilio's first foray into movie-making.

They are able to find the grave and the dagger easily. Upon removing the dagger they release a curse which includes an evil tree creature. There are also natives in this area that sacrifice trespassers. Everyone fights everyone.Betsy Russell provides the token eye candy in this made for TV movie.

Lee is into 'african' at the moment so lots of tribal beats in background if you're into that. There's a great line-up of musicians but unfortunately even they cant do much with the music. The african girl sings Lovely Day - pretty good - makes it her own song. Lee's son plays drums but can't hear any drumming(!) - maybe on the final master they cut out his track? and supposedly co-writes one song. Dave Grusin and Lee plays in Lovely Days with some glimses of Harlequin album - well almost. Patrice Rushen background sings her song Forget me nots - but unfortunately not memorable unlike her original hit in the 80's. Overall nothing memorable and no tunes you can hum along. For this listener, I'll go back to listening to the truly great music from the earlier albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smoke 'N Mirror","review":"This was given to my niece who loves jazz.

My only question to Lee is when are you going to tour again??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smoke\`n\`mirrors","review":"Well, pretty good album, but for a long time Rit fan there are a better ones! The last song on the album reminds me of an old GRP sound, but for me there is always a question of (modern) production... For instance, I am very pleased to hear Fender Rhodes keyboard on a few songs, but this modern drum production sounds so shallow and therefore the whole song sound (the songs are great) is shallow too! Anyway, a solid 4!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Every Copy of this CD is DEFECTIVE","review":"Ever since \\"Thunderball\\" was issued on CD it has contained a defect. I have purchased 3 copies through the years and they all contain the same defect.On Track 5 titled \\"The Bomb\\" at exactly 2:40 and 2:41 minutes the sound goes dead and then skips a note as it returns. This is one of John Barry's best tracks on this album and it just ruins it, for me at least. I purchased my third copy just this last summer thinking the problem would have been corrected after all these years. It has not.As an interesting note, when this album was issued on Liberty audiocassette it did not contain this defect. When Liberty reissued the audiocassette simultaneously with the \\"Thunderball\\" CD it too contained the same defect. If you own these on audiocassette you will note that the serial numbers for both audiocassettes are different."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun Bond soundtrack in the best tradition of 60's Bond","review":"Sassy, brassy, exciting and fun. Sometimes dark and deadly. Not only is this a description of Bond, but of the soundtrack to \\"Thunderball,\\" one of Barry's better efforts. This movie had Bond escaping death so many times, and it's reflected in pieces like \\"Chateau Flight\\" and \\"Death of Fiona.\\" \\"Mr. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\\" and \\"007\\" are classic Bond pieces, although \\"007\\" appears in a different arrangement on the \\"From Russia, With Love\\" soundtrack. And then there is Tom Jones doing a memorable job with the main theme. The soundtrack misses five stars because of the plodding pace on a couple of the pieces like \\"Finding the Body\\" and \\"The Bomb\\" as well as the omission of Fiona's theme.

In fact twenty minutes into the film you'll wish they'd cover up with at least a pair of speedos.Set on the real-life Adelaide nudist beach of Maslin Beach in South Australia, you'll find yourself wondering if all the producers did was take a hidden camera down there for the day and video the dreary lot who frequent said beach.PLEASE save your money and don't be tempted by the tittilation you will NOT find on this DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TWO STARS ONLY FOR THE STORY LINE","review":"Quite frankly, I was embarrassed for all the blokes that decided to do this movie 'au naturel'.

Hendrix got herself totally in a knot trying to use the upper class english ah sound instead of ay or a. Add that to a whole host of other mispronunciations and it was badly distracting. She was also very hesitant, the words never flowed and she accented the ends of words as if she had a choirmaster conducting her. The story itself isn't one of Stephanie Laurens best, although pleasant enough, but it would have been greatly improved by a competent reading. I will avoid Hendrix in future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible pronunciation","review":"The story drags along slowly no excitement.I normally love having audiobooks on my ipod to listen to while I am swimming / housework etc but this was dreadful.The reading was stilted many words were mispronounced I will never listen to another book read by this reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"it's okay but its missing a few tracks . i like the album still listening to it to this day ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak is the word","review":"Who says Bond music says John Barry.

Barry only got 2 weeks to write the score to this weak film, with weak lyrics by Don Black, and a weak singer called Lulu. This all said, the soundtrack album is pretty weak. Lots of eastern rimram in too jolly a mood.

Rather than being organized alphabetically, the book is organized by region, which has its advantages and disadvantages. But with the guide's incomplete index, this is extremely frustrating. For instance, if you want to read up on Annecy, Lac du Bourget or Chambery, all of which rate multiple Michelin stars, you will not find them in the index. So after looking in the index and not finding them, you have to go find the table of contents. What is the name of the region? A for Alps? No such category.

You'd be wrong, unless you consider information about accomodation and places to eat to be superfluous, which this guide does.What does it contain? Lots of brief explanations of every last tourist site in France. In an effort to be inclusive, it has failed to prioritize, resulting in minor attractions being given nearly the same coverage as major ones. Yes, they rate things using their three-star system, but it's just not enough to distinguish the worthwhile from the merely amusing.The only reason the book merits two stars is the suggested walks provided for various cities.From now on I'm sticking to Lonely Planet. Their guides may be weighed down by unnecessary PC editorializing, but they give you enough logistical information to find places to eat and sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great grammar explanations, pretty complex","review":"I really like this book, but I'm a linguist and don't really consider myself a novice. Although I'm a beginner in Lithuanian, I'm not a beginner in studying languages, so the complex explanations weren't too hard to grasp. If you enjoy studying languages and want a complete grammar explanation, then I definitely recommend this book.

I also think it needs to be more colorful and the dictionary in the back of the book more extensive. This book is recommended for grammar gurus because it focuses extensively on sentence constructions and grammar. Lithuanian is a very hard language to write and speak and this book doesn't make it any easier to learn. However, this is the only book to learn Lithuanian and it does stress correct grammar. But it is very old fashioned and needs some color and liveliness. Learning a language is supposed to be fun and this book makes it more like work."},{"rating":"2","title":"From a tutor's perspective","review":"I have read the reviews for the book, and was quite disappointed. I myself am a Lithuanian, and I have been teaching Lithuanian for the past three months to an English speaker. From what i have seen published, even recently, there is not any other book that would cover grammar and vocabulary as well as this one does. Most likely, i would arrange the topics differently, but over all, this is a great book for a guided or independent study of Lithuanian language."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bit Outdated But Better Than Ramoniene/Press","review":"Although some of the dialogs and readings could use updating, this text is thorough enough for a serious language student. I had previously tried learning from \\"Colloquial Lithuanian\\" by Ramoniene & Press, but found it lacked depth, which led me to this book. It has a solid reference section, with the exception of the dictionary, which is a bit thin. I especially liked the pronunciation section which really helps you to \\"get\\" the sounds that are unique to the language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for information","review":"Dr. Elder definitely describes the places he visits in New Zealand adequately and the book gives some good information for people who are planning a trip in the future.However, I took many of his impressions about the people he met with a grain of salt. Dr. Elder seemed much more forgiving of people who may have erred if they had a good bottle of wine. He seemed harshly judgmental and impatient many times which made me regret purchasing the book, especially since the majority of the text deals with the people he met along the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Future Travel Wishes","review":"As a seasoned traveller, I am always searching for new and interesting places to visit.

Bill Bryson's book, In a Sunburned Country, was recommended to me. It was fabulous. Not only is he an excellant writer, he gives detailed history of the country and his travels and does it with a wonderful sense of humor.When I read the blurb on Straying from the Flock I thought I had found his counter part on New Zealand. I couldn't have been more wrong. While there is a smattering of history, the focus is more on what Elder ate for breakfast, a critique of the places he stayed and even his \\"one night stand.\\" I finished the book having no more of a sense of this country than I did before I read the book. (unlike all that I learned about Australia in Bryson's book). To say it was disappointing is an understatement. Maybe one day Bill Bryson will travel to New Zealand and write about his adventures in this beautiful country!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Made Me Want To Go","review":"Alex Elder has the rare ability to combine history, culture, cuisine, geography, and adventure with the personal involvement and insight of an experienced, thoughtful person. Elder always knows when geography or history or personal anecdotes are appropriate. From how to get to a glacier by helicopter or where to find the best fishing guide, Elder's book is full of timely information. But some of ther best reading comes when Elder tells of his excursions and his meals and his interactions with New Zealanders. Some chapters read like suspenseful popular novels. It is rare to find such an informative trove so well written. You will want to travel to New Zealand after reading STRAYING FROM THE FLOCK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying to impress you","review":"I was very disappointed in this book as it really said nothing about NZ. Rather it is an attempt of one arrogant New Yorker's idea of how to impress you with how well he can judge people and wine.I couldn't finish it. This is rare for me as I am a compulsive reader. I don't usually review books....but if you want to know about NZ this is *not* the item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Wonderful Book","review":"I purchased this book because I enjoy Dr. Elder's trading books and thought it would be interesting to read this departure. I really enjoyed it. New Zealand came alive for me and I feel completely familiar with the region. However to me, the best part was the adventure he had and how well he communicated the joy and excitement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very useful","review":"This book was not at all useful as a travel guide. It's not very useful as a story either. The author is self involved, self important and describes things we'd rather not know, like his sexual exploits (just look at his picture and you'll know why). He's into wine, women and cigars in a very annoying way. He complains a lot and seems to have an inability to roll with the punches. He is basically a sexist bore. Look elsewhere for a better read and info on New Zealand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self Righteous nonsense","review":"I brougth this with me to NZ on a current trip and left it behind at my last youth hostel. Not worth anymore of my time. I couldn't stand the tone of the book. It's written by someone who thinks far too highly of himself. He writes condescendingly about booking B&B stays and eating mussels and giving advice to fisherman about finding a specialist for hands. Obvious nonsense that anyone who has ever traveled has had to do do without feeling a need to write a book about it. Not much insight about the country of its people without it being filtered by a very wealthy person's tinted vision and with a need to make himself sound far superior than his audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateurish Travel Writing","review":"This book desperately needs an editor. Not only does the author repeat information several times, his spelling and grammar are atrocious. The author lacks respect for his reading audience which is mirrored by his smug disrespect for many of the people he meets in New Zealand.Perhaps an editor would have deleted his endless descriptions of meals, cigars, reckless driving, and liquor that crowd out more interesting details of his travels. I, for one, don't really care what he ate, smoked, drove, or drank through NZ. What does that have to do with his reader's knowledge of New Zealand?This book is a personal travel journal by an amateurish travel writer.

It is a nice quaint little story, but not helpful in the least if one is traveling to NZ. I agree with the other reviewer about the whiny tone of the book. Apparently, Dr. Elder, like most Americans (unfortunately), feel that the world is theirs for consuming. I don't think that the book gave an accurate account of the people of NZ, nor the changing NZ culture in the face of rampant globalization, which is what I had hoped for given the author's expertise. One positive aspect of the book, however, is the historical introduction that it provides. It is well-weaved into the story and does provide a useful framework for learning more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not particularly helpful if you are planning a trip to NZ","review":"Having just returned from a month-long trip to NZ, I had bought this book beforehand, hoping that it would provide me with some ideas or insight for my trip. Not possible. The author spent way too much time worrying (and whining) about the personal details of his homestays and dining arrangements. Do not buy this book if you want to plan a trip to NZ. It might be useful if you are interested in homestays, but only if you expect 150% from each homestay and are not ready to forgive the occasional idiosyncratic ways and needs of all human beings. The New Zealanders were mostly charming and engaging when we visited (July 2006). This book did not give that impression."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointed","review":"I purchased this book a month ago in preparation for our first trip to New Zealand. I am taking my family on this journey to celebrate the collage graduation of my two sons and my own retirement; therefore I was looking for positive and joyful accounts of this fabulous country. The writer of this book, Alexander Elder, presents New Zealand from the view of a stuffy opinionated older man, with little tolerance for others while lighting up his cigars and drinking his wines. I have not been able to finish the book due to frustration that it continues to not only miss the information I need but also presents what I feel is a narcissistic tale of Elder's travels, his other \\"best selling books\\" as well as his speaking engagements. I will not be reading further."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just so-so","review":"I'm off to NZ in a few weeks and was excited by the other reviews of this book. It sounded like a magical tour through a magical land. And while the stories were somewhat compelling, I found myself constantly waiting for something deeper, more profound, more passionate. The descriptions and especially the emotions in the writing were very superficial. Eventually I got tired of reading about all the wine and food and put the book down. Each day is it's own 2-4 page chapter which leaves the book with an unsettled feeling. Yes, I appreciated getting to know a little about a lot of things. But all in all, I thought the book was flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Proof Reading","review":"Since I've never been to New Zealand, I looked forward to this book.Every thing went fine until I got to page 52. After two words I thought-What is the reason I'm reading this stuff again--a typo?? then more similar words--What's going on??. I stopped went back to where I read these words before. I then found out that pages 21 to 52 were repeated. So The book starts nicely 1- 52; then 21- 52; then on to page 85. I can't believe a book which, is missing 30 some pages, could get through Proofreading and on to the publisher, printed and out to the book stores.I've read the book reviews--No mention of missing pages--VERY STRANGE.I returned the book, got my refund, so money wise I'm satisfied.For this reason I cannot recommend this book, unless you get it for FREEand or have an active imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke in a week","review":"It worked great for a whole week, the it just stopped completely.

This is without question the finest music you will ever listen to. Romantic, mesmerizing, and enchanting. These three adjectives describe the music of the great Paderewski.

Wonderful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignacy was not the best pianist, and here is the evidence.","review":"Paderewski was often derided by critics and other pianists of his day for the poor taste and Romantic exaggeration of his playing. This 2-CD set has the recorded evidence of the validity of these accusations on every track. Thus, it is a valueable document for teachers and players to show how someone famous, who could play all the notes and had a stellar career, could be a bad interpreter and performer.His \\"feeling\\" for Romantic repertoire was so eccentric that he makes some of the pieces sound like early jazz or ragtime. To hear it is to believe, and, if you believe in the myth of I.P as a great artist, prepare to have your bubble burst. If you want to confirm what history has generally said about I.P's musicality, this set is perfect. If you like the music, buy another, ANY, other recording.MBB"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell asleep after ten minutes...","review":"Where's the beef? Supposed to be about cars and overhaulin' , duh ??

It breaks the boundaries of standard fiction by giving the reader a taste of all the genres...from adventure to romance to suspense. The advanced technology gives a hint of the futuristic, yet the scene is solidly set in our present world.

It takes over an hour before you get a good look at it and by then at least 5 people are already dead. When the insect makes its appearance it's not bad for a low budget movie. This makes the last 15 minutes of the movie exciting. Unfortunately the first hour plus is boring. None of the characters are particularly interesting and neither is all the talk about illegal drilling techniques.

These clogs are very well built and look like they will last a long time, even if heavily worn.I found the fit a bit different from my old pair, a little tighter overall especially around the instep, but they are very comfortable nonetheless. For now I'll just give them time and wear them in some more, but if I were to get another pair I'd consider a half size up.They don't make my feet sweaty (the Bean's sometimes did) and they don't smell (ditto) after being worn for a long time.

But one way or another, you should hear what some, including myself, consider the best of Barry's work for the Bond franchise.The title song is the loveliest of the series. \\"The Cable Car\\" is as stark a confrontation with Fate as, say, the end of \\"The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly\\".

I thought that the monster's name was Frankenstein and that he was green and had metal screws studded into his head. However, after reading the book, I realized why it is considered a classic. The tales of both the scientist and his creation are equally disheartening and pitiful. The ambitious scientist pushed the limits and acted recklessly for his own interest. On the other hand, I ended up feeling sorry for the monster as well. He tried to be gentle but his isolation and rejection from other people ended up making him evil.This is definitely a story worth reading. It will help to buy this edition as well because the vocabulary words defined actually do help the story.

It's pretty sharp wide open and produces tack sharp images up to f11. f16 is good but by f22 there's noticeable softness. Diffraction kills this lens at what is a very useful aperture for depth of field. Forget sharpness at f32.The lens is very compact and light for a macro. That's good. It lives in my bag and I use it often. Color is neutral if a bit low in saturation. Contrast is also just a tiny bit low, though both of these factors are easy to correct with a little processing. I generally get good results with autofocus, though that is slow and there is no focus limiter on the lens. Since very close up work requires manual focusing anyway, I don't think that's a real problem.The lens works well for tight portraiture like head shots.

I was never good at statistics which is a pre-req for this class I just finished, but the book had me understanding better than my math class.

I used to be also a huge buyer of CDs, but they got expensive and I started suscribing to XM, so I haven't bought any for a long time. This CD MADE me go out and buy it! The problem with listening to Bluegrass is that a lot of the songs start to sound the same. That's not saying anything bad about Bluegrass, any kind of music shares that same critique, look at radio rock or radio country.Both of these guys are great, but Mark Johnson takes the banjo to a whole new level. Girl from the North Country gives me goose bumps every time I hear it. I've never heard a banjo like that and I've been playing banjo myself for 26 years. His style is old time clawhammer, but with a drive and difference that has to be heard. I hope that this album is getting the attention it deserves and I hope this group stays on its awsome road to innovation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clawgrass is wonderfully different!","review":"I liked Acoustic Rising so much that I bought another copy for my banjo teacher.

The antifogging solution provided works for more than an hour. The microphone records sound well. I have a High Def cam and the S.Pack did not decrease image quality inside or outside the water. In the specs it is stated that its buoyancy is positive, and by experience I recomend to buy a weight for it to avoid the camera going up in the water while you push and push down - even more snorkeling.

He is changed by the love of a woman and by the guidance of a priest.The violence perpetrated at random to blacks is graphically shown. However, it is not gratuitous.

This novel was one that kept me on my toes with many smiles and great suspense, not to mention the heart throbs, and poetry. I never knew what to expect next. Great stories told from both sides of the fence (although it was supposed to be fiction...smile). Reading this novel made me feel as if I was in the mix with the happenings. Such real life content, messages, and delivery from each author. Took me a minute to catch on as the characters appeared to have a reality based story line. I would say well planned and written out especially for portraying the characters real life activity and speech. I'm giving this novel a two thumbs up.

It is reminiscent of the J Horor movies. An excellent script, creepy as hell, and great efx! You will not be disappointed!!! Having said that...The Wailer movie was so bad that I cant even intelligently review it. The acting was horrible, the script was horrible, the production was well...you guessed it horrible!! The only positive thing I can say is that the image of La Llorona in the last 19 seconds of the movie was pretty scary looking. But not worth the $5 dollars.

It was a relief that 90% of my students were gone that day due to the Giants' world series parade because the film focused on shallow behavior with booty and booby shots throughout the majority of the film.

The Infantino just doesn't provide the support baby needs, and can be tricky to put on, especially when you're in a hurry. I've used a Baby Bjorn throughout my daughter's infancy, and it's still in great condition, ready to be used for the next baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Carrier","review":"We received this as a shower gift and it has really been nice. I definitely can't see spending big bucks for the Bjorn. This one is just as good. I used it quite a bit when our daughter was a newborn. She wanted to be close to me but I still had to get stuff done around the house too. It worked great because she wasn't very heavy. Now that she is 18 lbs. it gets a bit heavy, but she still seems to enjoy it. It is especially nice to use on days that are still a bit chilly but you want to go for a walk - baby is right there next to you keeping warm. The most important thing I have found is to make sure the straps are criss-crossing low enough on your back (as the manual states). If they are too high you will be uncomfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works better rear facing","review":"I bought this because I was too cheap to pay for the Bjorn and wasn't sure how much I'd use it. It worked great when my baby was 0 to 12 weeks old and we put him in it rear facing (his chest pressed towards us). Then around 3 months he wanted to ride front-facing where he could see, and as other reviewers have said, the front flap does *not* stay down! I tried to safety pin it but the pin came undone and the whole process became aggravating to my baby, so we don't use it anymore. I would think they would have tested this product with various age babies rear AND front facing before putting it on the market. I will buy a sling for my next baby and skip this product altogether."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as the Baby Bjorn","review":"I originally had a snuggli, but found it to be very cumbersome and uncomfortable for my 1st daughter. Was going to buy the baby bjorn when I read some reviews for the eurorider and decided to buy it instead. I don't regret it. My 2nd daughter has been riding comfortably since 2 weeks and I find it to be simple to use and extremely comfortable. That says alot since I primarily use it for hiking!! My back does hurt after 3 or 4 miles but with a backpack on to counterbalance me, I have no pain. I also only gave it four stars because the head support doesn't fold down very well when my 10 wk old faces out. I think I will install some kind of snap or velcro and the problem will be solved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Deal","review":"Like everyone else I was just about to spend quite a bit more to get the Baby Bjorn until I saw this carrier.

Like others, we almost bought the Baby Bjorn but thought we'd try this one first.

After all these years it probably doesn't have as much currency, but to my old ears it's enjoyable and is part of my personal memories of Atlanta.

People and characterization are the stars of this film not special effects and car chases. I'm glad to have had an opportunity to see this film and hope others would take advantage of a film that can bring out real emotion from the screen to the heart.

Rather than having the usual scantily clad women running around with a killer who showed up for no particular reason (see Sorority House Massacre 2 for that), this one tries to tie everything together in a thriller-like fashion. I am not sure the skills of any of the involved parties were really up to the task. Overall it is still an enjoyable movie. There is plenty of slashing and scantily cladness, and if you tune out the plot it is good mindless fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE!!","review":"Granted, I wasn't expecting much and am by no means judging these unfairly. I actually found the first \\"Slumber Party Massacre\\" quite a hoot! I watched \\"Sorority House Massacre\\" back in the day and remember it being above-par as far as bad slashers go. Clearly, I was out of my teenage mind. These movies are flat-out TERRIBLE. The first one is a blatant (and BAD) ripoff of \\"Halloween\\" and the second one is a second-rate Skinemax pic. The girls run around in tight lacy bras, thongs and teddies. And the acting is beyond horrid. Not fun to watch. Just bad and stupid. Sorry. For a really bad and FUN slasher pic, I recommend the bombastic, jaw-dropping \\"Pieces\\" (\\"BAAAATARDDDD! BASTAAAAAARD!!!!!\\") or maybe the first \\"Slumber Party\\" film. Do yourself a favor and skip both of these and all of the \\"Slumber Party\\" sequels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boff!","review":"Boring... go on with texas chainsaw, friday 13, body count, suspiria, nekromantik, schramm...

A raving psychopath murdered his family 12 years ago with the exception of one of his sisters, Beth (or Laura as we later find out). Now 12 years later Beth has joined a sorority. The sorority house itself is actually Beth's old house and her moving in sets off her maniacal brother who then escapes from an asylum and hunts her down.Sounds like a good plot, and it really is. Where the movie fails to deliver is in the suspense catagorie. It fails to deliver any really scary scenes, nothing that will make you jump anyway. The killing scenes are average but nothing spectacular and the flashbacks at the beginning are a bit confusing although it all comes together at the end. If your a fan of the 80's slasher flicks you might want to check this out but I'd recommend \\"Slumber Party Massacre\\" instead. 2 1/2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite highlighter","review":"I love the color of this highlighter.

The author has his own politcal beliefs and he does not shy away from expressing them. His left leaning political beliefs make this book hard to read.

Far More!","review":"John Barry delivers his most magnificent soundtrack ever! The title song is so catchy and has no lyrics because it sounds outstanding without them. It is reprised throughout tracks Ski Chase and Battle at Piz Gloria. One of the other treats of this CD is Nina performing Do You Know How Christmas Trees are Grown?A true Christmas favorite. Just wait. It gets better. Louis Armstrong gives it his all in a classic James Bond hit- We Have All the Time in the World. A stunning romantic melody that is played when 007 and Tracy's relationship grows. This soundtrack is packed full and will truly leave the you breathless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Without the defect OHMSS would be a five-star score","review":"I purchased this score when freshly released in 1969. It's one of my top favorites in spite of the defect. As soon as it was released on CD I purchased a copy hoping the defect would have been corrected. Sadly, it has not. On track 4 Ski Chase, at 2:30 (and here I'm guessing at the fault) it sounds as if the microphone on half the flutes on the right side is disconnected and then connected mid-note. On the repeat it's fine. I was encourged to post this review by the one done by gobirds2 for Thunderball also noting a defect. I assume that's why the price for it is low. It would seem that this should be the case for OHMSS, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is why James Bond is O.H.M.S.S.!","review":"When I got this CD, from this very page, I thought \\"Okay. The film was good, and I liked the music, so does that make the soundtrack good?\\" The answer is: Yep! This is one of the best film soundtracks I've heard. Track 1, by Louis Armstrong, is one of the best James Bond themes I've heard! Track 2 contains clips of Barry's The James Bond Theme and totally expresses the feeling of the scene. And, all in all, this is an excellent soundtrack! I'd say buy it. If you like this CD, I also recommend \\"For Your Eyes Only\\", also available on Amazon.com."},{"rating":"2","title":"O.H.M.S.S.=The Best!","review":"This Barry score had the best music of any Bond film. The dynamic opening title theme, which is, in my opinion, the best opening title in the series, is incredible. Some great music came out of this film, including \\"Over & Out\\", \\"Journey To Blofeld's Hideaway\\", and \\"This Never Happened To The Other Feller\\". But, again, like many other soundtracks, this one is missing some of the best pieces of music, like \\"Gumbold's Safe Break\\", and \\"Escape From Piz Gloria\\" (which have been re-scored on the Bond Back In Action CD). So, I must give this four stars, even though it is the best soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too sad...","review":"I love this anime, I'm not saying it's the best but it is definitely good. I'm hoping there's a second season because this one just leaves you off. This season showed how Guts met Caska and Griffith, how Guts lost he's arm and how Griffith became the way he is. This isn't the end of the line for Berserk, We haven't seen Guts fight anyone with he's huge sword and hand cannon yet, except for the 1st episode.All in all, this would make a great collection. It's story is skill full, the animation is exceptional and the voice acting is normal. I gave this anime 4 stars because of how it always leaves you off, especially the sad and grotesque ending were Caska gets raped and Guts looses he's arm and eye. He's suppose to either go berserk and save Caska and escape or the Black Knight comes and saves them, either way, it doesn't show you what happens and that will piss alot of people off.Order it all today and Enjoy"},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointing!!","review":"After going through all the previous eps. of beserk. i am very disapointed with the ending. it was nothing short of a hentaiesque finale.

She exhibits all the signs -- molested and sexually humiliated when young, tortured homosexuality, unhealthy obsession of death, repeated suicide attempts, S&M; play-acting, and etc. What saves her in the end is her confronting and overcoming a real life psycho killer. The film is beautifully shot. The slow first half feels like an art film. The second half hits like a sledgehammer(in much the same way as in the last 20 minutes of Audition).The film is also a cautionary tale to certain horror fans. Jiney represents some extreme horror fans who take too much sadistic delights in pain and death of fictional characters. What happens when they come face to face with the evil which has so far remained as darkest fantasies and wishes? As the old saying goes, \\"be careful of what you wish for...\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor asian horror","review":"This movie was not one of the best asian horror movies ive seen alot better.This movie stars out slow then takes a twist by the ending it was a big disappointment.I watch a lot of asian horror and gore but this one i dont thank ill bother to watch again.Could have had a better ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"strange...","review":"I really enjoyed this film, although I'm not sure I can really say why.

No ghosts, no creepy supernatural events.Jiney is a photography student dissatisfied with her life; it's only after she takes a photo of a dying woman that she comes alive. Her best friend Jas is worried about her obsession with death, and tries to help her through it. But just when Jiney thinks she has a handle on things, she's stalked by someone who knows her secrets.Most of the movie was well done: it's graphic and edgy, but you can really understand why Jiney is the way she is. The end--with the final confrontation and revelation of the stalker's identity--is both weak and unnecessarily squirm-inducing, however. I found out after watching the movie that Jas (Rosanne Wong) and Jin (Race Wong) are sisters in real life, which makes the scenes of Jas taking care of Jin rather poignant."},{"rating":"1","title":"It sucks","review":"and that's pretty much all I have to say about that.It reminds me a lot of Cinderella (the Japanese Horror movie) except it lacks everything that made that movie great and worth watching.I admit I didn't finish watching this film it lost my interest and just seemed to bland.

This is a history book. It is easy to read. It is not a book that attacks the Catholic church or lifts up Protestantism. Catholics and Protestant agree that there have been both good and bad popes.

In the opening chapters of The Bad Popes Russel Chamberlin traces similarities to the Joan story and the real life Theophylact ladies, it is a deliciously scandalous story. Case in point: their rivals invented the lovely term \\"Pornocracy\\", a political system dominated by prostitutes (it was fashionable at that time, as it often is in ours, to label powerful women with such epithets).

The original Doobie Brothers members reformed in 1989,after a seven-year split. McDonald joined the band in 1975 shortly before original frontman Tom Johnston's exitthe following year. The DB's had broken all ties with their original record label,Warner Brothers after the disbanding. This triumphant comeback was originally released on Capitol. The songs on this album are very good,I must admit. McDonald(in '89) was enjoying success as a solo performer. I believe McDonald decided not to rejoin the DB's. The DB's originally formed around 1969 or '70 and one night caught the attention of a WB producer who patronized the bikers' bar the band was playing at at the time.

You cannot judge a movie just because of the biceps or just because it has a sweet happy ending. Honestly, there is no artistic merit in this film at all. The storyline is very contrived, as if it were a fairy tale or a fantasy of getting it on with your best friend who was in the army. Also, there is way too much crying and tragedy in the film and thirdly, I know the film has a low budget but look at \\"Ethan Mao\\"! It too has a low budget but is more compelling.

From leaving a Germany to avoid persecution as a Jew to his rise in the academic and political world, Kissinger was hungry for making a difference. You learn of his role in opening the East and his close working relationship with Richard Nixon. Kissinger was one of the few of the Nixon inner circle that was not tainted by the stigma of Watergate.This book also humanizes Kissinger to his highs and lows and his surprising reputation of being a lady's man.Isaacson's books do a good job of giving the reader a well rounded perspective of his subjects. A good read and interesting subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kissinger","review":"If you like biographies you will enjoy this one.

Isaacson presents Kissinger in an unbiased manner, which helped me realize the incredible complexity to his personality and his achievements.

However I was immediately intrigued when I recognized several outlying characters-really enjoyed the Duke of Tremore and his story. I enjoyed this book, because it did have a different take than most. I liked stuffy Ian, loved to read of him loosing control. Lucia was interesting, and albeit gorgeous, had flaws. Please don't give me a perfect character such as Grace from \\"Kiss\\" and expect me to care what happens to her.This book was a keeper for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat tedious","review":"A spinoff of His Every Kiss, which was a very good read, and possibly one of my favorite historicals, She's No Princess almost seemed as if it had been written by someone other than Laura Lee Guhrke. While Dylan and Grace's story was unputdownable, I had trouble finishing Ian and Lucia's. I agree with the reviewer who said Lucia was a bit of a whiner and I never understood why Ian found her so attractive. The development of their relationship was never really elaborated on and by the end of the book I wasn't sure how the two of them had fallen in love with each other. While His Every Kiss was kind of a deep, heartfelt story, this one didn't compare. I found most of it to be monotonous and boring and not written with the cleverness that I had expected after reading His Every Kiss and Secret Desires of a Gentleman. However, I have faith that her other books that I bought will be much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"She out of control - and it so much fun to watch....","review":"She's No Princess by Laura Lee Guhrke is electric historical novel of illegitimate daughter to the Prince of Bolgheri and the English Ambassador who was ordered to find the wayward daughter a husband before the London Season was over.

Lucia was a annoying, irritating, conceited, spoiled brat. She manipulates Ian throughout the whole book to get what she wants. She flirts, uses her looks (and she's not the least bit ashamed of it) to get what she wants. She was not worthy in the least of Sir Ian. Poor man! He is the only reason I kept reading this book, and being able to read about Grace and Dylan. Lucia has no redeaming qualities and she seems to only get worse throughout the whole story till the end when she realizes that maybe she has not been completely fair to Ian.Her last two books this and The Mariage Bed have been poor books for me but if your looking for a good one by this authortry \\"Guilty Pleasures\\" - great book, great characters, great passion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yami No M. all the way!","review":"okay, this is not a very original begining for a review, because lots and lots of people have used it before, but..

However, the title of the book is \\"A history of information storage and retrieval\\", not the history of encyclopedia. The author seems to have assumed the encyclopedias as the only way of storing information.I did learn some interesting things from the book; yet, not much about what I was aiming to look for \\"information storage\\" and \\"information retrieval\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misplaced title","review":"In computer science as well as in library and information science there is a field devoted to information storage and retrieval. It has even got its own journals, e.g. \\"Information retrieval\\". Another journal, \\"Information Processing & Management\\" was formerly titled \\"Information Storage and Retrieval\\".This research area has an experimental tradition going back to the 1950'ties including the famous Cranfield experiments, and is today continued in the TREC experiments.This book mentions absolutely NOTHING of all this research. It is mainly concentrating on the history of encyclopedias. The author or publisher may have chosen this misguiding title because they have already earlier published a book about encyclopedias."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nitpickers be damned!","review":"Okay, so maybe this is not the perfect title for this book. Books (and now electronic devices) have for centuries been the prime method of information storage and retrieval, so I don't have any patience for the quibbling. (Often when someone has nothing to say, they resort to cavil, that is, raising trivial and frivolous objection.)This book is an amazing read. The content and style are both fantastic. Anyone who considers themselves a book-lover (and I'm assuming there are many reading this) must read this book. The author walks you through the entire history of knowledge accumulation, focussing on encyclopedias. He DOES include electronic formats when they occur in this history.I'm still a little beguiled that the other reviewers could miss the point so completely. It's as if they were to meet Da Vinci and refuse to speak with him because his name tag was wrong!That's my two cents, thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The End of The Journey","review":"It's been a long road, both for Youko (the lead character) and the fans. We've waited patiently for these volumes to be released and here they are. An end to a glorious series that any anime fan should consider as essential. Complex characters that drive a story that has almost as many layers as Dune. An onion like plot that has yet to be fully peeled yet satisfies those with a desire for great story telling. Don't let this jewel pass you by. Special thanks to Anime Works for bringing this beautiful series to these shores."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe you had to have been there","review":"Although \\"White Noise\\" still has some resonance in today's America, it remains a dead-on commentary about America in the 1980s. With remarkable prescience, DeLillo instantly grasped the weird changes that took place between 1979 and 1983, when cable TV opened up offbeat channels, when Elvis became a cult, when rumor supplanted fact and the written word surrendered in the face of an overwhelming onslaught from the oral culture. Given that all these trends have only worsened since, it's entirely possible that \\"White Noise,\\" like \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" and other cutting satires, cannot be appreciated fully by those who weren't there at the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"odd how so many misunderstand the point . . .","review":"This book isn't about the author's being \\"cool,\\" witty, or anything like that. It is a book about how contemporary American culture deals with and treats the concept of death. It seems as if either one loves the novel, or hates it . . . I think that those who hate it missed the point of the novel, and could not see how the sometimes confusing quotations and senarios develop the message."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHITE NOISE: Literature :: Seinfeld : TV?","review":"With very comical situations throughout, laced with characters from who-knows-what-planet and dialogue about \\"nothing\\", this novel could easily be split up into several episodes of a successful sitcom. DeLillo uses excellent sensory details, leading to easy visualization. Although most books are better than their movie counterparts, I am willing to bet that WHITE NOISE could be easily translated into an excellent screenplay, and, with proper directing, filmed into a masterpiece. A warning to those who cannot live without a rapidly moving plot: The first third of the novel . . . well, it lacks plot. This is not to say that it is not entertaining, it just doesn'y really go anywhere. That is why I opted for 4 stars instead of 5. But, do yourself a favor anyway and read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentiousness Run Amok","review":"Read this on an empty stomach or its unabashed pretentiousness will make you throw up."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know about this one.","review":"I have no idea how everybody's receiving this one so well. I mean, Hitler Studies? I'm supposed to take this seriously? If I wasn't supposed to take it seriously on some level maybe I'd like it, but everybody wants me to take this book real seriously and I can't do it. The repetition of product names (like Velamints) is silly and adds nothing. And DeLillo doesn't bother to throw in a plot until two-thirds of the way through. I like the bantering between Heinrich and Babette and their kids but aside from that I'm not seeing the High Importance of this book. This book is like a still-life of watching television passively, so if that's what you're looking for, this is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A snoozefest...zzzzzz....","review":"Funny? Maybe for about a chapter and a half. This book is a monotonic bore. The prose is lackluster, the characterizations cartoonish, the so-called portrayal of the absurdity of modern life (there's a new concept!!!) obvious at best. I could not have cared less about anyone in this over-rated piece of junk. A complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Kindle experience at a rip-off price","review":"DeLillo is one of the greatest American fiction writers, and \\"White Noise\\" is a magnificent novel. But don't buy the Kindle edition, which will completely destroy your reading experience. For some reason, the text loads to the device with a line space between every single paragraph.That's right. A line space between every single paragraph. Like this.And that means there's also a line space between every line of dialogue, even if a character speaks only a couple of words.The result is so disorienting, and such an insult to the author, that I bought the physical book (not from Amazon, I might add). If you love literature, throw away your Kindle and buy real books from real bookstores. At $13 plus shipping, Kindle downloads aren't even a bargain any more."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book offered theories to life's unsolved questions","review":"I thought White Noise explored a lot with the topic of death. I liked how Murray offered us an explanation for massacres, killings and wars. His reason was people were trying to gain \\"extra life-credit\\". It had some interesting aspects. The book had underlying themes throughout it, which was very clever. The symbolism is endless. I would recomend this book if you like abstract and in-depth novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was dying to read this book and ended up wondering why","review":"Although somewhat engaging for the first 100 pages, the book moved from interesting to banal. I had to force myself to finish it. I was especially disappointed since I had heard that it was extremely funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is supposed to be some kind of cult American Classic.....","review":"But it is really not. It is basically rubbish. It is trying to be ironic but failing. A left wing hipster might relate to the message the book is trying to communicate but most people will just find the book to be dull, drawn out and frankly uninspiring. If you like stories revolving around moaning middle class left wing academics then this is the book for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's art, for better or worse","review":"If a work of art is supposed to harness the resources at the disposal of its medium in service of a message, this book is a true work of art. It effectively communicates the disjointed, unsettled, alienating nature of modern life, parodies the detachment of both academia and modern parenting, and skewers the modern merged family. It shows off the facile satisfaction, and indeed, beauty of consumerism, and makes a dig through the household rubbish of a family into sacred augury. And behind, or under, or over it all, lies the ever-present fear of death - perhaps a bit too thickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Falls Prey to Its Genre","review":"In my experience, modern literature tends to build slowly to a crescendo a la Aristotle's poetics and then closes with a satisfying catharsis, whereas post-modern works start with a flourish and just fizzle in the last third. Delillo's work exemplifies this phenomenon.The first half is extraordinarily good writing; the characters are gritty and true-to-life and it seems to be headed somewhere specific. However, toward the end the dreaded meandering starts and from then on the end of the story could occur pretty much anywhere. It still earns 4 stars for some profound insights into post-modern American life, and inasmuch as the novel is an embodiment of that life the ennui-inducing end is faithful to its \\"text,\\" to tip my hat to crazy old Foucault. Fantastic read, but I predict you will scrunch your nose in exasperation in the final chapters."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece of satire and prose","review":"By R.Taylor (Not BLT Taylor and not a music review). My first impression of \\"White Noise\\" by Don DeLillo was that this book was scattered and going nowhere. But with an author of such acclaim, I went back and started again. This is when I saw the satire and caught its impact and the strong messages about the fear of death and the role it plays in our lives, and how we deal with, or try to avoid dealing with, the fear of death. DeLillo's message about our conventions, diversions and obsessions that we utilize as our \\"white noise\\" to deal with the daily rat race also came home with a poignant, and sometimescomical impact. The book provided great food for thought and discussion for our monthly book club."},{"rating":"1","title":"A really dull book","review":"This book has virtually no plot, the characterisation is almost non-existent, and it isn't funny. I bought the book because the idea of Hitler Studies was amusing, but the idea remains completely undeveloped. Maybe I missed the satire somehow, not being an American, but it seems like virtually everyone is tediously normal - apart from the fact that the children speak like adults and none of the characters are well drawn. The prose is very well constructed, but personally I like a bit of content too.Some of the other reviewers seem to think that this tedium and pointlessness is the underlying message of the book. If I thought there were enough people like this, I'd start a restaurant selling cardboard, grilled, boiled, sauteed... I'd tell customers it was a clever satire on British food."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"Probably the worst book I ever read. Oh, why you ask? Because the writing was annoying, the characters shallow, the narration pretentious. It takes more than snide comments about \\"life in America these days\\" to make a good novel. Satire is so often on a lowest level of art, because it presumes to show \\"us\\" (whoever \\"us\\" is) how shallow and absurd \\"our\\" lives are. However it completely misses the mark when the readers life is not shallow, boring or controlled by what's in the aisles of supermarkets. Social criticism in literature is so tedious and common, written so that the \\"intelligent observers\\" can have a generic laugh at \\"society\\" and feel superior. I am not impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The archtype of everything wrong with modern lit.","review":"If you enjoy books where a faceful of minute observations takes the place of a plot, where the main character is a lunatic wandering around in a lunatic world, where the author is so involved in constructing some type of difficult to discover meaning that when you figure it out, you realize that his 'insight' was so inane that it wasn't really worth five minutes of effort. Yes Don, modern life is kind of odd and confusing sometimes, can we please move on. I would only recommend this book to you if you are the type of psuedo-intellectual who reads estoric books to reveal your superiority to an uncaring world, the type of person who bores others for hours about the beauty of modern art when you couldn't tell the difference between a Jackson Pollack painting and a painters dropcloth, this is the book for you. All others, you have been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Beginning of the End of the Novel","review":"Delillo's disese has been spreading ever since this novel was published. The redundent fragments, the uncomphrehensable descriptions, and the false meaning that is being controlled by his illiterate notions of the dreaded \\"conspiracy\\".Delillo's attempt to debase literature and humanity is praised which makes it that much more ironic and ultimatley a pathedic sign of the power of publicity."},{"rating":"2","title":"here's the problem.....","review":"This book was amazing, for those of you who get it, awesome, all of us think on the same level, for those who dont, the problem might be that you are too caught up in the pop-culture that this book talks about so much to even realize that this book is a slap in the face to you. Maybe you should let go of these \\"truths\\" about life that you have come to believe over time and realize that there is more, stop being so closed-minded. I think that DeLillo has brought the ugly truths about our society into the spotlight and some of you just can't deal with it. Don't get mad at the book, some parts may be redundant, but listen to how you hold a conversation sometime? I'm willing to bet that you will be shocked when you hear something that sounds a lot like conversations from the book..."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolutely unreadable - no, unless your teacher insists","review":"I'd tried to read White Noise a number of times, thrown it across the room each time. But this time, with a couple of transatlantic plane flights in my arsenal, I couldn't fail to finish, right?Wrong. White Noise is terrible. It's full of dialogue that no one would ever say, precious, precious, gimicky, and gimicky. Every word is too clever by half, including \\"and\\" and \\"the.\\" I take it the grating serial monologs making fun of consumerism (oooh - how unprecedented!) are meant to emphasize the disconnectedness of modern life. But instead they show only the consequences of writing an arid echo chamber of a piece drained entirely of humanity or anything remotely resembling any claim at accuracy. It is, however, tremendously effective at annoying its readers.Fear not DeLillo haters. This will be off the syllabi before too long. And how we will celebrate!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was informative and somewhat interesting","review":"White Noise was an interesting book. However, I never fully understood the plot of the book. I didn't ever see any climax or anything that would grab my attention. The book was alright. I found myself falling asleep at certain points."},{"rating":"1","title":"I prefer life to death.","review":"I read this book because a friend whose taste I respected recommended it. And by recommended it, I mean he said \\"I didn't like it, but maybe you will.\\" Well, no. Droned on and on and on about death. The characters had no dimension- they were just mouthpieces so Delillo could set up conversations about death. I'm sorry, but I'm not that consumed by the thought of death. I will die one day, so will you, but for now I will enjoy life and not waste it obsessing over death. If you happen to have an unhealthy preoccupation with death, you will most likely enjoy this book, but I found it so terrible I almost wished for death. Writers like Hunter Thompson or Vonnegut or Tom Robbins or Keroauc will give you a much better insight into American culture, and are all FAR better writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"This book was awesome. I laughed all the way through. Jack's conversations with Heinrich and Murray made the book worth it for me. I loved the repeated nods to post-modernism theory. It's a smart and sharply witty book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The prose of impending death","review":"DeLillo manages to capture the subtlties of modern suburbia with amazingly accurate prose and an experienced eye. Jack Gladney's world is intellectually formless on which he attempts to impose some kind of meaning, no matter the resistance he encounters (the paralyzing wit of his own children, his wife's fear of death that seems to exceed his own, his obsession with the master of death himself, Hitler, and his inability to replicate the harsh gutturalness of the German language). DeLillo's book is a work of brilliance. It left me breathless and hyper-aware of my own surroundings. It left me afraid, amused, astonished, and branded with his own signature mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"suburbia just isn't this strange","review":"DeLillo is supposed to be one of our best contemporary novelists. Alas, when I picked up this book, I found a world of Hitler obsessions, death worries, multiple divorces, sexual blackmail, and toxic waste disasters. Perhaps there is some satyrical level that I didn't get, but I couldn't identify with any of this. THe characters are two dimensional and the story is too outlandish to be taken seriously.Is it my imagination, or are contemporary novels supposed to be bizarre? Sure, American suburbs are like an odd bubble in history, but no one I know is this crazy. This is mediocre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parody at its worst","review":"The author is so caught up saying something about modern society, he forgets that he is telling a story. The characters are weak and poorly written. The plot is so thin, I could see through the pages.A theme from this book is the placebo effect, but I think its ironic that this very book has its own placebo effect. Some people seem to actually trick themselves into thinking there is a story that is worth telling in this book. To these people I would say, \\"I have some sugar pills that cure whatever ails you.\\" The fact is there was no story at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"WTF.

He and his wife, Babette, have several children, residue of their past marriages to others. All of the children, however young, talk the same as all of the adults, however old.There is, in other words, no individuality in the dialogue.A toxic cloud enveloped part of the imaginary village where Jack and Babette live, but I didn't care, because there are no engaging characters in the book....END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pynchon comparisons odious and highly misleading","review":"What can I say? I don't read contemporary novels. I've been creeping toward more modern novels and had just read and was floored by Thomas Pynchon's book 'V.'. There is no basis for comparison here. White Noise does not stand up to the test of time even 20 years after it was written. Some of the concepts may have been ahead of their time, but they seem trite in retrospect. This is a light-weight throw away that has nothing important to say, although it desperately tries, about the human condition. I didn't find it particulary amusing, thought-provoking, or challenging and I didn't feel any compassion toward the main character as he spiraled toward the thinly-veiled conclusion. Better him than me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring as hell.","review":"Books like this (and for the most part, many works of Pynchon and Vonnegut) provide social commentary and overblown allegories of life in the modern age. White Noise is trying so hard to teach lessons and issue warnings that the message comes across as subtly as a teacher holding up multiplication table flash cards. Along with Breakfast of Champions and The Crying of Lot 49, this is the kind of book that I will no longer feel guilty about not liking. Boring and unrealistic, with a plot that wanders like a donkey lost in the desert, this self-important book provides me with absolutely no reading enjoyment. It's like listening to a 20 minute guitar solo by some bored jazz musician who turns his back to the audience. I've left the concert, see you at the bar. Read William Vollmann instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pass the Oil of Olay","review":"The obsession by these characters with pop culture and bad news rang true, so I can only assume that the characterization of middle age as a time of failing third marriages (think Woody Allen without the \\"humor\\") is also accurate. A chilling tale of (post-)modern emptiness."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best american novel of the Eighties.","review":"Divorce, pollution, television, computers, spies, firearms, drugs, science, supermarkets, pornography, tourists and Hitler Studies. All this and more is combined in a dryly (and - darkly) funny tale of middle class dread. Jack Gladney, professor of the only Hitler Studies degree program in the world, lives with his blended family in a New England College town. The Gladney's embrace all that SHOULD be comforting about middle class life, but nothing erases their fear of death. Things get complicated after a bit of infidelity and the appearance of an experimental drug (it takes away the fear of death).Those who either love or despise Pynchon should appreciate this startling picture of Middle American life wrapped into a tightly plotted suspense story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black Noise","review":"The protagonist is a professor who intellectualizes his family, his career, and his experiences into existential angst, like a college sophomore strung out on Sartre and Camus. Characters talk alike, and the plot reminds me of static between radio channels. If this is satire, it rings hollow.The protagonist's father-in-law, the most lively character, makes a brief appearance, delivers snappy parting lines, and disappears forever. The book gets two stars because of that character and because the descriptions are good.Spare me another \\"modern\\" novel like this, limp in spirit, vapid in plot, short on progress toward meaningful resolution."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Disappointment","review":"I read this for a fiction course, and was excited because I'd never read DeLillo before, but had heard great things of his Libra and Underworld.There are parts of this book that are very cleverly written. But entire pages go by and nothing really happens. I kept turning pages, waiting for the payoff, waiting for something that would make it all worthwhile, and it never really happened for me. It was a real frustration.I may one day still read Libra and Underworld, but I'll either borrow them or get them from a used book store. DeLillo has gotten the last of my money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 seconds","review":"Thats how long you need to get the theme of this thoroughly boring book. The ideas on modern culture were thought provoking when we read material with similar themes in 10th grade.

From it you can infer everything this book has to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"an anti-novel for anti-readers","review":"To say that Don DeLillo is pretentious is like saying that Mike Tyson is prone to anger: it's true but it doesn't really give you the full picture. Self-importance is DeLillo's defining quality and, in this sense, \\"White Noise\\" is his masterpiece. Every sentence seems unjustifiably pleased with itself; every page is dense with humorless profundity. The \\"Toxic Event\\" at the novel's heart has such an artificial, manufactured quality that it seems to arrive with the words VERY IMPORTANT SYMBOL emblazoned across it. Gore Vidal once described Pynchon's \\"Gravity's Rainbow\\" as the perfect teacher's novel, in the sense that it was plainly written to be taught rather than read. With all due respect to Vidal, and to Pynchon's unreadable concoction, \\"White Noise\\" is a strong contender for the throne: the symbols are plentiful enough to keep any grad student busy, and, more importantly, it's impossible to imagine anyone reading this novel except under duress."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written, poorly read","review":"Although one would not know it from this book, words do have meanings and must be selected with at least minimal care. With no plot, no character development and no discernable raison d'etre, this book would probably not make it past a college level creative writing seminar. Don't waste your money buying it or your time reading it; there are too many other good books that deserve both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long winded, dialog heavy","review":"A long long meditation on death. If you like to hear professors droning on about their obsession with death, without being particularly witty or profound, read this. Delillo tries so hard to be deeply insightful about the nature of human obsession with death, that his characters just end up sounding stilted, pompous, and frankly, ridiculous. Sure there are some great moments and characters- like Heinrich, or Denise, but none of them gets enough screen time. The Airborne toxic event is squashed into a few rushed chapters, and even though the book isn't trying to be a disaster thriller, there was so much potential in the moments in the barracks, all wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"There was a differnt style to the writing of \\"White Noise\\"","review":"\\"White Noise\\" was an interesting book because the problems that each character dealt with were not the termed \\"normal\\" problems of today's society. Most people don't have an underlying fear of death that compels them to do outrageous things. Also, not very likely will you see an entire area of a city evacuate because of a cloud. These points made the story a bit hard for me to follow because I couldn't relate to the characters. The book does however keep your attention after the first section. The book finally develops a story line to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, makes your head spin","review":"I had to read this book for a course on 20th century novels. I found it to be mostly plotless and nearly a complete waste of time to read. If the author hadn't been praised in the past for other novels he'd written perhaps I wouldn't have been assigned this and my time would have been better spent on a more worthwhile text. The book was unrealistic as well, if it was trying to make a point about the real world I didn't get it. Thank you for your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Highly Overated Author","review":"Boring!!

In general the book is condescending, obvious with characters who I had absolutely no interest in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated, Not Funny, Overrated","review":"A selection of my book group, I must confess to being totally underwhelmed by this National Book Award winner. This is the book that cemented Delillo's reputation as one of the modern greats, but I really failed to see much in beyond some pretty tepid superficial sniping at modern American culture and lifestyles. Set in a fictional town somewhat akin to Pittsburgh, the book's hero is a college professor of Hitler studies. It takes his (and his wife's) fear of death and seemingly tries to tell the reader that while they are so obsessed with death, they are missing out on life--in no small part due to all the \\"white noise\\" that forms our popular culture. I never found any of this particularly amusing or insightful, however I was in the minority of my bookgroup in this one, so take my opinion with a grain of salt... I guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece of Contemporary American Fiction","review":"DeLillo is a rare sort of writer: he seemlessly blends engaging fiction, biting satire, and shrewd cultural observation in one easily readable book. In Babette, Heinrich, Murray, and especially Jack (JAK) Gladney, DeLillo has created vibrant and dynamic characters that function as realistic human beings in the framework of the plot as well as larger representations of society in a broader, cultural reading of the text. Don't come expecting an edge-of-your-seat thriller, though--DeLillo takes his time and frequently steps away from the suspense, waiting until the last moment to spring a major plot device on his audience. This has turned off a lot of readers, who cite DeLillo as boring and pretentious. This he is not; he simply isn't Grisham or Patterson. If you want an intelligent, satiric look at society told by one of America's true living masters, then this book is very highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the faint of heart","review":"This is a brilliant book. I admit that I am a VERY jaded reader and a cynic at heart; any whiff of sentimentality turns me off. What Dellilo offers in White Noise is dead-on: neither satire nor straight realism, it is a brilliantly accurate reflection of life in the \\"informational age.\\" The scene where Jack and his son discuss wether it is raining or not is hilarious and frightening. Read it; laugh, cringe; pass it on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging!","review":"I was engrossed by this book from the moment I picked it up. While I can understand whyintellectual snobs will inevitably lambast this work and its cartoonish characters and absurd plot, I applaud this book for its genuine charm and quirkiness. After all, the purpose of writing is to entertain and enlighten the reader, not to win the prestigious and elitist praise of over-educated literati. A wonderful, fresh and entertaining book worth every moment spent reading it. I will read it several more times."},{"rating":"2","title":"bombdiggity","review":"The book was an excellent satire on many of society's stereotypes and conceptions.

It gives an intellectual approacch to the little things of the characters life. Although this is interesting at times, there is often too much analysis and gets a bit redundant. Especially the talk of Jack and Babette's fear of death, which occurs throughout the book. After a while, I got very tired of this talk of death and the analysis seemed too much and unnecessary. This makes the book drag and at times I didn't want to read any further because I knew what was coming.

White Noise is a book austensibly about death, the meaning of life and the frivolousness of consumerism.Mr. DeLillo has created a small world where moderately interesting people take great pains to be clever, bathed in non-sequitors and absorbed in seemingly silly arguments. I will say, however, for every 5 ridiculous conversations played out, there is one that contains the germ of an interesting thought or concept. When Jack and Murray have a discussion about death, rage, meaning and the reaching of conclusions based on honest reflection, the insight and complexity of the books' intent come to the fore.I wish there was more depth, less faux tongue-in-cheek patter in this work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated.","review":"This book was assigned reading for my contemporary American literature class. My instructor and most of my classmates raved and said how great Delillo is, calling him a genius. I could not disgree more. First of all, his style of writing and utterly pessimistic world views are not my cup of tea, therefore alienating me from the get go. Even worse, nothing he wrote was new to me. None of his ideas were original. If an author has nothing new to tell me & writes in a stlye that doesn't appeal to me, then I feel that book is a waste of my time (and money). Why the critics embrace Delillo is beyond me. I guess some writers are just en vogue and become very overrated in certain periods, much like Hemingway or S. King. I'd avoid this if I were you and read something by Vonnegut or T. C. Boyle. If this is considered the \\"cream of the crop\\" of American contemporay literature, we might as well watch T.V."},{"rating":"1","title":"The scintillating grace of a wet firecracker","review":"Written in 1984, DeLillo's delightfully obscure novel plows through a slice of prescient postmodern America at a time when America was stubbornly modern. However, anyone born since 1970 is environmentally sophisticated enough to breeze across this tattered landscape of a book with merely a nod. One might even wonder if perhaps the book was the result of a prolonged sleep deprivation jag as nothing seems to hang together in any but the most tangential, immaterial sort of way. There are assaults on meaning and symbol, but none calculated to break through into the realm of shared consciousness or gravity.A puzzling book, either a mild success or a grand failure, but not much else to be appreciated. Save your money for some meaningful white noise of your own and check this out from the local library, instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly, highly overrated.","review":"The reason so many professors of late 20th century fiction teach this book is the same reason that I feel that it's ultimately unsuccessful: it's a completely paint-by-the-numbers rehashing of an extrapolative social critique that's been done to death. That the narrative assumes that these observations are new to the reader indicates how pedestrian of a work it truly is. Its \\"content\\" allows professors to feel as if they're contributing to students' liberal education, yet its narrative structure is about as complex as that of an episode of \\"Father Knows Best,\\" so no students complain about how hard it is to read. The wide praise this book has received as a great postmodern novel is completely undeserved, and is evidence of how simplistic a view academia takes toward modern fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost interest","review":"Sorry, but the book didn't grab me.

Not because of the storyline, or music, but because the DVD conceals the nudity found in the original version in very uncreative ways that are very distracting from the plot. For example, objects are placed in front of the offending areas in ways that would have you beg for black bars instead.

Granted, dogwood is pretty hard wood, but it made me think about the people who wrote the 4 & 5 star reviews on this product. Were they cutting down 1 inch pine sapplings or what? I gave it a second chance: I charged it for another 9-10 hours, it ran out of juice again after a few cuts, and I was stuck hand-sawing again. This is the first time I ever returned anything to Amazon.com, but return it I did. And, yes, it does leak oil all over the place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for a quick clean up","review":"You wouldn't think this thing would do all that well, and no, it doesn't replace a gas powered chainsaw. But I don't need a gas powered one to trim certain sized branches, and a corded one is a pain in the butt when you don't have any outdoor outlets. This tiny, quiet little machine works perfectly for the quick cleanup after a storm, or for trimming back trees. Works pretty well with firewood too. I already have the cordless hedge trimmer and drill, so I have plenty of batteries charged and ready to go, but this thing manages a good 30 mins before it starts to putz out. Perfect for the small jobs."},{"rating":"2","title":"great value","review":"great value for trimming around the yard. Battery charge does not last as long as I would like, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a toy","review":"I bought this saw to cut firewood for me and my son. I have several B&D cordless tools that use the same battery that work great, including a line trimmer. I figured with the extra batteries I had, I could cut all the wood I wanted in one session. My intentions was to go out to our city's brush pile occasionally to cut smaller limbs (around 2-3 inch diameter). My reasoning was to avoid gumming up the carb of a gas chain saw by letting it set for extended periods of time. The first (and only) time I took out my cordless chainsaw, with the chain properly tightened, and oiled, and a fresh fully charged battery, I put the saw to wood on a small, green limb. After nearly 30 seconds of putting as much pressure as I could put on the saw without bogging it down, I cut about a quarter of an inch gash in the limb. Luckily, I bought this saw from a reputable internet dealer who not only allowed me to return it, but also picked up the tab for the return shipping. DO NOT BUY THIS SAW!"},{"rating":"1","title":"chain hassles","review":"I thought the light weight and size would make this a perfect compliment to my B&D tools. The problem is keeping the chain on.

Oh, and it leaks oil all over the place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cordless Chainsaw","review":"The chainsaw worked weel the first time I used it.

After several weeks of use I recommend this chainsaw. There are a few things to keep in mind though. First, the blade is not very long and its only 18V; large trees are almost impossible. Second, I also have the 3 piece B&D yard tool set and so I have 3 extra batteries. If battery I'm using gets low I can easily put in another. Lastly, the oil leak others speak of is minimal (if at all) and the saw does take some use and adjustments before optimal performance.

She discovered how light weight and easy it is to use rather than firing up the gas saw that I have been relagated to picking up the limbs that she trims off. We really love the Black & Decker battery system have several, the weight differnce between these and gas powered tools is enough to justify. Have multiple batteries on chargers so you always have a fresh battery, but should not be a problem after your initial paly time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little chain saw","review":"I've used this saw for three days now and am really impressed.

We have a small piece of property in the city. The first time he used it was for cutting up some small branches (1 to 1 1/2 diameter). That went fairly well although he had to stop often to clean the saw of small bits of debris. The next time was to cut up a larger branch 6\\" in diameter. The saw started fine but by the second cut was running out of juice. Fortunately he had a second battery charged and waiting. Unfortunately after another 2 cuts this battery also ran out of power. And since the batteries take FOREVER to charge it meant he had to quit halfway through."},{"rating":"2","title":"chain saw","review":"This is a great chain saw for women.

I skimmed through a few pages and just couldn't find the energy to keep going. The author may be a nice guy in real life for all I know, but in the diary he comes across as being truly pathetic. It is being generous to say that the writing style is childish. The book manages to write about sex in a completely unsexy, uninteresting way.

It ends with the suicide of Crown Prince Rudolf but before that event this book of a city captures the personalities of such people as Sigmund Freud, Arthur Schnitler, Gustav Mahler and Theodor Herzl. It was an amazing time in this city and the author brings together all of these highs and lows of politics, art, culture, and society into a delightful tapestry. The reader truly gets a feel for this city and these people and part of the joy, for the reader, is knowing what the future will hold for many of these characters, such as the struggling Freud. This is not a work of anaylitical history. One does not understand why this time and this city but the reader can sit back and enjoy the ride through this slice of history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Momentous months in Vienna","review":"This book, published in 1980, describes the events occurring in Vienna from the summer of 1888 to April 20, 1889 (the day before Easter and the day Hitler was born in an Austrian town (not Vienna)).. The story covers the doings during that time of Theodor Herzl (a playwright, not eyt a Zionist), Brahms, STrauss, Bruckner, Freud, Mahler, et al. and of course Franz Joseph and his son Rudolf. The Mayerling murder-suicide on Jan 30, 1889, occupy much of the time from that date to the end of the book. The book is well-done for its type--not history, except incidentally--and one feels one is authentically shown what Vienna was like to the people described. This is he third book by Morton I've read and I found it worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A spotlight on Vienna","review":"What an unbelievably well researched book AND a fantastic read.

Morton is a very knowledgeable guide. Unfortunately, he has little more than scorn for everything and everyone in sight. I suppose this is why he identifies with the neurotic, pleasure-seeking Crown Prince Rudolf, who was so uncomfortable with his surroundings, and in his own skin, that he committed suicide, after first murdering his seventeen-year-old mistress.After three hundred pages of Morton's nightmare version of this place and time, I'm ready for a more balanced and insightful treatment of the subject. Any recommendations?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, gossipy cultural history","review":"This is an extremely readable and enjoyable account of one of the most portentous years in Austrian history: its central story concerns the murder/suicide of the Crown Prince Rudolf and Mary Vetsera at the prince's Mayerling hunting lodge, while orbiting around this are mini-narratives concerning Freud, Klimt, Herzl, Schnitzler, Bruckner, etc.This is highly recommended for people who have enjoyed similar works such as Roger Shattuck's THE BANQUET YEARS. While Morton's narrative genuinely suffers from the perfect 20/20 hindsight take on history (not only, in his account, is the Empire doomed, but even the Emperor knows at the back of his mind that the Empire is doomed, which seems highly unlikely), and his overwillingness to tell us exactly what famous people were thinking at given moments (when there is no way he could know), the book is informative, exciting, and intelligent."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY MISLEADING","review":"Says \\"Over 10 hours of breathtaking footage\\". That would be the case if there was actually an abundance of underwater footage but, unfortunately, most of the series takes place on the surface via on-camera interviews, history lessons on war ships, and the explorers doing whatever. Those looking for uninterrupted footage of undersea lifeforms will be thoroughly disappointed and should avoid this set. Despite a low price I still feel cheated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not Great","review":"I read the reviews for this set of movies and decided to take a chance and pick it up, figuring what's the worst that can happen. I was pleased with the set. It has some interesting shows and nice footage of undersea animals. The only down side is the editing, it is an older television show that has been converted to a documentary format. The editing is a little jerky in places, sometime leaving a blank black screen. If you are hoping for a cheaper version of Blue Planet this is probably not it. If you are looking for a nice show at a decent price this is a good option. I am very happy with most of the episodes. If they would have spent a bit more time fixing the editing problems this would have been a great DVD set."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is a mess","review":"Rob Crow has to be one of the most diverse artists in music, and is probably one of the most prolific. This CD has something for everyone Ranging from Boy-Band pop to Death Metal. And any song writer that can write a whole song about Jedi Outcast has my attention. The only problem I see with this album is the same problem i see with all of his work; the songs are too short. The songs are only 2-3 minutes long, and when they end its almost dissatisfying; you want more but then it stops. This cd is mixed suprisingly well also. The Songs meld together and there isn't much dead space between tracks. Deffintily a good buy, but if you are just getting into Rob Crow a more conventional album like \\"Offcell\\" by Pinback may suit you better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Believe the bad reviews and STAY AWAY!!","review":"This is one of the worst insults to gay movies that I have ever seen.

It has a small footprint, and it looks nice on my work desk. I was looking for a small fan for my desk as my work office is hot all year round. However, the ideal fan needs to be quiet enough not to interfere with speakerphone conference calls. I can only have it on the low setting while on a call--any higher setting is too loud. I could deal with keeping it on the low setting, however, the dealbreak for me is the random vibration from the unit whether it is stationary or oscillating. If the vibration was consistent and not random, I could write it off as white noise. I've tried placing the fan on a mousepad to absorb the vibration, but the fan housing still vibrates. I'm not fond of the loud beeping either to change the settings. I would definitely have chosen a different fan to suit my needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for cubicle.

Took the fan out of the box and sat it on the desk plugged it in and it ran for full 30 seconds! The fan motor broke loose inside and it committed suicide!This thing is JUNK!I'm not happy!! A 30 dollar gift has turned into a 94.00 nightmare as i have not gotten any of my money back yet. And I just ordered another fan! Lasko 4000 Air Stik Ultra-Slim Oscillating Fan. If this one doesn't work! Walmart gift card!!!!Update.I've gotten half of my money back. I do expect the rest this week which will make this week number four. The lasko 4000 fan worked out!

Unlike some others, I don't find it to be loud at all and i really like that it has a timer on it.But I'm also questioning if it's really a new product as mine also had scratch makes on it. This could be from the cheap labor they use to put this thing together, but even the buttons had dirt marks which really makes me ? it even more.Since it works and the noise isn't bad I'm going to keep it, but I'm also going to place a call to amazon since others seem to have the same issue.But I would buy a 2nd one if I need it, it puts out a nice amount of air and keeps the room cool!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent choice","review":"I have this office at home, this item was perfect for the space and it operates with little noise.I do recommend it"},{"rating":"1","title":"msplus superpack winxpenglishna","review":"Did not work with my apple computer,requested help but did not get results I wanted which was to return idem & get credit"},{"rating":"1","title":"LOUSY!","review":"This product is now discontinued, but no one bothers to tell you that before you make your purchase.

In addition, you need to buy additional dvd burning software, because the dvd burning software imbedded in this software package will only create dvds that will run on a dvd player with the Microsoft logo on them.

It adds virtually nothing to XP. Too bad they didn't make it as interesting as their packaged media edition. That would have been worth the money, but old Bill who doesn't want to be the richest man in the world would rather you spend money on a new PC to get that product. The themes are nice but far too few for the price. The games are a gimmick since you have to pay to play the real things. The DJ is dumb and the dancers are cute but after a while boring.

It indeed has some good items but overall this is something one can live without.Games - Bowling game is actually a teaser version. You can play only two lanes. Others cost you extra. Two other games are not exciting.Themes and Screen Savers are mediocre.I liked the analog convertor but not too much. If you can get input from any audio device, this program can convert it into a digital format. Alas it doesn't convert to MP3 format. Also you need to keep computer completely free of other load while recording otherwise songs will be recorded slow or fast, but not on the normal speed.Dancers can provide some entertainment to young kids for two minutes but soon they find out that these dancers have canned actions. I liked Ben though especially when he gets tired of dancing.Bottom line - I don't think you would regret buying this at 17 dollars but the novelty will wear off within a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plus!

My wait was not in vain. The book was truly a hit. I am generally a slow reader, but I could not put this Stephanie Plum novel down. Evanovich is able to mix humor and suspense and come out with a novel that is entertaining without being too real-life. I found myself laughing out loud several times while reading the book. The characters seem to come alive from the pages. It makes you wish you were the one asleep on the couch when Ranger comes in for one of the many nightly visits.

I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Slowly Running Out of Steam\\"!","review":"Sorry, but of the sixth book in the continuing saga of Stephanie Plum plus family, animals, cohorts and criminals, it seems to me Evanovich is running out of steam. To me, there was too much superfluous dialogue and some rather unrealistic situations. There, also, seemed to be a strain on silliness in an effort to make the situation humorous. Her first couple of books were super reading, for me, but they have steadily gone downhill in content & intent making it a rather tiresome \\"read\\". It appears she may have rushed to get this book out and in the haste lost something in the process."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE SAME...","review":"I could not wait for the new book...well, I must be honest and say, it is not as good as previous books.

Plum, bungling but lovable bounty hunter, acquires a dog then Grandma moves in and the riot that follows will have you laughing so hard you have to put the book down for a brief breather just to gain control. Plum's instincts are 'right on' and often keep the ultra nosy apprehension agent alive. I was already an Evanovich fan, this book just cemented the affair. Can't wait to see what she comes up with next.Beverly J Scott author of Righteous Revenge"},{"rating":"2","title":"Halarious, sexy, and captivating.","review":"I picked up Hot Six on a summer vacation, the store didn't have the other five in the series. Stephanie Plum is SO funny, I actually laughed out loud. The storyline followed something I might have seen on a happier Law and Order. It was awesome. The characters were incredable, I fell in love with all of them. And this book was no without a bit of romance, but not the sappy kind . . . the real kind. This book was so great, that I went out and bought all of the other books in the series. I'm waiting for no. 1 to come in so I can start from the beginning. I totally recommend this book to everyone who wants to get lost in a funny, sexy, and dangerous world."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!","review":"Janet Evanovich cut her teeth writing romances, and I'm glad she never broke through to superstardom in that genre. I'm glad she switched to mysteries. This entire Stephanie Plum series is great, and HOT SIX thrills me.

Are there going to be any cars left in New Jersey?

My expectations were high, probably because her books are always on the best seller lists and are always checked out at my local library.

For those who have convinced themselves they like Evanovich I recommend they try Sparkle Hayter's Robin Hudson novels which are 100% better than any Evanovich.

I thought it was going to be a tightly-written thriller. Instead I got a book that when it was amusing, was in a juvenile sort of way, and utterly lacking in suspense. I was also appalled at the way that killing, rape and setting people on fire was dealt with as if it were amusing, when sadly, there are a lot of crimes out there comitted like sickos like that, and it is anything but funny for the families. In fact, as I write this, I wonder at myself for being 'entertained' by stories of sick criminal types. they certainly abound in this book, though entertained is not what I felt. more like offended and disgusted. A light weight bit of fluff that deserves mass market at best, certainly not hardcover."},{"rating":"1","title":"A LAUGH EVERY 100 PAGES","review":"Evanovich writes with a cookie cutter instead of a PC keyboard.This novel is so formulaic you'll go back to see if it's already in your collection.You may smile or slightly chuckle at a turn of a phrase--but that occurs about every 100 pages. And the book is about 300 pages, so the math is evident.Evanovich has sniffed at reviewers who've questioned whether she is just churning this stuff out on auto-pilot. The paragraphs seem like they are produced the way a butcher shoves sausage through a grinder.And grind is a perfect word for Hot Six."},{"rating":"1","title":"unhappy","review":"I guess it was my fault, but I did not read the fine print and received merchandise that was represented like new, but had no jacket cover.

As always Stephanie is likable in her hapless way, and you find yourself rooting for her, and not being surprised when she survives impossible situations.The story equals any of the previous books, except perhaps for the first.

Faithful readers of this series surely already know the answer: why oh why, Ms. Evanovich, do you make your main character so inept at her job? The author seems to think that Stephanie's incompetence and gullibility are amusing. Perhaps screwing up royally once in her efforts to bring in a person would be understandable and could be portrayed in a humorous way, but twice in a row? Three times in a row? And don't get me started on falling out of a tree into a presumed bad guy's back yard. I'm sorry, but to me all this incompetence takes away so much from the character--a character whose other outstanding characteristics are overshadowed by her incredible ineptness in doing her job."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love this book :)","review":"I just purchased this book today.

Sure I got a few laughs, and it was an entertaining way to spend 3 or 4 hours - but it is another step down as far as I'm concerned in a series that started out great.It was way too short (lots of white space and a big font made it appear to be a normal sized novel). As well, the plot was too easy. It seems like Janet Evanovich is counting on putting in a laugh here and there, and hoping that will be enough. Well, in my opinion - it's not.Needs more plot development. I hope the next one is better, or I am finished with this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Six Sizzles","review":"Evanovich has done it again -I read this book in less than 24 hours (and did not cut work to do so!)I laughed out loud -Plum's new friends are weider and crazier than any introduced to date, but Bob the dog takes the cake (literally!). The scene in which Bob rescues himself is Evanovich at her most brilliant! A great beach or vacation book - if you can put off reading it that long. After the cliff hanger ending of the previous book, I couldn't wait to get my nose into this -and Evanovich leaves us hanging at the end of Hot Six. Groan -How fast can you write, Janet?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Predictably Brilliant","review":"In her usual wacky style, Janet Evanovich has come up with another winner. Suspense, intrigue, and foreplay that will keep you guessing till the very end. There are, of course, a few extra twists and turns in this one, in the relationship between Joe Morelli and Stephanie Plum. Ranger, the sexy bounty hunter, disappears when he becomes a suspect in a murder. The inevitable sexual tension with Ranger escalates as Stephanie comes to his aid in order to secretly help solve the murder in which he is implicated.The usual wacky storyline, a few wacky characters, lots of sexual tension, and a few dead bodies for good measure. You'll be laughing out loud before you realise. Stephanies somewhat predictable bad luck and 'accidental hero' status will have you smiling the whole way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wacky & Sexy- the Best Evanovich yet!","review":"Hot Six starts out a bit slow- the introductory information gets in the way of Plum devotees' instant gratification of the High Five clifhanger. But the engine catches after that and then VROOM! the Buick races through the pages with all the mayhem and humor we're used to. Stephanie is chased by bad guys, lusts after Joe and Ranger, and actually cooks! A meatloaf! The most memorable new character is Bob the dog. He never says a word, but his escapades are hysterical! I had to close my door so the neighbors wouldn't wonder what the maniacal laughter was about! Throw in a few wacky cars, Grandma Mazur's driving lessons, and two helpful hippies and you've got a Plum mystery that you won't be able to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evanovich Does It Again","review":"I'll admit that I don't have the most sophisticated tastes, but I know what I like. And what I like is Stephanie Plum and her whole crazy, funny world and its inhabitants. This book resolved the cliffhanger from \\"High Five\\" and jumped right into Stephanie's current (and ever present troubles). The characters we all love are back, plus some new folks liven things up a bit. It is interesting to watch Stephanie evolve - she is gradually gaining confidence in her skills. I read this book in 24 hours and now I have a loooooong time to wait for the next one. But I'm sure that book number seven will be worth the wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do yourself a favor - READ IT!","review":"If you don't pick up another book this year, grab this one. I just finished \\"Hot Six\\" and I'm still smiling. Last year I was furious when I finished \\"High Five\\" and realized I would have to wait for this book to find out who was knocking at Stephanie's door. It was so much worse than waiting to find out who shot J.R. Ewing! But the wait proved worthwhile. I took the book with me to get my hair done this morning and really did embarrass myself as I couldn't stop laughing out loud. As usual, Janet Evanovich manages to keep her story moving at a brisk pace and keep us up to date with all of our favorite Trenton residents. (Knowing Grandma Mazur is driving is one really good reason to stay out of Trenton though. Especially when you know she's always packing!) I don't want to give away anything, but Janet, could you please hurry up with Book Seven? Give up those book signing tours, just keep writing! Damn skippy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"S'WONDERFUL","review":"We have read all the other books of Janet and were looking forward to this one, which came out on our 47th anniversary. It certainly didn't let us down, I am only sorry we have to wait for the 7th one. My husband is from Jersey and probably this adds to our enjoyment, since Janet is so right on with her characters, especially Grandma. I have also enjoyed telling my friends about Janet, and we have such great discussions about her books. My local used book store owner Ginger, of Books, Books, Books, in Ramona, CA, shares my enthusiasm. Keep them coming, Janet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just like all the others","review":"Ok, I know we read these books because of their entertainment value. But, please! The woman is stupid and would have been fired from McDonalds (or anywhere else) in 24 hours. She has a gun and is afraid to use it because she might shoot someone?! But she is around the dregs of humanity who would shoot her without thinking twice about it. She is afraid of the people she has to apprehend...who would want a job that you were afraid of. I enjoyed the first one but this woman would get on my nerves after a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOT SIX BY JANET EVANOVICH","review":"SAME BASIC FORMAT AS PREVIOUS NOVELS. TORN BETWEEN TWO LOVERS.A FEW LAUGHS ALONG THE WAY."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Plums","review":"This was one of my top Plum books - you can't beat Grandma Mazur and Ranger's mystery.Anyone looking for intelligent reading is not going to find it here. Not to say these books are dumb, but they fall far on the side of fun reading. Some might see them as formulaic but how can you not love Stephanie Plum and her Grandma Mazur? There are a lot of authors I wouldn't read because I think they just switch cities and character names, but I just plowed through 3 of them in 3 days. They're addictive and laugh-aloud funny and I would recommend them to just about anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun","review":"I absolutely love Janet Evanovich way of writing. She has an amazing gift of brilliantly mixing humor and action. I have all her Stephanie Plum novels and I am really looking forward to getting the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"HYSTERICAl!","review":"Janet's funniest book yet.Stephanie is at her all time best,along with her wacky grandmother,strange but endearingneighborhood charachters,a new family addition,the irrepressableDamn Skippy Lula and of course (sigh) Joe Morelli! A steal at twice the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hot Six by Janet Evanovich","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. I didn't agree with Stephanie's choice of men because I was rooting for the other guy, but that's just a matter of choice.However, what really disappointed me was that this book didn't have any depth. It feels like an installment or chapter that was rushed out to the public in order to answer the burning question at the end of High Five and to be a bridge to the 7th installment.As in the rest of the series, parts of this book are laugh out loud funny; once again Grandma Mazur and Lula are hysterical, and I love Bob; but a couple of funny scenes don't make a book. For me Hot Six didn't really advance the series, once the \\"which man was it\\" question is cleared up (and that's only given 2 pages), we're really no further into Stephanie's life than we were before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Continuity errors, but still fun !","review":"Stephanie is still finding bodies and mixing it up with bad guys. This is very entertaining even with the two continuity errors. Being a writer, I work very hard at keeping track of all the plot points and where the characters are. One mistake has Bob and Rex going to Joe's for safety. The next we hear Rex is at home, in the middle of a device that sets Stephanie up for being abducted by some bad guys. She then visits Joe, who has Rex at his house.I know this may sound petty, but it is jarring and disappointing for me as a reader, from a writer who usually does an admirable job of keeping all the threads in place.All in all it is a great romp, especially with Dougie and Mooner. It is worthy of listening to more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Irresistably Fun","review":"I'm normally turned off by the fodder usually topping the bestseller charts, finding it to often be mindless, formulistic garbage like \\"The DaVinci Code,\\" overhyped and poorly written. Evanovich's work, however, truly stands out as endlessly entertaining, full to the brim of original characters, snappy dialogue, bizarre adventures, and a consistently lovable heroine. Don't miss this series - you WON'T be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Go Girl!","review":"I have read all of the Stephanie Plum books as to date! And I have got to tell you that there is no other woman that I can relate to as well as her! The sex (so to spesk) is outrageous, the characters are so identifiable! And, I for one can relate to having a bad hair day! She is every woman on PMS and then some! Thank God she has some hunky men in her life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"funny but....","review":"I enjoyed reading this and have to admit to laughing out loud at some parts, however it could be just as funny without the bad language. I have a 13 year old that loves to read and I cannot let him read this due to the continous bad language. The book is sillier than her others too, therefore, based on these two things, I probably won't buy her next book - instead rent it from the library and if the language is still offensive, I probably won't be reading her anymore.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evanovich does it again!","review":"This series about this misfit bounty hunter and her cast of dysfuntional friends and family members is incredibly entertaining. Try to explain to fellow customers at Starbuck's why I am just about doubled over in laughter about Bob in the McDonald's parking lot! (Go ahead, I dare you to try to read that section and keep a straight face!) And poor Bob and his prunes! Another fit of laughter where I literally had to put the book down and walk away and get control of myself. The only disappointment? Too short! I read this book in just a few hours! Can't wait for the next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Plum Good","review":"Stephanie Plum series is very enjoyable reading.The quality of the book was lacking. Some pages had very faded ink."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Six","review":"I have enjoyed all of this series so far. The antics this girl, Stephanie Plum, gets into are hilarious. Not that you smile as you read. I laugh so hard as to have to put the book down!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best One Yet","review":"Love the series and this was a fantastic story in the series. Fun, sexy and hilarious, I love it and I look forward to reading the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something to remember when reading Evanovich","review":"Don't buy Evanovich when you're after a nail-biting, logical, dark, deep, keeping-you-up-all-night thriller. Don't read Plum when you want something that makes sense, no loose ends, all tied up nicely.Buy her when you care about laughing-out-loud, read her when you like a hilarious character. She's top of line when it comes to the absurd (Grandma Mazur is only one \\"item\\" to mention).Maybe this series can't go on much longer without getting repetetive and ridiculous, but I'm sure Ms Evanovich will come up with something new and equally entertaining! Just one thing - DON'T ever make it a movie! Leave it to our imagination! I'm sure we all know how Ranger and Morelli just HAVE to look like in our (okay - female!) minds. And I just can't think of any actor playing Rex..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yum! Wow! Zounds!","review":"More, more, more, PLEASE! Can't wait to see what kind of trouble Stephanie can get in and out of next. And I'm still holding my breath waiting for Grandma Mazur to plug somebody! Laughs, thrills, romance, and mystery all in one. Brava, Ms. Evanovich!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the read","review":"I really liked this one, even if there wasn't really any Nancy/Frank stuff in it.

I was quite hesitant about purchasing before I had seen it in real life, but once it arrived, I was so happy with it! The quality is very good, and it's worked wonderfully, no problems at all.I would definitely purchase again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks way more expensive than $26","review":"I purchased this item for my nook in our kitchen. For $26 dollars, I didn't expect it to look just like the picture, but it did.I am very pleased with this purchase and I haven't put it up yet, because I haven't had an electrician come out to our house yet, but it's very nice and I recommend getting it. Assembly was a little confusing, as there were no directions in the box, but I just looked at the picture on the listing on Amazon and figured it out myself.I would and will buy another one for my home."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must for Anyone Putting Together Poultry Rations","review":"A lot of poultrykeepers feel the temptation to invent their own chicken feed blend. Doing this successfully requires quite a bit of knowlege, and this book provides it. It's quite accessible to the interested layman, though it assumes you already know something about nutrition (for example, it doesn't explain what amino acids are or why you'd care).Not as exhaustive as Ewing's massive and long-out-of-print POULTRY NUTRITION, but it's more up-to-date and far easier to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do your research","review":"My wife and I kindly received this PNP as a gift at the baby shower. We used it 3x and now the locking mechanism will no longer lock. We, like so many can't do anything about it since it is past the 90 day warrentee. Play the extra $20 and get a better product, it isn't worth the frustration with a new baby. Now we are stuck with it until I can figure out if I can fix it, since there is no help from Evenflo."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Good So Far","review":"Because we are buying items in advance for our baby, we have not been able to use this with an actual child. However, we did put it up when we received the item and it is really cute. It took us awhile to figure out where everything goes (the instructions are not the best), but we did manage to get the job done. I did not give it a 5 as it is pretty heavy, even when compacted. Additionally, the changing station does not go into the bag when packed up so it is just hanging out. It seems to be pretty practical and very sturdy. We are hoping that it all works out for us and our baby!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Look at others- there are better","review":"I purchased this for use at the Grandparents house. What a disappointment compared to ours at home! The changing area comes with no padded insert to which you can cover with a sheet; and the changing area has to be removed if you put the baby to sleep - others simply swing or pivot off to the side.Secondly, this is such poor quality and support that a 3 1/2 month old baby was sagging in the middle of the bassinet.Also the sheet provided is so cheap you can see your hand thru the other side.For a matter of $20 or $30 more, buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"1st time shame on me, 2nd time shame on you","review":"I received this playard as a baby shower gift and fell in love with its features. It was pretty easy to put together, however when I packed it up the first time and tried to put it back together- none of the sides would lock into place. After several tries I called Evenflo, who walked me through a few troubleshooting steps and the sides still would not lock into place. They agreed to send me another playard.I received my new playard a week later and the same problem happened again. Based on my personal experience I will never buy this brand again!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for our needs","review":"I got this pack & play because we are going to be moving several times this year, and needed a bed for our new daughter that was easily transportable. This fit the bill perfectly. I will have to say that the first time to put it into its carrying bag was a little tough, but now that I know how, it's easy.The bassinet and changing table are both nice and feel very sturdy. I really like the detachable music box, which turns off automatically, and also plays nature sounds (including the womb) and has a night light, which was great for checking on my baby in the middle of the night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Item","review":"I received this PNP for my shower. We've put it together and broken it down numerous times with no problems. It's very convenient.

It's not only sturdy, but attractive as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I researched the Madison playard and decided on registering for it based on the reviews. I just set up the crib last week, my son is 3 months old, and I was very disappointed to find out that there are no sheets that fit the matress. Graco sheets fit but then the matress can no longer velcro to the base wghich is an important safety feature. I contacted Evenflo and they told me that they do not recommend usig a sheet. I find that silly, because how will you clean the matress?? Also the snaps of the bassinet broke after 3 uses. Evenflo said that part is backordered and they will ship it in 3-4 weeks. By then my son will no longer need the bassinet portion of the playard. I ended up returning the crib to Babies-r-us and purchasing a Graco instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Base Broke after one use","review":"I love the several different functions of this playard. But when I returned to work after my son was three months old and we took it down for the first time to take to grandma's house, the base of it broke and will not lock back into place. There is only a 90 day warranty on it, so I can not return or exchange it."},{"rating":"1","title":"the most awful tasting vitamin","review":"I know vitamins are not supposed to taste good and I have had others in the past so I have something to compare to.

Now, it's possible that I got defective tape, but I bought several rolls and had to throw them all out. The tape would not stick to cardboard, period. After trying to tape a box for shipping, I could pull all of the tape off without damaging the cardboard in the least. It is basically just plastic strip that is *very* mildly tacky. I could run it between my fingers with very little friction at all. Certainly this is not suitable for packaging anything. I guess maybe you could use it for masking, as it would pull away from the wall very easily without damaging, but would also allow paint to leak under the tape, as it does not adhere to any surface."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sticky-Note would do a better job!","review":"This NOT tape.

I know my daughter will enjoy reading what her grandma had to say about her when she was just a little baby.

If you're casually trying to reduce sodium a bit this may be fine, but if you're on a very strict diet many of the recipes probably won't be acceptable. I found many of the recipes a bit unimaginative and lacking excitement, being perhaps geared towards people who find mild picante sauce too spicy.

One interesting picture shows the Victory with the Hood (of Bismark fame) in the background.In addition to providing information about the Victory, there is enough general information to say a lot about the nature of the navy of its day. Quite an interesting book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest grown-up books ever written for children!","review":"Although admittedly this book is nostalgic for me, given that it was probably one of the first books I ever read and holds a special place in my heart, I still feel confident in saying that even a new reader will enjoy. Though it is, for all intents and purposes -a children's book, I know several adults who would benefit from the lessons of friendship and love in this book. These Mole and Troll stories will definitely put a smile on your face, each tackling basic human fears and inadequicies with a bit of silliness, while stressing the importance of having real friendship. As for the illustrations, I can't possibly say enough! They brilliantly compliment the stories. Worth every cent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Southern Sam Levenson","review":"Harry Golden, in a time in America when many Jews were wary about making it known that they were Jewish, spoke directly and proudly as a Jew. Golden had a forthrightness and courage- and this especially in his support for the Civil Rights Struggle.He had too a homely sense of humor and this is perhaps the major reason his writings were at one time so popular.But he also was a principled moralist. And in both these things, and also in his comical roly-poly looks resembled quite a bit another Jewish comedian not shy of using Yiddish expressions , Sam Levenon.His writings can seem dated at time but a wise skimmer will find much in any Golden book to delight in and learn from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleeping Beauty-Better than Tylenol PM","review":"Or maybe you will need Tylenol PM after watching this cheesefest!

I am 19 and I still love this movie...my friends and family think I am crazy, because of my age...but the movie is absolutly beautiful, and the songs are so memmorable.

Matthias Alexander was certainly one of the great creative geniuses of this century, although he is still comparatively unknown. In part his obscurity is due to the novelty of his ideas and in part to his very difficult writing style. This book is a very lightly edited version of his second book and still makes for fairly difficult going. On the other hand, time spent digesting the material in this (and Alexander's other books) is well worth it. And the book includes an introduction by Professor John Dewey, a great admirer and supporter of Alexander.If you don't know much about Alexander and the Alexander Technique, I'd suggest one of the many other introductory books as a first read. Body Learning by Michael Gelb, Fitness Without Stress by Robert Rickover and How to Learn the Alexander Technique by Barbara Conable are all excellent choices."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Problem","review":"We ordered the full set of Foyle's War because it is an excellent series, superbly written and photographed.

I am more of a fan towards the series that would appeal to an \\"american\\" audience, where more action, and a faster pace is present. I am accustomed to series like NIP AND TUCK, DEXTER, WHITE COLLAR, SONS OF ANARCHY,etc, so this series really had no appeal to me on an entertainement level. I barely got through the first disc, and couldn't finish the second one. all of this of course is my own personal opinion, since I am not a movie critic,neither am I trying to be one. This series will appeal to fans of Agatha Christie, or maybe of Sherlock Holmes, but if one is looking for a fast pace, action, intense dialogue....hum...look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"British perspective on War on the Home Front","review":"Start at the beginning with this series and watch the months of World War II build up.

Perfection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fighting the other War in Jolly Old England during World War II, right!","review":"I find this first series of Foyle's War very well done. The time period is in the early part of World War II in England. Christopher Foyle is left to investigate crimes which always are involved in the intrigues of the great war.I found the casting to be right on. The period depiction of the time period are historically correct. The episodes are well developed and relevant to its time period. Foyle is a Detective Inspector living in Hastings who quietly solves crimes and sets all records straight. Remember Foyle looks beyond the obvious. He uses all his resources. He is a student of human behavior. Foyle proves to be an enigma to all in his approach to solving crimes. These four serials are indeed grand. The German Woman, The White Feather, A Lesson in Murder and Eagle Day are all well done.Five Stars, good job!! Right!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST TV SERIES!!","review":"This is a BBC made for TV series about Chief Detective Christopher Foyle (Kitchen) set in 1940 England in a small coastal community. Foyle would rather be defending his country somewhere but he must stay home solve the crimes (often related to war activities) that still occur on the home front. The chemistry between Foyle and his driver, Samantha Stewart (Weeks), and his assistant, Sgt. Paul Milner (Howell) is outstanding, as they go about solving crimes in this WWII environment which affects everyone in England. If you like WWII, detective mysteries, and character driven shows this is almost perfection. I can't recommend this highly enough. Aside from some violence around the crime scene, there is almost nothing to deter family viewing. This is about real people living out real life in a war-plagued country and they do it in a most entertaining and satisfying way. Try one and I think you'll be hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't go wrong.","review":"Foyle's war is a classic . The stories are compelling, based in part on true events . The acting is superb!

This is the kind of hidden treasure album you cherish for years, and don't even know why. It's so sincere and modest. So sincere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and Sophomoric","review":"I wasted 100 minutes of my life watching this drivel. This would be a C plus film school project at best. Its scope is very narrow, and it harps on Walter Brennan (!) so much I wanted to scream. The point, that there were implicit gay relationships in otherwise hetero movies, was so well known by 1997 that this was a pointless exercise in snickering, smirking, and playing with libel. If this mess was edited down to 60 minutes, without the awful \\"host segments\\" and backing off the Brennan obsession, it might be tolerable.If you REALLY want the Hollywood Gay Back Story, buy Vito Russo's superb Celluloid Closet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible message to both straights and gays","review":"I thought this would be an interesting movie about the history of homosexual characters in cinema but it turned out to be a guy searching for any slight hint of a gay stereotype that most nobody else would see. Even gay people. If a character in a movie talks too sophisticated, is interested in the theater, or just likes hanging around his male best friend, he must be gay. To me, this kind of attitude is what makes many straight actors stay away from these kinds of roles and instead choose the roles that are mean spirited towards gays. Now a guy can't even get another guy a cup of coffee without some wacko out there thinking he's gay."},{"rating":"2","title":"full view montly planner","review":"Large squares with the whole month clear.

I bought this DVD for the Walton concerto, a piece I have played myself and feel deeply about. However, the other performances were an excellent surprise. Piatagorsky interprets the piece commissioned for him with authenticity, passion, and the appropriate grace. Heifetz's Mendelssohn is always a joy to hear.One must note that these are HISTORICAL performances and should not be judged by their age and picture quality. You are getting performances that may be older than yourself, in my case certainly. (For more of that rant, see my review on the page for Rostropovich's performance of Shostakovich and Prokofiev, also on EMI.) In any case, these are easily ignored by those seeking authentic interpretations and an opportunity for a lesson from masters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality of picture and sound","review":"I had previously purchased 4 EMI classics DVD's and was satisfied with all. Thus I was very disappointed by the poor sound and picture quality on this DVD and have returned it. The Heifetz Mendelssohn is the worst. The Rubinstein Beethoven is better, but the muted sound of the orchestra in the Beethoven is not good. The Piatigorsky Walton has some bad picture problems near the beginning, but overall the picture is OK (not great, however), while the sound varies. There is no point in buying any of these DVD's just for the sound, in my opinion. If the picture is bad, don't buy. And if the sound is bad, too, then definitely don't buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"In b&w, static picture, sound could be better","review":"This documentary, in black and white, shows the artists playing, but the scenes are relatively static, the quality of sound could be better, and the picture in not much richer than a slightly animated slide show, unless the objective is to see the artist's technique.

A few of these songs have been heard elsewhere or are featured on other mixes. On the other hand, on this album they are in thier full versions and in so add just enough 'newness' to the tracks to make this a worthy purchase. Not to mention almost every song on this album is incredible.Its a bit deeper per say, as in the casual listener might be turned off by it but the fact remains that this is truely a masterpiece and has a strange effect of getting better the more you listen to it. Infact, Border Community (his label) in general has that sort of aura in their music; to stay on topic, Corduroy, Lump, Flute and Idiot are the stand out tracks in my mind and have James Holden's notoriously excillent and undefineable progressive sound to it. Melodic, choppy, blissful and never tiresome tracks abound on this Album.

Thus there's absolutely no challenge here, just the tedium of going through each map, and the \\"story\\" is so moronic and dumb it's beyond belief.Maybe this game has a good internet mode, but if I wanted to play a game on the internet, why wouldn't I just use my PC?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong UMD in case","review":"It arrived on time, the box was in great condition but when i opened the box I did not see Field Commander.

It's a ripoff of the best TBS game series ever made... Advance Wars. In the current AW game you controll the Allied Nations, which was copied into field commander, and the Orange Star army is the first army from whic youi get CO's, which in FC is the Orange Bandits. My tip, save money and get a DS and Advance Wars: Dual Strike. AW:DS has more CO's, more units and about as much missions, plus the bbonus of CO powers, super powers and tag teaming. In short, Sony should create their own games."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING!! TURN BASED GAME = BORING!!","review":"You could play this game with some five sided dice and a game board, I have no idea why anyone would make this into a \\"video\\" game. Flat out, this is a dumb game. Why? There it no action that you control! All you do is move a few board game style ships/tanks/aircraft around and then the machine takes over and shows you the result of your moves. Did I mention that YOU DO NOT CONTROL ANY OF THE ACTION! About as high tech as the original Dragon's Lair. O.k. that is not true, Dragon's Lair was a much better game."},{"rating":"2","title":"field commander","review":"This game is truly great. It is a great strategy game, much like the game of chess but at a larger scale. I own this game and cant stop playing it. But the only problem is the length of this game. You could spend hours playing one mission. Basicly in the game you are a commander of an army and lead your army to victory over foes. While fighting, you have to think about where to move. If you move a smaller unit in front of a larger unit good chances are you are dead.Overall this game is pretty good but it could use some improvement with teaching fundementals of the game. So if you are looking to buy a new game for your psp and are a big strategy lover this game is the game for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, fun game!!!!","review":"I have to say, this is the only game I've purchased so far that I've really enjoyed on the PSP!!!

Thus, i was wildly excited when the soundtrack to the movie came out, and i bought it really for that one song. However, there are other great songs on it too, but this is my favorite one. im not usually a fan of instrumentals bc i find a lot of them to be rather monotonous, but this song changed my mind.

Scorsese is back in his old New York neighborhood to take us on a trip down memory lane and how, as he grew up, the Italian cinema influenced his career. His passion for these films is contagious and with each movie clip you will want to screen the entire movie again. An interesting sidebar to this well produced documentary is that italian designer Giorgio Armani was the executive producer on the project."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important Film History Lesson from Important Director","review":"I've always been curious about European film since so much has been written of it--and so little of it played here in the States!Martin Scorsese has made an excellent DVD that touches on his earliest influences and provides a tour of the Italian cinema from its beginning to its critical zenith in the 1950's and 1960's.I would recommend this DVD for anyone with any interest in foreign films. With Scorsese as a guide, you'll not only see the highlights and subtleties of each film, but you'll get historical details and a better understanding of the context from the narration.I'll definitely be checking out Scorsese's previous \\"personal journey\\" after watching MY VOYAGE TO ITALY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Film School 101.","review":"What can I say about this film? It's a chance to learn about cinema from one of the greatest directors in history. The irony is that Scorsese is every bit as fine an artist as any of these legends that he discusses. I really did not know much about Rossellini and De Sica before I saw this documentary, and if you see it I'm sure that you too will walk away highly appreciative of their oeuvre. Many of the things that Scorsese points out about these movies I would be incapable of noticing on my own. I suppose that if one is an experienced scholar of cinema then some of this discussion might be obvious but it certainly wasn't to me. I learned a great deal. Fellini's \\"Vitelloni, I\\" is definitely one that I now have to see, and the commentary for La Dolce Vita is priceless."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works if you want it to work!","review":"It is not easy but as others said, if you really want to, you can quit.

I admitted not reading the description closely enough, and that had I known they were expired I would not have bought them. He offered to refund my money if I chose to return them, but in the end I kept them.

This is the same made-in-Mexico movie, but a vastly different edition. It is in Spanish with English subtitles, all narration is stripped away, and instead of Gerald Fried's gripping music score, there is merely whooshing-wind sound effects by a musical mediocrity named Raul Lavista. What a pity, the nicely trimmed-up, filled-out, tuneful 1977 ABC version replaced by this dreary, boresome ain't-cannibalism-groovy pseudo-novelty.

But many smaller streets in central London are NOT even named on the map and are not listed in the index. This was definitely a problem for me in finding smaller hotels, restaurants, etc. and lesser tourist attractions. In addition, the map includes some decent subway information, but nothing about buses. The reason for these inadequacies appears to be that the map is not detailed enough for there to be room to label the smaller streets and lesser tourist attractions.

The high end, at first seemed a bit recessed, but as I listened to more CD's that I knew well, I realized that they were smoother than I was used to. All of the highs (stuff like cymbals) were beautifully detailed. I also noticed an increase in detail in acoustic instruments.

It consists mostly of page after page of carefully voice-led chord sequences, following the important ii-V-I variations and explaining other types of changes as well. It's great for drills. However, as a theory book it's not particularly deep. If you're familiar with Mick Goodrick's \\"The Advancing Guitarist\\", this book is almost the exact opposite. Goodrick forces you to think to get anything at all from his lessons. This book invites you to turn off thinking and start memorizing. Both are valid, useful approaches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"Excellent progessive etudes gives us the perfect frame to learn voice leading (if you find some typos don't worry that much, it's part of learing :) ).

In that time, I really didn't know the influence Eurithymics had in contemporary music. Later on, I started to take an interest in Annie Lennox's solo albums, my favourite until \\"Bare\\" arrived was \\"Diva\\". Who will ever forget the video and the catchy song \\"Walking on Broken Glass\\"?This new release its a true gift from Annie, she talks about intimate matters in a perfect and soothing way.You know when you buy a CD and you have to skip those tedious songs? This CD you simply can't do that because each song moves you in an unexpected way. My favourites are Pavement Cracks (so Annie) and Erased which awakened feelings I didn't know I had inside of me.This is a must buy and with the special DVD, you can understand every single song through the delicious interview she gave."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, viable and wonderful","review":"After listening to the new Annie Lennox \\"Bare\\" cd, I'm now reconvinced of why I purchase everything this Diva records.

Many may be appalled at the cd cover but for anyone with an inner view, artistic impressions can speak a thousand beautiful things. And Annie Lennox is one of those things. Listen to the personal lyrics of all her songs as she is spirited through lifes' failures, triumphs, and uncertainities. \\"What will be the end result of this life.?\\" \\"Where is God in all this?\\" Annie Lennox is BARE to the world with this latest release. For here, in this cd, she has truly found her self. No secrets. Happiness and loneliness intertwines. Honesty. Whether you are a fan or not, Annie Lennox does not command, but truly deserves your attention. Buy this cd and let Annie sing for you. \\"The curtains are down!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Bare","review":"This is by far one of the best albums I own from start to finish.

What's impressive here is the diversity each remixer brings to the work. For instance, drone master Electric Company puts a slow sweep across his track, while Casino Versus Japan gives a mellow, fizzy lift to his track. Greg Davis lays in some guitar strumming that gives way to bucolic blippery, and Robert Lippok of To Rococo Rot fame goes for quiet and baroque electronics. Stars as Eyes meld their space tones with deep, earthy tones. It just goes to show that the Europeans have nothing that American IDM can't do just as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jw of B-more","review":"Upon receiveing this Dvd I placed it in my player and sat back to watch it.I was impressed with the performance of each group.I thought By purchasing This Dvd Without any other reviews that I would see Such entertainers as Skip mahoney & the Casuals,Black Ivory,Ebonys Some of the less Popular groups of the 70'sThis Dvd contains.Stylistics, Dramatics,Chi-lites,Delphonics,Harold Melvins's Bluenotes & cuba Gooding Jr.This dvd should included a history of each group as extra."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"This DVD is wonderful.

The storyline is decent and the animation is okay although occasionally the vehicle animation can be a bit dodgy. The last 3 episodes developes a deeper storyline as it progresses and previous members are revealed.

After doing that, it fit very securely and I do not think it will wiggle lose or anything, and it was a small operation that took a minute to do (pretty malleable plastic on the nubs).I would not say this should scare someone from ordering this product, but good to know in case your first attempt to plug in your drive was like mine.Mike"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the real deal, OK copy","review":"The good news it seems to work OK in my IBM T60.

Truth be told, they did alot better job than Evil Dee on the 1st Soundbombing. But, just like the 1st volume it is filled with great songs and lightly dotted with bad ones. For every horrible \\"Stanley Kubrick\\" track, there are three or four others like \\"Patriotism\\", \\"1-9-9-9\\" or \\"The Mayor\\" to make you forget about it. The beats and lyrics were well crafted for the most part, but that is due to the great selection of artists.

It's difficult to categorize The Motels because they incorporate elements of punk, new wave and adult contemporary. Their individual albums are not quite as solid as this hits package, but you might want to listen to 1982's All Four One cd. The Motels disbanded in 1985, after the release of Shock. Martha did a solo cd in 1987, and then in 1990 this hits package was released. The hits are all here: \\"Only the Lonely\\", \\"Take the L\\", \\"Suddenly, Last Summer\\" and \\"Shame\\" plus other non-hits like \\"Icy Red\\", \\"So L.A.\\", \\"Who's Problem Am I?\\", \\"Kix\\", \\"Total Control\\" and \\"Danger\\".

Second, the article mentioned that the Motels do not sequence when recording (that is, each instrument plays by themselves, to produce a cleaner sound per instrument), but preferred to play all together, so they had the freedom to improvise and play off each other.I finally, about 20 years later, had the privilege to hear their greatest hits. And it was a privilege. I don't know much about the lyrics, but I loved their musical style. My favorites included \\"Danger\\", \\"Only The Lonely\\", \\"Shame\\", \\"Suddenly Last Summer\\", \\"So L.A.\\", \\"Cries And Whispers\\", \\"Take The L\\", \\"Trust Me\\", \\"Little Robbers\\", and \\"Whose Problem?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"MOTELS","review":"I owned this album years ago and somehow lost it.

Although at times you might wish they'd spent a bit more time on that great panorama they just left, overall I like the approach.I very much wish that they had some sort of captioning option so that you would know what you're looking at. Unfortunately, there is no detail provided. The musical tracks are fine, nothing stands out about them, but the focus is on the scenery.All in all, a very nice DVD that will provide a nice escape.

Here we are in December 2005 and there is zero sound coming from my speakers. The system just stopped producing sound. I reset the unit and it fixed the problem for about a week. Then the same thing happened again and the reset function would not fix the problem. I've never had a problem with a Sony product until this one.

Mine stopped working after only a few weeks - bad tuner. so I said \\"Oh well, that's why I bought a Sony - good design, good warranty - Hah! You cannot bring these devices to any Sony authorized repair shop. You MUST ship it to Texas and for me that meant about $20-$30 because the unit is heavy and I'm on the east coast. so in reality the Sony 1 year warranty is worthless unless you live near Texas.My advice - buy a Panasonic.

A must for any bug lover!!!","review":"I was worried after reading some of the reviews, but my daughter used her own money from her 6th birthday to get his and we found the suction was just fine.

While it obviously can't pull bugs out of the air (that's what nets are for) it does a good job picking up spiders, beetles, and other small bugs/insects. Make sure you switch out the provided batteries with quality batteries. When we did this it increased the suction substantially. It also helps if you teach your kids to use it at an angle instead of straight up and down (so it doesn't have to fight gravity as well.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISSAPOINTING","review":"I was excited to receive this product and start using it to catch bugs for my bearded dragon. Within the first 5 minutes out of the box I pushed the trigger in and when I released it the vacuum remained on. Now I have to keep the battery housing loose and push up on it when I want it to go on and off. It also has very dissapointing power, you can't even pick up the bug until you have the opening of the vacuum completely covering it, even on the highest setting. Overall this was a very dissapointing purchase and wouldn't reccomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very weak suction","review":"The vacuum is too weak to pick up almost anything heavier than a stationary moth. Even then, you have to get the moth almost all the way into the tube entrance before it gets sucked into the observation chamber. You're certainly not going to be able to grab a hovering fly with it. It has 3 speed settings, but even the fastest is just too weak to be useful. There is also no reverse, so if you think you're going to grab insects for feeding to a caged amphibian you're going to have a hard time getting them back out. There is more educational value in showing a child how something that looks neat in the store isn't so neat once they're home and trying to use it. Perhaps there is value if you removed the motor and hooked it up to a good quality shop vac... but then you're going to have to carry the motor around with you."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOUR MONEY","review":"This is a piece of junk.

MC Hammer is good for a laugh, as Journey's \\"Any Way You Want It\\" is a side of Journey that doesn't get heard all that often.

The book was so manipulative, the villian so unredeemably revolting, the heroine's motivation so flimsy that I found myself saying \\"Oh come on now\\" (out loud no less) repeatedly while I read. The plot is stretched thin to the point of breaking. The internal dialogue goes on forever. I found the book akin to eating lots of really, really cheap, very sweet candy and then feeling sick to your stomach all day. I don't recommend it"},{"rating":"2","title":"His best work","review":"Dean Koontz keeps me coming back because I like his quick tempo, suspensful plots, and most of all his main themes: Hope, Good triumphing over evil, and individuals triumphing over adversity. However, often times his character choices and plot devices get over used. For instance, in most of his novels that I've read (I've read at least 15 or 20), the main protaganists are either novelists, law officers or both. Almost all include dogs that save the day, and almost all have characters that develop separately and then meet in the end. The great thing about Intensity is that none of these plot devices get used. He boils down his main themes and his ability to keep you on the edge-of-your-seat and comes up with a totally fresh plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatly and sadly dissapointed with Koontz","review":"How many words does it take to convince me Edgler Vess is bad? Or that he is a sociopathic, wide eyed maddened killer. At times I forget the plot of the story by the time Koontz finished his ten page wordy description of how the moon hit the asphalt! I am a huge fan of Koontz works but this was the most absolutely frustrating of all his works for me to have to endure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formulaic and droll...","review":"Overwritten and very predictable. I regret trusting the favorable reviews. Prior to purchasing this book I had just finished The Stand by King. It is painfully clear that Koontz does not possess the same prowess, though I won't assert that conclusion based on reading just one book by Dean. Perhaps he has penned some quality novels, but do not waste your time or money with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking and disturbing","review":"I've decided to only review books that make a huge impression on me, and this one did. After reading some of Koontz later books, I gave this a read and my, my, what a ride.It's primarily the story of one killer and one victim, a girl who escapes him. The author goes deep into POV and lends a window into a demanted mind, but not gratuitously. I can't handle Koontz every day, but I find him to be a very smart writer and Intensity does not dissapoint. Not for the timid, but then life isn't really for the timid either."},{"rating":"2","title":"On the Edge of my Seat!","review":"Having read this book years ago and remembering it being one of Dean Koontz best thrillers, I picked it up in the grocery store during a recent reading lull. What I had forgotten was just how intense my reaction was to the storyline! I had to read it while my husband was awake, it is THAT scary the SECOND time I read it. WHEW! I was exhausted by the time I finished it because of being on an emotional roller coaster with the heroine.This has made me want to stroll down a Dean Koontz memory lane with some of his older books a second time. I'll just make sure my husband is awake while I read them.Update 06/10/10: I have read and enjoyed the following Dean Koontz books since I originally published this review.Velocity,Sole Survivor,Tick Tock,The HusbandandThe Taking.

However, throughout the book I was cringing at the graphic and shocking nature of the evil lived out in the \\"bad guy\\". I now wish that I hadn't filled my mind with all of the disgusting images that this book has to offer. I believe in the truth of the cliche \\"garbage in - garbage out\\" and I'm sure that I'm the worse for taking in this type of \\"garbage\\".For those of you who have read the all-time best-seller \\"The Bible\\", reading this book is in opposition to the teaching in Phil 4:8."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overwhelming","review":"You know how somebody starts talking to you and you realize they're overwhelming you with their rhetoric. Most times, we say back, \\"Please speak in English, simple terms.\\" Well, that's what Intensity did to me. Most Koontz books are overly heavy on detail anyway, but \\"Intensity\\" did me in. If an eyelash fell in this novel, he would write two or more paragraphs about it.It's one thing to be erudite, yet another to wordy enough to sink the Titanic. I know Koontz is trying to create a reaction in the reader, but this is way overdoing it. I think I'll go back to normal mystery and detective novels and leave the Koontz stuff to the rest of you who are totally enamored with the man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gratuitous Depraved Indifference","review":"Totally devoid of redeeming value, this novel appeals to sadistic interests only.

It take place in a twenty four hour period which is depicted in over 400 pages. Some spots are as the title states are \\"intense\\".

Some are excellent (Phantoms, The Face of Fear) and most are fairly good (Midnight, Dark Rivers of the Heart, Icebound). Unfortunately, some are just not worth finishing (Dragon Tears). This book is one I finished, but is not a good example of Koontz' work. It was billed as extremely intense and Mr. Koontz even says it was the most intense to write (end notes in 'Tick Tock'). Overwrought is a better description. The sequence of events happening in a 24 hour time span just do not generate enough copy to fill the number of pages necessary for a big novel. This tale would have been better as a short story. The interest level dropped after the first few chapters due to extreme repetitiveness. I would recommend many other Koontz books, but not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"I have not yet finished the book, but will, just because I bought it. I find the killer, Vess, to be highly self-indulgent, but interesting as there really are people out there like him. Chyna on the other hand is an IDIOT! And I find Koontz' writing to be dull, repetitious, over manipulated, wordy and tiresome. This is the first of his books I have read, disappointingly, and probably the last. The only reason I read as much as I have in such a short amount of time is because I found one only needs to read every other paragraph since he is so repetitive. Did I say he repeats himself? And rehashes everything ad infinitum. Go back to writing class, Dean."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE Best! No comparison.","review":"This was and is the best book I've ever read and probably will ever read. From page one to the end I could not put it down.

The strong point of the story was not Chyna, but Edgler Vess. Koontz's descriptions of Edgler's sensations and emotions were amazing, it kept me coming back for more. A first person look into the mind of a serial killer is a refreshing change to the media or some psychologist. On the flipside Chyna was too unrealistic and downright stupid at times. A little more thought process was needed to go into the making of her character. The \\"strength under stress\\" thing was just a little TOO MUCH"},{"rating":"2","title":"good book, one of koontz's best","review":"I really enjoyed this book, I have never read one of his books faster than I read this one. I loved the characters. I really hated the villian. Chyna did make a few stupid mistakes that contradicted how she was protrayed in the early portions of the book but she was still an excellent character. I like the happy ending, usually that is the case with dean koontz, but if I notice a book where he had it end on a sad note I will definitley not read it. Only one real stronge criticism I have for this book is that Ariel should not have been so drawn in, had she been as unbreakable as Chyna, she would have made an excellent partner in Vess's undoing"},{"rating":"2","title":"BRILLIANT, WRENCHING, POETIC, DISTURBING...","review":"...ARE THE WORDS THAT ONLY BEGIN TO DESCRIBE THIS SOLID THRILLER FROM THE BIG K, WHO I'D NEVER READ BEFORE.

THIS BOOK IS BRILLIANT IN THE WAY IT DEPOSITS YOU WITH NO BREATHER INTO THE WORLD OF THE PSYCHO, ARMED WITH ONLY AS MUCH INFO AS POOR CHYNNA HAS. I WORK ON A PSYCH UNIT AND CAN ASSURE YOU VESS'S WALK THE EARTH, DRIVE CARS, AND LIVE DOWN THE STREET FROM SOME OF US...AND JUST AS SURELY, THE ONLY VICTIMS WHO EVER TRULY RECOVER ARE THE CHYNNAS, WHO, TO BORROW A SINGER'S PHRASE, KICK AT THE DARKNESS TIL IT BLEEDS DAYLIGHT. DON'T DISMISS THIS AS A PULP FICTION, ITS CORE IS SOMETHING CLOSER TO POST-MODERN LITERATURE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Put It Down","review":"This is one of my favorite books by Dean Koontz. It it also one of the scariest books I've ever read. The antagonist in this story is not only weird himself, but the fact that he has the power to do the things he does and still have a normal job makes this story all the more scary. The way he plays with his victims minds is freaking in that this is something that could actually happen. It has the classic plot of a killer and a person trapped in his house, but Dean Koontz does an excellent job of throwing different twists in the story that keep you on the edge of your seat every page of the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book to Date!!!!!!!","review":"There is no other book like this! It is the best book written thus far by Koontz! Read it, and you will be INTENSIFIED!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book kept me on the edge of my seat.","review":"This book was so good, I couldn't bear to put it down! I have never enjoyed a Dean Koontz book so much. It was very believeable and unlike some of his other books, it didn't involve the \\"other side\\". I would definitely recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Koontz' Best Yet!","review":"I'm not the biggest DK fan, but of the four or five I've read this is the least predictable and best heartpounding thriller I've read in a long time. I found this book keeping me awake at night turning pages and burning dinner because I couldn't put it down. I loved it. I might just give DK another chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely \\"intense.\\" But nothing original.","review":"One of the most suspenseful books I've read, but once finished I realized there was nothing unique about it. How many books/movies/shows have the same theme? A young, hapless girl being tortured and teased by a lunatic-- if I had a dollar for every plot similar to this I could get that Minivan I've always wanted!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put it down","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I read it all in one day and could barely put it down even to go to the bathroom. DK sure knows how to keep the pace moving. I was so involved with the Chyna I could almost feel everything she felt. I really liked his villan. He did a good job of creating a guy with absolutely no consious without him seeming like a psychopath. He was so brutal, but smooth. At the end of the book, I felt sad that it was all over. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone that likes a thrill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cassette Version Review","review":"Kate Burton's reading of Intensity is the perfect combination. Her reading style complements Koontz' writing as she sucks you into Chyna's world. I eagerly anticipated every word spoken. Upon listening to it, I bought the hardcover for my stepdad."},{"rating":"2","title":"A blood-curdling, spine-tingling, hair-raising novel.","review":"Though Dean Koontz never fails with any of his novels, Intensity is, without hesitation, one of his best. And the best part is that the characters are not laid out for you. In order to figure out who they are and where they've been, you must be alert! As for the heroine, Chyna, she was absolutely wonderful, to the point of seeming real. Her hesitant attitude helped the reader identify with her and her quest to stop the killer.Koontz's killer was great as well. He fits the description of any next door neighbor in any town. After I read Intensity, Koontz made me wary of every \\"normal-looking\\" person I came into contact with!Wherever you are Dean Koontz, I have one word for you: Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Koontz's Hot Streak Continues.","review":"After the incredible streak of excellent novels he hasreleased, including Dark Rivers of the Heart and Mr. Murder,Dean Koontz delivers his most suspenseful novel sinceWatchers. Filled with one gripping situation after another,Intensity doesn't slow down for a minute. This is onenovel I could not put down. This ranks among his bestwork without any question."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo! Koontz does it again!","review":"This is my second-favorite book of Dean Koontz's (the first being Phantoms) and I guarantee that this will have your heart pounding faster and faster with every page you turn. The story is interesting and the characters have so much depth. The killer is utterly deranged and Koontz shows this so well that it made the hairs of my neck stand on end, and Chyna, the heroine, is my favorite character in any Koontz book so far. I defiantely recommend this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over written and not even deserving of one star","review":"I have read a lot of Koontz's earlier works, but stoped about 6 years ago as they begain to be so very predictable. A friend, who agreed with me, insisted that I give Intensity a chance. They said it was comparable to Koontz'z old work and worthy of my time. WRONG. This book is so over written, I couldn't even finish it. No author should abuse the reader in this way. It was a total insult. I'm just happy I bought it on a sale table for $5.00, instead of paying the original full price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored first time reader of Koontz","review":"I bought this book because I needed something to read on the airplane. I had a friend who used to rave about Koontz and I had heard a lot of positive comments about this particular title so I decided to read it. UGH! What a waste of money. I was interested in the first 75 pages or so, but then it got so predictable. And give me a break, no matter how \\"intense\\" your childhood was, you would not keep following a serial killer so that justice can be served. I can't even finish the book because Chyna is so stupid. This is my first and last read of Koontz. It is downright awful. I'm curious to know what kind of rubbish the people who gave this book 5 stars normally read so I can skip that too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old thing from Koontz","review":"I think Koontz peaked a while ago and now he has traded in suspense and horror for gore and graphic sadism. I was ready to tear my hair out a few times because he can't seem to move things along at a good pace -- He insists on describing the living hell out of each scene and dragging it out to the point where it's almost unbearable. I think his readers are extremely undemanding -- why else all the five-star reviews? It's beyond my comprehension!"},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn","review":"DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE.

I can't even believe it was a bestseller! What is even more hard to believe is that in almost all the customer reviews it got five stars! Um what is going on here? Did someone come along and snath all of your brains because i honestly can not comprehend that someone with and intelligence would give this book a FIVE! Incase anyone is reading this and saying whatever she doesn't even have any evidence to support her opinion well here is why: 1. How exactly did chyna get out of being chained to the chair? Oh wait there was two chapters on it. in case you didn't catch what i was hinting at TOO MUCH DETAIL! Detail is good but not in overload. 2. The pace, wait or should i say the lack of one.

The book is long, redundant in details and the plot is far fetched."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book kicked butt!!!","review":"This book was excellent. Edgler Vess was had me on the egde of my seat throughout the entire book. Chyna was a very convincing character. I got goosebumps. I recommend this book very highly. My mothers friend recommeded the book to her, she loved it, passed it along to me and I am glad she did! Thanks MOM"},{"rating":"1","title":"The definition of tedium","review":"I have read about 12 Koontz novels. They range from outstanding to mundane. This book did not live up to its reviews or praise. It also did not live up to Mr. Koontz declaration that it was the most intense novel he has written. The plot is nothing new, so you would expect infusion of some twists and turns in the story to keep you going. However, he belabors the same points over and over. It is hard to write a riveting story about a 24 hour period of murder and killer and this book certainly does not dispel that fact. I definitely would not recommend this book even to die hard Koontz fans. Read or re-read Phantoms, Icebound, or Strangers if you want to read some of the best Koontz. Don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good.","review":"I loved the way this book glued me to my seat. I was sad when I had to stop in the middle of a passage and then go do something else. Dean Koontz really deserves to be called a master of suspence. The beginning, however, was for me a little awkward. I felt that the author was just trying to rush through the beginning to get the plot moving. The killer really didn't know she was with him until more than a quarter of the book was read. Throuhout the beginning, she was trying to stop Vess, but kept missing him. Though I think the author was trying to make the story more realistic by setting up fear within a character that anyone would have, for me, the beginning was slightly awkward. But I have to say, the plot afterwards really got good. I stayed up until the weee hours of the morning trying to finish it and to see what happens. The suspense doesn't stop until the last page. I reccommend this book to anyone who like to get lost in a really good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A quick, exciting read, but flawed.","review":"At a certain point I really thought the female protagonist ought to go to the police...this is one of those stories where the central character becomes so focussed on catching the killer herself that she acts foolishly. I also found her memory of her mother and her mother's boyfriend to be beyond belief in terms of their bloodlust and their rather vague political \\"causes\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much monotony","review":"It was alright I guess. The only problem is that Dean Koontz spent too much time speaking of the same thing. It gets a bit boring. But it is not too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wasn't that impressed with this book.","review":"This was the first Dean Koontz book that I read and I didn't think it was that good. Thank goodness that I read Dragon Tears immediately afterward because that got me hooked on Dean Koontz. My other favorites are Lightning and Tick Tock."},{"rating":"2","title":"thrilled in dallas","review":"I'll keep it short and sweet. I couldn't put it down! Loved it! I guess it's my favorite because it could really happen. I wouldn't go chasing after him, but then again, If he had someone I loved...think about it. My mother has worked in hospitals and state-hospitals all my life. The stories that I have been told and the story line of Intensity hit home. When I drive down the road and pass a motor home I look, I wonder, I get the hell away from them. After you read this one you will be looking over your shoulder, looking to see who is walking in the store as you are shopping. You will always wonder who you can trust!You have to read this one. You won't be able to put it down. To those who think that this isn't that good, just name one that is better and we will read the review on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book that started it all!!","review":"If I hadn't read this book, I would never have read Koontz. This book is a great read, and is a horror author other then King. I think if you like horror and suspense, this is the book for you. He keeps your eyes on the words and your hands on the pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely Intense!!!!!!","review":"Other than the dragging middle, this novel was difficult to put down. Koontz knows how to write 'em. I would recommend this to anyone who loves suspense. He knows exactly how to scare the daylights out of you.If you think you know what is going to happen next, Koontz makes it even more frightful than you'd imagine. He knows how to keep you on the edge of your seat. He is right up there with Steven King. This book definitely lives up to it's name.This was my first Koontz book, but it is certainly not the last. It was horrifying and shocking. Absolutely one of the best books I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Title Says It All","review":"Hitchcock would have loved this one. It's a non-stop, nail-biting white-knuckler.A woman staying with new friends over the holidays wakes up to find everyone she's staying with murdered - and the killer still in the house. She ends up hiding out in his van and following him home, putting two and two together about a missing young girl and hoping to be of some assistance. Needless to say, our not-so-friendly neighbor hood eventually detects her, and the nastiness gets nastier.Somewhat contrived, but workably so. The heroine and the little girl are fabulous characters you can care a great deal for - but when has Koontz not provided at least that, even in his weakest efforts?The T.V. miniseries is quite good, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it in one night!!!!!!","review":"I love Dean Koontz for the fact that most of his books were somewhat \\"ghost stories\\" or \\"out of this world\\". But this one was set in the present in a normal place and the fact that this could happen anytime and anyplace grabbed me. I read the book in a matter of hours than I went back and read it again. My heart would not stop pounding. I thought while I was reading this that it would make a great movie! (to bad I missed it on TV)I lent out my copy so much that I have had to replace it twice!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"Hoping for a typical Koontz thriller, I dove into this book one night. I wish I hadn't because this book seemed like it was anything but a Koontz book. I found myself skimming over pages in the last half because the descriptions were lengthy and served no purpose. He goes on for 3 pages to describe how the main character is trying to get out of her shackles. This really disrupts the whole \\"thriller\\" part of the action when you're forced to take a break for 3 pages. It really was one of the worst books I've read in a really long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Page Turner","review":"I want to tell you every time I travel I am inclined to buy a Dean Koontz book. There is no other author who can drag me into his story and spit me out at the other end. This book is his masterpiece to date, and I highly recommend it. This book is much like Truman Capote's \\"In Cold Blood\\" but almost more exciting. You will never guess the ending. Thanks Dean, you keep right on keeping on."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic 12 hours! My favorite audio book!","review":"For some reason, I think Dean Koontz books translate really well to the audio format. I loved \\"Fear Nothing\\", and based upon that experience, I decided to listen to \\"Intensity\\" on my commute. It was even better.This book grabs you by throat 20 minutes into it and doesn't let up for about 11 and a half hours! I was intrigued by both of the primary characters and how they both aproached similar situations so differently. The suspense is unbelievable. Koontz turns what could be just a few short chapters into an entire book, chock full of nerve-jangling detail written at a nail-biting pace.The reading of this book was splendid. It really required that she switch narrative styles so that the listener could follow what was going on, and Kate Burton does that with admirable skill. I was never confused, and she did a great job of becoming, somehow, the horror that is Edgler Forman Vess.This has been my favorite book on tape yet! Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is far too generous....","review":"I, like another customer, bought this book to read on an airplane, and like yet another reader, I'm thankful that I spent only five bucks in a discount bin for this dreadfully predictable and un-intense book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is intensly boring!","review":"I was recommended this book by a freind who told me it was one of the scariest and most thrilling books she had ever read. I took it home planning to read it right before going to sleep (all the more thrilling of course) and was I ever dissapointed. The first couple of chapters were okay, not great but not bad. However I soon found myself forcing myself to read anymore. This book was not only boring but I felt as though I were reading a book written for 12 year olds. In fact its style reminded me of the Goosebumps series I read when I was 12. I could not finish the book so I have no idea what happens to any of the characters, sadly I also don't care. I have never read any books by Dean Koontz, and I won't say I will never read him again, but I will be wary before trying another Koontz book. If I want thrills and chills I will stick to Stephen King whom judging by this book, appears to be a superior writer to Koontz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intensely dull and un-origional.","review":"This book had nothing new to offer. I felt like skimming but forced my way through. Our Heroine escapes again and again from impossible situations without any real guile. And if you cannot predict the 'twist' I imagine you have never read a book or watched a movie before.A poor man's 'Misery'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intense Junk","review":"For anyone who loves great literature, this is definately a book you will want to miss. I can think of no redeeming factors which excuse the low quality of craftsmanship or the stupidity of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense as Intensity can get","review":"Dean Koontz \\"Intensity\\" lives up to it's name. By the name you can tell what the book is about-INTENSITY. And intensity is what you feel by reading this book. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and keeps you reading. I couldn't believe how much psychological, emotional, and physical realism King could put into the book. It's an excellent thrilling/horror book and I recomend it to any mature reader because of violent content."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Thriller","review":"This is the first of Dean Koontz I have read and it's great.Just as the title: It's intense all the way through to the end. It's one you'll want to keep going back to."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Koontz's best","review":"I loved this book! It was definately intense. I have read several of Koontz's books and this is one of my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Koontz - Terrible Narrator","review":"I have always been a Koontz fan. I read the book several years ago and thought I would enjoy being able to listen to it on the road. Trying to suffer through this narrator's voice was TERRIBLE! Kate Burton was not capable of pulling off a guy's voice and ended up being down-right annoying. I've listened to several other of his books with male narrators and they all did a MUCH better job! I would not suggest this narrator to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had lots of potential","review":"I will join the very few who did not particularly care for this novel. I've read worse, but I've also read better. Chyna goes to spend a lovely weekend with her slightly spoiled, overly wealthy friend at the beautiful family home. She winds up first fleeing and then chasing a serial killer who fancies himself indestructible. There are some worthwhile scenes: Chyna trying to creep through the house to avoid the killer preying on her friend's family. However, Koontz's dialogue and character development fell flat for me. I never really cared what happened to any of the characters, and the plot dissolved before it was truly built. I didn't feel that Vess, the killer, was really that frightening, and all the characters talked as if they were reciting lines for a school play....very stiff. Obviously, more people feel differently than I about this novel. For me, it never lives up to its name. Koontz tends to have great ideas but often fails to reach their potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"review on Koontz's Novel","review":"It got to me on time. Very efficiently. I like the book and I've read almost all his works andenjoy each book so very much. Thank you, Dean Koontz..Thanks to Amazon too."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing thriller","review":"Intensity is a dark thriller that just lacked suspense. Not to mention the ending was hasty and rushed. Koontz should just stick with writing about the supernatural. For a real scary novel, read Phantoms, Fear Nothing, or Seize the Night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring as I've never seen before","review":"This is the worst book I've ever read in my life. The author describes everything with all detais, what makes everybody sick of reading. Elks, chairs, tables, everything deserves at least one page to describe. It seems that, if you squeeze the book, making all the useless comments flows out, you would be able to read the same history in 10 pages. The only good thing is the vocabulary. Very rich."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip This Book","review":"I am a huge Dean Koontz fan, however, I was terribly dissapointed with this novel. Koontz did not take the time to develop his characters effectively, rendering most of the character decisions made in the book silly and laughable. Was Mr. Koontz trying to beat a deadline???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Metaphor....Metaphor...and did I say Metaphor?","review":"My first Koontz book. Wow. The story line popped up between zillions of metaphors....like weeds popping up through flowers that blow gently like a mother's kiss to her baby. UGH. Interesting plot - great to be in a 24 hour period during the book, but my gosh, the metaphors. Really made it hard to plod through. Disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another serial killer...it's enough now!","review":"As everybody on this page reviews the book favourably, am I the only one who can't stand serial killer anymore? We've had enough of them, I think!But the biggest problem of the book for me was: Chyna wasn't characterized well enough so that I could feel for her. Normally, Dean Koontz creates wonderful characters where the reader DEFENITELY has to know what happens to them (check out WATCHERS or Mr. MURDER), but I didn't care for Chyna very much. The book kicks into gear to fast, I don't know her well enough.And Edglar Vess, although a scary villain, stands in a long row of serial killers who haunted books and films for the last fifteen years so that he doesn't stand out.Technically, the book is ok, the style is efficient as always in the books of Dean Koontz, but, well I didn't find this book INTENSE and so I can't recommend it, although it's from one of my favourite authors.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Koontz's Best . . .","review":"This is not one of Koontz's best books. It is a pretty basic thriller, and it just didn't really go anywhere. It was full of overblown descriptions, the characters were bland, and it was about as far from \\"intense\\" as you can get. I was very disappointed.Try the Watchers instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"What better word then....INTENSE!","review":"I got three words for this book....Intense....Intense...INTENSE. From the moment i picked this book up i was hooked. The storyline takes a hold of the reader within the first couple pages and never...NEVER lets you go. This is a must read for someone that enjoyes intense thrillers...however i will say this, if you are afraid of the dark or wonder what might be around that corner, well this book might just keep you awake late at night. I read this book and told everyone about it...it's one of those stories that you want everyone to read just so you can talk about how it got your heart racing.This book will have you believing you are in a theater, late at night, watching that scary movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Hold on tight for this ride, its a great one!Bravo Koontz!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There's more to good writing than intensity.","review":"No. Sorry. Serial killers like Mr. 'God fears me' Vess are best left to Patricia D. Cornwell and John Sandford. They have protagonists who can handle them. The ideal Dean Koontz antagonist is science-fictionized (The Bad Place, Watchers, Phantoms) and two- or three-dimensional. And the protagonist is an ordinary person (The Voice of the Night, Watchers, Midnight), not a Superwoman who breaks oak chairs and fights off guard dogs with cleaning fluid. This book was intense all right; unfortunately, that's ALL it was"},{"rating":"1","title":"idiotic and annoying","review":"This is easily one of the worst books I've ever read. It reads like a really bad horror movie. To it's credit, it might make a decent short story if you remove most of Koontz's flowery babbling language. No wonder this guy is able to write so many novels, he doesn't seem concerned with plot or substance, only with filling pages with words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Weak, Stupid Heroine","review":"In an on-line chat session Koontz mentions that this is his favorite book. He needs to go back and read some of his GOOD novels. Every other page all I could think was, HOW STUPID CAN SHE GET? Chyna was not only stupid but weak. She manages to empathize with some girl she does not even know, and keeps company with the murderer, just in case she can save her. Save yourself - skip this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother!!","review":"The positive response to this book is so overwhelming that I must put in my two cents worth. I started to read it, I even held out hope for 100 pages, because I like Koontz. After 100 pages I found I still wasn't interested or involved in what was happening - I really didn't care about the characters or their eventual fates - and I put the book away. I felt I had better things to do with my time"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I've said before that koontz doesn't write to impress any literary guilds; he writes to sell novels.Usually, they are worth the price, but 'Intensity' was so dragged-out and unbelievable, and so slow-moving that I never really finished it. I got close, but I could see where it was going and so I finally just stuck it in a drawer.If you want Koontz, there are many better ones to choose from. Don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book by Koontz... and it lives up to the title!","review":"Wow! What a great book. This has to be my favorite of Dean Koontz' books!It really is intense and I can't get over how the whole book happens over a matter of 36 hours at the most! Definately a must read. Especially for Dean Koontz fans... you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, Insightful!","review":"Intensity is indeed a book filled with action and suspence. But there is also a powerful message within it's pages. By saving Ariel, Chyna also saved herself. At the times when she felt like giving up and waiting to die, the thought of Ariel drove her on. One of the overall themes of this book is that you should never give up without a fight. Chyna did just that when all the odds were against her she kept fighting for her life, for Ariels freedom. This book brought me insight into the human spirit. How incredibly strong it is when faced with what seems like complete hopelessness. Chyna found hope,and saved herself. I recommend this book for everyone, it's an easy read, and very entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adrenal Rush!!!!!","review":"I was looking for a good book to read and my friend handed me Intensity. It was the first Dean Koontz book I've read and I was more than impressed...thus why I looked up Amazon.com to find more books by Koontz. The fact that you can't put the book down is only the surface...I missed my metro stop because I was so involved in the book. Koontz keeps you in suspense on every page turn and all you want to do is find out how it ends, not to mention the unexpected curve. You feel for the main character and just want her nightmare to end...so now I'm off to find my second book by Dean Koontz."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was intense and I couldn't put it down","review":"If you want a good scary book to read at night then this is the one.

This book left me amazed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast but full of action","review":"This book went pretty fast, there isn't any thime wasted on details. The story starts out a bit weird, but I gets good in the middle.This is one of those books that even made my shiver while reading it ... I usually don't get that feeling quickly while watching horror movies, and certainly not while reading books, but this one was an exception I guess. The last part of the book was just so intense, it was like a was running away from the psychotic guy.Not just an entertaining story, but an intense one"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Book...

Not that the first two movies didn't have their share of them, but in this case it didn't add anything to the story (or lack thereof). The second problem had to do with ending. I won't give it away, but it was thoroughly depressing and I suspect was most of what kept people away in droves when this movie was in the theater.There were a few funny parts here and there, mostly spoofing scenes from the other two movies.

Not even a good storyline. The movie is full of horrible writing, and even worse acting. Arnold might be a cool guy, but he should be thankful his career isn't dependent upon this movie.

After 12 years away, you gotta hand it to Arnold: he still looks great for his age (in his 50's now!). Although the movie, like Matrix Reloaded, is extremely fatalistic (our destiny is unchangeable), it makes for a great popcorn flick nonetheless. Arnold's performance this time out, however, is lacking something that I could not quite put my finger on. Perhaps it was James Cameron's direction, who knows? In any event, it's one movie that I'll probably buy when it's out on DVD. Gotta have the complete trilogy, you know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad to the Bone","review":"This movie sucks.

The humour is horrible and mocks the legacy of the two 'real' Terminator films. ie)Elton John shades on the Terminator.The special effects were terrible CGI graphics (in the behind the scenes interview on the T2 DVD Stan Winston says the big problem with films today is all the computer effects - he uses them ONLY when they can't be done another way. But here it's ALL CGI all the time and it's all terrible.)The uninventive story plods along, missing the boat in almost every scene. There's no real dramatic arc in this film and it completely misses the point of the second with its resonant theme of the value of human life. There are no such themes here -just boring, unimaginative action scenes that land with a dull thud.I'm glad Arnie is now governor because he hasn't made a good movie in TEN YEARS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arnold looks really old","review":"This movie was such a letdown. I loved the first 2 movies but this one was awful. Don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tales from the not so deep","review":"This one is not the instant classic that the first and (especially) the second, but it holds up well enough as a good action movie. It is not as intense as the first. Nor is it as insightful as the second. The aim this time around is simply to have fun, and it meets that goal very well.Arnold is back here in his likely last appearance as a terminator from the future, and, despite the years that have passed since the first outing, he looks very much the same, as he should. Kristanna Loken is a welcome addition to the pantheon of terminator models, becoming both very sensual and very eerie.You may feel that the movie should have done more to deal with the concepts of fate and free will, like was discussed in the previous movie, but if you merely want to watch a movie that has great effects, great action and passably charismatic characters, you could do worse than this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacked everything","review":"This film is beyong doubt the ending of the Terminator sequals. Arnie looks like he's a fat bloated old man now. The TX was just a rip off of the T1000 liquid metal idea, and there were absolutely no surprises. John Connor looks like he should get a part in the next Planet of the Apes film. His character was pathetic. The effects were boring, morphing, computer graphics on the truck, plasm gun, how boring! It's all been done before! Overall I would give this a zero rating. It was too long forthcoming and was no were near the league of it predessors. It was also too short. Rise of the Machines is a joke and it's hardly surprising hardly any of the actors from the previous films got involved in this one. The idea has been done and is now old hat. Give up now! This is the final nail in the Terminator coffin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Film, Great DVD","review":"IMO, this is the second best Terminator film in the saga.

Terminator 3 was not bad, it was a good decent movie. I will watch it again and buy it when it comes out on dvd. But Mostow doesnt know how to put in the action like Cameron did. T3 has action, but it doesnt have enough as T2 did. Cameron really should have been the one to direct it and bring back the original cast instead of new people. T3 does have it good points though. If they ever make a T4, I hope they will correct many of the mistakes put into this movie. If Arnold wants to do it again, but I'm sure he will get tired doing another Terminator over and over again. The ending was also a downfall, I thought it could have been better. Thats about it. It just means that theres a possibility for a T4. But other than that, a good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"When I came out of viewing, \\"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,\\" I knew it was the greatest movie I've seen in a very long time.

The way it talked about the human condition, the bond between a robot and a boy, \\"There is no Fate, but what we make\\" and the strength of women. It had a lot to say. \\"Terminator 3\\" had absolutely no redeeming value. The way Arnold says \\"Talk to the Hand\\" to how they totally negated the \\"Fate\\" quote in \\"T2\\" really made this movie seem like on big expensive joke. It was too short, not smart enough, said nothing about the human condition, and finally, where the hell was the \\"Terminator\\" theme music. It was orchestrated at the end. You cannot have a \\"Terminator\\" film begin without the theme music. This movie just makes me mad thinking about it. If James Cameron does not one want to come back, ask Ridley Scott. Do not let Jonathan Mostow screw up a potential \\"Terminator 4.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"dissappointing...","review":"Why on earth would you do that? Everyone knew that T2 could not be topped. So why would you want to leave the Teminator legacy like that. That was like MJ playing for the Wizards after retirement. What for? It wasnt worth it.

All his films aren't like movies, but rather like some very low budget TV special. This is suppose to be a great scale movie, but I never feel any grandness while watching it.There is absolutely no character development in the movie. The John Connor character in this movie could have been played by just anybody under this script and director. Obviously Jonathan Mostow aren't the type of director that pay much attention to details, which become his major failure as a director.I wish other directors could have directed this film instead of Jonathan Mostow. I wouldn't even mind watching James Cameron direct another Terminator movie once again. Atleast I am pretty sure he won't let us down. (None of his movies have ever let me down)"},{"rating":"1","title":"sad","review":"I gave this movie 1 star because 0 wasn't an option. This movie should have been awesome. I don't care how great the special effects are. If the story is bad... it's a bad movie. These guys messed with a classic series that should have been handled with much more thought and care. Those who have said that it made T2 pointless are absolutely right. I could have cried when the Matrix sequels turned out to be so lousy. The new Star Wars movies had the same effect on me.

The first Terminator movie back in 1984 was dark, disturbing, violent and amazingly believable. T2 gave us more insight into the story, but T3 seem to ponder from one action sequence to another without any rhyme or reason. The only part in the movie where I actually felt a connection with the other two movies was when Arnold aknowledged that he killed John Connor.Otherwise I was very disappointed with the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"T3","review":"My favorite of the Terminator movies.

The problem is the plot seems to be to take T2 make the bad terminator a she instead of a he. Throw in a few good special effects, and some very very bad jokes, which should of been cut on final editing and call yourself T3. It never seems to reach the drama of T2, the jokes are old and the plot recycled.

It was Tereminator to the extreme. t3 was like an upgraded version of t2 not a alternate. And how can people even say at all that there was nothing different between the t-1,000 and the t-x. The part of the movie that I didn't like was how the whole moeal of all the Terminators was no fate but what we make and now its changed to theres no escaping fate. And it was only pg-13 material.

Christina Loken is wonderful as the female terminator and Arnold does his best to hang in there as the good guy terminator to keep us entertained. They pull it off very well with a good story and excition action sequences. Seeing this movie on Blu-Ray is a must-see experience. Add this wonderful Sci-Fi movie to the mix and get out the pop corn. A fun ride is straight ahead for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ending ruins it","review":"From the moment Arnold says \\"You're terminated,\\" this picture falls apart. There are several places in the picture where you wonder if the screenwriters even saw the first two films, though you tend to ignore them because Arnold and the other actors are doing good work, and the setpiece destruction is well-staged. But you do notice Skynet's takeover. That was described in T2, and it's not what happens in T3. Then we are asked to believe a father outright lies to his daughter with his dying breath. That leads to an ending that is totally in violation of the series' premise (till now) -- a saying repeated in both films: \\"The future is not set. Our future is what we make of it.\\" This picture's premise is: \\"The future IS set, and there's nothing we can do about it.\\" Maybe if all this had been set up it would have worked, though I doubt it. You can't change core tenets of a film series and have it work. T3 does just that, and it doesn't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Arnold!!!","review":"Rise of the Machines was just as much fun to watch as the first two. The Governator had a machine gun and he was shooting it. Plus his face was practically ripped off leaving only his metalic skull showing. What more do you want? T3 had intense robot battles and lots of high tech special effects. I myself am not too big on tons and tons of computer generated images. The CGI and the fact that the movie was a bit slow at times lead to me giving it a 4 out 5. But the fights are awesome and the intensity is high. I think Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines fits nicely with the other two and I am hoping for a T4. Plus the ending rocks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How does this happen?","review":"How does this movie happen? It is impossible. Skynet shouldnt exist in T3.

This movie by far (besides Gigli) has to be the biggest disappointment. I wish it would've flopped in the box office, but like idiots we go see it & leave in shock of the suckiness that took place.

So this is not a review from someone who hates cheesy unrealistic sci fi or action films.I was really disappointed by the:1) Plot2) Script3) Acting4) PaceThere were some cool special effects and a hilarious chase scene, but overall the movie is terrible! Its worth watching if you were a Terminator fan, but don't get your hopes up that it will add anything significant to the previous two stories. It would have been interesting to go forward into the future and focus on the wars against the machines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good.","review":"This movie wasn't terrible. It was about on par with your average big-budget summer blockbuster. But as pointed out by other reviewers, the plot is lacking. Considering the special effects capability of modern film, they could have done a much more entertaining film by making a precursor - a grim future where the humans fight to send Kyle Reese back to protect Sarah Connor would have been interesting, at least. This film feels more like a rehash of the second movie, with only minor deviations from that plotline (take the same terminator, send it after John Connor, but this time instead of knives and stabbing weapons, give it a gun, and make it female). I'd call it the worst in the terminator series. I still bought it just to own the triology, but as a standalone film its just not very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Da Gov was excellent","review":"I sure hope they don't ever change the Constitution and allow Da Gov to be Prez.

T2 was made over 10 years ago, and still looks like one of the best FX jobs on the plannet. Ever. I thought at least for T3 they'd have realized this high standard and tried to compete with it. Through the whole move I was flinching from the half-assed production. I'm thinking that most of the $170+ million, or whatever it was, went to Arnie. So they turned post production over to the local computer club, gave them $50, and said \\"Please make this look decent. It's all the money we have!\\"Enough ranting I guess, the rest of the movie is decent, and even slightly unpredictable. You can see influences from the other Terminator movies, and from other movies that this mutha would be competing with.

WHY?! This movie joins Alien Resurrection and Jurassic Park 3 as movies that took a good idea, ran way too long, and ended up stupid. this had so much potential and it just died. We sat in the theater laughing because this is histerical, but it wasn't supposed to be. The \\"funny\\" parts were boring and the serious part cracked me up. Gotta say though, that the part where she locks him in a dog cage is kinda funny, again not meant to be, but it is. Oh, and why would they pick Claire Danes for this? She did nothing but scream throughout the whole thing, the relevation regarding her in the future was seen a mile away, and where was Linda Hamilton? I'll tell you; she probably took one look at the script and wisely said hells no. So easy solution, we kill her off.So sad. go watch the frist two, forget yuo ever saw this one, and enjoy your Terminator world where there is a possibility of a happy future.Terminatrix was hot though..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the first two, but still very good stuff.","review":"Come on people. This was not a bad movie at all. It's not the masterpieces that the first two are, but it's better than most third entries in a series. Arnold was once again good as the robot sent back to protect John. Claire did well as the fill in for Linda Hamilton, but she couldn't take away the fact that I missed her. Nick Stahi was a better actor than Edward Furlong, and pulled off the role of John Conner nicely. It's not a bad movie, go see it, and prepare to be amazed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been there, done that","review":"Clearly T3 was expected to revive an old franchise, as well as the sagging career of Arnold Schwarzenegger. In both respects, it fails miserably. The film is, however, well directed, with crisp action sequences that are very well choreographed. It is both the source material and the acting that fall flat. Every key performance in this film is flat and uninspired, from Schwartzenegger on down. The script is also uninspired, failing to break very much new ground and rehashing virtualy every cliche from the first two films.While the first film broke new ground in its science fiction detail and the second film broke new ground with its dazzling special effects, this film does neither. Basically, if you watch it without giving much thought to what's going on, you may find it to be an enjoyable way to pass a couple of hours, but if you want real entertainment, rent or buy one of the first two movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disappointment!","review":"I loved the first Terminator film and T2 (seen both multiple time), but T3 - what a disappointment! Aside from a single good chase - there's really nothing interesting at all about the movie. The story and plot were very weak. And only a handful semi-humorous jokes and one-liners, really makes the movie forgetable. The \\"terminatrix\\" ,although gorgeous, was about as intriguing as Natasha Henstridge (the hot alien character) in the movie \\"Species\\". I wanted to like the movie but was really let down. If you really have to see it, don't expect much."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Terminator Yet!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This movie was one of the best movies that i've seen in a long time.

This is a have to see movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful sequel","review":"When T3 begins, a lot of audience members might ask themselves \\"How can this possibly top T2?\\". The simple answer is, it can't.That isn't shameful by any stretch, as T2 was arguably the best action movie ever made. T3, however, manages to have both great action and a great story, more than enough to entertain and even provoke thought. Though showing his age, Arnold still manages to shine in the role that made him a real movie star, and Nick Stahl is a great replacement for Edward Furlong's John Conner. While it probably won't make it onto any top 10 lists, T3 is more than enough to please any fans of the series or action fans in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"The WORST!!!!!","review":"Without giving anything way, the ending of this movie makes the heroic actions of the John's mother and father in the first two movies completely pointless!!!Arnold's last word's to John: \\"I'll see you\\".

The female terminator was rediculous, she couldnt act at all. The plot had huge holes in it. It didn't really work on any level.

I don't care how many lasers the T-X fires while in that crane truck, the action was no where as riveting as the T2 18-wheeler vs the dirt bike. An utterly uninspiring villian, barely a few threads of plot- many of which unravel once you start asking too many questions . . . (i.e. if Ah-nold has two hydrgen cells in him, why didn't he use one to off the T-1000 in the last movie?)All attempts of humor seemed campier and far less appropriate than the dark humor we have seen in the previous movies.\\"Talk to da hand!\\" ?? where the hell is that coming from?Edward Furlong made the best decision of his life to not be in this movie.

You gotta be kidding.","review":"This is the worst Terminator film out of the 3 to date, and the reason is, because it has no depth and is to predictable. T2 was by far the best sequal of any film to date, the story was fresh and the special effects were refreshing. T3 seems to be a desperate attempt to re-start the Terminator story, but it falls well short of expectations. The film also has so many gaffs in it, you lose count. Some of the acting is 3rd rate and the ending, whilst, is probably the its only plus point, does leave you wondering what is next. But if it is as 3rd rate as this sequal, I doubt I will be wasting anytime in seeing it. Incidentally, T3 is already in the discounts bins, and I think that speaks volumes."},{"rating":"1","title":"what were they thinking?!!!","review":"I am super fan of Terminator and Terminator II but when I watched Terminator III, I was super disappointed. No wonder James Cameron did not participated in this movie.There are few things that were just too hard to bare. 1) Even Arnold hit the gym for this movie, you can totally tell he was an old man. He was sucking up his tommy. 2)Did anybody thought \\"Talk to the Hand\\" funny? Not me. 3) Is it just me or does anybody else think that John Conner looked like a monkey?...the list goes on.If I were you, I will just rent this movie and return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE! \\"DONT COME BACK\\"","review":"TEMINATER 3 \\"RISE OF THE MACHINES\\" IS A MOVIE FOR PEOPLE HOLDING THE HOPE OF THE FIRST ONE.

This movie doesn't stand alone, nor does it do T1 &/or T2 justice... seems production time was rushed due to the elections and it screweed up the story, or the writers were in a hurry to throw together something (I'm still not sure what!?!) in order to get money out of the public. This is one of the worst sequals I've ever seen, if not THE worst. A HUGE disappointment.

NICK STAHL AND CLAIRE DANES ARE BOTH CAPABLE ACTORS BUT JONATHAN MOSTOW IS CERTAINLY NOT A CAPABLE DIRECTOR TO HELM SUCH A FRANCHISE. THE SADEST THING IS NOT SO MUCH THE DISSAPOINTMENT OF THE FILM, BUT THE INCREDIBLY LONG WAIT FANS HAVE HAD TO GO THROUGH TO GET TO THIS CRUMMY WORL OF BAD PERFORMANCES AND PLOT ERRORS.

The studio apparently thought that the first two movies were blockbusters because of the chase scenes, not the plot or development. So what does the studio do? Cram the movie full of mindless and seemingly endless chase scenes (largely a variation on the first two movies .. the obligatory motorcycle chase, trucks, etc.) tied together with some flimsy pretexts and forget to put in an interesting plot.

The acting was marginal and the characters didn't even seem likable. Claire Danes was very annoying throughout the movie, and I think they could have picked someone better. Arnold did good, but I really didn't care for Terminator X. She was just plain boring. Nothing really stuck out in the movie.

I even marked the date on my calendar. Now I'm sorry that I purchased it at all. The acting all around is atrocious, the dialogue lame. Storyline is passable with some ( emphasize very few) memorable effects although no where near T2's groundbreaking effects. To think that they had 10 years to develop this property.

THE ENDING OF THIS MOVIE TOTALLY CONTRADICTS TERMINATOR 2. THE MOVIE IGNORS THE HUMAN STORY AND FOCUSES ON THE SPECIAL EFFECTS WHICH AFTER A WHILE BECOME BORING.

Now they're sending an even more powerful (T3) terminator that still can't do it.Let's just skip onto say T19, the baddest momma out. I mean, these things are from the future, right?

The T-101 model terminator (Arnold Schwarzeneggar) comes from the future to protect John Connor (Nick Stahl), the future savior of the human race, from a more advanced model (Kristanna Loken) sent to destroy him. This time, it happens simultaneously with the long-dreaded ascendance of Skynet and the revolt of the machines.T3 lacks the freshness of T1 and the intelligence and human drama of T2, but it certainly delivers as a special-effects laden thrill ride.

It's very obvious that the original writer / director had nothing to do with this film. Lacks the mood and the tight plotting. Plus Ahnold is way too old for the part. Cyborgs do not age! The ending is much darker and totally contradicts the main point of T2."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORSE TERMINATOR MOVIE EVER MADE","review":"The movie is so cheezeee.... the action is so phony, the guy who plays John Conner sucks, in T2 the kid was cool in this one he's a big dork. So much money put into this crappy movie, it's a one big joke if you a ask me. Whatever ever happend to the cop that pulled over the evil robot chick, all the sudden they decided not to show that part. The huge truck was alreayd parked next to the animal hospital to be driven on little street and destory everything in it's way...oh please....THE MOVIE PLAIN SUCKS...T2 is still the best Terminator MOVIE. period"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quality","review":"Good quality if you download and watch in Windows media center or Windows media player. Not so good if you use Unbox player to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than worth the money.","review":"This DVD isn't amazing, but worth four bucks. The documentaries, transfer, and behind the scenes footage are all plenty worth this money. If your looking for a load of bonus features(because you're a collector or something) you probably won't want this. However, if you're just browsing Amazon and happen to come across it, considering it applies to free super saver shipping, you might as well add it to your cart for the heck of it and if you think it sucks, it isn't like you wasted the bank's vault. The reason i give the package four stars is the movie itself. When people say they think this is the worst movie in the trilogy, they are definitely right. The movie itself is great, especially if you've never seen T1 or T2, but if you have seen them,you know that T3 falls significantly out of the constant flowing story line of the previous films. This could be a result of the fact that it was not as closely related to the magnificent Jim Cameron as T1 and T2."},{"rating":"1","title":"movie good condition","review":"i got the package but my uncle already bought me this, when returning it i have never got my refund, nor i got a message. plus there was no way to contact them. do not buy it at all nor waste your time looking at it. thank god i have money still but never will buy it no more unless i get my refund to erase all this and start some thing new."},{"rating":"2","title":"good story","review":"It is a good story, but not as good as the \\"terminator2\\".

T2 was boring, way too long a rehash of the original with better special effects minus the violence. T3 is the worst movie of all time along side 28 Days Later, this is a rehash of T2 which was a rehash of T1. T2 the violence was watered down T3 is a joke (I've seen more action packed violent episodes of Scooby Doo).

Give this one miss boyz because it's definitely for the Girls."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a joke.","review":"When I went to the theatre to walk this movie, I went in expecting it now to be near the quality of T2. And that is exactly what it was, a complete joke. The movie was poor acting, poor diolugue, and had a very poor story line. Sure it had some good special effects, but thats where it stopped. How the hell could the terminator remember all the small details that he did from T2? and those stupid one liners were so over done. I hate the way that they killed sara conner, and the actor of john was a complete joke.I really missed the monologues of Sara Conner like in T2, and how T2 had messages about how human were destinted to kill themselves, and about family. And did this movie have even the slightest of this no. All this movie had was 1 hot women.Please just buy the T2 Extreme Edition or something worth your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"RUINED 2 CLASSIC TERMINATOR (1 & 2)","review":"I couldnt wait 2 see this film. im a big fan of schwaznegger. i love Terminator 1 and 2.

Arnold acting in here was really bad and so was the entire crew. John connor was the biggest wimp of all time. No wait he's the second the ifrst is mark patton's chracter from NOES 2. You want real Arnold movies get Predator that is way better then this garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"you morons","review":"Who said T3 was a sequel to T2? T3 is a prequel showing us what happened before Terminator and Judgement Day. We will see John Connor in action as a man, the whole reason Terminator and Judgement Day happen.

This is most fitting given the fact that this is one of the very best Science Fiction movies that I have ever seen. The performances are excellent as are the direction and script. You can tell that the producers of both the movie and the Special Edition really dedicated themselves to their tasks.

These are only a few of the new and awesome installmts this movie offers for fans of Ah-nuld's android series. Although Arnold (I can't spell his last name) is the only returning cast member (except for John's mom's doctor making a cameo) this film still is great with an ending and plot that actually makes sense and leaves the viewer with a thirst for more.

The rhyme and rhythm of the poem make this an excellent bedtime story with its almost song like effect. The illustrations are clear yet have such depth that my child will stare at each page for several minutes, picking out the many details. If your child had fun finding the mouse in \\"Good Night Moon\\", he will love looking for the mysterious creature that watches from the shadows as the story unfolds.Though the plot could be viewed as kind of scary, the immages are depicted in very gentle and innocent drawings that leave the reader with a sense of comfort, not fright."},{"rating":"2","title":"Child Pleaser","review":"I have never read Mouse,Look Out! to a group of children without them wanting to hear it again and again.

I received a rancid bottle, and can not return it. I will never buy fragrance from Amazon again due to the fact they do not accept returns on defective, outdated products they sell, such as fragrance. I would highly recommend you buy your perfume elsewhere and make sure you test the bottle first. This is outdated, and smells horrible! Normally this fragrance smells wonderful, but BEWARE, what i received was disgusting, and is headed for the trash can since they will not allow a return/exchange.

The cover I received fits very tightly only around the table top - and if you have a lip or edge around your table top, it may not fit at all. It reminds me of those elasticized table cloths that go over the realy cheap and flimsy plastic tables that always look dirty. Avoid this purchase! The shipping also seemed unreasonably high. It is contained in a very small box that is only about an inch deep/thick. No reason for such high shipping costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"This wire stinks!","review":"This wire stinks!

The movie itself is not that exciting, but the theme is fascinating."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a film","review":"At best this is a poorly made commercial for some sort of evangelical Christian sect. (Being a Jew, I find it appaling that any religion could hold that the only path to salvation is through some arbitrary acceptance of some mythical figure. All the Jews, Muslims, and Hindus are doomed to eternal fire becaue they do not accept Jesus, whatever that means. The film does not define the process of acceptance. The idea of somebody dying for somebody else's sins is so alien to Judaism, that I find it silly.) This hokey film is trying and failing to prove that without \\"accepting\\" Jesus man is doomed to a state of some immoral anarchy. The plot, the acting, the special effects are on the level of Japanese kiddie SciFi flicks of the 1950s. Enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh My God!!!","review":"Quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen, except that it was so bad I couldn't look away -- like a train wreck."},{"rating":"1","title":"A simple movie with a simple message.","review":"You question the bible and you are evil!! Christianity must be forced on everyone, if they like it or not. Free will is a tool of Satan!! This is basically what the message of this movie was. One line in this propaganda film was, \\"The scripture is always true, and never needs verification.\\" I will say that D. David Morin was very good in this. His character was likable, if not a bit close minded."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad vehicle for evangelicalism","review":"The movie should come with a warning label:This is a stuffy church movie which is embarassing even for Christians to watch.we had no idea what the movie was about, and took our youngest son with us. half the audience left in the first 30 minutes. the rest appeared to be church groups that had come together for the show.I found no redeeming value to the movie, the plot and the major theme are intellectually interesting but the heavy handed preaching technic will turn off anyone but the most ardent fundamentalist viewer.Sadly so, evangelism doesn't have to be stuffy, preachy especially in a culture that is action orientated and where most kids can't even sit still to read....So the movie ends up preaching to the choir. with no outreach to unsaved or secular people at all. It will just prove their position that Christians are oblivious to the need to capture people's attention and meet them half way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than HG Wells! Take It Straight To Your Heart!","review":"I must of said, \\"Wow\\" about a hundred times while watching this movie. It deals so perfectly with the Christian Church of today and sadly what it has become: A Social Club, blind to the ways of Christ.

I agree that it's worthwhile so I bought it. Now I recommend it as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time well spent","review":"This filmmaker is fairly new to the feature film market, but has produced high quality short films for over a decade. This film is well written, splendidly acted, and the cinematography is superb. The message of the film is well thought out. The central thesis is that presenting moral teaching aside from the authority of the creator is counterproductive. Key characters in the film, set in the 1890's disagree over the premise, and the central character is sent forward to present day to experience the consequence of his approach. Interacting with modern day Americans and Christians, he is shocked to see how our society has decayed in 110 years. The film makes it's point clearly, and is very entertaining. This is worth seeing more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"LIKED IT!","review":"The movie had a silly premise - but as I watched it, it really showed how we have truly become desensitized to the corrupt culture we are living in. I related to the characters as they were shocked at the vulgarity and immorality the \\"world\\" is imposing on us. It encouraged me to speak out the next day when my employer started using the name of JESUS CHRIST in vain in my presence. We Christians should not be allowing this culture to impose their lack of morals and ethics on us. A great movie to take your children to see - but from some of the reviews here - obviously many adults would profit from seeing it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"The acting could be better, but it is an important message","review":"I have used this movie to show my children the double standards in today's society. The movie points out that although curse words are common place in modern society(freedom of speech), the name of God used in any positive way is no longer acceptable.It is also sad to see in the film, the state of many churches of today (thankfully, not all). The acting could be better, but considering the film's budget, they did great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have not receive it!","review":"I, also, have not receive this.

This is a religious propaganda film. Buyer beware! This is the worst movie ever. I couldn't even finish it and I have watched some pretty painful, awful movies. This movie is screened at churches and they are all told to go review the movie on Amazon and other sites so there are a lot of \\"shill\\" reviews out there. These people think that they are doing Gods will and can trick you into watching an awful movie and somehow you will become enlightened and change your mind about the whole Jesus thing. One of my favorite all time movies is \\"The Ten Commandments\\" this is a very religious movie, well done with great acting. This movie \\"Time Changer\\" is a horror show of what the christian taliban would do to this country if they could.

Jennifer O'neil's character has no relationship with the script. After twice meeting people from the past, each of whom have no idea how recent history transpired, Michelle launches into (presumably the same) sermon about the moral decline of the times. Her role is overly preachy, and unrealistically steps over Carlisle's complete ignorance of the events she describes.I wanted to see the movie because of its concept. I don't think it was well done, in spite of the cast of great actors. It came off as something I could expect to see watching a late-night TV evangelist."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie should be in the religion section!!","review":"This movie should be in the religion section, not the sci-fi section! The movie was produced by people who make movies that are played in churches to christian audiences. The acting is simplistic and primitive. I also am repulsed at the theme of the movie, which is that good deeds have no value, unless they are performed by someone who believes in Jesus. I am not exaggerating- that is the message of this movie!! All non christians would be insulted by this theme. I dont believe that christian themed movies should be misrepresented as science fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"What if you could get offended by everything you see?","review":"ONE MAN WILL! Ok this is such a baptist movie. All it is is watching a rule loving freak geting offended by everything in the future. I think this movie is funny, but I still hate it. If you watch this movie and enjoy it...FORSHAME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Drek","review":"I exited watching the flick a little over half-way through, having figured out I'd been decieved into a Fundamentalist propaganda meeting. Deception being a bad thing, by the way.What struck me is the amount of falsehood presented as fact in the movie and the amount of hypocracy it took to create it. Not only would the science involved with time travel have been shelved by a Fundamentalist \\"scientist\\" because it would involve things such as accepting the ancient age of the earth, but the claims of the religious nature of the start of this country are patently obvious to anyone who has actually sat down and *read* our Constitution.Apparently it is OK to use technology which invalidates the belief in the inerrancy of the book (like time-travel or the movie industry itself) to promote the inerrancy of the book.Hypocritic, propagandic, deceptive drivel.The flash of time-travel was pretty, though.Too bad one can't give it 0 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sanctimonious Claptrap","review":"Oh, for the good old days when blacks were still \\"smarting\\" over slavery, women had no rights, but had to wear 5 pounds of clothes, a popular form of medicine was bleeding the body with leeches, no indoor plumbing and if you lived past 55 you were very old! Please! C. B. Demille should be turning in his grave after this one. Religion is used to try to get this one over. Most of the time you want to tell the hero to F*** Off. The Amish and that \\"God Hates Fags\\" group who delude themselves into thinking they're religious might like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hideous","review":"Pass this by. Possibly the worst sci-fi movie I've seen in a long time. This is a total preach fest! Do not watch unless you find grass growing interesting. It gets a bit old when a group of older WHITE men tell me that my morals are wrong because I don't believe excatly what they believe in or do not give credit to Jesus for the source. If you would like a wholly innacurate incredibly dull experience, or possibly have really bad insomnia. Watch (attempt?) this film. ICK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The packaging neglects to mention that this is propoganda","review":"Pure blantant Christian propoganda. The acting is terrible, the story fails to argue its' point, and the packaging I would argue is intentionally deceitful, which is extremely ironcic given the Christian moral message of the movie.If you want another crutch to prop up your religious beliefs on, by all means rent this movie. But if you have a brain and can think for yourself, the ridiculousness of this movie will cease being funny about 30 minutes in.For the first 15 minutes I kept expecting the movie to be a joke, a comedy. But it isn't. Its just trite and stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy","review":"This movie is dull and I would be embarrassed to invite anyone to see it with me, or to recommend it. The visuals were great, but that's about the only thing good I could say about it. This is a thinly-veiled vehicle for the evangelical message, but naive in its presentation,and so would probably get good reviews only from evangelicals. It certainly would not impress the people who need Christ most, if they are accustomed to quality secular works. The lead actor was not likeable, which further makes the transparent preaching motive hard to take. I am a Christian, and regret having to review the film in this way, but I have to be honest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing!","review":"How is it possible that this movie has received so many positive reviews? Is no one else offended by the idea that the 19th century--with its slavery, child labor, no rights for women or any racial minorities, appalling work conditions, the slaughter and oppression of native people around the globe, etc.--is somehow morally superior to the 21st century? I know we have our problems today, but are you kidding me? Does people using the name's lord in vain really compare to SLAVERY! I don't know which is worse: this movie's appalling understanding of science, or its complete ignorance of history! I'm disappointed that there is any \\"Christian\\" who cannot see this. This movie is promulagating a lie--that the \\"olden times\\" where somehow superior because there was a greater belief in the Bible. But to believe that is to engage in an unspeakable--and, I think, EXTREMELY racially offensive--whitewash of history."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Horrible Waste Of Time","review":"This is not a movie, it's an infomercial. A silly attempt at brainwashing. Ten minutes into the film I was asking myself if the well known actors were responsible for community service. This movie was brought to a \\"film night\\" group that we've had for a year or so. I've felt compelled to join Amazon in an attempt to insure noone else is scammed, either by purchasing or renting this horrific display of complete stupidity. First the premise that; 1890 is holier than modern day. 1861-1865 Civil War. (1865 the year wacko gets his bible). 1847-1882 Jesse James Gang, The James Younger Gang, Dalton Gang 1861-1937 and numerous other outlaw gangs. Apartheid, hangings, child labor, prostitution etc. If you want to laugh out-loud at the too numerous to list idiocies, this propoganda non art, waste of celluloid, hunk of junk has to offer.

Our boys range from11 to 17. I agree that the main character seems a bit stiff, but I think this is how his character is supposed to be.

A clown fish named Marlin travels the waters off the east coast of Australia after losing his son Nemo to a human. Marlin's journey to save his son is filled with memorable characters (including a fish with a bad memory and sharks that have forsworn eating fish) and lots of action. Meanwhile, Nemo's imprisonment in a dentist's aquarium also has its share of memorable characters and humorously \\"tense\\" moments. The climax coming when the dentist's precocious (to put it nicely) niece shows up for her surprise gift of a pet fish -- Nemo. The movie's animation is wonderful...with the possible exception of the few human characters...I thought they could have been animated a bit better. This minor point aside, Finding Nemo should be seen by all...young and young-at-heart alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Animation Excellence!","review":"My wife and I viewed this with our 6 year-old daughter and we ALL had a BLAST!!!

This movie has everything from adventure and drama to comedy. All the characters are well thought out; the story is extremely well written; the graphics are astonishing, and the DVD has so many extra features you'll be entertained for hours. If you don't have a fish tank try their virtual aquarium and see what it would be like to have one. Or, look at all the beautiful original artwork for the film. Don't forget to play the intro before the movie!This movie is tons of fun for kids and adults alike. If you have a buding artist in your home this DVD is perfect for them.

We watched it EVERY day while both parents were working. I enjoyed it as much as she did. I found myself watching it every day (sometimes several times a day) with her. I made the mistake of letting her take it home, never to be seen again. I now have another grandaughter, aged 6 months, so I have an excuse to buy another copy. I confess that I would skip the whole first scenes showing the bad fish with Nemo's mom, and you know what happens if you have watched this. My grandaughter never even knew that was in the movie until she was older (she probably wouldn't have understood, but I personally thought it was sad, even though death is a part of life). As I first said, I know this movie word for word, and recently watched it on TV with my 60+ husband and we still laughed (not a kid in the room as an excuse). I can't wait for new grandaughter to watch it with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Florida!","review":"Of course I loved the movie etc.. I've never been much in to animation and would probably have continued to successfully avoided it except for a certain birth some years ago. So I've watched a lot of animation, and the animation that I don't ever hate is Pixar. In fact, I quite like it. Nemo is a delicious new beginning for them - dealing with parenting and family. Love the humor as always and the pace and the visuality - everything. More female characters wouldn't be terrible of course yadda yadda...Anyway, given that it came out in May 2003, and the main character is named Marlin, how obvious was it that Florida would win the 2003 World Series!?!?? Clearly there's some sort of force at work here - all that positive karma attached itself to that bunch of pretty good guys in Miami.

He tugged and pulled at my arm in pure delight. It was just wonderful! This is a must see movie for the whole family and a definate buy for the collection!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For the kids, mainly","review":"Adults usually write the reviews here so from an adult perspective, this film is not as rich as Monsters nor the Toy Story films. Those had many in jokes and adult themed gags. I would say that Nemo is entertaining enough to see once, maybe twice, but adults will tire of it soon.Kids are another matter. It is cute, colorful, and entertaining. My only caution is that my son didn't like the lost mom and separation from dad plots. Most of us grew up on Disney films which always had lost parents though. I don't expect it to cause any major trauma, but more sensitive kids will be sad during those parts. The humor is gentle and okay for tots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!!","review":"I have waited to get this on blu ray since the first time I saw it!!

A soaring triumphant film!","review":"My whole family loves this movie. My older boy (a toddler) just jumps up and down during some scenes. We have the little toys that came with the meals at one of the fast food places. He knows everyone's name! He pretends like he's swimming around the house. He dances and says OOOh OOh ah just like in the initiation scene in the fishtank everytime the bath water runs. The animation is stupefying. There are some scenes that I believe are flat out real pictures and not animation. That's how good this is. The colors are unbelievably vivid. The storyline has enough twists and turns to keep a hula hoop up. The characters are believable and likeable. This is a good choice.

Neither one of my kids are particularly skittish, but a mom and siblings eaten by sharks, a kidnapped kid and very scary sharks chasing the main characters was WAY too much for them. I don't think they made it past 30 minutes into the movie. I'm very sorry that I didn't preview it before allowing them to watch it.

Vegetarian sharks? Wonderful idea! A dentist that inflicts mahem on his patients? Ah my childhood nightmares take flight again! The world's dummest fish as a companion? Hilarious!Yes this film has its moments and the animation is quite first class.But if you want to see how a cartoon made for kids can appeal to adults, try \\"Ice Age\\". For me the humor in \\"Ice Age\\" was far more sophisticated and endearing to adults.Nemo wins out for animation but for a compact, well told story without a minute of waste, it just doesn't compare to \\"Ice Age\\". Overall I rate Nemo as a young kid's movie that parents can chuckle over. Much better than Monsters Inc which was really just a one-joke flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for three year olds","review":"i don't know why Disney movies seem to need to kill off the mother - it's as if kids can't dream of a big life if their mom's around... but it starts with Nemo's mom being eaten, then Nemo's in danger, my 3 year old couldn't take it - she's a kid with anxiety though so, maybe a normal kid who watches a lot of bright loud t.v. would have no problem...Heck just turn of the t.v. and give the kid a book!

You've probably already read about the baracuda eating Nemo's mom and all his siblings in the first 15 minutes of the movie. I can't say that was as disturbing to the kids as it was to me - they were all confused as to what was going on and didn't get it. However, there is one shock after another in this film. From the sharks to the dentist performing root canal work, to the sadistic little girl that Nemo is to be given to, none of the kids in my group liked the film.I think Disney tried to hard to make an action-packed film and forgot that there can be action without the fear factor (think Toy Story 2)The two stars I gave it are for the graphics -- superior as usual, and Ellen DeGeneres' portrayl of Dorrie, the forgetful fish who helps Nemo's dad find him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas gift","review":"This is a Christmas gift, but I enjoyed the one I saw.

(But it's okay...the movie has a happy ending! :c) )Nemo is so cute with his lucky fin and he reminds me of human children who want to push the envelope with their parents. This is a movie the most people are going to enjoy.

As a father, grandfather, and great grandfather I could so identify with the lesson of having to allow my children to find their own way yet being there for them as they ventured out. I even felt I had lost them for a while but eventually I found them again. The movie told my story really and I'm sure many parents felt the same identity. I've always felt movies are some of the greatest theraputic media available and this one certainly has that if the viewer is open to it.

While Marlin and Dory follow his trail, Nemo becomes acquainted with the other fish in the dentist's office tank and learns that he is destined to become a gift for the dreaded \\"fish-killer\\" Darla, the dentist's niece.Though ostensibly a children's film, there is plenty here to engage adults as well. The computer animation is magnificent; the colors and textures of the seascape and its inhabitants are gorgeous. The story itself is rather touching and includes many jokes and references that will go right over the heads of little ones but will be appreciated by the adults in the room."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best movie....","review":"Finding Nemo is definatly one of the greatest Disney And Pixar movies I've seen so far. The movie is great for younger kids as well as older people. The actors voices fit the characters very well. Ellen Degenerse is the voice of Dory the blue fish, she does a wounderful job. She really brings the Dory th life. The whole movie is really funny. At times I think the movie could of been a little bit better like there could of been more about when Nemo after he got saved. Or when the other fish excape from the fish tank. Overall the movie was great. I would recommend this movie to people of all ages. The way that the movie comes together is really cool. One of the best parts is when Marlin and Dory meet the squirt and the other turtles. Squirt is the baby turtle and he is cute and funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kinda funny...heart warming","review":"I heard so many good compliments on this movie. It was a buzz for a very long time. The bad thing about this is that my hopes get too high but all in all it was pretty funny and I enjoyed watching it. A great disney!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD great opportunity to avoid \\"scary\\" parts for 2 year old.","review":"Most of the upsetting scenes for my 2 year old daughter occur in the beginning of the film...the mother is eaten, Nemo is kidnapped, and the father is chased by a large shark. But the rest of the movie is absolutely wonderful and very entertaining for her. I like that the dvd has scene selection. We simply start up the movie for her after the \\"scary\\" scenes, and we haven't had to worry about nightmares."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful underwater fairytale!","review":"Finding Nemo is a wonderful underwater fairytale - unique in that it is one of those few movies that fully lives up to the hype it has received. The animation is incredible - you feel like you are right there under the sea with them! The voice acting is superb and you get the sense that the actors really put themselves into the mindset of the characters they are playing. The story captures both the attention of young and old, mixing humor and drama equally as a desperate father teams up with a quirky, crazy new friend in a search for his lost son.If you are a fan of classics like \\"The Little Mermaid\\" and \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" then you will love \\"Finding Nemo\\". The primary difference (that in my opinion makes the story better) is that there really is no \\"bad guy\\" trying to foil the main character - he just has to overcome the overwhelming odds against him in his search. It's a truly delightful story for both young and old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finding Nemo~~~~WOW","review":"Wow, Finding Nemo was awesome! I am a bit too old for it, but that didn't stop me from begging my mom to make me take my little brother (wink, wink!)!!! The animation was amazing and the voices cute! I saw Finding Nemo 3 times in the theater!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finding Nemo - 4.5 / 5","review":"Another huge success for the folks over at Pixar, Finding Nemo is a delightful film that should be enoyable for everyone. If you've seen other Pixar movies, it won't surprise you to find that the humor can be enjoyed by viewers of all ages. Kids will love it, most teens not too worried about being cool will enjoy it, and any adult with children should find it entertaining as well. Another fantastic movie for the entire family."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good, fun cartoon.","review":"This is a cute show. It's amazing, but my 6 month old, baby girl LOVES this show. I'm sure it is only for the bright colors, etc... but it's fun to watch her look at all the shapes and colors. I quite enjoy the movie myself. It does have adult humor, but none that I find offensive to small children. If you think your children are being corrupted, you're overestimating their comprehension a tad bit. There is a reason why this is the best seller. IT's a fun movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute...","review":"My son and I saw this movie in the theaters and also saw it again when it came out on DVD...loved it...the animation was top notch, and the charaters were so likable...for those that think that this movie was scary...or boring, dont really know entertainment.

After the first 10 minutes the freeze-framing seems to have stopped, and it could play.The story is overall OK, although it's definitely a kid's movie.But I was really surprised that Pixar included a scene that trivializes aboriginal culture (aboriginal in this case pacific islander). There's an 'initiation' scene that is right out of a tacky B&W; comedy. I can only imagine what a child might infer from it, and it diminishes the overall message of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"unable to view on any of our equipment","review":"Wish someone had told us we would not be able to play on any of our American equipment.

Another feel good movie about a poor little tyke who manages to, against incredible odds, rise above it all and save/inspire everyone!!! Now, I will admit that my 10 year old like it. But she's 10!The story line is so old. And I'm sick of movies that Anthropomorphize animals. They are so beautiful and aweinspiring in their own right. To learn about salt water fish, take your kids to a good aquarium and teach them what animals are really like, and what they truly need to survive: a clean ocean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This movie just grates on me. The casting was terrible, Ellen's voice makes my head want to explode, the turtle is a completely useless character and this movie is NOT FUNNY!

Rent Shrek instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the fish's name is 'Gill'...","review":"Okay, naming one of the fish's 'Gill' is so basic, and lazy, and just flat-out pathetic. Hey! Kind of like the movie itself! That's like calling an elephant 'Trunk', or a tiger 'Stripes'... uh oh, I'm giving Pixar more ideas for their NEXT \\"masterpiece\\". I know what to expect. Some kid being lost and someone trying to save him and get him back to his family. Case in point, Finding Nemo is basically just chase after chase after chase after chase after CHASE! Guess it's tough being a fish. They need to get Nemo back to his dad! Much like the monsters had to get Boo back to her family in Monsters Inc. Much like the Sloth and Mammoth had to get the baby back to it's family in Ice Age (non-Pixar movie). Much like the toys getting back to Andy in Toy Story. Much like... oh well, you get the point. Oh yeah, wasn't Dinosaur about getting someone back to its family too? Heh. Lame and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finding Nemo","review":"This DVD was delivered.

(SAD MOVIE)","review":"Although I've seen and enjoyed every Pixar film so far I have to say Nemo dissapointed me. This is certainly a sad story, a lonely story about loss which I don't find appropiate for kids. I don't remember anyone dying in any of the previous PIXAR movies and they were still great movies, so why putting the idea of death and loss in the children's mind? Children should laugh and enjoy and we adults should try to let them enjoy thier chilhood and protect them from sadness. There'll be plenty of time for that when they grow up. Visually the movie is great and some of the special features are worth watching too but the storyline is far from being funny. Grab yourself any of the TOY STORIES instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finding Nemo - movie wouldn't play","review":"we couldn't get the movie to play at all.

I give it 5plus stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Dad Movie","review":"Our family loves Pixar movies. These days, when even Disney movies have questionable things in them, every Pixar movie so far has been great. \\"Nemo\\" is an all-around great movie, but our very favorite part of it is the portrayal of Marlin, Nemo's dad. Dads are rarely portrayed in movies as loving, responsible, etc. if they're even present at all (there's no dad in the \\"Toy Story\\" movies, for example). \\"Nemo\\" is a terrific portrayal of a single dad who's single for an acceptable reason (widower, not divorced or never married) who loves his child, takes responsibility for him, and is totally devoted to him. Even if the rest of the movie weren't so good, I would recommend it solely on the basis of this aspect of the movie. We rarely go out to the movies, but we took our kids to see this one twice in the first month it was out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"Tgis is a great movie for kids.

Pixar is raising the bar as usual. The writing is top notch. Excellent voice acting by Ellen D. Looking for racial downturns.... hiss. Lighten up my friend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Pixar great","review":"I thought this film was terrific. It's a rare film that explores things like the fish in the sea and how they live and interact. In this film, Nemo can't seem to understand his father, and ends up being caught by a fisherman. Now the quest is on for Nemo's father to find him, and boy does he do everything to find him. I think this movie should be watched by everyone. It really shows just what a parent will do to help their child. Excellent!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I found Nemo...and the best animation project ever!","review":"I absolutely almost always hate animated movies, but every so often one will catch my eye (Shrek and now Nemo) and I'll have to watch. I must say...hats off to the Disney and Pixar studios who put this one together because you did a fantastic job! This film is filled with lovable characters (the turtles, Dory, Marlin, Bruce, and of course Nemo) and witty dialogue that is great for all ages. The plot keeps us strumming along as we follow an uptight and very nervous father on his journey with the hilarious Dory on their search for a little clown fish named Nemo. Highly enjoyable and great fun for the whole family!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!!!","review":"I really enjoyed this movie, right from the start. The animation was great and all the bright underwater scenes really put on a great setting. The story is easy to fallow for young children, but some parts are slow and could bore you easily. Some of the \\"jokes\\" werent that great either. I think they tried too hard to make this movie a comedy and it just turned out flat at some parts. Overall this movie was good though. It has more good qualities than bad, and of course I was overjoyed to get this on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"This movie is hilarious, one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time.

The story line was encompassing and taught lessons to children and adults alike. I cannot sit through the movie one time without commenting at the end about how wonderful the story line could touch so many aspects of life and emotion.When I purchased the DVD I was even more amazed about the extras. There were hours and hours of information about the making of the movie as well as educational aspects of the types of fish and other animals that were represented in the movie. There were also games and and things for children to read and learn about current ocean issues like pollution.A great buy for any member of the family."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Review Haiku by Todd Marrone","review":"Real, light-hearted funfor kids and adults alike,the seagulls are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this movie","review":"I love this movie and in 3D it was amazing.

When I saw the previews for Finding Nemo, I couldn't wait to see it. I finally saw it in the movies with my dad and my best friend, and I LOVED it! The computer animation and colors were beautiful! The voices were perfect, and the story was cute. The movie starts out with a young clownfish named Marlin (Albert Brooks) with his wife Coral who are parents-to-be. Suddenly, a baracuda attacks, and eats Coral and the rest of the eggs except for one: Nemo. Marlin takes care of Nemo on his own, and is very protective of his son. But soon, Nemo is kidnapped by divers! Marlin desperetly tries to find Nemo with the help of his new friend, Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) who has short term memory loss, and the adventure begins...~~~~~~Will Marlin and Dory find Nemo?

All the fish had great their own unique greatness.The DVD features are excellent. I only have the FS version of the film because I split the DVD with my sister (neice and nephew). I ususally go for the WS but in this case FS is better because it doesn't cut anything out. In my high school this movie is well known for a Disney movie.

Caught in open water by humans and off to a dentists aquarium.Marlin then starts the long search to find him, meeting up with soom interesting charcters along the way. The most induring and nearly scene stealing is of his forgetful companion, Dory, voiced by Allen deGeneris. She comes accross really well.Nemo finds himself trapped but with new friends and soon plots an escape.The team at Pixar have really excelled and it is such a shame that it takes so long to make this type of animated movie.

I saw another person on a different site complaining about the same problem on the DVD disk. Very disappointed in Disney trying to save a few pennies at the customers expense. Typical America business pratice today. As far as the 3D portion, it was good to watch the movie again after such a long time but I expected more our of Disney for the 3D portion. I want items to pop out of the screen and very few times did that happen. If you do not own Nemo and want to buy it though I would recommend buying the 3D version over the reguler version.

Unlike the previous Disney/Pixar efforts, this one isn't even remotely interesting. The writers, from the looks of it, probably spent too much time working on the plot, and as a result it feels MUCH lacking, even moreso than A Bugs Life. Not to mention that the film could have been ended a LOT earlier had they cut some of the uneeded parts out. The jokes just aren't funny, and it's not for kids, as some parts will more than likely make them cry. The visuals are decent, I guess, they're typical of what Pixar's been doing, no more, no less. Overall, this is a very bad Disney film, and a disappointing Pixar film. If you really need a Pixar movie, I suggest the Toy Story movies or even Monsters Inc, or if you just need a CGI movie, Shrek 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finding answers for my kid","review":"Two months after I took my son to see this, he was still asking what happened to Nemo's mom....Too sad that killing parents is still the best they can figure out to make a \\"childrens' movie..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissapointed.","review":"Huge grossing movies are usually far from the best nowadays but I kept hearing no this really is great.

For whatever reason, I grew up with an...uneasiness...around people with handicaps. By the end of the film I was completely oblivious to the fact two of the main characters were physically or mentally challenged. Dora, in fact, was one of the most charming characters I've seen in film recently - animated or not.I also (as a divorced father) greatly appreciated a single FATHER being portrayed as loving and capable.

The graphics are really amazing, and the voices of Albert Brooks and Ellen Degenares are a perfect match for the characters they play. The producers did a really incredible job in putting together a story that is engaging, fun and moving.The other characters are great, including my personal favorite the sea turtle (a dead ringer for Spicoli in Fast Times), the other fish in the tank with Nemo, and the sea gulls with their \\"mine, mine, mine, mine\\" calls. Too funny.A great film for the whole family, although little ones may find some of the scenes a bit too intense. My two year old was scared in a couple of scenes. Overall though, a home run for Disney on this one!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor streaming quality","review":"My 3-yr old son often asks to watch movies from Amazon instant video but the result is always frustrating: chopped video and interruptions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of Scary and Predictable","review":"At the beginning of the film, a barracuda devours Nemo's mother and all his siblings. Only his father and the unhatched Nemo are left. The deaths are not shown, but the great emptiness afterward is. More scares follow, as Nemo ventures off the safe reef and is scooped up by a huge scuba diver looming like a cliff.Supporting characters are more annoying than funny. The end is completely predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Purchase","review":"I ordered this DVD for my grandchild and when it arrived, it would not play on my DVD - it's from a different region of the wolrd.

But have you noticed that Disney movies for children seem to always bump off one of the parents? Try to name more than one (101 Dalmations is one) where they don't kill a parent. They are for some reason against the family unit as a whole.This movie is great otherwise! It has us in tears laughing. The talking whale, \\"intervention\\" with the sharks, \\"You made me ink myself.\\" There are tons of lines!

Then it would go to something that would be impossible for any child to understand. This made the movie to hard to follow. The only real entertaining part of the movie was Dori the fish because she was extremely funny. Also the beginning was good, but it was far too much for children to handle."},{"rating":"1","title":"G Rating Very Inappropriate","review":"A G rating of film implies that it is appropriate for all ages. This movie includes a scene of Nemo's mother and all of his siblings being killed. Next, he is captured and his father, who has been too traumatized by his wife's killing to even leave his home, has to find his son and save him before Nemo is killed. Although this movie is lovely to look at and is funny for adults at times, it is irresponsible to tell parents to show it to their young children. In addition to the violent death of Nemo's family and his own impending doom, there are other violent and scary images in this movie that young children should not see. My child told me after the movie that he was very scared. I am giving this movie one star because it was irresponsibly marketed to young children and their families and given a rating that was inappropriate for the subject matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST MOVIE EVER!!!!","review":"THIS MOVIE IS SO BAD THAT IT GIVES ME NIGHTMARES ABOUT CLOWNFISHES. THE MAIN CHARACTER NEMO IS A MUTATED FAILURE FISH WHO CANNOT SWIM AND HAS A FIN SMALLER THAN THE OTHER ONE. ALSO, THE CHARACTER OF DORRY IS MENTALLY RETARDED AND SHE IS WHACKED IN THE HEAD WITH A BASEBALL BAT. THE JOURNEY TO FIND NEMO IS THE LAMEST THING I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

Ellen Degeneres is amazing as Dora a forgetful but ever caring fish who teaches Marlin (Nemo's dad) to live again after he has experienced much loss and tragedy.Their travels bring them many places including a 12 step meeting for sharks (Hilarious, espescially if you are in recovery)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MOVIE WORTH SEA-ING!","review":"This is one fantastic animated movie! Perfect for all ages.It looks incredible in HD, if you have a bigscreen t.v."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nemo, YOU ROCK!!!","review":"What in the hell was that reviewer doing complaining about violence in this movie? Have they even played a video game or watched their local news? If they're referring to Nemo's mother getting killed, well, (1) you don't see anything graphic and (2) death is a part of life. Anyways, Nemo is a great film, you should know that by now. This dvd really is fantastic as well. I highly recommend all of Pixar's movies (Toy Story, Toy Story 2, A Bug's Life, Monsters, Inc.); they're just fabulous. One last thought . . has anyone wondered what is UP with Disney nowadays?!

In fact, the only good part for me was when the little girl walks in and the Psycho theme plays. If you want to see an outstanding Disney/Pixar film, see The Incredibles, it was actually entertaining. I know my view doesn't count for much, seeing as how everyone else absolutly loves this movie, just keep in mind, it really isn't all it's cracked up to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"It says I own it but...","review":"This review is more about Amazon than the movie, which is fantastic. 4 Stars! Well, I guess I should have researched this before buying, but then again why should I when there is an option to \\"buy\\" this item, which is what I chose. After my purchase, I found myself looking for the \\"Download\\" button so I can view this movie I now \\"own\\" on the device of my choice. To my dismay, there is no way to download movies from Amazon. I just assumed this would be possible, since I can do so with music I buy on Amazon. I don't get it.

It worked twice and then after it is saying it is a unreadable disc. Not exactly sure why it worked at first but I tried it in 2 different players and it no longer works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad and Scary for little ones","review":"The film begins with the murder of the mother fish and 399 of the 400 unhatched babies. Only dad and one egg (Nemo) survies. So already, children feel the fear of abandomnemt and the horror of the realization that mom and/or dad can die and leave them without a parent. This theme continues throughout the film, with Nemo being kidnapped by humans becuase he didn't listen to his dad, and both Nemo and dad facing deadly circumstances and several incidents when the audience is supposed to believe that one or the other is dead or greviously injured. The animation is beautiful and the voices well-acted, but the mildly humorous aspects within the film are greatly overshadowed with sadness and grief and abandonment issues. (Not to mention reinforcing the sterotypical fear of dentists.) I would NOT recommend this film for young children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent before you Buy","review":"I am a big fan of Pixar Animation Studios' films(Monster's Inc., A Bug's Life and Toy Story), but this one does not reach the same comedic level as those that came before it.The humor is really limited to a green sea turtle (who lasts in the movie for 5 minutes) and a few short conversations between Ellen Degeneris' character and different species of animals throughout the ocean.I am not a big Ellen fan, but she was definitely the highpoint of this film's humor. The main character was just kind of flat, and didn't really give Ellen the platform to be as funny as she could have been as the color commentator sidekick.Don't get left high and dry, rent before purchasing. You won't miss it.The DVD has some really cool features, including (but not limited to) both widescreen and fullscreen renditions of the movie.A tour through the Pixar Animation studios (led by Nemo's real life counterpart).And you can turn your tv into a fishtank."},{"rating":"2","title":"how can Finding Nemo be a G movie!","review":"Finding Nemo was a great movie. Ellen as Dory and Albert Brooks as Marlin were a histerical team,but some scenes in this movie were panacking(including some parts of when Nemo was trying to escape). I cant believe why MPAA rated this movie G it had to be at least a PG movie. This is propably not the best movie for sensitive little children but still a good flick, and this is propably not the best Disney movie Disney Studios has made. Even some horror movies are least panacking then this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Finding Nemo","review":"Finding Nemo is a story that everyone would love. Makes my Hubby and I feel like kids again. 3D makes the underwater adventure so much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four stars for the long wait","review":"There is no doubt that the Bluray version of Finding Nemo is outstanding in regards to video and audio quality. The extras are ok but not out of this world. However I am giving this disk a 4 star review simply for the fact that Pixar and Disney waited so long to release it. Wehave seen the standard def version so many times that by the time this arrived it was less enjoyable.Having said that, this version is of outstanding quality and would make a great gift for any Pixar fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nemo's Mom Died Which Really Makes Me Mad!","review":"Melissa Smith, I hate animal violence too. I think that the character Coral is the most beautiful creation in the film and it's really bad that that beautiful creation was killed at the very beginning of the film. Not only does Nemo's mom, Coral die, but his brothers and sisters, Marlin Junior and Coral Junior die too. The only member of Nemo's family that survives is Marlin, his father. This movie has too much animal violence in it. Even more than you say, Melissa Smith. Coral was perhaps the only female creation I like in this movie, any of the others did not look so pretty, like Dory. She is not a cutesie, Coral is, but no other female in this film looks as cute as she. So sad. Disney and Pixar did do better than this, notably Toy Story and A Bug's Life. That crazy old fish ate up Coral and the kids who were going to be Nemo's brothers and sisters and I don't like it. Bad Clown-fish-eating fish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finding the Tylenol","review":"I had never seen this movie when it was out in theaters and my wife and I usually buy every Disney movie that comes out on DVD, so we bought it thinking it would be another cute entertaining movie like the rest. Oh boy were we wrong.I cannot tell you how incredibly boring this movie was. I am normally a big Albert Brooks fan but his character voice over was annoying. I fully anticipated Ellen's voice over to be annoying (she is annoying in real life). Every time she spoke I wanted some painkillers to ease the pain of the incredible headache it gave me (especially the whale imitation scene, yikes!)The story was lacking, I didn't care about the characters. I was ready for the shark to come along and eat them all so the movie would be over.Well, just like with Lord of the Rings, I am but one of about 10 people in the world that thought this movie was horrible. No shame in that, I actually like movies that have an engaging plot and interesting characters. Funny me I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"The first time I saw this movie I'll admit I liked it. But when I watched it for a second time, I realized what an awful movie it is. It was just so boring. I couldn't stand to watch it. And it really makes no sense. I mean, fish don't really care that much for their offspring. They lay tons of eggs, and some die. It just annoyed me how the fish were acting like people. And what's the deal, with the sharks not eating fish? What else would they eat? They survive off of fish. Ugh. I don't understand how so many people can like this. I really hate this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"DENTIST SHOULD SAY SOMETHING! ! ! ! ! ! ! !","review":"I'M VERY CONCERN ABOUT THE IMAGE THAT THIS MOVIE SHOW ABOUT THE DENTISTS. DOES ANYBODY CARE ABOUT THE MESSAGE THE WRITTERS OF THIS MOVIE ARE SENDING TO OUR KIDS? WE ARE TALKING ABOUT PART OF OUR HEALTH.

DENTIST SHOULD SAY SOMETHING!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too American","review":"I, Robby Genepri, have languished long and hard while critiquing this film through and through for any revolting gratuitous cartoon violence. After finding little to boot, I must admit that I am still taken aback by the sheer audacity of Disney to release a cartoon film that encourages fish to fend for themselves. I feel it incumbent upon the cartoon industry to underscore the increasing importance of interdependence, or collectivism, if you will. Nemo, in his despicable American individualism, sours the taste in my Marxist socialist palate."},{"rating":"2","title":"The First Pixar Academy Award Movie!!!","review":"This movie is one of the best disney pixar movie ever invented and the first pixar movie that won an academy award, it contains a whole fun for anyone of any age.

Our son (9) loves it just as much as my husband and I do. If your child gets scared easily there are a couple of scenes that might frighten them a little, watch for the shark scenes. They start out ok, but then the sharks start chasing and it's a bit intense for kids who are easily scared. My son was ok with it after seeing it a couple of times and learning what to expect though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe it's me","review":"Okay, don't laugh, but I thought this was one of the scariest movies that I've ever seen. I spent the whole time clutching my boyfriend's arm. Meanwhile, the 7 year old on the other side of me was laughing his head off and having a great time. So maybe it is just me.The movie is a Pixar film, so obviously it's brilliant. Great animation (the reef at the begining), great writing, great story, great characters. The beauty of the animation must be seen to be believed. Hopefully it will also teach kids a lesson about taking care of their pets.If your child (or you) does get scared easily, you might want to procede with caution. It's obvious that it's going to have a happy ending... but it's a bumpy ride getting there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmm...","review":"Animation is superb, but the story did not work in some places even with the necessary suspension of disbelief."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but it could've been better","review":"I thought this movie was a very fun movie to watch plus it had great animated special effects. I just didn't think it was as good as some other movies that Pixar had done in the past like Monsters Inc. or Toy Story 2. Mainly because there wasn't as much humor in this movie as some other animated movies that I've seen. Some of the scenes in this movie were funny, but not many. Also I'm not a really big fan of Albert Brooks or Ellen DeGeneres. But if your looking for a movie that is good for the youngsters to see, this is a good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too expensive","review":"This is whats wrong with movies today. $33 dollars for a movie!

People wonder why piracy is rampant, well this is why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disney does it again!","review":"Definitely one of the best Disney films I have seen in years. Personally I felt Disney had been going downhill after The Lion King, give or take a few, but Finding Nemo is an EXCELLENT movie! I got it for my daughter, who loves it,but my husband and I were both equally entertained. Nemo is a handicap fish (one fin is smaller than the other) who gets taken by a fisherman as an addition to his fish collection and his over-protective, worry-wort father, Marlin, swims all the way across the ocean with help of a new friend Dory (Ellen Degenerous) to get his son back. It a beautiful story about father and son, the lengths that any parent will go to in order to protect their children, lessons in differences, and lessons in learning how to let go. Kids will love it for the goofiness and undersea visuals, adults will love it for the heart warming story and underlying jokes. No DVD or Disney collection will be complete without this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Exciting And Interesting!!!","review":"I was taking a nap the other day while my master was watching this. Pretty soon the movie had my undivided attention. I know it was a cartoon and all, but the underwater world is a world that dogs just don't get to see. The movie was so well done and looked so realistic (I am assuming anyway) that I almost couldn't follow the story, but the story was great anyway. If the folks at the Pixar studios ever do a story about dogs, you can bet I'll see it (I just wish theaters would let dogs in so I don't have to wait until they come out on video)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This movie was so funny!

While my family loved Toy Story and a Bug's Life, we were unanimous in giving this film a \\"blah\\". The animation is very well done, but the characters are uninteresting, there is no chemistry be tween them and the plot is one long wandering effort, ultimately unsuccessful, to bring in other minor characters in an attempt to bring some interest to the film.Dory's memory problem is annoying and brings nothing to the story. The best part of the film are the characters in the aquarium, but that is damning with faint praise.If you are older than 8, find a better way to waste a couple hours of your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did anyone else notice the little anti-American remark?","review":"It happens when our two fish heroes are hauled to that shark \\"ten-step\\" meeting, Nemo's father tell about what happened to his son, that he was taken by human divers.

Luckily , I caught it last night on the Disney channel and I relived those unforgettable and funny moments all over again. My son was born in 2003 , and this was the first film that I took him to see. So , yes , I am very partial to it. The script is highly creative and improved alot by the actors and it supports layers of interesting dialog and situations for the characters. The plot is simple and easily understandable for children. \\" Finding Nemo \\" reminds me of those programs like the original Three Stooges, Bugs Bunny and Tom and Jerry , in the sense, that children and adults, alike, will find this film ,highly entertaining. There's been alot of filmmnakers trying to capture the same essence of \\" Finding Nemo\\". However , they have failed to capture both the adult element and children element. However , Pixar has captured this essence and balanced it perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie so totally rocks!","review":"From the very begining, as every Disney Pixar movie does, Finding Nemo touches your heart. This is a very heart warming wonderful tale of a clown fish boy and his father, who go through two quite magnificent journeys. Along the way they run into some wonderful fun loving characters, who you can really relate to in your own life. This movie is great for the whole family and has something for everyone adventure, action, and plenty of comedy. It has a great all star cast. Finding Nemo will keep you glued to the screen unto the very end. Thank you to Disney and Pixar for another well put together masterpiece!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Must See Movie","review":"I took my three year old to see this movie and he just loved it. He has a problem sitting through movies but when this one came on he was very interested in it. Bruce the Shark, was the only thing that he talked about. After we came home, where ever we went in the car he always told me that Bruce the shark was chasing us. He was really cute about it.

The production value is really bad. The music is okay, kind of relaxing, but the video is so terrible. The camera is shaky at times and the scenes are poorly composed. When the camera isn't shaky, it's panning and zooming at a jerky rate. It's really a shame because you can tell the locations are nice, but the way it was shot is really amateurish and the camera used is of a very low quality. They also didn't keep in any of the sound of the waves or the background...just a few birds chirping. Don't buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"Don't believe the description!!!! This item's description says it's 18 by 22 inches. WHAT A LIE!!!

I am very disappointed that I was misled like this and caused this extra frustration.

His tone is condescending and patronizing toward both Halliday and the reader, which instantly makes you dislike the book. Beyond that, the insights that are in the book are vague, not well argued/supported and very abstract. This book does not open you to thinking about poetry, but rather attempts to lecture you on a single viewpoint that's incomprehensible.

Great preset functions with my mac printing dialog box.Pros: fast, cheap, networked, auto duplex, easy presetsCons: loud, can't fill the paper tray because pickup mechanism can't pick it up, and tonor light comes on too early (see other comments for how to bypass this problem with the tonor)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple to set up, pleasant to use","review":"What I liked best is that this was trivial to set up. Put in the toner cartridge, and connect to the network, and hit add printer on my OS X 10.5.5 box. Ignore all the driver disks, etc., it just works.I use this primarily for text. The text is great. One other review commented on banding of photos, and I do see some of that. So not recommended if your primary use is photo printing. But if you just want an easy to use, fast, duplexing printer for text, this is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best choice","review":"This is the first product I own from Brother. The defect is that the printer do not detect paper once the paper gets to about half. Its a defect within the paper tray(does not push up), it also clicks after printing. I also know another purchaser that had similar problems.I would send it back to the manufacture to get it fixed, but shopping fees for this big item would be costly, so I just keep the level of paper really high. Also I can't spare a few weeks without a printer.I'd think twice about ordering this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the delivery estimate","review":"I ordered one of these on April 11th. After missing the original 5 week delivery estimate, Amazon requested an extension with a new delivery estimate of June 20 - July 11th.

Why? Simply because there are far more clips of Oistrakh that were worthy of inclusion, including the entire Brahms concerto, Locatelli Labyrinth, Sibelius Concerto, Khachaturian Concerto, numerous Kreisler pieces, etc... Those clips were, to my mind, a good deal more interesting than most of the offerings on this well-photographed, well-restored, and all-round decent DVD.

The MAIN problem and the reason why I'm giving this item ONE star is the fact that even with a PERFECT connection, the audio quality STILL cuts in and out on SkypeOut calls! There's no reason for that and it makes the concept completely pointless. It cuts in and out with EVERYONE that I've spoken to.

The plot is nicely complex, yet the story is driven by interesting and well delineated characters, as you expect in a Burke novel. And as usual, Burke manages to convey a sense of the physical setting of his story. This makes for a nice contrast between pristine natural beauty and the evil men do in its midst. At the end of the book, we are left pondering the true state of Wyatt Dixon's psyche. I recommend this novel to all, and especially Burke fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"James Lee Burke has become a wimp","review":"In his latest book, James Lee Burke has put together a wimpy, dog tired plea for the ecology that goes nowhere. He has become part of the problem because in his wrap up he simply points out that the good guys never win. The major villain who I believeis patterned after Dick Cheney goes on to continue bribing officials and getting just what he wants for the Oil Industry Lobby or whatever and Burke says that you can't stop them with a bullet and there's always one to replace them if they go down. In fiction, we should see the good guy win, even if it's only on paper, to be reminded of the way things should be. With his wimpy, liberal crying attitude, Mr. Burke simply fosters the idea that that's the way it should be.But Mr. Mabus should die for his sins. The criminals should pay for their crimes and any wimp who can't pull the trigger on themshould never make it to print."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the Moon of the Red Ponies","review":"Let me preface this review by saying up front, that I have read all of the Dave Robicheau and Billy Bob Holland novels, plus some of the other books that Mr.Burke has written.

When did you swing so far left of center?This book is another example of Burke's recent endless rambling without much substance to back it up. I don't know what the cause for this departure from his normally descriptive and interesting prose is, but It seems that Burke is trying tosee if he can start pumping out colorless drivel and still get paid. Shame on him.I only wish I could get a refund on the book.

Billy Bob (I still can't get over that name, is anyone really named Billy Bob?) can't wake up in the morning without describing for rentless paragraphs the sound of the crickets, the smell of the forest, the rushing of the stream, the crack of a broken limb, the...well you get the point. Now a little local color can certainly add to a novel, particularly one set in Montana, but enough James Lee, is enough.There really isn't enough plot to make this book worth reading, let alone buying. I am from Massachusetts and somewhat liberal, but I have to agree with other reviewers, Burke went way over the line with the political commentary in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the blood of vast rightwing conspiracy","review":"i have read and paid opening price for the great majority of mr.burkes books.i consider myself a true fan;however,if he continues the leftwing drivel and victomhood presented in his recent work,i shall have to put him in the trash heap with poor old willie nelson and the rest of the libs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Billy Bob and Temple just can't cut it","review":"Having become a James Lee Burke junkie over the last year, I couldn't wait to read \\"Moon\\". What a disappointment. Billy Bob and Temple in Montana just can't compare to Dave and Bootsie in Louisiana! The action wanes when it needs to wax - and Cletus is no where around to spice it up. If you like the Bayou stories, I'm afraid the Bitteroot Mountains won't elicit quite the same reading anticipation."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"James Lee Burke's thrillers, whether they revolve around Dave Robicheaux or Billy Bob Holland, are written to an unvarying formula: a tightly-wound hero convinced of his own morality encounters flawed and self-destructive people from his past who involve him in a struggle with evil forces. Though the hero attempts to ward off trouble by self-righteous rudeness to all around him, he is inevitably drawn into the vortex that leads to a deadly redemption for the figure from the past and a dose of rueful wisdom for our hero. Though this formula has worked for him before, Burke goes to the well once too often in his latest novel.\\"In the Moon of Red Ponies\\" was clearly written in some haste with little concern for plot. The author's anger at politicians and corporations makes this effort more like an eco-terrorist's recruitment tract than a novel that cres about its readers. Pity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formulaic BS","review":"I've read several of the earlier Robicheaux novels, and liked them. Sorry, Mr. Burke, but it seems you've degenerated into turning out pap to pay for your ranch in Montana.Poorly developed and unbelievable characters, overloaded with trite prose about the Montana scenery and Indian/Christian hokum. I'm disappointed, sir."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing read","review":"This is my first Burke novel, and it was extremely disappointing. I didn't like the characters--they were stupid, psychotic, or shallow--some all of the above. The storyline was not well defined in my opinion. The main character, Billy Bob, was dumb as a box of rocks. Myself, being a lawyer, I take offense when an author creates a lawyer-character this stupid. Neither, did he have any loyalty to his clients. He posted the bond for Johnny, which in the real world is unethical. His client, Johnny, had no loyalty to anyone, other than maybe Amber. To sum it up, this was a book filled with unlikeable characters. Darrel, with all his foibles, was probably the only honorable character in the book. I doubt I read another Burke novel. If I can find one on CD, I would probably listen to it. The book did hold my attention, and for that I give it 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"We need the real Burke back","review":"I am a huge Burke fan, having read virtually all that he has written. This book and the previous one for that matter are decided drop offs from previous work. The story, plot, his fascinating sentences are just not up to his previous works. I used to read his books slowly to just enjoy the dialogue and the fellings his stories evoke. I read this book just to be finished so I could go on to something else. Read his early books they are brilliant, some of the best books I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing with weak ending.","review":"I agree with the comments by tobyheaton. Billy Bob, the protagonist, comes across as weak, moralizing and unctuous. I felt like I was reading serial short stories, each ending with an introspective, hoped for insightful fade out. There is an absence of any humor or lightness (unlike, e.g., Elmore Leonard or Robert Parker). The heavy tone unrelenting. The Robicheaux series is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writing because he can","review":"I've read just about everything Burke has written and this is one of the worst. The various parts just don't fit together and I found myself drumming my fingers and wishing it would just end. I suppose the good news is that it did. More and more the author has his main characters wallowing in self analysis and contemplating their navels at great length. If you like that you like it but there's too much of it for me. In addition the plot is kind of pasted together and imparts no belief that it could happen as written or that it makes sense. And the actions of the protagonist become increasingly tiresome. Enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Intro Level Statistics Book","review":"This is a great introductory statistics book, for students who are taking beginning level stats courses.

The first two, \\"house of Cards\\" and \\"to play the king\\" were good, altho the second one with Michael Kitchen should have foretold the left wing bias coming in the third. The ending of \\"The Final Cut\\" was rather disappointing and seemed as if they just couldn't think of any way to end the thing and took the easy---and laughable---way out. A majour disappointment to say the least and not at all believable.If you get the chance, at least watch the first one, \\"house of cards\\" and perhaps the second \\"to play the king\\"(only for the great michael kitchen) and leave it at that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nobody does it like the Brits","review":"Ian Richardson is perfectly cast in his role of deceit, manipulation, ego, and power.

Ian Richardson is incredible in this BBC production. All the actors are top notch. Politicians in this production are ruthless, sexy, and self promoting. Ian Richardson's Francis Uehrquardt will stop at nothing to gain his post. His wife isn't far behind. The ending is unbelieveable.

And who better to introduce us to the intrigues of the world's greatest Parliment and British politics? The ambitions and power of a passed over chief whip whose wherewithall to inspire mischief, is unmatched, provides the backdrop for this witty often hilarious and always edgy tale of the man who would be prime minister. It's possible that I was just disappointed that it was coming to an end, but I found the last of the four hour-long sections, Final Cut, a bit lacking. Still. I've watched it three times in a year and given it for presents twice. I highly recomend House of Cards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wicked Fun!","review":"One of the Best political films around, Ian Richardson is at the top of his game.

You can read the description in the editor's note, so I won't go into the storyline. I first saw it on the BBC when it was aired in early nineties, but it is mostly unheard of in the US. But when I showed some of my friends, they emmidately baught the whole set, and also as presents for friends, everyone just LOVED it. Though utterly serious, its also hilarious, we'd rewind the movie and then go over again. Especially the functioning of the parliament is a little unknown here, so knowing some minor details will help.

In fact, it is more like part of the instructions are missing for all of these patterns. I would not suggest this book if the projects that you wish to knit from it are any of the baby sweaters.

It doesn't appear to affect the TV or computers, but the TIVO box seems much more sensitive.

I was deeply disappointed.Firstly, the picture is not an accurate representation of the color of this stapler, it's more fuchsia/purple than it is deep purple.Next, using regular office staples, the stapler got a jam--gathering 2-3 staples at a time--every 10 or so staple punches I did, so I had to open it each time and remove the jam.The final factor was that the effort to punch staples was almost double that of a regular stapler! You also cannot stand it up on its edge, which is a natural way to pick up staplers nowadays. It also does not have the ability to staple with the bottom lip down, so that you can punch onto a bulletin board, for example.Buy a different brand is my recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paper weight. Not a true stapler.","review":"I did not purchase through Amazon but since I buy most of my products here I thought I'd try to save someone from making the same mistake I made.Like most staplers, this one jammed often and then just stopped working. Unfortunatley, it was within the first 10 staples. I returned the product and the replacement is doing the same thing.I believe the spring design that holds the staples into place is flawed and therefore creates the problem. When you load the staples in and push the assembly closed, it locks into place but unlocks when you fold the stapler back over to use it. There is a big plastic casing that prevents you from keeping this locked for \\"stapler mode\\" so the product is rendered useless, unless you need a $20 paperweight and then it would probably work great.This company probably makes other great products but this one needs a little work."},{"rating":"1","title":"GARBAGE, DO NOT BUY!!!!","review":"YOU WOULD THINK FOR THE PRICE IT WOULD LAST.

This thing sees daily use, by teenagers, no less. It has been dropped, pounded on, and generally abused. The first time it fell on the floor, I thought \\"Well, there goes that.\\" But it's worked fine after several drops. It has a nice safety feature. While you can open it up and staple on bulletin boards and such, it will not shoot staples out into the open, as teenagers like to do sometimes. Costwise, it's more than a cheap stapler from the big box store, but the body is mostly metal, with rubber and plastic parts as well. It will staple though at least 15 pages (that's the most I've tried), but I am sure it would do more. Did I mention it's effortless. One finger is plenty of pressure to operate it.

I've put it to the test for nearly a year, stapling hundreds and hundreds of documents, and I've found it really does reliably handle 25 pages, and sometimes even more, with a light, ergonomic squeeze. If you've struggled with stapling thick documents, it's just the greatest thing, the most wonderful simple pleasure, to know you have something that can do the job so you don't have to resort to the dreadedbinder clips.

But Stanley had one up; Robbins' co-wrote the title song on James Lee's disc. While the movie soundtrack may have been the music for the motion picture, James has written a soundtrack for the novel. Music for the theater in your mind.Each of the songs is supposed to be inspired by the book's characters, including a cover of \\"I Only Have Eyes for You.\\" The CD has more of a folk/country feel than the soundtrack, which bounced from the rodeo to the electronic disco. Stanley's disc has a more romantic heart, you can fall in love with the music as you would fall in love with the book. The disc works as a literary whole.

If I want to export, print or work with the original image, the software prompts me and tells me what CDR it is on! The ability to tag files is incredible. The more effort you put into tagging the files, the better the softwares searches become later. I tagged each of my nearly 5500 files with the people that were in them, the occasion they were taken for AND the location they were taken in (when it was relevant).

But then \\"Sol Searchin'\\" gets to the meat and potatoes of the album: nice deep house, with some tech flourishes. \\"Tonight\\" is a vocal track that's immediately catchy, while \\"Scenario\\" is cool and smooth (with some well-placed cursing), like a filthy downtempo milkshake. The jazziness on display on the first track returns in \\"Broken Arrow,\\" which melds a wailing trumpet with some mid-tempo breaks. The final track, \\"Slayin' the Dragon,\\" is a dark guitar and feedback piece. H-Foundation is nothing if not versatile. This album proves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Box Broken on arrival","review":"Nice looking set, but the hinges on the box were broken on arrival.

The case I actually received was the double-12 version of this:Double Six Club Size Dominoes. It is very thin vinyl over flimsy cardboard with a flap/2-snap closure. Case was torn in all four corners rendering it completely useless once the dominoes are removed from the cellophane (which was also torn). I also made 2 attempts to contact the merchant to see if they wanted to correct the problem. No response. Shame on you.Sure, as problems go, getting ripped off on a domino set won't make the news ticker on CNN. But there's no way I would've paid more than $10-$15 for what I received.

The hunt for a stalker, blackmailer and murderer. Under Blake Edwards direction it becomes alot more. Filmed in black and white with a fondness for night scenes the film unsettles its audience by allowing them to use their imaginations. No gratuitous violence or blood splattered scenes. In its shadows where the horrors are barely glimpsed the audience has to use their imagination to conjure up their worst nightmares. That is often scarier than a graphic depiction. Ford and Remmick are excellent and Ross Martin turns in a performance that makes him the world champion haevy breather. Martin is noted for lighter roles but is superb here in his sinister turn. Henry Mancini's subtle but unsettling score is icing on the cake. Enjoy with the lights out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A neat little book for a gift","review":"The author, Roger Price, was a first-rank single-panel magazine cartoonist of the 'fifties, and he invented this art style--a great, funny time waster, and a neat gift book when you are fresh out of ideas and want some little thing to let that special someone with a sense of humor know that you are thinking of them.Joseph (Joe) Pierre,former 1950's single-panel magazine cartoonist"},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST ZOMBIE MOVIE EVER MADE!!!","review":"I HAVE MANY ZOMBIE MOVIES IN MY COLLECTION...

I'm a big fan of mystery novels and this one just left me a little unexcited. Although I felt I could root for the main character, the rest of the cast seemed unexciting and unmemorable.

Until one night I got real bored and decided maybe it would put me to sleep. But it did the exact opposite. I stayed up ALL night reading and nearly finished at daybreak! I should have already known it would be a great book I mean it was written by L.J Smith!

Nice Price.Cons: Slightly disappointed with the actual product. The sheepskin quality is acceptable, but the inner lining is made by really rough fabric. The seal edge of the sheepskin is made by really rough fabric, it felt like i'm grabbing on fishnet whenever I drive. It's been 3 months since I started using this product and now the whole piece has lost the tightness or elasticity and it fell right off from my steering wheel. I admit that I live in a hot city, but still the quality is disappointing.

I don't know if this is true for all, but mine came with a very pleasing scent. For the past few days, I've been enjoying the natural feel of this more than my old neoprene cover.The only downside is that since it's especially thick, the wheel becomes quite bulky, and is not suited for people with small hands or like to fully grip their steering wheels. For that it loses 1 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Updated","review":"Here's an update: I liked this product at first, but after 6 months of use, I'm less happy with it. The elastic has loosened, causing me to constantly readjust it around the wheel, and it constantly throws off lint, making my dashboard very linty and dusty. I'm now looking for an alternative. A shame, really.I need a steering wheel cover that protects me from the burning heat of the desert sun and provides a good surface for gripping. This one fills the bill. Even on the hottest day (and it's routinely over 100 F here in the summer), the wool is warm, but not burning. I was a little afraid that it wouldn't provide me with a good grip, but have no fear! In fact, it's so soft and cushy, it makes it downright fun to grip the steering wheel. Wish I'd gotten it in the gray color, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"From Great to Awful","review":"So first off; I LOVED my sheepskin steering wheel cover.It feels great on your hands: during the winter the frozen steering wheel is much more tolerable and the sun seems to have no effect on it. This was a huge improvement to my sticky, deteriorating steering wheel. And it's true, the padding does make for a thicker, better feel too.Then I bought a new car and brought my Sheepskin Cover along. Taking it off the old steering wheel and onto the new one was enough to stretch the elastic past it's comfort zone. Within the year I started to notice bald spots on the cover. And the sheepskin hair had to go somewhere - along with the bald spots I was noticing \\"sheep hair\\" on my dashboard, on the floor, on my sweatshirt, on the shifter...Lastly; I hate my sheepskin steering wheel cover and threw it out less than a year after buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy","review":"I bought this in April 2012.

Regardless of the stretching I'm going to buy a new one. At this price I can afford one every year or so..Great product and if it hadn't stretched I would give it a 5 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shapeless","review":"I bought this steering wheel cover a month and a half ago. It fit a little loose at first, but stayed on just fine. I removed it over this last weekend because it has NO elasticity left to it.

While the quality of the sheepskin is nice (after years of fake synthetic ones), the piece is really stiff and does not stay in place... which could be dangerous, as the cover will turn with my hands and the wheel goes nowhere. It does seem to fit just fine, just doesn't stay in place. Thinking I will try to sew it on and see if that makes it a bit safer, but would rather something that just was more stretchy. Oh this was for a standard steering wheel on a Corolla that has never had fit problems before with covers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, but not curved","review":"As usual, exceptional quality (Rubis products) in terms of finish and design.

I actually got an error code and it refused to sew. The problem is the pressure foot won't go down far enough with thick materials and therefore the computer won't let it sew. So if you make suits or coats, sew denim or children's toy repairs, this MACHINE WILL NOT WORK!!!! And forget the needle treader. It twisted in less than an hour so it didn't go thru the eye of the needle, which was predictable since it was so flimsy. The thread broke about 5 or 6 times in the hour I was trying to use it, and it bunched up inside the machine. Just a flimsy piece of junk! Where can I get a good solid metal machine like my old Singer from 1957?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The price is a lie","review":"I don't understand how this Amazon Deal shows the regular price of this machine as $449.00 when it is not on sale at WalMart, Sears, or Target and yet they are all selling this machine at their regular prices - all $169 or less.

I recommend this machine because it is easy to operate and does a fine job stitching. Makes sewing a pleasure. Another reason I like it is, it is a popular machine. If you ever want to see how to do something, just look on You Tube and search the model #. If you are on the fence and don't know what machine to buy, look no further.

This is different from the metal frames of the previous machines.I hope that will not be a factor in future use. I have found, although at first, difficulty with the bobin and thread tightness, it is much easier than my previous Pfaff machine.All in all, I like this machine and I hope it due well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made","review":"I have owned this machine for about two years now, and have had trouble with the tension and with uneven stitches since I purchased it. After taking it in to get serviced this year, I found the spool tension was designed too tight, making it difficult to accurately adjust the upper tension. It tends to work ok for half of a project and then knot up and jam. Sometimes changing the needle helps for a while, sometimes taking out the bobbin case and replacing it. Usually I just have to walk away and let it rest for a couple days. It's incredibly frustrating. The stitches have continued to be uneven and skip at times, too, even after the tune-up. The mechanic who worked on it said these newer machines with everything internal are harder to repair and often not made as well. He was as unimpressed with this machine as I am. I just wish I had realized it was something that couldn't be fixed before it was too late to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware!","review":"I bought this machine based on the good review written here. It is not worth the money. It is VERY picky about thread. The bobbin jams CONSTANTLY. I have broken every needle that came with it. I am an experienced sewer and was only sewing two cotton-blends together. The bobbin-case was scratched and was causing the jamming (according to the manual) so I bought two new ones at $35 each. With literally the first gingerly stitch with a new case, it snapped the neede in two. Today, after using up every needle I had, I still am nowhere near the end of my simple and lightweight project because the bobbin keeps jamming, for NO REASON. It was a total waste of money and I am really angry that I fell for it. I have another Brother machine with the same problem, different model. THEY ALL HAVE DEFECTIVE BOBBIN CASES!!!! KEEP AWAY!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great little machine - until it broke less than 2 years after purchase!","review":"I loved this machine and used it for many, many projects as I taught myself to sew - unfortunately, the plastic frame was not built to hold up long-term. After using it to hem a pair of jeans, the machine called it quits, only about a year and a half after I started using it. I live in a large metropolitan area, and was very surprised that the closest \\"authorized service center\\" was over 50 miles away! I took it to a local repair shop (and probably voided the warranty by doing so) and was told that the plastic frame or the needle arm had bent, and there was nothing that could be done for it. Although I really loved this machine when it worked, I'm not sure I would buy another Brother product since there are so few places to get them serviced in my area."},{"rating":"2","title":"THANK YOU TO ALL THE POSITIVE REVIEWERS","review":"I did a lot of research on the brother cs6000I sewing machine.

It should work right out of the box. I will find something that is not made of plastic. Don't bother with this machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy it!","review":"I wonder why so many people recommend this machine. This is super cheapy \\"made in china\\" machine. I bought it about one month ago (because I believed over 4 star recommendations), I'd had so many troubles with bobbin feed and needle move. Today I returned it. I'm Japanese so I used to have almost same brother machine made in Japan. It was great machine but I didn't bring it for living in US. I'm so regret I should have brought it. I'm really disappointed with this anyway!All brother and singer products in us are made in china now.

I researched extensively beforehand and decided this was the one I wanted to buy, both from the reviews here and independent articles. I live in Australia, so it was a bargain compared to other similar brother machines. The exact same machine here costs $600, so I was so happy to find it at this price.I ordered it on the 9th of May and received it on the 6th of June. I was so excited that the wait was worth it. Once i got it, i started sewing a jumper out of polar fleece material. Nothing fancy. I had just sewn on a sleeve and was pinning another when i heard a POP. SMOKE CAME OUT so I turned off my machine. Not sure what I should do, or who can even repair it, but I honestly cannot afford anything, since the cost to fix will probably be more than that of the machine. Can anyone tell me why it blew up??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"I really am a dedicated hand quilter at heart, but this machine is making me like, no love learning to machine quilt! The gals in my quilt group have all said \\"We told you so\\" regarding machine quilting...and the fact that if you have a sewing machine you love, it makes quilting/sewing all the more enjoyable! Now if it would just cut all the quilt pieces for me....... I am an avid quilter, and in the past have only owned used machines...the last one I bought (about 2 years ago) seemed less appealing than any others I have ever had...stitches skip, machine is loud, over all very little power so it would get jambed on thick materials. I did a lot of internet searching, and kept coming back to this particular model...I am so glad I bought it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME! AWESOME! AWESOME!","review":"This machine is AWESOME! It's the best sewing machine I have EVER had the pleasure of using. It's so easy to use, rarely ever jams, light-weight and VERY effective. I run a small Work-At-Home Mom business and this machine allows me to complete orders in 1/2 of the time! I love that you don't have to thread up the bottom bobbin & the threading option is great.

Threading and bobbin winding are much more easier than the Singer machine I had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good machine for a great price","review":"I use my sewing machine a lot and I found this one very easy to set up and use. This is the easiest drop in bobbin ever! You really just drop it in - nothing else. The bobbin winder turns off the needle motion automatically. The needle threader works well. Very easy to thread and just start sewing. The needle down option is very useful. The motor is not as strong as some of my really old machines, but is OK. All and all it is a great choice for all levels of users."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brother CS6000I","review":"As a total beginner I was surprised how easy it is to create simple things with this machine. I have made 2 envelope pillows and my daughter in law made 3. It is a blast. Now we have to learn how to apply more stitches and hopefully apply zippers and buttons. It is so light, therefore we can move it easily and take it to each other's house. It has a lot of functions and no extra attachments to buy. I checked other machines and had to pay a lot more money for the same functions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome machine!!","review":"I bought this machine to replace my old Brother XL-5700 that finally broke down after 9 years of a fair amount of use and I am extremely satisfied with it! I've tried out almost all of the built-in stitches, and I've already made a few aprons with this machine using the twin needle. No complaints from me. Just a reminder to make sure to adjust the thread tension with different stitches, that seems to be one of the more frequent complaints I've seen but it hasn't been an issue to me. Each time I change stitches I use a scratch piece of fabric and adjust the tension appropriately before sewing on my final project, a process that takes all of 30 seconds. I highly recommend this machine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible customer service for defective product","review":"I bought this sewing machine three weeks ago and am working on my first quilt. I've been using the walking foot for a few days and the walking foot 'jumps'. It's a defective walking foot. I called Brother, and expected them to send me a new walking foot. That would be decent customer service for a brand spanking new machine. Right?!No. I need to send them the foot with proof of purchase, and they are going to test it out and let me know what they are going to do about it. Seriously?!If I still had the box, I would send the entire thing back. Talk about not standing behind your product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad!","review":"I wanted a mid-range sewing machine with some flexibility, and this is the machine.

I received it promptly and had it set up and sewing within 30 minutes. I tried all the stitches and accessories, and all work well. The only accesory it didn't come with was a ruffler. I am making a quilted pillow top and so far so good. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is that after I changed thread colors I kept getting an error message and I had to clean it to get it to work. Never did find any jammed thread. Hope that doesn't happen every color change. I love all the decorative stitches and the buttonholes. Since I don't plan on using heavy fabrics I think it will be fine. I have a 30 year old machine (another brand) and will use it for any heavy fabrics. It is a little more noisy than the old one, but I think that is because it is so lightweight. Overall I am pleased with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"My expectations were to high for this CS6000i , it has some good features but in general , for the type of work I do with a sewing machine dog coats mainly for large breeds of dogs it did not match my old Janome Excel II 5024 .Doing buttonholes on polar material is a nigthmare and using some of the fancy stitches on thicker material does not come out very well .The speed lever , can accidently be touch when you sew , just by turning the material for example, this is a bit annoying .I would have taught that with all the sounds alerting you, that this machine would at least alert you when the bobin was out of thread , if you sew with dark thread( which I do a lot ), you don't see well if you are running out of thread .And I do not know if it is me but I have found that I go through a lot more thread with this machine than with my Janome .I will have my Janome reajusted so I can use it again , and I will keep the Brother as a back up ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This Machine!!","review":"I'm writing this review because I found reading reviews so helpful in choosing a sewing machine myself! Can't begin to tell you how much I love this new machine. I spent about an hour learning everything on the machine to make sure all was in working order and was very pleased with the performance of the features. I have had no difficulty with the machine since purchasing it - and have started quilting on it already. Easy to learn to use, and easy to use! The instruction manual makes everything very clear and reiterates all the important points more than once - and absolutely everything you need to know to begin any project is covered. Can't wait to continue my projects! And as far as I can tell - there isn't anything you won't be able to use this machine for with the proper attachments. Excellent machine, excellent value!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad machine - bought based on price = bad decision","review":"I bought this machine to replace my 27 year old Kenmore. I had it 62 days when it locked up and quit working. I called customer service and had to bring it to the nearest service center - 27 miles away - to have it serviced because it is sealed and can not be fixed. I had to leave it with them for 10 days during which I had to borrow back my old machine to finish some projects that needed to be done right away. I got the machine back and I am looking for a better machine. I bought the machine thinking it was a great buy but it stalls on heavy fabric and shows an error which you can not override. I can't return it because of the 30 day return policy so I am stuck with it. I don't have a lot of expendable cash so I will have to use this one. I'm looking for a better machine now and would not recommend this machine at all. What a terrible disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy to use","review":"This is even better than I expected.

At first I was in love with it, the features were great and all the stitches were wonderful. However it didn't take long before it started acting up and now it seems to break on me every 3-5 months. It may just be that this machine is not made for such frequent usage, however my most recent (and most expensive) problem that I have run into with this machine is that the whole feed dog component collapsed into the machine. It would have been cheaper to buy a whole new machine than to keep forking over $50 here and there to maintain this one. If your looking for an inexpensive machine for beginners than this is a good choice, you pretty much get what you pay for so if you are a frequent sewer than I would recommend forking over a little extra cash and getting a more durable machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the beginner or more advanced sewer","review":"After having a Singer machine for years, I did a lot of research and ended up with this Brother model. I am very happy with the machine. I am an advanced beginner and find this extremely easy to operate. I appreciate the lighter weight of the machine which facilitates set up. Once it is ready to go, though, the machine stays in place and sews like a dream. There are three speed settings which I have found to be most useful. I haven't yet explored all of the stitch options, but changing the foot to accommodate them is an easy process. My only criticism concerns the illustrations provided to show you how to set up the machine. I still can't figure out the self-threading option. The machine comes with a hard shell carrying case. All accessories are stored conveniently on the machine. A very good value for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Sew for Your Buck!","review":"Remember those one stitch sewing machines handed down to you by two generations of mothers that weighed 500 pounds and had their own gravitation pull?

It is just a drop over cover, it does not really lock in place or covers the machine too well, there are open areas through which dust and such can get in, but it does the job of protecting the machine from nudges and prods. i would have preferred a case that was lockable and covered the machine entirely.Machine itself is beyond reproach for an amateur user like me."},{"rating":"2","title":"use it all the time","review":"I use this all the time.

I can't adjust the tension to make a difference.Also, it breaks needles all the time, but also jams on needles all the time. You can't win.Bottom line is this thing is junk.

The stitching was not nearly as nice as my mom's professional-quality machines, but it was perfect for what I needed. After I finished two dance costumes, the machine sat until I needed to repair sweatpants for my sons. The bobbin thread knots and loops horribly, now. I have adjusted the tension to every possible number. I have cleaned the bobbin case. I have used the best quality thread. I've checked to make sure the bobbin thread is under the plate correctly.

The only machine down fall is the light...it is very dim and is difficult to see the project while sewing, if it could be made brighter that would be perfect. The case is nice, although I assumed it was a \\"carrying case\\" and it is not, simply a case to put over the machine for storage on a table."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Weak Machine--Very Bad Purchase","review":"I am very disappointed with this sewing machine.I can't even use it on medium weight fabric the machine,just vibrates and needle will not go to through.It has no power at all.Also there is a piece of metal underneath the feeder that the thread continuously hangs to it and it makes the thread tangles. Very bad purchase for me. Very frustrating to work with and it Finally quit working."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This machine really rates 0 stars, but that choice is not available. The list price is over $400. I'd be contacting my state's consumer protection office if I had paid that much for such a low quality product.I have been sewing for almost 50 years and have never had so many problems with a new machine!! Despite the description, it is not so easy to thread the machine. It is not the needle that is the issue but rather the thread uptake lever; it is nearly impossible to get the thread to pass from one side to the other. If you desire to work on denim then you will really have problems. This machine will NOT sew through the heavier layers at the seams when hemming jeans. I have spent hours trying to get the machine to cooperate and still have not finished one leg. I would definitely return this machine if I could but too much time has elapsed since my purchase. Since it is considered polite to say something nice, here goes: it is easy to wind bobbins."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad my old sewing machine broke!","review":"I love this sewing machine! It is smooth and quiet and I love all the stitches, they are so much fun! I also really like the drop in bobbin and the self-threading needle. It took me a while to get the hang of the self-threading needle but I use it every time now. I'm not a fan of the cover it comes with because I like the one I already have that has a bottom to it. I like the computerized aspect of it. It took some getting used to but I really like it. This is perfect for a beginner or seasoned sewer. When I sew with it I keep expecting it to have the same problems I had with my other one and I am pleasantly surprised every time! i would recommend it to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My first new machine in over 40 years","review":"I inherited my mom's old singer when I was in college (she got a new one) and I used for years! It was made to last. I purchsed 2 new singers for my daughter and neither one lasted more than 4 or 5 years, I was very disappointed with singer. So when I decided to finally update my antique, I read the reviews and decided to go with this Brother.The price was so good I got one for my daughter too.While it took over 10 days to get mine (not sure why it took so long) when it arrived I was instantaly amazed.It works beautifully, and so quite! I especially like the speed adjustments and the self threading needle.Changing stich styles is a breeze, and every stitch seems perfect.I can't speak for how long it lasts yet, but it appears to be solid purchase - one of the best in the past few years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Love the machine it is easy to use and set up : easy instructions for follow..lowest price thru amazon.

This past summer I started learning on my grandmother's old Kenmore. Features about this machine that I love now that I have it are: well, for one all the stich choices, the needle threading feature (so nice!), and the forward and backward automatic button. I give the machine 5 stars because it comes with all the accessories I think would ever need, but I don't really like the case if you can even call it that... it is really more like a hard plastic cover/lid (can't really store anything in it... not even the extension for the table), but it really is a great machine, and the instructions are very easy to read and follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"CS6000i","review":"I really like the machine.

I have not had a new machine since 1989 when i had a Singer that cost $1500. This machine so outperforms the Singer. The technology has come so far it is amazing. I am thrilled with it as it will do everything I need if I am mending a seam or making a new Santa Claus suit for the hubby. What a dream machine. I am so glad the old one broke and I purchased this one at 1/10 the cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"I purchased my new brothers sewing machine and have not stopped sewing. i have made place mats for my dining room table and now am making 16 pairs of PJ's for all the kids. i love this little machine. It is so user friendly and the book that comes with it helps me alot. I keep it on the side of my machine. the needle threader is absolutly wounderful. The speed control and pedal free are great. I did alot of homework and looked at alot of machines before i purchased this one and i am very very pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love! Love! Love!","review":"When I decided to take a sewing class, I did my research on different sewing machines. I read the reviews good and bad and found the CS6000i had many great reviews on this site as well as others. I have to say as a beginner, this is a sewing machine I LOVE!!!! I have been taking it to my sewing class and have made my first dress. Very easy to use, love the accessories it comes with, and great for beginners. Cannot say anything negative about this sewing machine and it is one of the best purchases I have made! LOVE MY CS6000i!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a beginner!","review":"I just recently purchased this machine. I have not touched a sewing machine since the 7th grade (over 30 years ago)! I was able thread the machine, make the bobbin and sew a straight seam all in one night. The automatic needle threader was a little tricky...but nothing a You Tube video can't handle. As I continue to read the instruction manual, I am becoming more comfortable. If I can use this machine, anyone can! Overall, I think it is a great machine for a beginner and I am looking forward to my sewing lessons."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than I expected","review":"I was pleasantly suprised by this machine after some of the reviews I had read. I was in immediate need when I bought this Brother as my old machine just up and croaked in the middle of a dress project. I have had no problems with it and love the automatic needle threader and buttonhole choices. The one thing I did do was buy only the SA bobbins made by Brother for this machine. I have had none of the tension problems I had read about in other reviews. I usually sew one or more garments each week and am very happy with my new Brother. It has more stitch choices than the average home seamstress will ever need or use. I also like how quietly this machine runs. My previous machine was over 13 years old so I was suprised by all the \\"modern technology\\" like the needle threader and the one-step buttonholes. The price was great too, only about 1/4 of the cost of my last machine. All in all I think this is a pretty good product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sewing machine, especially for the price.","review":"The sewing machine is great.

I can take this machine to class and from room to room with no problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything I wanted for the price I wanted","review":"I couldn't be happier with this machine! For less than $200 this machine packs a big punch! It is very easy to wind bobbin, thread, change the presser feet, and navigate the digital interface. It handles every kind of material easily including denim (which I tested by patching jeans - it even made it through the thick seams with no effort!). True to the description it is very lightweight, and this purchase comes with every additional accessory you could want. So far I've used it for patching jeans, making Halloween costumes, and a few general garments. I'm looking forward to trying out more of the features for quilting - the prospect is promising! If you purchase this machine, I know that you won't be sorry. It is worth the money, it is very easy to use, and the user manual is easy to read and covers every troubleshooting question you might have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"First time sewing","review":"I grew up watching my mom sew, but never tried it myself. This is the first sewing machine I've owned and I love it! It was pretty straight forward to start, just follow all the steps in the manuel. I have not changed the needle or anything complicated just spinning thread around their bobbin and threading the needle and just sewing and playing with the different stitchings.A couple stitchings seem to sew the beautiful stitch patterns on the front and back of the fabric but others only do the back. Or maybe I set up my thread wrong...A couple times the fabric jammed, or the thread, can't tell which jammed first. I read other reviews which said cheap thread will be more likely to jam, but I can't tell which is cheap or fancy thread. I'm a noob.So far I've sewn a pillow case and a shoulder bag. They are functioning fine and I love the beautiful stitches!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful","review":"I received this machine about a month and a half ago.I didn't have alot of money to spend but needed a better machine for quilting. I went through the reviews and made my choice. I am so glad I choose this machine. I know it's been only a short time but it works wonderful. I'm not sure what some of these people are doing but I haven't had any trouble with threading the bobbin or the needle threader.Obviously they are doing something wrong. I never had a computerized machine before and I thought it was very easy to learn. I do quilting and the different stitches make projects easier. I have had no problems with the thread bunching up. The option of not having to use the foot pedal is great. I particularly like the needle up/down option. So far all and all I think the machine is great for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works very smooth, I like it!","review":"I order it at amazon last weekend and received it yesterday.

It was great at first and then I started having major problems with it. A few weeks ago it finally gave out on me and I bought the CS600I. So far so good. I've been able to design and sew quite a few projects with it and look forward to learning even more about it in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far it's great!","review":"I love this thing. It's got the stitches already programmed into the machine so all you have to do is select the one you want, and go!

I am an experienced seamstress and sell much of what I make, primarily appliqued fleece baby clothes. The fleece didn't feed well through the machine, stitches were skipped, and the top thread looped and tangled on the wrong side. I contacted the manufacturer and tried all suggestions - their final advice was to return to the dealer. Too bad the machine had some nice features. The decorative stitches were clumsy looking however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good of a deal as it looks like!!!","review":"I bought this sewing machine last February after I read the reviews on Amazon and I thought that this will be good for easy sewing at home. I am a seamstress and I also have a very good sewing machine that I use constantly, this one I bought just for the different stitches. I haven't even used it that much until last week when it broke down completely. It was probably defective from the start, (my husband fixes appliances and he looked at it and couldn't believe how cheaply made this is) and thinks it had a problem from the start when I bought it. I am very disappointed with it because I've had problems constantly with the thread breaking in spite of doing everything right and using the right needles. If you don't have the expensive good quality thread, good luck sewing with this one. I want to warn people that this is not as good of a deal as it looks like!"},{"rating":"1","title":"had to return TWO of these due to defective buttonhole....","review":"Very disappointed. I am a seamstress & neither time did the automatic buttonhole maker work. It's computerized so no part to replace, it just ruined 3 different coats I was making. The stitch was wrong, didn't go the right direction, VERY hard to fix a messed up button hole, hard to rip. Very frustrating. Got a refund, new replacement sent only to have an even worse button hole. UGHMy bad luck or faulty product?? If you don't SHIR (which it also won't do well at all) or make button holes, then go ahead, this machine is fine for the price. If you need all the features to work, avoid it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wife likes sewing machine.","review":"My wife likes this machine that replaced a much heavier and hard to use Pfaff machine.

So I'm sewing away and it stops stitching. I only had time to half way finish one bag. I've done everything the book says to try for trouble shooting. Nothing is working. I'm just so disappointed with this machine. I called by dear MIL and told her about it.

We love the features and ease of use is a big plus.That being said, we now have a problem with the machine drawing fabric through at a diagonal slant. Somehow, the stitches come out straight but we have to work at a diagonal which will be very difficult for larger projects or tight corners. The fabric also will 'bend' and curve itself from the force of a diagonal pull and straight stitches.If it weren't for that problem, we would probably go for a 5-star review as the features are nice and the machine is easy to maneuver.

The machine does not sew properly. I have experienced nothing but problems with it since I began using it. Most of the stitch options do not work properly, so I'm pretty much stuck with straight stitching. And even when I backstitch, the stitches start coming apart shortly after completing a project. Even at proper tension, the stitches are sloppy and every so many stitches, the machine seems to sew at different tensions and snags the threads. It's a shame, because the machine seemed to have a lot of bang for the buck."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"This machine is awesome; it has some many neat features and is very user-friendly.

I would definitely recommend (and have!) this machine to others for everyday sewing projects. This would not be a good machine if you plan to use it for a business where you sew from home or anything, but it is a fantastic machine for the price.

I am right back where I started -- breaking needles when the bobbin assembly doesn't move like it should. Now that now I've looked at the negative reviews I realize it wasn't me -- it was the machine.

Luckily, the machine does it for me.Initially, I had problem with the User Manual. Apparently a single manual was written for several different models. Where there are differences, then the say \\"For models with ...\\" do this and that. This sometimes confused me.All in all I give this machine high marks.

One day the bobbin winder function stopped working. I took it in to get serviced; the sewing store folks basically told me the machine is fairly cheap, \\"doesn't have a frame.\\" All the mechanics of the machine is attached to plastic, and the bobbin winder's plastic was melted and sticky. I'm not an expert on machines and sewing, but I suppose this machine is good for beginners, but it doesn't last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has some flaws","review":"In addition to the commonly voiced complaint that the light is inadequate, I've found that I have to pull out a flashlight to read the LED display (the little screen that displays information about the stitch you're using, length, width, etc.). These are flaws that would have been ridiculously easy to avoid! I've used many different machines in roughly 50 years of sewing and had a really difficult time figuring out how to thread this machine. It was easy right up til almost the final step and the manual was of little help for that although the manual was much better than most in other respects. Also have not been able to figure out how to use the device that's supposed to make threading easy. Again, these particular problems could have easily been avoided, which is frustrating since it's otherwise an excellent machine and reasonably priced."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's \\"sew\\" Easy","review":"I can't praise this machine enough! It has so many wonderful and thoughtful features; no feet feed, super thread cutter; the ease of choosing from the many stitches and/or lengths; light weight and easy to carry, attached tools; etc, etc. The list just goes on and on! The case does not attach but has an indention that fits the machine and so it can be carried as if it did attach. I found that my old Montgomery Wards sewing machine bobbins will fit and work great with this versatile machine because they are the same size. That was just an additional bonus. This is just a little jewel that makes sewing fun and I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift","review":"I researched for a good quality machine for a beginner sewer and this model came up repeatedly. The price was GREAT and made it worth the risk to purchase for our 13-year old granddaughter. She absolutely LOVED it and grandma learned how to thread, fill bobbins, stitch the various stitches right along with her. It's a great little machine and up to many large projects. I was impressed with the simplicity and the quality stitching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wife likes it!","review":"She had an old Singer which pretty much did only a straight stitch.

The settings are so easy to use, and my poor old eyes really appreciated the self-threader.My only complaint is the throat of the machine is really too narrow to do much quilting. I made crib sized quilts and it was a big struggle trying to pass the material through the narrowish throat. Other than that, I love the machine.For regular sewing it is perfect!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great transaction, but how about the packaging","review":"I ordered the sewing machine late for a Christmas gift, and had to pay extra for express shipping to get it in time. All went well, machine showed up on time in perfect condition. My only complaint is that the seller simply taped a shipping label to the sewing machine box and did not put it in a shipping box. The UPS lady was walking up the front walk when my daughter spotted her and the sewing machine box (the sewing machine was supposed to be a surprise) and quickly sent my wife to the other room so she wouldn't see what it was. If you are ordering from this seller, do not expect discretion on what is being shipped. Almost ruined Christmas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon Failure","review":"Amazon decided not to put this in a box. It was a Christmas gift for my wife. She saw it on the porch when she got home.

It continously binds up and makes it to where we are not able to use it at all. So we pretty much just wasted our money on this sewing machine and of course we are a month past our return date, so we are stuck with it. Do not suggest wasting your money on this machine.

Has all the features of something costing ten times the price. My 35 year old Bernina was a work horse but this is a different animal. If you've never used a computerized machine it will take some getting used to. Take your time- go slow and READ everything twice. Play with it before starting any projects. I have had none of the problems many people are talking about but am paying attention to the comments.

However, there was a foot missing and I needed to call Brother to have them send me one. They did so in a timely manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"Great price for the features, I think. This sewing maching is available at Walmart, which I think is why the \\"retail\\" price is so much higher than the selling price. I mean, Walmart kinda forces companies to lower their prices on stuff. I think? And it means a lot more people (who don't shop online) see these. This one is cheaper than they have it at Walmart, for the record. Buy this if you want a sewing machine under $350 or so, this is the best value I could find. I mean, some $350 machines might be a little better, but that's more than double the price of what I paid. Good features and the reliability seems good. If you want something in this price range, get it. Nothing under $200 compares as far as I've seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL MACHINE!","review":"ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL SEWING MACHINE....SUPER EASY TO USE..AND FANCY STITCHES!!

I sewed on a borrowed Kenmore machine for about a year before finally buying my own - this Brother machine. What sold me on it was that most reviewers said it performed well and came with extra feet and attachments. I sew on the machine about 3 hours a day, about 5 days per week. It is a fantastic machine. It sews smoothly. It is easy to maintain and clean. The baseplate slides off and the bobbin holder pops out for easy lint removal. The extra feet and various things that come with the machine, including the big extension table piece, are fantastic. I love having all the feet to use. Sewing is easy. Threading is easy. The extra buttons and things are very usable. I couldn't be happier and would definitely recommend this machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"A-sewing I will go...","review":"I just used my new Brother sewing machine and I am totally happy with it.It's smooth and quiet and sews like a dream.

No, I am not a beginner sewer I have been sewing for 12 years.It worked great at first, hardly any issues. The base that attaches to the sewing machine is rather annoying, as the legs always cave, so it's not good if you have a lot material. Now, it will not sew anything remotely heavy. It appears to be sewing and makes the holes from the needle but there is nothing. It is light, and I think that might be the problem, cheaply made.I have contacted Amazon and they are letting me return it for a full refund which I will use towards a Singer machine.I would say that if you sew a lot, heavy and non-heavy items, go with a machine that is built better because ideally it will last longer.This is a total disappointment for me because I am without a machine for a bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Sewing Machine...","review":"I was optimistic about this sewing machine since it had so many great reviews, but upon receipt I was sorely disappointed. I am an intermediate to advanced sewer and have two sergers, but wanted a simple machine that could make a nice straight and zigzag stitch. I know how to properly thread and work a sewing machine and the Brother CS6000i was a tension nightmare from the first stitch. I'm assuming that the machine I received had been bumped and bruised being sent through USPS, or that all of these positive reviews are coming from beginner sewers that don't know the difference between a good and a bad sewing machine. The final straw was that the feeddogs on this machine were plastic! I sent this cheap pile of plastic p00p back to Amazon and all I was looking for was a good straight and zigzag stitch, which this machine could not perform. I'm giving this machine 2 stars only because it might be a cute gift for a 7 year old?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great so far","review":"I purchased this last month and have used it quite a bit. So far so good, I love it. I'm a novice sewer who has been taking some classes at a local store (renting one of their higher-end machines). I decided on the Brother CS-6000I after a lot of research. This was within my price range and gets excellent reviews. I did notice that when I set it on a hard surface I have some of the tension issues that people talk about, but if I set it on a softer surface (carpet) I have no issues with the tension at all. I have sewn through thin cotton and knits as well as multiple layers of heavy denim. As long as I switch to the appropriate needle....no issues! I also fixed the crotch-seam in a pair of my step-sons work pants that are a heavy twill. The crotch had so many layers I didn't think this machine would be able to do it. But I switched to a 90 needle and gave it a try....no problem! So far this machine has been a little trooper and I love that it only weighs 13ish pounds....easy to carry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy","review":"When I gave this to my wife she was very happy and even more when she was able to follow the guide and do fancy stiches and such she just loves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"tension problem","review":"my machine broke after 1 year warranty is expired first foot plug in is broked i took to sewing center and they fix it and after tension problem is started and i can fix it by myself and took it to sewing center again and ask me 90$ to fix it"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT waste your money!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I bought this after reading a lot of reviews and this machine seemed to have gotten decent reviews.

I am an experienced seamstress and figured all the features on this machine really did seem too good to be true. We decided to take the gamble and sadly lost.First of all when ordering, Amazon asked if it needed to be concealed since it was a gift and we marked the box yes and then it got delivered and my daughter saw the box (actual sewing machine box) while it was delivered! Ruined her whole birthday surprise!Then, we decided to make a costume together and the buttonholer did not work at all AND the needle was staying in the left position instead of the middle. The stitch wasn't very good either. I made sure it was threaded correctly and that we were doing the buttonholer was attached correctly.Just a cheap machine, should have known. Sending it back....along with all the attachments I bought separately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth it, just don't buy from Kens Sewing and Vacuum Center !!!","review":"This product is fantastic, it's very easy to use and is easily the most for the money. Unfortunately I bought it from a company with a 95% rating, I've learned my lesson. The powercord that plugs into the actual machine, the one you have to have to make it work, doesn't even fit ! And this product was supposedly, \\"New\\" ? How is it new if you pop in an odd sized cheap chinese made power cord that doesn't even fit the Brother machine ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY IF IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION","review":"Researching I felt that this was a great quality machine with the perfect range of features. On reveiving the machine I was releived to discover it was the perfect weight and size. However, it uses a really specific voltage (110-120 volts) and cord type so DO NOT buy this if you are situated in the pacific, especially Australia. Most European countries will have the same problem. As soon as I plugged it into the power outlet the votlage blew blowing up the motor in turn. The machine now does not function at all!!On contacting Brother they claimed no responsibility (which was clearly stated in the warranty) and it would cost $300 AUD to fix it.I am really dissapointed the voltage problem was not communicated to me when buying the machine even though they knew my location."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Machine Ever","review":"I purchased this machine for light craft sewing and thought it would be fine. It is the worst machine I have ever used. I threaded everything properly, high quality thread, etc. The bottom stiches look like there is something wrong with the tension. You can only adjust the top tension, not the bottom. I adjusted to all possible positions, but no luck. I took the machine to a local dealer and he checked it and said I am doing everything right, it is just a bad machine. Furthermore, I had a problem with another household appliance purchased from Amazon, which the manufacturer replaced with one that worked. So, I am beginning to think that the products available for such great prices on Amazon are knock offs, or rejects. I will not purchase another piece of equipment this way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ring - long delivery","review":"I paid for rush delivery for a specified date and they missed it by 5 days.

It is very quiet. My husband was watching TV while I was sewing and commented that he barely heard it. It does sew through thicker layers as well as thin ones and it sews smoothly. I like using the button on the machine instead of the foot pedal. It is very lightweight and takes up very little space. Having used a cabinet model before, this is a big bonus for me. If I get half as many years out of this one as I did my previous sewing machine (38) I'll be very happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"good machine for the price","review":"This is a very good machine for the price. I replaced a 25-year-old Singer machine. I doubt this one will last 25 years, but I hope I'm wrong. It did very well on medium-weight fabric, not so well on very lightweight fabric. I used it to patch my husband's jeans, which it did well, but probably not as well as a more expensive machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice surprise","review":"When I lifted the box and took out what seemed to be very light flimsy machine i thought to myself here we go....Until i set it up and started to use it.

You can not go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brother CS6000i Sewing Machine","review":"I did a lot of research before purchasing this sewing machine, both in local stores and online. I read many of the reviews on this machine before making the purchase. I have not yet had a chance to look at or try all the attachments, accessories, and stitches. There's so much!! The machine is very light weight, but seems very sturdy. It's very quiet and runs smoothly. Threading the top of the machine is very simple and I like that the bobbins are the same size as those I had from the Kenmore machine I'm replacing. The additional detachable table and hard cover are great bonuses. I was worried about having this machine shipped to Hawaii (cost and condition), however, to my great delight, shipping was FREE and the machine arrived in 4 days, in perfect condition!! I'm very happy with this machine and the price, and the convenience of home delivery cannot be beat! Thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good purchase","review":"The machine works good.

It was easy to use and set up right out of the box and I began sewing with it immediately. I have made 400 dresses since then and I have never once had any problems out of this machine. I sew on it for hours and hours a day so it really takes a beating. It works as good now as when I first purchased it. The features are great, especially the buttonhole maker. I am an experienced seamtress and have been sewing for over 20 years and this is the easiest buttonhole maker I have ever used.I can't say enough good things about this machine, especially the price. It works so well I was tempted to buy another one just to have on standby, but after sewing on it this long with no problems, I don't think I will need it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lightweight, inexpensive machine.","review":"I had this machine for a little over a week and just finished packing it up to ship back. It is so lightweight that it wobbled and rattled all over my sturdy sewing table when I sewed on the fastest speed. The thread broke often, regardless of the tension setting. Feeding fabric through was another challenge - it pulled to one side, much like driving a car out of alignment. It appealed to me because of the assortment of decorative stitching (which I use often). Maybe this machine was just a lemon, but I'm not willing to try it again.That said, it is not a terrible machine. When stitching straight, it did a good job. It would be good for having a portable back-up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I needed","review":"I had never touched a sewing machine or knew anything about them or sewing.I had no idea what a bobbin was or what winding one meant.I needed to make some curtains for a RV and ordered this machine after reading the reviews.While I was waiting for it to arrive I watched a few video's online on how to sew and how to work this machine.When it arrived I unpacked it and read just enough of the instructions to get it threaded and running and was sewing in under a hour.I had to sew a few edges on the curtains that were over 10 feet long plus splice pieces together and it worked perfect.I did all the curtains for the RV and the machine was flawless.I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give it 0 stars","review":"I saw the great reviews and I saw the terrible reviews.

I was really looking forward to having a new machine, especially one with a quilting foot. The quality of this machine is poor. I was afraid that the bobbin winder was going to break when I adjusted it. It did not handle heavier fabrics well, especially since there is not an adjustment for the pressure foot to go over multiple seams. I was also disappointed that when using the foot peddle, I also had to keep adjusting the speed with the push buttons. I guess you can't teach an old sewing dog new tricks. I've been sewing for over 50 years, and used to be an industrial seamstress. Give me a machine that is made well and that I can control with the foot pedal. I sent this machine back within my 30 day Amazon return window. Now, I've ordered a Janome 500 Sewist machine.

I haven't had any problems with it, I've only used it three times but so far nothing has gone wrong and it is pretty easy to understand. The manual shows you how to thread the machine and how to wind a bobbin but also there are pictures and numbers on the machine to help you figure it out.There are so many different stitches you can choose from and it comes with many different feet and shows you what foot to use for what stitch, very nice and helpful.

It makes threading the needle very awkward and frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Avoid this one!","review":"It just stop working, the bobbin spins off and then pulls the thread into a huge clump!

Skip this and check out better quality machines and avoid Brother! I've since purchased the Janome DC2011 and am in heaven!

I was looking for a middle of the road machine since i do not sew as much as i use to. It is very lightweight, has the feel of a toy machine. It \\"travels\\" on the table when i sew.There is not much space between the needle and the arm of the machine so larger projects are out of the picture. Due to an error on my part (I did not change the setting for a stitch) the needle arm jammed into the throat plate. There was no way to correct it. I have sewn for over 40 years on an old singer model with no problem.I brought it to a local repair shop and the cost of repair was not worth throwing good money after bad.So i upgraded to a much better Brother model.Buyer beware. I should have researched this better before buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great machine for the price!","review":"Brother CS6000I 60-Stitch Computerized Free-Arm Sewing Machine with Multiple Stitch FunctionsI bought this machine to replace my old 10 ton kenmore (over 35 years old!)After reading the instructions I was up and sewing in no time. The bobbin winds easily and is easy to thread. The machine is quiet and smooth and very light weight.

This machine comes with many accessories (several different sewing feet, a basic sewing kit, and a hard cover) that will cost you extra with other machines. The instructions in the manual are very easy to understand and follow. It also has several nice features such as a lot of different stitches, fast bobin winding, button or foot petal controls, reverse stitch button, and needle height button.

First the bobbin winder, then the bobbin case, finally the electrical system. Sure, the price looks good, but this is a very cheaply made machine that isn't built to last.I'm an experienced seamstress and used the machine at least a couple days a week, so if you intend to use your machine only rarely and for simple tasks, it *might* hold up for you. Then again, if you need just basic sewing functions, you're much better off with an inexpensive Singer. I'm now looking into buying a Singer again (used to have a basic model that never gave me any problems). It'll cost more up-front, but probably not in the long run!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not for heavy fabrics","review":"This machine has a lot of bells and whistles: One-step buttonhole, 60 stitches, 7 different buttonhole styles, etc. It's also got variable speeds which is nice for beginners, and comes with a package of presser feet that would cost $50 or so purchased individually.However, my major disappointment was that it did not sew through more than 3 layers of denim without putting up a fight. The needle gets stuck in the fabric, it makes a horrible noise, and then displays an error message. Not so good if you want to do something as simple as hem a pair of jeans. Going slow or fast does not seem to make a difference. In addition, some of the fancier buttonholes (keyhole for example) look terrible.My experience has been that if you want a computerized machine that sews through heavy material you're going to have to pay around $300. The Brother Project Runway machine goes through thick material without balking, unlike this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not pleased","review":"I purchased this machine based on the positive reviews it received.

Not having to practically take the machine apart to change a presser foot, thread a bobbin, etc., feels like such a luxury. :) I know there are sturdier, more intricate machines available; after reading the reviews here, I knew this one would be just right for me.

I can do twice the ammount ofbibs in half the time and the decorative stitch features are great because now I can also add beautiful little borders to the bibs and baby blankets. Also the machiene is so smart I've never had one like it. I also love the feature it has where you can choose to sew with the pedal or with the simple push of a button which is so nice when your feet get tired after sewing for a few hours.

That should have been disclosed before I bought it, I would definately not have purchased it. I don't know what the basic charge is for service in your area but mine is $80, this machine is definately a throwaway. I will buy a Singer after this one goes, and it will.

That is the good thing I can say about all this..Amazon customer service was great!I was sewing on an older Kenmore (Janome) before this that I borrowed from a friend. Its stitches were far superior.

It is easy to use. The operation manual is simple to follow. After sewing for a few weekends, I think I'm getting accustomed to my electronic sewing machine. Previously, I had a Singer that finally gave out after about 35 years of occasional use. Here is my concern, also voiced by many reviewers: the bobbin tension is too loose. The bobbin thread can be pulled out with only a little effort. The bobbin is wound correctly and inserted/threaded per the manual. I have tightened the top tension as high as it can go - no change. I am going to try different weight fabrics, different thread, and anything else I can think of, before I make up my mind about keeping or returning the machine.

I've rewound bobbin, and tried mightily to get it to work. Top thread can't pull up the bobbin thread - just keeps jamming. $170 is too much money to spend on something worthless - and this machine is worth nothing. I loved the idea of it: light weight, lots of different stitches, big attachment to lay fabric on. I'd seen Brother products used on Trading Spaces so thought, heh! If they use Brothers why not me? Lesson learned. I'm now hunting for a Singer sewing machine. And not looking forward to the hassle of packing this up and returning it. Original box has already gone to recycle. Nope.

This machine is awful!! I bought mine about 2 yrs ago, and it worked ok for about the first year sewing very simple things (pillow cases & such). But after that, it went downhill like it was on a luge! I made the gigantic mistake of not doing enough research before I bought it. It loses it's tension very, very easily. I took it in to be repaired, which cost almost as much as the machine itself. It then worked great - as long as I only used straight stitches. Anything other than a straight stitch on a lightweight fabric will mess the tension up severely!My biggest suggestion for this particular machine, is DON'T BUY IT!!

I did have trouble at first with the tension, but it was my error, I didn't have the machine threaded correctly. I found a helpful video on U-Tube that explained everything. I do have to mention that I invested the money to go to my local Brother sewing center and take a guide lesson to make sure I was doing everything the right way.

This book is not up for controversial debate, and it doesn't judge other belief systems, it simply wants to aid you on your quest in life through the eyes of an amazing woman, author: jamie sams.I recommend this book only for people seeking enlightenment, spiritual transformation, evolution and ascension. Maybe if everyone read this book, felt the words and projected into higher awareness, we'd be more conscious of the great spirit that connects everything!I really love this book~"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too theoretical","review":"I didn't like this book because I didn't find any useful suggestions to put theory into practice. It does give a description of the 7 Paths, but it doesn't say exactly what you should do in each step of your transformation. It is very philosophical, and the only parts where it gets practical are the sections in which the author tells her own experience. Even though I understand that for some people just reading about someone else's experience is enough to understand and copy their attitude, I need something more. Maybe I expected a series of tips and instructions, and this is not what this book is about.That said, the author seemed to me a very inspired woman and the things she says are interesting, from a merely philosophical point of view."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a Wonderful Book","review":"Exceptionally well written book.

If you're an employee or free agent, you'll find the tools you'll need to cut through day-to-day clutter. If you're a leader, ignore this book at your own peril. Jensen shows how storytelling, conversations and making connections for people are critical, and how the future of companies will look like the Net -- leaders will have to build tools and structures for business units of one...the individual.I've already gotten over a dozen copies for the team leaders I work with. It's that helpful! Bonus: For me, the design is a big plus too.

Jensen is so on-target when he talks about me and my friends (80 million Net Geners) as a force to be reckoned with.

If you are interested in the future of work, this book shows you what tomorrow's workforce will expect and demand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too simple","review":"I read a lot of business books, so I know when I've make a purchase mistake. This is one. There's so little of substance between the covers that many pages use huge caps and double spaced quotes from someone else. All this isn't even tied into the text effectively. The rest of the text is loaded with quotes from lots of interviews, but there is a lack of boiling it all down into something new. I have no idea where all these great recommendations came from. Believe me, the emperor has no clothes."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a pity","review":"The topic is right - and the direction is correct. However: A book on simlicity should be more simple, more structured and especially more to the point. I may say this because I know the challenge on a day to day basis: - How to communicate IT-Value to top management ? - How to explain business to IT people ? - Why should some thousand sales people work with our applications ? What's in for them in using their PC ? If you have to do that you soon learn the value of simplicity and a basic understanding of how it works. If you've worked through that book you probably get some sense of it, however: - It takes you longer than necessary. - It doesn't help you so much in applying simplicity. - Instead you find assertions like those that teams don't help you with simplicity - If you ever worked in a non-teambased environment, you know that that assertion is - simply - WRONG."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book that needs better coherence","review":"I'm one of the many individuals who worked for large corporations before but recently switched to the fast moving internet startup environment. With the speed of the internet, better communications and team work is getting more important than ever.This is the reason I looked into this book. The book does offer some useful ways to simplify communications and corporate cultures, but all the paragraphs are not written in a cohesive manner, that I have a hard time following and apprecieting the book!Having read great business books written by authors like Tom Peters and Seth Godin, I'm used to the style of clean, coheresive, and interesting writing style.Didn't mean to give this book a 2 star while it receives great reviews from the other reader. But I'd like to be honest rather than conformative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely useful for smarter speed","review":"Bill Jensen has written a book which is extremely useful for seeing the connections between how we communicate, how we use time, organize work, build companies, and how we lead. He cuts through the usual sandbox sound bites about making things simpler and asks us to take a more holistic approach. Simplicity is about smarter speed. \\"Change all you want,\\" he says, \\"just know that execution happens at the speed of sense-making.\\"What may be Simplicity's true legacy is how Jensen connects sense-making, meaning-making and the use of people's time to how we build corporate infrastructures and tools. Read passively, this part of the book might appear uneven. Think deeper about what he's saying, and it profoundly rocks the accountabilities of leaders and companies!

It is not very surprising that her only positive review was written by herself!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book-shows the true significance of bar/bat mitzva","review":"This book should be read by every parent whose child is approaching bar/bat mitzvah. Too often, the significance of the occasion is lost in the \\"big party\\". This book focuses on what is important about the bar/bat mitzvah-about accepting responsibilities such as study and performing mitzvot, about the service and about keeping the celebration in perspective. It focuses on the spiritual as it should and helps pull away from the social aspects that often overwhelm the true meaning of bar/bat mitzvah."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seeking true values, not just an opportunity to party","review":"There are any number of books which are designed to help you plan the logistics of a bar/bat mitzvah. This book's main purpose, however, is not to be a party planning guide. Instead, this book reaffirms the important commitment a bar/bat mitzvah makes to Judism. A party is fine but truly connecting with God, our people and our ancestors is what the experience is all about. The bar/bat mitzvah experience is explored in a very spiritual, meanful way but not necessarily from the orthodox standpoint. Indeed, the authors are non orthodox. I recommend this book to all who wish to make the bar/bat mitzvah a meaningful means to grow as a Jew rather than as an end in itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great books for Jews by Choice!","review":"I wrote a much lengthier review at my blog [...] but this book is not only great for someone who is planning a bar mitzvah, but for Jews by choice.

Most of the information is generic to almost any condition/disease; the rest simply directs you to websites. If it were $9.95, it would probably be worth it - maybe. This publisher has several other similar books out on other conditions, they simply substitute MAC for other diseases, added a few websites and slapped a ridiculous $30 price tag on. There is NO PRACTICAL information about MAC in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only worth the 11 I paid for it....","review":"When I paid 11 for this book I thought I would only get 11 worth of information...now that I have finished the book I think I was correct.This book seems to have been put together by some one with no first hand knowledge, infact 3rd hand. Every topic is covered in an overview with no specific details, names of brands, costs, etc...which is the main reason most people buy this book. I believe this book could have been better if some one googled and compiled all the information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but could be better","review":"This book covered much of the same info as in other start-up books for bars/clubs, but definately points you in the right direction for things to think about and consider in owning or starting a nightclub. Aside from the numerous grammatical errors I am pleased with the book. This book should have been proofed better before publishing, I found an error about ever 10 pages (along with some strange wording). I would like to see a bit more on financial price breakdowns and models along with more info on contacts and ways to go about getting the tools/contacts you need. All-in-all this was good brain food for thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"I own a bar","review":"Before I actually owned my bar I bought this book. This book is a joke and is good for laughs. I would suggest this book for someone who wants to work in the nightclub industry(bartender)but not for someone wanting to open their own bar.

While those songs are quality, they are fairly standard hip-hop, especially when compared with the group's subsequent records. And why was the title track off ATLiens omitted? Inexplicable, especially since its listed among the liner notes. Guess you can't please everybody. As far as the new tracks go, none of them is particularly memorable. Funkin' Around and the After Party have strong jazz elements. The After Party seems like an afterthought best put on a B-side rather than an actual track. The raps in The Whole World are tight, especially Big Boi's, but what's up with Andre singing?! The hook is OK, but Dre's intro seems deliberately bad. Nonetheless, the album is a must for any Outkast fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of songs left out","review":"This album has most of Outkast's greatest hits. The only flaw I really see is they left off a lot of songs from ATliens. I understand they can't include every song in their catelogue but Atliens is by far the best album they released.

This is all any outkast fan could ask for. It's all the classic Outkast songs on one spectacular CD. Big Boi and Andre 3000 don't dissapoint. These are songs you'll have stuck in your head.

The book's beginning tells us that broadcasting has consequences and that theme runs through the text. We're given clear definitions of the key terms used by media professionals and a historical context of their development.Appropriate charts, graphs, and photos add an element of visual explanation to accompany the written descriptions. The sections on regulation and audience research emphasize the importance of those two components for students interested in entering the field.

If Dr. Moody decided to try again with more attention to the art of the documentary instead of basically lecturing into a camera lens, he'd hit GOLD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"did not enjoy this","review":"The content was very repetitive. The personal stories just weren't interesting enough to hold your attention. Raymond Moody is an expert in the field of death and the afterlife so I expected this to be better. I'd rather read his books instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A biased collection of testimonies.","review":"While certainly an interesting subject, it's unfortunate that the film does not go to any lengths to explore more opinions and studies. It serves mostly as a collection of testimonies from people who have had \\"near death experiences\\" and offers them as proof of an afterlife.I would have loved to see a more scientific approach with interviews by science and medical professionals. Perhaps not surprisingly, there was not even a mention of MacDougall's \\"21 Grams\\" study. It also would have been nice to get a historical perspective with some insight into the beliefs of different cultures.Overall this was a disappointing watch. It was obvious after the first fifteen minutes that the director already had an opinion on this and simply wanted to convince the audience to share his view. If you already believe in an afterlife and enjoy hearing people's tales of almost dying, you will probably enjoy this. If you are looking for any real insight on the subject, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"The interviews of those who have died, come back, and reported on their experiences was very interesting.

Read it if you get the chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent thriller 4.5 stars","review":"Read this book shortly after the 4th of July. Was an excellent thriller with a good cast of characters and quite well written. Obviously, you can figure out that the Germans did not stop D-Day. This was my first Silva book but thought he was an excellent thriller writer in the Ludlum and Follet style to a certain extent. The plot reminded me of Day of the Jackal as MI-5 searches for a deep cover spy.The epilogue to the story is terrible as it refutes most of the plot points, but the story itself is a very enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Generally enjoyable novel for the beach or a dreary afternoo","review":"Good story idea with interesting twists. However, it predictable, with only a few characters fully developed. The ending (epilog, really) is too similar to too many other novels and TV stories-a wrap-up that cannot be told any other way. I prefer an ending that doesn't need an explanatory wrap-up.However, it is fun and worthy of spending time with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, fast moving and elegantly scripted","review":"The author weaves a multi-track spy thriller with care and apparent consideration for the reader.The plot is direct, credible and attractive - the characters are full bodied and alive, the accuracy of the environment is thorough without the minutae of Clancy but also more physical that Le Carre.Altogether an excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"needs editing","review":"The plot of this novel is interesting - not as engrossing as some others of this genre such as Forsythe and Harris. My biggest complaint is the disrupting way flashback are inserted into the story. Only one is necessary, the others are just distractions and do not further the plot or enrich the characters. This being the author's first published work I must blame the editor for this. I'm hoping other work will be more tight."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a dull debut for such a great writer","review":"Silva's Gabriel Allon series are collectively, my favorite books. I've read the whole series through at least twice. So I thought I'd see where the author got his start and checked out The Unlikely Spy from my local library. I didn't even get through the first fifty pages, which is what I usually allow for a book to grab my interest. The beginning of the book is sufficiently boring to quash any interest in further reading, but I think for readers like myself, who discovered Silva during his brilliant Allon books, it's particularly disappointing to see the talent that would come along later that evidently wasn't there in the beginning. I guess it's not how you start..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tremendous","review":"A few years ago I flew out to Miami and had some time to kill so I browsed the airport bookstore and picked this up. Started reading in the Terminal and couldnt put it down throught the whole flight. It is a tremendous espionage novel. Silva is extremely talented and he wrote a fantastic book.I wont give it away, just going to tell you if you like espionage novels then go pick it up. Its Tremendous!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What??? What was this all about?","review":"This seemed like a great novel till I got to the end. I don't want to give away anything about the conclusion, but I felt like I had been had, by the way this story wrapped up in the last few pages. I wondered a quite a bit about the sense (or senselessness?) of the whole plot for quite a few hours after I was done reading this novel. Mr. Silva has certainly written far better works than this..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Switchblade sharp","review":"Silva has endeared himself to the crowd that seek more than just 007 spy action. He has created human characters that struggle with the reality of their actions. He lifts the veil on the German machine showing the grays that are usually depicted as pure black in other creations. The Unlikely Spy is a book that I had an unusual amount of fun reading. And the ending was very enjoyable. Too many times you reach the end of a book like this and it just doesn't live up to the action and intrigue of the body. Unlikely delivers from front to back. If you have any interest in espionage or WWII fiction, you can't miss this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"This is a tedious, long drawn out book about a very old theme. Many times I thought to put the book away, not to finish it, but thought it might get deeper into the character of Catherine Blake. She could be great (though utterly ruthless) but her character could have been taken much further in this book. Instead, it concentrates too much on the rather stuffy Vicray who becomes progressively more tedious. All in all I don't consider this a very good book and it should in no way be compared to \\"Fatherland\\" as suggested on the jacket, since that story is truly fascinating. The Unlikey Spy is a repetition of a theme so old and repetitious that it really wasn't worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"put me to sleep","review":"I can't believe this book got such rave reviews - and even worst, that someone compares to \\"Eye of the Needle\\". I had high hopes and expectations and kept at it for a while hoping that at some point it would pick up but at best it's a mediocre, unsophisticated attempt at a thriller - without feeling and without real character development. By the middle started to skip entire sections hoping that at some point it would l but generate some excitgement but finally gave up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"Very interesting historic setting: WWII and the pre-invasion of Normandy period.

Can't wait to try another of his. One of my top 20 favorite books"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I am a big fan if Silva and have read most of his books. The beginning was gruesome and really upset me so much that I skipped to the next chapter. The book being about Hitler and his buddies was too much. I got bogged down in all the discussions and kept wanting it to speed up. It was depressing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ends better than it begins","review":"Just finished the book, and then re-read some of the reviews here, and I agree with most of them. Overall, I found it to be really exciting and great historical fiction. I wasn't very 'into it' at first, but was completely rewarded with my patience during the last 250 pages or so. Also, it has one of the best chase scenes that I've ever read. Though, I have to agree with the review that indicated that Silva spends a little too much time developing characters without fully using what he's come up with. That being said, I would recommend it - it was fun read..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many different stories in this one book","review":"This book was really hard for me to get into. If you are like me and read a little and then dont pick a book up again for another few days, this one is too confusing. Just when you get to know a list of characters, the book starts a whole new story that is within the current story with all new characters. Also I felt there was just too much useless side information that was just filler. I am really busy and dont have much time to read so I want to be entertained (plus I have a horrible attention span).If you are the type of person who will read a book from start to finish without stopping this might be for you. But otherwise this is just too much info and too many characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hans 4","review":"What a waste of time. Could have written the whole thing with half the words. It was fast reading, as I simply read the topic sentences in paragraphs and skipped the rest. In many case, I skipped whole paragraphs and didn't miss a thing.Obviously, Silva got his act together in later books, which I have read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply excellent; fun to read","review":"As the description eludes to, Silva intoduces quite a few characters early in the book, which has a tendency to make me nervous, thinking I'll need to remember everyone as the story progresses. This is true to an extent but Silva makes it easy and the book gets better and better with every page, culminating in an intense and exciting race through the english countryside; the germain spies trying to flee MI5 to catch a ride on a submarine back to Germany. Excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage, Perfect Silva","review":"If Daniel Silva writes a Gabriel Allon novel, count me in. If you're a fan, it's a must read....aren't they all? I can't find anything to criticize about this adventure. They all seem vaguely familiar at times, but it's like coming home to visit an old friend. You know what to expect, but it's comfortable, enjoyable and mostly thrilling. This effort is perfect and well worth the readers time. If you're not a fan, this, or any of Silva's \\"Allon\\" novels will make you one. The action is ever-present, the characters are well-developed and the plot..while not always as unpredictable as some may prefer, is well-honed. Truly another great effort and a worthwhile read for fans of the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Fast!","review":"You can always count on Danial Silva to give you a good story and this was no exception.

In England, Catherine Blake is the respected widow of an RAF pilot. She is also a German spy, trying desperately to find the location of the invasion. Her enemy is Alfred Vicary, a former history professor and seeming bumbler, but he is brighter than he seems, and he runs counterintelligence operations. Blake seems to have all the smarts to leave Vicary in the dust, but it's like the hare and the tortoise. Suspense builds as the tale progresses and the stakes become ever-higher. It's a thoroughly-enjoyable story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't stomach it.","review":"I didn't finish this one so I can't offer a fair review.

Yes, it is a bit campy, and yes, it is often over the top, but I can say that the people are well intentioned, just a bit off target. I attended Trinity Church from birth until I was 22 years old. I do not attend their anymore because of the close-minded attitude that is prevalant in this documentary. I stopped doing HellHouse when they added the decision room my last year. I just felt it was an un-biblical scare tactic. I now feel that way about the entire operation. The worst feeling I get is knowing the young teenagers are blindly following the leadership without doing any research themselves. I know because I was once one of them. I have found that a growing number of former Trinity Youth Group members my age do not attend there for the same reasons I listed above.

The only objection I could offer is that from what appears in the documentary, the only critics of the Hell House are incoherent raging teenagers, whose objections are skillfully and calmly responded to by a member of the church. Yet I know from first-hand knowledge that there are critics of fundamentalism (Christian and otherwise) who are capably of equally calm and skilled rational debate.

Its not as twicthy as it is with a gamepad.The track layouts are very weak.No challenge like mcm2 Graphics are crisp and clear and bike and rider physics are alittle better then mcm2 but over all the game is very difficult to play with a joystick.

I don't agree with the review below: the book is nowhere near as negative as At the Hong Kong Movies and the amount of plot synopsis versus criticism is reasonable IMO, more so than Sex and Zen and a Bullet in the Head.

This is not a book that makes easy bedtime reading. For those who persevere, however, it provides a fascinating insight into some of the most damaging aspects of our times, as well as offering some uniquely wise and spiritually enlightened solutions for the new millennium.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"simple fact about book, its rating and its reviews","review":"The author of this book is the founder of a religious cult and is worshipped as the Holy Ghost, the Supreme Goddess, by her devotees. Messages have been sent out within her cult telling her followers to come here and give 5 star reviews to drown out any criticism. Thus you can take the rating for this book with a pinch of salt. I've tried reading the book but I find it very boring. I'm also surprised at the $50 price tag but I guess the Goddess needs her royalties from it to supplement the millions of dollars per annum she scams from her followers. The book basically slags off the West and says how great India is. Of course the only answer is for everyone to join the author's cult and worship and enrich her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cult Brainwashing, $50 a Pop","review":"Written by the wealthy founder of the cult, Sahaja Yoga, Meta Modern Era is a convoluted mess of disjointed prose, Hindu lore and pop psychology.

Steer clear!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Inspirational Read","review":"This book is a fascinating read. As a Masters student of Modern English Studies, to me this text was a perfect example of post-colonial writing. Born in India under British rule in the 1920s, Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi played an important part in the country's liberation and for many years has been working hard towards world peace. In a new context of a world constantly threatened by international terrorism, Meta Modern Era has additional meaning. Full of innate insights that Shri Mataji shares with the reader, this book liberates and inspires. Whether you are reading from a point of interest in the Author, or in meditation, or as a student of the subaltern finding a voice, there are questions and answers to be found here. In an age of post-structuralist resistance to an essential or absolute truth, this book is a stimulating and enlightening breath of fresh air."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Changed My Life","review":"I feel as though I had been searching for this book all my life, and had given up on the possibility of real truth being found in the pages of a text.

I've read the book and, besides it's terrible mistakes and the ignorance of the so called godess, it would be important that authorities should take this subject in their hands.

Lack of Spirituality and maintaining Sacred traditions as referred by this Author, cause an emotional vaccum within our beings which we as a culture try to fill in with materialism. Hence, the feeling of true joy remains elusive. We are not just physical and mental beings but spiritual beings who without connection to our spirit feel empty.This book reaffirms to me the simple truths of Life and the need for us to feel a spiritual connection within ourselves and with others. It is transforming because it shifts me from the belief that I am merely human, to someone who is connected with the Divine, and therefore more precious."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a book","review":"What can i say?

If you've ever had a stressed family member or been bothered by stress yourself, you'll know how amazing it would be if you could be rid of this stress and just enjoy life.

These problems, however are becoming increasingly universal, and in her book, the author describes the plight of humanity with tremendous understanding. Such delicate issues as racism, materialism, nationalism, substace abuse and other collectively and personally self destructive trends are addressed in Meta Modern Era with compassion and with a sense of urgency. One can feel through the author's words her desire to see all of us rise above these sorts of crippling limitations.But what is most unique about \\"Meta Modern Era\\" is that Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi does not merely analyze our social ills; she offers solutions.

If it is the least bit warm outside, there will be condensation on all sides of it, and if you leave it in one spot for an hour, then move it and step on that spot with bare feet, the ground will be very cold.

Every single song is a masterpiece---buy this CD, you WON'T regret it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The horror!","review":"This CD is definitely not worth purchasing. The first track contains cursing and phrases with inappropriate meanings, as well as other tracks in the album, which is a poor example to her underage fans. I am disappointed at how someone who probably once was a well-behaved child could turn into such a yucky person. Another reason, which is the main reason why I am writing this, is because it caused my CD player to malfunction, to be more specific, practically explode. It had worked perfectly until I inserted this CD in it. So in conclusion, I advise you all not to buy \\"Britney\\". Spend your money on something more worthwhile, such as Charlotte Church's \\"Enchantment\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"talantless","review":"thanks for nothing, britney has been polluting our airwaves for years and has to be stopped.please someone STOP BRITNEYbob_chicken"},{"rating":"1","title":"A comment about 1crazy_sexy_cool1's review","review":"YOU SAID IN YOUR REVIEW:\\"Britney's real voice sounds alot more stronger, the exact opposite of what some of you said.

It's a great mix of producers and writers ranging from The Neptunes to her longtime collaborator Max Martin who is what made Britney her signature sound. It's a nice transition from teen pop idol to dance diva. The songs are great and bouncy and there's only one lone ballad here written by Dido the single \\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman\\" which has a great message. I also love \\"Let Me Be\\" produced by \\"DarkChild\\" as well as the remake of \\"I Love Rock 'n Roll.\\" \\"Britney\\" uses her own voice as the chorus unlike \\"Oops...I Did It Again.\\" Other highlights are the disco style \\"Anticipating\\" and the hit \\"Overprotected\\" even though I wish they had a bonus track of the raido version remix by DarkChild. While Britney hasn't had a album worthy of 5 whole stars yet \\"Britney\\" is her breaking point from teen pop. I thought \\"In The Zone\\" would be much better than it was but overall \\"Britney\\" is still in my book her best album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sex Music!?","review":"THis whole album seemed to me to be more about Britney showing off her skin instead of her actually singing.

Or any Britney CD's have"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Admit I Bought This CD","review":"I never really was a Britney Spears fan but I bought this CD because I had heard several songs and really liked them. After hearing the whole entire CD, I realized I had wasted my money.

(It's a theory I'm testing out, do not ask.) Of the three albums I have heard from Britney (this, In the Zone, and Oops! I Did It Again), this is the most painful to listen to, despite producing efforts from the Neptunes on songs such as \\"I'm a Slave 4 U.\\" (IMO, I like the beat, but Britney's singing is terrible on this track.) Of all the songs on this album (including that lovely end duet with Justin Timberlake), the songs triumphantly featured on the terrible movie \\"Crossroads\\" are the worst: my least favorite song, Britney's cover of \\"I Love Rock and Roll,\\" had me longing for Joan Jett's more anarchic rendition (and remember, this song was not performed for a bunch of karaoke patrons like in the movie). If you want to start listening to Britney Spears, this is not the album to start with."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"Ok. This is the poorest album I've ever heard!

You're not able to hear HER, like the music is drowning her out on some songs.Having said that though, the album is a fun album. I bought the album not really looking for VOICE from Britney Spears but for FUN. And in my opinion, that's what I got.I don't understand why people give her a hard time, I remember Madonna and Janet starting out the same way-and still continue success and neither of them have a great voice either and look at where both of them are!! Britney, I think will be around as long as Madonna and Janet has."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the top albums of 2001","review":"Britney Spears' newest album, Britney, is by far her most entertaining and catchy album yet! I would definitely have to say that it was one of the best albums of 2001. It has the catchy songs that make you want to get up and dance, such as \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\". This album covers more genres than her previous two, with songs such as \\"Anticipating\\", and the classic cover of \\"I Love Rock n' Roll\\". Britney is definitely a talented young lady who is going to be around for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best from the best","review":"Put quite simply, this is the best pop CD released in a very long time.

She was very smart in going the more r&b/pop way instead of sticking to bubblegum pop. She is growing and so are her fans and you can tell in her songs. My personal favs are: \\"overprotected\\",\\"anticipating\\",\\"let me be\\", \\"that's where you take me\\", and of course \\"slave4u\\". Some songs could have been left off like \\"lonely\\" and \\"what's it's like to be me\\" but overall excellent. Some of her younger fans might be disapointed in the change for there are no childish songs like \\"soda pop\\" or \\"lucky\\" on the cd. If your 16 to 21 you'll love it!! i know i'm about to listen to it now...."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't really like this album","review":"britney's voice was alright with the first album but it was in decline since then though the music on oops wasn't that bad. But when I heard slave 4 u and how britney claimed she feels its the best song she's ever written I was very disappointed and hated everything about the beat and the lack of melody in it. That song grew on me though and I appreciate it for what it has to offer. Boys and Lonely are the only other good songs here and I'm Not a Girl Not Yet a Woman is cute though the voice really sucks and the music is nice. This album overall is a hot mess though and britney's voice is at her worst especially on the song cinderella. Check out In the Zone and Oops if you want to hear alright music from britney but don't expect a good voice"},{"rating":"2","title":"converting the britney haters","review":"I thought Britney Spears was going nowhere, but this changed my mind. Like someone else said, it's not the best artistic effort ever, but you can definitely see it as a good start.

SHe has surprised me with how well she has started that transition. Now we just got to see what happens next."},{"rating":"1","title":"A slave for you..........with a bad voice and no personality","review":"I received a leaked copy of this album and was very disappointed with it. Other than the single \\"Slave 4 U\\", I really only liked a couple of the songs. I am a fan of pop music, but I'm just not feeling this album. There's very little substance, just more nonsensical video friendly spewing. \\"I Love Rock 'n' Roll\\" is an interesting choice for a cover, and it works well in this case. I also like the song \\"Bombastic Love\\", which features great production. Overall this album is more of the same, so I can only recommend it to people who already like Brintey Spears."},{"rating":"1","title":"STOP!!!!!!","review":"For the love of God, please stop making records, Brit. You have no talent what so ever and your sending a message to girls that in order to recognized, all you need is to be good looking. To those who are buying her \\"records\\", STOP IT!!!

The only good song is \\"what its like to be me\\", otherwise the cd is horrible"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"I haven't heard the whole album, but I've heard 8 songs out of the twelve by downloading them. There all good, except I'm A Slave 4 U is getting annoying now! My favourite songs that I've heard are: Not A Girl Not Yet A Women(slow song, great job Britney), I Love Rock & Roll(hardest song I've heard, well done), Cinderella(especially this one), Lonely(fast paced, really well done) and Boys(is pretty good). Overall, out of the 8, it's probably the best 8 songs I've heard from, excluding Stronger. I definetely recommend this from what I've heard, and hey, even if the other 4 aren't good, that's still getting your money's worth. I've heard plenty of worse albums, trust me! Way to go Britney, TWO THUMBS UP! Her BEST so far! Be sure to catch Britney in Crossroads, also TWO THUMBS UP!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Triumphant Third Effort","review":"Britney Spears has made it clear that she is \\"Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman\\" with her third album, simply titled 'Britney'. Spears has matured into a songwriter, and co-producer, along with the Neptunes, (famous for work with rock artists). The third album is said to be the 'coming of age album' for an entertainer, and Spears proves that. She demonstrates stronger, less juvenile vocals, and a more urban beat. The beat has a hip-hop and techno aura about it, and more honest lyrics. She shows she has staying power through re-inventing herself, (a certain Madonna-esque), and moving on to a nineteen-year-old image, and even lower low-riders. Britney has an ... attidude, and is definitely catchy. During the duration of the album, you will snap, stomp, belt, reminisce, laugh, shake and jerk your head (to the side), and shake your bonbon until it hurts. Uptempo groove-thang of an album, with a light-heartedness, that proves, GIRLS JUST WANNA HAVE FUN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it...","review":"Quite a let-down from her previous album (too much disco influence). Most of the songs sound like variations of each other or of the weakest song of her previous album (which in my opinion was One Kiss From You).

Hopefully next time, there will be a little more time spent on writing and producing songs that are different..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock On","review":"This album has all the beats and it just keeps on going. From a serious song that pulls at the heart to a fast and upbeat song that gets you dancing. It has no mistakes in it.

I promise."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY GOOD BRITNEY","review":"I think this is Britney's best CD to date. I play this CD all the time.

I have always loved Britney's cds until now. The song I'm A Slave for you is a really fun song to listen to with but with all the strange panting and the little parts were she goes \\"I just want to have sex with you.\\" is a little out of hand. So it's hard to really know if the song is good or bad. The other songs on here are very well put together but the not very great songs out number the good. So I guess it all depends on your taste of music because some won't like it and others won't. But for me I could of done with out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obnoxious","review":"Well at least I can say Britney's true personality came out in this recording. Spears is a brat that can't even say \\"Hi\\" to her fans who think the world of her (remember the crowd of young pre-teen girls in the UK that Britney snubbed?).For a singer with such a self-proclaimed \\"protective\\" parent, it amazes me that Britney could come out on stage in such outfits, with songs like \\"I'm a Slave 4U\\", a song with no musical quality and lyrics that are trampy at best.Spears tops off her brattyness with \\"I'm not a Girl, Not Yet A Woman\\". Supposedly its about a girl coming of age. But in Britney's clearly immature view of the world, the lyrics are implying 'leave me a lone to do what I want I don't care what you think: just leave me your credit cards and bail me out when I can't take the pressure anymore'.Better luck next time Britney, as clearly your career is going the way of your failed New York restaurant 'NYLA'."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS CD IS HOT!","review":"Britney is doing her thing and this CD proves it!! She is writing for people her age and showing that she is no longer a little girl!! I am 20 yrs old and i can relate to the songs and i hear what shes saying! All of the tracks are funky and the beats are hot! I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants some good music to rock to!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Britney Has Ever Made Better","review":"I was very decepted by this album. Though the cover is beautiful, the songs all look the same and the whole album screams disaster. The only song that has a unique sound is \\"I'm a slave for you\\" but everyone knows Britney ever did better than that. But I appreciate a lot the song \\"I'm not a girl, not yet a woman\\", the lyrics are great and the melody is relaxing, but if you compare to Oops I did it again CD, you might really appreciate better \\"Where are you now\\" as a slow song. The song \\"I love Rock'N'Roll\\" is awesome too, but it's nothing but a look-a-like of Oop's I did it again's \\"Satisfaction\\". Frankly if you like pop music, you might prefer way more the two first albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, no, not another album","review":"I have seen it before, the running of 13-year-old girls to a britny spears concert. I felt sorry for them and scoffed then burst out laughing. That reminds me of this CD mostly. Think I have never listened to it? No, the radio plays this crap a lot and therefore, I switch the station to something better like... nails on a chalkboard. She can't sing, and she's the worst role model for anybody. She even called herself a [huffy] (I'm not going to say what she actually said for the fear of being edited.)If you like britny spears, and if you are 13, it is time to find yourself a band with real music."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't even deserve one star!","review":"This album is so awful it doesnt even deserve \\"one\\" star! I only gave it one because, see... well, it just saddens me that a girl who thinks she looks good thinks that means she has 'what it takes' to be a singer! ugh...I don't think so girly! and if you've heard her voice when singing you'll know what I mean!No, no, no, the real reason I only gave her one star is really because I couldn't give her a zero! You know, everytime I hear one of her songs, whether it be on the radio or on television, I get sick to my stomach. I remember one time I almost nearly hurled! I kid you not! Please don't waste your money on this! It'll be your biggest regret!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment","review":"This CD is a shift in Britney's style, but a shift for the worse. Melody was sacrificed for harsh rhythms in an attempt to uncover the \\"matured\\" Britney, so that there's more noise than music. However, it amazes me that the same masses who praised Britney at her debut are now claiming that this album is her best, although it's radically different.If you liked Britney before this album and you don't want to change your opinion about her music, stay away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Her weakest album yet.","review":"Britney Spears's Britney album is a 12 track fiasco. Only two songs truly grabbed my attention which are That's Where you Take me, and Lonely. She shows potential on songs like Anticpating and Let Me Be but the rest of the songs are pretty awful and embarrasing like the song, Bombastic Love. In the Zone and Oops...I did it again are her best albums. Of course lately I could care less about Spears, her career is in the toilet and she knows it. This album was a waste of time and money for the pop princess, I am sorry to say but she could use some singing lessons, her success ain't because she has a spectacular voice, her success is all image. This disc belongs in a junk yard, skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"Being a fan of Britney, I probably would've given this CD a good review anyway, but this is her best album to date. But don't take only my word for it, everyone I know likes it(and they aren't even Britney fans). No song sounds like another one, and it shows a more mature Britney. Unlike many pop 'divas' today, she never feels the need to make every word an octave tour de force. She's not Celine, and she doesn't try to be. From the infectious \\"That's Where You Take Me\\" to the rockin' remake of Joan Jett's classic \\"I Love Rock n' Roll,\\" Brintey once again proves herself worthy of Madonna's crown."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?!?!?!","review":"Britney Spears was very popular when I was a kid. My sister gave me her first 2 albums (which by the way were great!) They were fun, had good songs, and good albums for a young girl. When I got this album I was to young to understand some things. Now I understand everything clearly. When I listen to this CD today, I think to myself \\"What kind of a song is BOYS?! That is the most stupidest, weirdest song on her album!\\" Along with I'm a slave 4 u. Uh, get real, Britney. Those are inappropriate songs that I don't think kids parents would want them listening to. I know my parents aren't a fan of them. It's kinda like rap. It's not the best music out there.

All of the songs start to sound the same after a while, the only two songs that I think are even slightly promising are Cinderella and What It's Like to be Me, but after a while I'd get sick of them too! This album sounds so different from her other two albums but it hasn't changed for the better! Take a listen to the samples and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about!

I do like the songs \\"Bombastic Love\\" and \\"Cinderella\\" is ok. The one song i think i so unbelievably bad is \\"Im not a girl, not yet a woman\\" OMG she sounds sooooo bad in.

She CAN'T sing. Her music is just plain terrible, if she wants a different, sexy direction that would be artistic then being a stripper at some classy bar would be a better bet than releasing this.If you bought this album, then I suggest the best way to use it would be to beat the person who reccomended this to you with it. If you are looking for some good music I reccomend Tool or Pink Floyd. If you want an album that has been released recently I suggest either the new Perfect Circle,the Beatles album, or Coldplay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apalling and Appealing","review":"First, let me say that I am not a fan of Britney Spears. I bought this album merely to hear what all the fuss was over this easily packageable star. While I thought most of the songs were completely overproduced and vulgar, and the way that she \\"sings\\"(most of the time, her voice reduces to what im guessing is supposed to be a seductive whisper), I give her 2 stars for taking a risk at switching writing teams,and her style of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Change","review":"Whereas \\"...Baby One More Time\\" and \\"Oops! I Did It Again\\" are bubblegum pop, the results of the teen-pop revival our dear pop princess started in the late 90's, this one is a real change. Britney is now an adult, and needs to leave the bubblegum pop behind, or she won't get very popular anymore. This is the result of the changes, but she's added sex in it. The titles say it all. She is \\"overprotected\\", loves \\"boys\\" and \\"rock & roll\\", is \\"not a girl, not yet a woman\\". I have an international edition with \\"When I Found You\\", \\"I Run Away\\" and \\"Before the Goodbye\\". I like the first two, the singles, and \\"Anticipating\\". I just don't get why none of them went even Top 10. However, Britney has given us something to smile about. In this more mature record, she shows us \\"what it's like to be her\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was what all the hype was about?","review":"I used to be a pretty BIG Britney fan and then died out, but i'd heard such wonderful things about this cd, thinking it was going to be good i went out and bought it. I was shocked at how wrong everyone was. It lacked something, her emotion. No offence to britney or other artists like her but she could of taken more time to make the tracks better using better vocals etc. It also seemed she talked about the same thing over and over... herself and boyz don't get me wrong good topic but after awhile it gets old. Lots of Talking Lacked the Singing like we saw in her 1st album..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"1. I'm A Slave 4 U 5/5 One of her best songs2.

But, I thought I'd take my chances buying this record, because of the club favorite \\"I'm A Slave 4 U,\\" and you know what? I actually enjoyed this album! Even though my statement about the lyrics remains true on this album (-one star). Blood flowing songs such as \\"Lonely,\\" \\"Overprotected,\\" \\"I Love Rock & Roll,\\" electronic-crazy \\"What It's Like To Be Me,\\" and sweet innocent lullabys \\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman,\\" and \\"That's Where You Take Me,\\" shows that Britney deserves a little more respect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do yourself a favor and buy this","review":"(...) I don't really turn to this CD for spiritual enlightenment. I turn to this CD for jammin pop music that is undenyably fun! And isn't that what music should be about, fun! In this respect, Brintey truly is the queen of pop! If I am looking for deep, spiritual enlightenment, I turn to Dostoevsky, not Britney. But is you are looking to have fun then I would recommend this CD immediately. I have noticed in my high school that the happypeople enjoy Britney music while the mopey, sad ones can't stand her. I'm sure there are plenty of people reading this who would love to start up an argument with me, but it wouldn't really be worth it - now would it.

She definatly changed her style, for better or for worse. She went in the same direction as NSYNC*, which was a more techno sound to their music.

This one is a great listen, and is well worth it. There are a great many of catchy dance tracks.

I was hoping for some growth but I guess that's all she got to offer. Just download the CD if you want it. It's a waste of money otherwise. I kinda like \\"I'm Not Yet A Girl....\\" and \\"Overprotected.\\" So, there's the star she deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Again, another awful album by the so called pop princess","review":"Okay first of all she never should have been allowed to do a cover of Joan Jetts I Love Rock N Roll.

There are a couple of catchy songs on this album but it's not worth it, save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"What happened with Britney? She was so pretty, so talented, and now she takes on the image of a garbage bag in a dumpster in a New York ally. Sure, \\"I Love Rock N' Roll\\" is a good re-make, possibly, in my opinion, better then the original. And sure, \\"Cinderella\\" has the same pop sound as songs on Britney's previous album, Oops...I Did It Again. But what's with all the disgusting photos and cussing lyrics? Does Britney not realize how badly people that aren't in her trash-trance make fun of her? It seems like she just keeps getting worse and worse with every album.(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"people are finally catching on","review":"I knew from the beginning she was trailer trash and this album confirmed it even more she can't sing worth a penny at all, she can only afford good songwriters, and even they can't enhance her abilities.

But stupid girls my age were buying this [...], disgusting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"Another album with slutty songs written by horny guys who can't get any action. Britney gets more pathetic with each album. There are so many more talented artists out there: Ashlee Simpson, Gretchen Wilson, Leann Rimes, Shania Twain, Christina Aguilera, Mandy Moore n Hilary Duff. All who write their own music and have actual talent. I agree with Kristen Dunker \\"Kat\\" This album is pure smut and sends an inappropriate message to young girls.

I would listen and sing along and all. But now she's trying to turn her music into something totally different. I think the idea was great, but she didn't do it right. She complains too much in this CD...to me it seems as if she feels sorry for herself.Her songs are not her style. Maybe if Alanis or Avril or someone like that had sung this, it would have turned out good. But I just hate it when Pop singers try to turn like this. it never works out..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets Better and Better","review":"I read some of the other reviews and saw that quite a few people didn't really dig on Britney's new album. People said that it was too mature for twelve year old girls. Well, I think that it is a more mature album...since Britney is growing up...and she's doing a great job. The fans that were twelve when she started are growing up and so is she, so it would have to be assumed that her music would mature as well. I think this album showed off her style and gave her some freedom in the writing process. I loved it and think it's the best yet.I'm A Slave 4 U has such a great beat and makes me want to dance. Boys is a great tribute to Janet Jackson's Nasty Boys...but better. I absolutely love Anticipating and it makes me just want to have fun. There's a lot of heart and soul in \\"Britney\\" and it's more mature than the other two. Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best CD EVER!","review":"Britney's latest work is awesome!! To all those britney haters: Listen to the album before you decide anything about her. Don't be jelous of her talent and beauty! Well I think everyone out ther should have this CD in your collection. The beats make you want to get up and dance! I can't get enough of it! Go Brit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So this is it ??","review":"Although I liked the first single \\"I'm a slave for you\\" for its freshness I have to say that Britney's 3rd album is disappointing.Most of the songs are lame. And unlike promised she did not write \\"all the songs except 2\\" only co-write 5 tracks.Contrary to her last album this one does not seem to have a theme that dominates it, it is more like a chaotic mix.The cover version of I love rock'n'roll is nice but not innovative at all.The songs Overprotected, Cinderella and Let me be are funky though.But I don't think that's enough to save the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your $","review":"I only listened to the samples...but just from listening to them I can hardly stand to listen to 30 seconds of some of these songs. There are only about 3-4 good songs. Those would be \\"Slave\\", \\"Overprotected\\" \\"NAGNYAW\\", & \\"Cinderella\\" The rest are awful! I was turned off just by \\"I Love Rock & Roll\\" It cannot even be compared to the original! It's so bad. She sounds like her nose is plugged! But then again she does in about half of her songs. She seriously needs to learn how to SING and get rid of that funky \\"techno\\" stuff that makes her voice sound even more (...). Just my opinion. I usually like any music, but this is just awful. I liked \\"Baby One More Time\\" and \\"Oops\\" but each time she gets worse. This is definitely not her best work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummm, is Britney going to grow up?","review":"The first album was an achiever: ...Baby, One More Time was excellent and cemented the vestal virgin' Sexy and Seventeen routine for all the guys in the audience. I did like I'm a Slave 4 U since it had a Paisly Park (Prince) appeal but the rest of the album was so fassssssst, it just didn't gell. Well, guys, sex appeal only goes so far when production is razor thin. Kids will actually find this \\"music\\" great, but the grown-up audience that loved the first album and liked some of the 2nd will be disappointed in the Pop Princess.

Don't waste you're money, not to mention your well-being."},{"rating":"1","title":"... what happened?","review":"Fans looking for the innocent pop stylings of Britney Spears will be severely jolted by her self-titled album. The romantic, upbeat, peppy and fun songs that we loved on \\"baby... one more time\\" and \\"oops! I did it again...\\" are missing. In their place are violent, choppy modern -- what? it's not rock, it's not pop, it's not rap. It's kind of a techno combination of all three. Britney rasps her voice (she'd better quit or risk permanently damaging her vocal chords) and plays around halfheartedly with forgettable lyrics. What happened?In addition, her works are getting progressively more raunchy. Mild profanity. Innuendo. Rebellion. And then there's the accompanyment. The CD itself is engraved with three obviously naked fairies. The back of the disk (and most of the insert) sports Britney in a barely-there ensemble at that at first glance makes you think she's topless.This is one fan who's decided to pull the plug. And unfortunately, this album makes it much easier than I thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"I won't of bought this cd.....","review":"I actually Got Britney free through an offer. I only gave it 2 stars because there is a few songs because there is some good songs. I'm Not yet,a woman is good. I'm A Slave For you is good also. I don't reccomend this cd though. If you like the chipmunks then this is for you because that is what she sounds like. If you are offered this cd free only take it for the few good songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice to see less album filler...","review":"I think the main difference with this album compared to her 1st 2 is that all the songs that havent been released as singles are actually pretty decent.\\"I'm a slave 4 u\\" sounds very different to her previous hits showing she can actually sing a different song and not keep recycling her old songs. \\"Not a girl,Not yet a woman\\" is actually quite good for a ballad from Britney as we all know ballads aren't her best songs. Don't expect anything to different, alot of it is still teen bubblegum stuff, but some of it is alot different.Overall, i'd say its her best album and alot of fun to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Britney Does It Again","review":"\\"Britney\\" is an excellent cd. It has a much funkier and mature sound than her previous attempts. Each song holds it's own and there's no limit to variety. She tries it all - pop, r&b, dance. Though she doesnt have the most able voice, she still manages to produce good vocals in every song. This one is definately one to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Britney Finally Bursts The Bubble","review":"When I heard Britney Spears had a new CD coming I thought it would be another teeny bopper like the previous two. Don't get me wrong I loved those CDs but it was time for Britney to get out of radio Disney for a while. This new CD brings her to a higher and more respectable level \\"I'm a Slave for you\\" simply describes her love and passion for music the rest of the songs show how much talent she's got. Even though she may not yell as loud as Christina or Jessica, Britney defenetly has the beat both of them are missing, so in other words Ms Spears has done it again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this is my opinion...don't waste your money","review":"ok i've heard the album a day before it was released. and i'm sorry but that cd was boring. i'll admit that 'i'm a slave 4 u' was a good song. it's the ONLY good song on the WHOLE cd. i got tired listening to the songs. they all sound very much alike and all sound dumb. she still has that 'little girl' sound that i never liked. but to all you britney fans, you'll probably like it. sounds just like her other cd's. but if you really want some quality music i wouldn't buy this cd. well that's just my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Britney! Stop hanging on to Max Martin!","review":"Her voice is too strain and there is no way she can reinvent herself! How can she be her own person when dirty old males are still writing her songs! I never hear her songs on the radio...only on MTV! Britney needs to realize she won't have a long term music career like Christina Aguilera. Christina is way ahead of Britney when it comes to keeping music fresh...just look at Christina's latest video, \\"Figher\\"! Christina is actually learning from Madonna's career how to stay strong in the music industry. Even though Britney already has three albums (all rushed and done without giving any thought to creativity), avoid getting Ms. Spears 3rd installment..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this album.....!","review":"I think it's one of my favorite cd's ever..i can't stop listening to it..it has all the songs that u can dance to..and sing along with.

In my opinion I liked her years ago but now I don't really care for her music. The music is catchy but the songs are the same. Its like listening to her whole album in one song. It is pretty annoying. But that is my opinion if your daughter or you enjoy Britney then hey buy the CD. I mean why me stop you. All I can say is please don't buy this CD if your child is under 10 years old b/c of the sexual content in the CD. I mean If you want your child to be hearing ima slave 4 you,dance up on me,hell, and swearing words then buy it lol. I just hope for better music in the future from Britney maybe a different beat.I know she can do better then this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A creative cover, but thats where it ends...","review":"Being her sophmore album, I thought I would give Britney a chance. After all, the constant bambardment over the past three years of endless pop music has softened me up. So, I put aside my angry girl music and popped in what was to be the \\"grown up Britney.\\" I was suprised to hear the girl who doesn't think of herself as a \\"sex kitten\\" all tarted up and ready for action. Although Britney seems to tests the boundries with her fans and critics, this album seems too grown up for the under thirteen market and too kiddie for the adult in me. Nice try Brit, maybe next time you could release two albums; one that's PG and one that doesn't need to blurp out the \\"S\\" word."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets better and better each time...","review":"Excellent disc! I was expecting to hear a more slow and lala singing release with Britney Spear's newest release, but most of the songs are faster paced and good to listen to over and over! My personal favorite is track 2, Overprotected. This is a -must- purchase for any britney fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Carbon copies","review":"Well, I have to compliment Britney on keeping up with her image. This CD is very sensual. Seems like all the songs involve her, a guy, & sex. And in all the songs, there's a standard beat, & some girls singing higher than Britney (who is singing low). Some of the songs borrow things from other artists & one of the songs Britney just re-did. There is nothing outstanding about the way this CD was done, and there is nothing stunning about her vocals. A good artist wouldn't have to promote themselves by wearing revealing clothes & dancing among writhing bodies. Sorry everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Britney Sucks","review":"Britney is one of the worst vocalists I have ever heard (Vanessa Carlton is right up there with her, though). She repeats her songs from \\"Baby one More Time\\" and \\"Oops, I did It Again\\" on this CD, changes the title, screeches \\"AWWWW\\" a couple more times, and, boom, a hit single.This CD over all sucks, big time. If you are a fan of people who sound like they are being run over by a Subway downtown, you might actually like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Best from Britney","review":"Well, I have to say that yes this is her best cd to date. But that isn't saying much. Britney Spears is a packaged girl who is now complaining about how she is so \\"overprotected\\". I'm sorry but the girl goes around in little to nothing infront of her fan base (13 and under girls and 35 and older guys). But still this is her best work to date, as to quote a friend after she had listened to the album: \\"I like the voice they created for her.\\" (to bad the voice is only 1 octive). The best stand out songs are \\"I'm a slave 4 U\\" and \\"Overprotected\\". Anyone who is an *NSYNC fan will surely pick up on the \\"me\\" song in the song (listen to \\"It's gonna be me\\" and listen how Justin sings the \\"me\\" and you'll understand). I doubt it will win her a grammy or too much respect, but the cd will satisfy her fans, atleast untill they all grow up alittle."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Review","review":"Classics (expect to hear these on the radio for years to come): I'm A Slave 4 U.Flavor Of The Week Hits (don't expect to hear it again once the single after it is released): Boys, Overprotected, I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman.Should-have-been-hits: None.Never-should-have-been-created crap: I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman, What It's Like To Be Me, That's Where You Take Me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just learn how to scream like Christina Aguilera!!!!","review":"Seriously... I must admit, this album is not good as her last 2 albums.We all know BRITNEY SPEARS can not sing... I am going to say this again, she can not sing! She needs a vocal lessons in this album, if she wants to re-record it.Her voice changes... sometimes it sounds like a womans than it sounds like a 12 yr old girl is trying to sing... *WEIRD*My advice is, she needs to learn how to scream, like XTINA, and she is off to better successful carrier!Dont buy this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Britney At Her Best","review":"Ok, so let's start off by sayin that unlike other reviews of this record who quote wrong lyrics (i wanna have sex with u???) that I find this to be Britneys best album yet. Obvious that she is now writin her own lyrics this album reminds me a lot of Janet Jackson's Control album. \\"Anticipating\\" is the greatest song Britney has recorded to date and is unquestionably a summer anthem. \\"Let Me Be\\" and \\"That's Where You Take Me\\" are great and never grow old. The only disappointment with the U.S. release are the omittance of two tracks \\"Before The Goodbye\\" and \\"I Run Away\\". I highly recommend this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops she did it again","review":"Now I know why I am not a Britney fan. The only song on this album with any kind of originality is \\"I'm a slave 4 U\\" and I even dislike this song. The rest of the album sounds like one big song that goes on for an hour. The entire sound of this album coupled with the juvenile lyrics makes for bad music. Sorry Britney"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good Pop C.D.","review":"Britney's new album is a fun, addictive c.d.

But let's face it, since then, she's gone down fast. Take \\"I'm a Slave for U\\", which is by far the best song on this album. The lyrics to the song's bridge are:Get it get it, get it get it (WHOOOA)Get it get it, get it get it (WHOOOOOA) (Do you like it)Get it get it, get it get it (OOOHHHH) (This feels good)(...)Quality music? You decide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reigning pop princess shows growth & maturity on new release","review":"The current queen of teen pop music delivers a new CD full of up-tempo, grown-up tunes. Tracks like \\"Boys\\" and \\"Anticipating\\" feature elements reminiscent of 1970's disco if that's your thing; or if you prefer \\"edgier\\" Britney, like on \\"Stronger\\" from her last release, then \\"Lonely\\" and \\"Cinderella\\" may be just for you. The leadoff track and single, \\"I'm A Slave 4 You\\" evokes memories of \\"Control\\"-era Janet Jackson, and the latest release (at the time of this review), \\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman,\\" may be the 19-year old diva's finest vocal performance yet. The cover of the Arrows' \\"I Love Rock 'n' Roll,\\" best known as recorded by Joan Jett, is far superior to Miss Spears's earlier covers of Sonny & Cher and Rolling Stones classics. This sort of music isn't my thing; but I actually enjoyed this CD. (...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Britney Breaks New Ground!","review":"Britney's work with the Swedish Acoustic Symphony Orchestra on this masterpiece should be studied in every music theory class in the country.Not only does she explore strong Elizabethan progressive rock (while playing a flute on one foot), but she's also given us groundbreaking television commercials with the will-be anthem \\"We Will Rock You\\", which I hear has already been covered by lesser British pop combos.Keep an eye out for her next concept-opus about social injustice, bourgeois satire, and political upheaval....or dating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I must admit that I'm not a die hard Britney fan and that I went off her for a while, but i really liked Slave 4U as it was so different. I was excited about the release of the new album, but unfortunately was very quite disappointed with it when I got to listen to it.It has got some ok tracks on it, but they're not at all individual and sound very alike. One of the tracks sounds like a NSync album track, unsurprising since Justin did some writing on her album. There is only one proper ballad on there; I'm not a girl, not yet a woman, and it's not very strong.This album lacks the content of the first two, it feels like she's trying to be Michael Jackson, as in every song she half whispers some of the lyrics. It doesn't have the contrast in tracks of the first two and I don't think is a CD that I will be able to listen to over and over.Britney is good at the style of music from the frist two albums, she should have stuck to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Younger Audiences","review":"My 10 year old loves Britney.

She has some really catchy songs, nothing that will go down in history, but they are fun.This is almost unlistenable and I'm really sorry I bought it. The problem is with the production, I think, because the beats and stuff just sound lame."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"I love this Cd. I respect Britney for success in the music business, and this CD shows her growth as a singer. Each Cd gets better and better. Basically all of you trashing her are just jealous.

Go Britney!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid but fun","review":"Okay don't expect the meaning of life in Miss spears new album but it is light hearted and she is the queen of bubble gun. Actually don't expect the meaning of anything in this overproduced eye candy. Britney is a sweet girl, and her wanna be nastie is not working out. She should start going back saying \\"yal\\" and \\"yes mama\\"--we love her for it.For example her track \\"boys\\" starts off with her singing in her typical robotic recorder voice \\"so curious\\" over and over it is really annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good enough to own","review":"Admittedly, I mainly purcahsed this to keep my Britney collection complete, but there are some pretty great songs on it. Her version of \\"I Love Rock N Roll\\" is a true tribute to the classic and even the couple co-written by Britney herself were worth listening to. I'll be the first to say the girl needs to learn to wear clothes, but there's no denying her ability to sing and entertain."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't work.","review":"I received the item yesterday and it doesn't even work.

The prototype for all porno/pop stars and the goddess of countless logo sticks across America, her music is a by-product of an overhyped, over-sold, teen-obsessed culture. Although the song \\"I'm a Slave 4 U\\" has a danceable beat, the rest of the insipid whining that accompanies it doesn't justify this CD's purchase. Don't waste your time with this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why no 0 stars??????????????????????????????????????????????","review":"If Britney Spears was 50 years old and 300 pounds would anybody buy this?Not only did she sing songs written for her ,but she had to make a pop version of I Love Rock and Roll.I reccomend Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers new cd, The Last DJ instead of this ...If you want to hear I Love Rock and Roll buy Joan Jett's Greatest Hits."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"Only one word to describe this CD from britney...TRASH!!!Don't waste your money on this please! look at all the other bad reviews this album received, and you'll see what I mean and that it's not just my opinion or that I'm trying to hate.

Sure, Britney might've put some hip-hop into her songs and I respect that. But the songs like Overprotected and I'm not a girl ; Not Yet a Woman are just dumb songs! Listening to these songs are like reading a teeny-boppers diary! I'm sorry but if Britney should ever get any better I suggest that she'd stick to her hip-hop songs because pop just isn't doing her right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Britney's Best, but Close","review":"I thought Britney would never be able to top \\"Lucky\\" and \\"Stronger\\". This album has made me rethink her talent. The first track is so horrible, both musically and lyrically, that I refuse to call it by name, instead referring to it as \\"That stupid slave song\\" - so, naturally, it got the most publicity. The other tracks are much better. \\"Overprotected\\" has a good tune and awesome lyrics; \\"I'm Not a Girl\\" is one of the best slow songs I've ever heard; \\"What it's Like to be Me\\" is her upbeat and enjoyable retort to all the people who hate her without even knowing her. Not all of the songs are good - \\"Boys\\" is almost as bad as the stupid slave song - but the good tracks make this CD well worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Britney? Disappointed.","review":"I would like to say that it was a great CD, and I honestly do like Britney, but quite frankly she has changed her image too much - from the girl next door to the raunchy and (...) girl on the corner. Her songs on this album sound identical from one another. They have the same tunes, the same beats. It was extremely disappointing to me. I think the only good song is \\"Anticipating\\" and yet it isn't even that great. I was sitting and wondering to myself why people even like her.. but then again, I guess it's true: Sex sells."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgous!","review":"I personally think that this the the best album of Britney Spears, every song in this album is amazing!!

Loves it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick of it","review":"If you like CANNED music then this is for you. Britney does not make real music. She can not sing.

It's obvious that they think it's just a beauty contest. Fine, if Spears really wants fame, she should become a model - but if she doesn't write all her music, she doesn't play an instrument, and she doesn't sing very well, SHE'S NOT MEANT TO BE CALLED A MUSICIAN!

Britney barely sings...she whines and sounds like she's in pain when she attempts to hit a high note. You can barely even hear her through the over-produced background music that attempts to drown out her voice so you don't notice how horrible she is. No wonder she lipsyncs in concert. This isn't real music. I would give it a zero if I could. Mandy Moore is so much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Britney Cd Ever !","review":"This album Is so cool! My favorite songs are I'm A Slave 4 U,Overprotected,I'm Not Yet A Girl, Not Yet A Woman ,Boys It has a realy good beat,Anticapating like a 60's, 70's, 80's kind of beat and I Love Rock 'N' Roll.Her music has changed as the years went buy.One time I went to her concert before and It was cool!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"For me, this is a big disappointment. I have both previous Britney albums, and have enjoyed them immensely, especially her debut album. But this, what is supposed to be a musical departure, doesnt sound that different and certainly doesnt contain a lot of the melodies that attracted me to Britney in the first place.'Slave' is interesting, and yes, is a more mature style for her. My favourite track on the album is 'Boys' but hey, there is such a similarity between this and Prince's 'Get Off'.A disappointing album, but I am not writing her off yet.One for the fans I think..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Britney Spears is living proof that sex sells because outside of those blonde locks, and silicone implants there really isn't any talent. Let's face it this isn't someone that's going to get deep and heavy about E=MC^2 any time soon. Most of what she has going for her is superficial, or prefabricated by either her management or her high paid handlers. Hopefully her next album 'Zone' will have a song or two that hints at her relationship with her ex-Justin Timberflake. If not 'Zone' could have a hole in it bigger than the ozone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Britney has got what it takes. This album is off the hook. She has definately proven herself as the pop princess. This is by far her best album yet. I hope that she releases at least 8 of the tracks. This album was definately put together. Britney needs to stay with the same writers on this album. If the next album is like this I will totally be a slave to buying her albums.Keep up the good work Britney and I hope to see your movie in February (the best month in the year)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy Now Regret Later!","review":"Now I'm a partial britney fan, I cannot say I completely love her or hater. After one listen to this record theres no doubt that britney is growing up and desperately trieng to establish herself as a true Artist and she's half way there with this record. This album lacks Baby One More Time's sweet ballads like \\"From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart\\" and \\"Email My Heart\\". But yet has Oop's I did it again's uptempo strong points like \\"Stronger\\" and \\"What U See Is What You Get\\". So if your one of those chosen few who don't regret, than just buy the album and think later!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet another amazing album from Ms. Britney Spears ....","review":"This album is, by far, the greatest work I have seen from Britney Spears.

This is music that teenagers actually can relate to and all of it is extremely catchy. I am sorry but I can stand it when people say that her music has no emotional depth at all. COME ON! She is only 20 years old! She hasn't even experienced life yet. What do you expect? Her to be singing about drug abuse, depression, or suicide like most rock singers. And if you don't think I Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman or Let Me Be aren't personal, what is?Anway this is an awesome cd that everyone should have! It is fun, catchy, and positive.

The image she conveys to the teenagers throughout the world that listen to her music is becoming worse. The innocence of the \\"Baby One More Time\\" album is lost, and an indescribable feeling of disgust swells over me at the sight of fashion styles on the front cover.It should be noted that her music is also degrading in quality. The tunes that delivered a message and could be hummed repeatedly in her first album have evolved to the newer songs including \\"I'm a Slave 4 U\\" that deliver no message (poor lyrics). Britney's a great dancer, but if the music seems bland, it's very important to ask yourself a question whether you're buying: because of her publicity and image or because you truly like the music.Folks, this album has hit blank space. Her voice in this album definitely lacks the resonance of previous albums, and I strongly do not suggest this. A true blow to pop culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncreative album title","review":"I spend a lot of time with my friend's daughters, so it helps me keep my finger on the pulse of today's youth.THIS is good music by today's standards?Okay, okay- I'll admit that when they played the cd for me, it got my booty shaking a little bit.

To be Jive would be completely embaressing. Not only does the album have one song (I'm A Slave 4 U) as the only song worth buying the album for, but it completly lacks the same Britney success she had two albums before.I am completely sadened with this album and the content, though it is clear Britney would do better as an Rock&Roll artist or at least Alternative. However, she looks to be heading down the path of former teen-sensations/pop-princesses, Tiffany and Debbie Gibson (Where are they now? My point exactly!).I can fortell the future for Spears' and that is the next album being her Greatest Hits! At least we will be able to hear the old material that was traditional and enjoyable instead of the disgraceful material found on \\"Britney\\". Overall, Mandy Moore's self-titled album is a way better choice for purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Yawner","review":"Once again, Britney has unleashed her tedious muck upon the world. No doubt every 9-12 year old girl with hormone problems will desire to own this one, plus its companions in the upcoming merchandising campaign. At least it has educational value--At least this way, our young future women will know how to behave like (...). I don't have any particular problem with Ms. Spears, and this is because my problem is with the music, which she has absolutely nothing to do with.

'Slave 4 U' had a good video and a catchy chorus but was well below par for the 20 year old, whereas 'Boys' didn't even have those. I thought 'Overprotected' was good, though, and thankfully this CD is filled with songs like this. 'Lonely' is one of my faves, as catchy as some of her first efforts, whilst 'Anticipating' is also memorable if a little risque. My personal favourite track, though - and surely a single release in the future - is \\"Cinderella\\". Bring on album four!"},{"rating":"2","title":"*~ A new sound for Britney Spears*~","review":"Ok.

I loved \\"Baby One More Time..\\" and \\"Oops.. I Did it Again\\" but there were a few songs I didnt like on her new album.Some of my favorites are Overprotected, Lonely, Not a Girl; Not Yet a Woman, and Cinderella. None of the songs were awful but I like to hear her sing and in some of the songs theres too many sound effects to even make out her voice.I hope her next album focuses more on her vocals than her vocals being tuned out by sound efefcts. Sometimes her voice sounds abnormal due to the effects and I thought that was a drawnack.But other than that Brit has a pretty good album out and I love listening to some of the songs~ I just wish she would get back some of her old musical style~"},{"rating":"2","title":"so what if she can't sing?","review":"if you haven't realized this by now, maybe you should have your hearing checked. and if you're looking to buy it because you think maybe her voice has somehow turned into whitney houston's overnight, you're sadly delusional. this is not an album one buys for the vocals. buy it purely because it's fun to sing with. if you take it solely at face value, it's a great album. if nothing else, shell out the fourteen dollars (or buy it on tape...it's even cheaper), put it in your car, and turn up the volume. you'll warrant odd looks from other drivers at stoplights, but it'll be highly entertaining. and for godsake, give her a break. if you were getting paid to do what she does, you would. regardless of your talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creuset Casseroles are the Best","review":"The single best pots for doing rich chicken dishes and the like.

Mr. Aitken's equally excellent review above makes further comment redundant. As for Ms. Malter, who also reviewed this book and whose other reviews I have encountered recently, there seems no limit to her ability to mis-comprehend, distort and denigrate a carefully written, balanced work and its author. One can scarcely believe that she actually read the book given her stream of nonsequetors, factual error and rantings.

It finally just broke. I needed a new camera - after many hours of research we decided to buy a canon. We bought the 85 and the 120. We took identical pictures with both cameras. The 85 had red eye problems even when the red-eye function was on. The 120 has similar but fewer red-eye problems. The color and crispness was beautiful. However, the red-eye simply ruins the photos. I never used the red-eye function on my Ricoh - and when reviewing my last few hundred photos - I noticed that I never had red-eye. I'm so dissapointed that Ricoh no longer sells the 35mm. I returned both cameras. I am now stuck with no camera.

The kit serves its purpose, we can keep 4 rolls and a battery in the side pouch, which I feel is more than enough for a normal photographer. Pictures are crystal clear, very neat and perfect images, no shadding or patches. The Zoom buttons are in a comfortable place, which makes the user to focus very easily, unlike other cameras.

The only interesting aspects of the book are collected newspaper clippings (most of which are illegible) and assorted photos, although they feature none of the bands from the latee 70s and 80s. By far the worst aspect of the book though is Russo's attempts at deciphering conceptual continuity, which run: '\\"Zomby Woof\\" is a corruption of \\"Zombie Wolf\\"' No! Really? Wow, how insightful. And '\\"Evelyn, a Modified Poodle\\" was yet another canine reference.' If you've read any other bio, this is relatively useless, and far too expensive for what it includes."},{"rating":"1","title":"DULL","review":"This book has its place. If you're looking for a very complete reference of Zappa recordings and band personnel changes here it is. But this is not much of a biography apart from a few key facts about schooling, kids' birthdates and such. There are no quotes, and only the most succinct and dry accounts of events. There's a great deal of shallow \\"sidebar\\" material on the order of \\"the single release was a 1:05 longer than the album\\".

This is, therefore, a good book for the beach, bus, or bathroom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shouldn't have been a book","review":"This would have made a great article for The New Yorker. The story of Dr. Minor is fascinating but not large enough for a book. As a result, Winchester's book is full of padding, such as unnecessary and pedantic discussions about insanity as a criminal defense and the strides made in modern mental health. Winchester also commits numerous inaccuracies in his references to orthography, grammar and usage; which is ironic, considering that he's writing about a work which is one of our arbitors of correct English. Winchester is a pop writer, not a scholar, and in this book, it shows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting story, terrible book","review":"While the central story of W.C. Minor and the OED is an interesting one, it is poorly served by this volume, one of the worst-written books I can remember reading in recent years. Mr. Winchester's ineptitude is both large and small scale, and one wonders whether an editor ever gave the book more than a cursory glance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story!","review":"I was suspicious at first. A tale about the making of a dictionary? However as the story continued it drew more and more interesting. This is a compelling tale about a professor and a madman.

However, as a professional editor, I was not impressed with the publisher's shoddy proofreading and copyediting of the book. While reading it, I found myself continually stumbling over typos and obvious errors in grammar and punctuation.Now, I'm sure that many people reading my comments will think that I'm just being picky. But, don't you think it's ironic that a book that focuses on one of the greatest, most scholarly literary efforts in history should undergo such careless proofreading? Just imagine what James Murray would think. I believe he'd be horrified at such inattention."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great short History of the Oxford Dictionary and more...","review":"The best thing about this book to me, is it never went to far in depth into any one subject the book was covering. I say this because I would not read a full book on any one of it's subjects for lack of interest. But instead it just laid out a short fascianting history. Starting with Dictionarys and the beginnings of the Oxford Dictionary. Then two rather fasciatings biographys on two of the great men behind the Oxford Dictionary. Then throw in some History of 19th. century America and England and I think you have a great short history novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting for an article, too little for a book","review":"This book, while fairly interesting in terms of plot, really only has enough material in it for a short article. There are perhaps three events of note in the entire book, one of which is well-known from the outset.I was disappointed - but then I prefer well written fiction to mediocrely written faction."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Professor and the Madman","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book.

Therather short book (less than 250pages) coversmuch territory and material. The flow is superb.A minor drawback is that the author speculatessometimes excessively without basis. An exampleis his suggestion of an affair between the\\"Madman\\" and a special visitor- the wife ofthe man he killed. Another drawback is theauthor's attempt to analyze mental illness. Itis rather too short to convey any significantunderstanding. But the subject of the book, thestyle of writing and the overall presentationmake this an unusually fascinating book to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully Boring","review":"There aren't enough words in the Oxford English Dictionary to describe my loathing for this book. It is constantly being recommended to me, because I apparently fit the stereotype of someone who would like it(I have an English degree, I enjoy reading, and I am a bit of a language maven). As someone who loves books, I am usually offended when others complain that a book is \\"boring.\\" Having said that, my main criticism with The Professor and the Madman is that it is painfully and shockingly ... boring. The only reason I was able to finish this book is that I was trapped in a cabin during a snowstorm. My options were to either read this book or stare out into a blank white landscape.I should have stared into the landscape.

The writing is pretentious and verbose. The most interesting parts of the book are the definitions excerpted from the OED. Whence arises the question, Why bother with this turgid little tome when you can read the OED itself?"},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste of time!","review":"I completely agree with the critic who suggested that this book would be much better off being a long magazine article. It's boring, it drags on and is not very well written at all.

Although the title seems sensational, the story told within is very tastefully done, and has no sensational tone. I came away with an appreciation of the OED, the process of its compilation, and with a better understanding of the ramifications (as well as the limitations) of the use of confinement of the clinically insane.As soon as I saw this book available for a reasonable price, I added it to my own collection. I have even loaned my copy to friends, and their response was as enthusiastic as my own.If these subjects are in any way of interest to you, you will not regret purchasing this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Story about Language and Madness","review":"I guarantee you that once you finish this book, you will not only appreciate the work that went into the Oxford English Dictionary, but you will also be searching for a CD-ROM copy of it.

I label this book a must read for anyone interested in language or writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Surgeon of Crowthorne","review":"Mind-blowing. If you love dictionaries then this book is an absolute must. Simon Winchester treats the subject of William Minor's insanity with respect and his brilliance during his lucidity is breathtaking.

This book will leave you wanting much more than Winchester has been able to deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great tale badly told","review":"The story of James Murray's obsessive work on compiling the Oxford English Dictionary is a fascinating one. However, 'The Profesor and the Madman' by Simon Winchester sensationalizes an aspect of this undertaking that should exist as a footnote, or a chapter at best. O.K. already, so the man was in a cushy asylum and had a lot of time on his hands.For a more in-depth account of the origins of the OED try 'Caught in the Web of Words: James Murray and the Oxford English Dictionary' by K.M.

We constantly bounce from Minor's sad condition to that of the main editor and their friendship. I never saw much about their relationship to make me believe they really knew each other. More frustrating was the author's writing style, which reminded me of reading a dictionary. In addition I have never seen so many colons (:) used in one book. He uses the passive voice to a very large and distracting degree. The story is interesting but I am surprised that the book is such a big bestseller."},{"rating":"2","title":"fascinating look at the history of English dictionaries","review":"Simon Winchester takes a seemingly boring subject, the creation of the Oxford English Dictionary and ends up with an entertaining tale of the origins of words and their meanings. Interspersed in his story are highly entertaining vignettes of murder, war and madness. Good reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"And you thought dictionaries were boring!","review":"Winchester takes an academic subject and makes it read like a Victorian thriller. He weaves together the lives of two strange and complex men to tell a story that has touched the entire English speaking world -- the creation of the Oxford English Dictionary: THE authority on the progression of the English language over the past millenium. If you love history, language, literature, and tragedies this is a book for you. Beware, this book will make you want to run out and buy your own OED -- well, a full set will run you at least $1000! There are compact and CD-ROM versions available for under $200. I guess I'll just add it to my amazon wish list and hope...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, Finished With Wanting More...","review":"I found this book disappointing. It was a fairly quick read but not because it was compelling. I thought his chronology too muddled, jumping back and forth between interesting facts (that illustrate his obsessive research) to rather broad historical summations that really should have been explored more closely.To his credit, I 'found' his descriptions of Minor, Murray and Merrett very intriguing and well written ('found' because they are literally strewn haphazardly throughout the book), which kept me reading, but ultimately, this book left me with wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"superbly written piece of literature","review":"Simon Winchester is an engaging and interesting man, whom I met and heard speak at Harvard. He is extremely amusing, well traveled and brilliant and not in the least bit haughty or snobby.

This technique is reminiscent of Faulkner's \\"The Unvanquished.\\"It's a shame, however, that Winchester can't get over his disdain for Christianity. He repeatedly attributes the madness of William Minor, one of the books central protagonists, to a strict Protestant upbringing.Was Winchester paying homage to the spirits of Emerson and Thoreau?Tom Wolfe's \\"Two Young Men Who Went West\\" \\"Hooking Up\\" offers a much more complimentary expose of the Protestant influence on American culture and the high tech industry in particular."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious, delightful, stranger than fiction.","review":"A marvelous tribute, well presented, to those involved in the Oxford English Dictionary.

The information was there, just not presented in an enjoyable way.

It's full of fascinating, if sometimes sad, characters as well as a wealth of information about how the greatest dictionary in the English language came to be (that story, in itself, is amazing).The author's use of language is superb and -- even more astounding -- he reads the book as well as any professional reader (a rare talent!). I simply loved this book!I've already read Winchester's book \\"The Map That Changed the World,\\" and I can't wait to read ALL his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"One would not expect a history of the Oxford English Dictionary to be particularly interesting, but indeed, there is quite a story behind it. A tremendous amount of the dictionary's research was done by a convicted murderer mired in severe mental illness. This book recounts the strange tale of how W.C. Minor came to write significant portions of the dictionary and, more broadly, how the OED came to be.The OED is undeniably a tremendous achievement. Winchester is clearly enamored of the dictionary; he states unequivocally that the OED is the most important dictionary in human history. He makes little of the various criticisms that have been waged against the dictionary: its orientation towards white, middle class language conventions, its imperialist outlook. Winchester has other interests, and cannot be criticized for that. Still, his dismissal of these criticisms is so absolute that it does make one wonder. Overall, this is a compelling story, enjoyably told."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappoint\\\\vb: to fail to fulfill the expectation or hope ~","review":"The title is misleading as this book is really the about the history of the Oxford English Dictionary. The so-called \\"madman\\", one of the major contributors to the massive project, does not appear as often as I would have liked. He is a tragic figure, a criminally insane American surgeon who was housed at England's Broadmoor asylum for the majority of his life. Mr. Winchester occasionally uses him as a vehicle to enhance the tale of the lugubrious task of the compilation of one of the English-speaking world's greatest literary achievements. In selecting the book, I'd looked forward to the surgeon's story rather than tiresome text, dates and definitions. The latter, alas, is what I found."},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfectly lovely little book","review":"This book brings us the story of a dictionary, of its editor, of an unfortunate contributor, and of a sad victim who could not have cared two cents about the whole project.

Perfect for that next car ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent history of the OED","review":"The author knows how to write an interesting book about a subject which prima facie, is not so interesting.

Spanning over 85 years, PM tells the story of a troubled man (William Minor) whose childhood begins in America, develops in Sri Lanka, and ends back where it began ... just in time for the Civil War. Serving as a medic, Minor sees - and causes - more pain than he was prepared for, and symptoms of mental illness soon emerge. Shortly thereafter, he goes to England to escape his demons. But alas, he cannot run from them, and in a fit of madness he takes the life of a local laborer. The rest of the story, indeed the bulk of it, deals with Minor's attempt to regain his sanity through his voluntary work on the Oxford English Dictionary. Winchester speculates that the OED would not exist without the critical help of Minor. I concur."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable account of the creation of a mundane publication.","review":"It's certain that Mr. Winchester enjoyed researching and documenting the incidents of and about the creation of the Oxford English Dictionary.

And it will all make sense, thanks to Simon Winchester.Winchester is able to draw something of a straight line from the Battle of the Wilderness, May 1864, Orange County, Virginia, to the OED! The trip will take you through the UK, a murder, insanity (?), a mental hospital, and , finally, a meeting between the two men most responsible for this most unique dictionary in the world.

I am not a real avid reader of history, but this was quite informative and held my attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"fascinating characters but weak writing and plot","review":"This could be a fascinating story of two characters whose lives were devoted to writing a dictionary. But, while Minor's life is sketched, the author writes too much speculation about his motivations. The few incidents known about his life are stretched into a full length book when a pamphlet would have sufficed. The style is repetitive and sensational. Apparently the author didn't read what he wrote in the previous chapter, or he wrote them out of order because each repeats what was said earlier."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Failed Story","review":"The basic story here is good, but I found the writing contrived, opinionated, and in the end, boring. While I enjoyed learning the basic information presented about the OED, and Victorian mental health care, I will never again read anything written by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled","review":"Of course the OED itself is a masterpiece, and the book's cover photo is quite provocative. But the fascinating fact of Dr. Minor's contribution is not *nearly* enough to hang a book on. It shows. The \\"drama\\" is histrionic and manufactured,Winchester's self-indulgence is stomach turning (see the multi-page acknowledgments section), and everywhere is padding and fluff. Reading one review of the book is a more than adequate substitute for this disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very well written for a book about words","review":"While it is heartening to see a book about the OED on the best-sellers list, I really wish that it had been written with a little more care. What is potentially an engrossing mystery at the heart of the creation of the definitive English lexicon is mired in a hash of choppy sentences and \\"sesquipedalians\\" that have been thrown in to make sure the reader knows that the author has in fact looked at the OED at least once in his life, but which more often than not are used in place of a shorter word that would be more appropriate. The bottom line is that this book reads like it was written by a journalist with a good thesaurus (as it was) and not by someone who really cares about words and good writing (as it should have been)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"I bought the hype, so I bought the book. What a disappointment! It turned out to be a magazine article padded to book length, larded with hints of amazing secrets to come but never delivering what it promised. This is a book in search of an editor, but then again, if properly edited, there would be no book left, just an interesting article for, perhaps, the Sunday newspaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"I read this book after reading \\"The Meaning of Everything,\\" which I thoroughly enjoyed. This book, \\"The Professor and the Madman\\" gave me a bit more insight into one small aspect of the story of the making of the OED. Worth reading, but if you must choose between this book and \\"The Meaning of Everything,\\" definitely go for \\"The Meaning of Everything.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Is Not a Keeper","review":"This is one of the most bizarre and depressing stories I have ever read. The madman's pathology is described in detail, as are the horrific Civil War battle experiences that allegedly drove him crazy. There is a lack of focus as the author alternates between his twin protagonists. Each chapter begins with a selection from the OED, as examples of the tremendous accomplishment this dictionary is. After having used American dictionaries all my life, it does not seem the ultimate in lexicography to have a short definition followed by a long list of usage examples.I very much enjoyed Winchester's account of the explosion of Krakatoa and the making of the geological map of England, but I probably won't buy any more of his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"the professor and the madman","review":"This is the most dryly witten book I have read in a really long time. I have tried to force myself to read it since I am such an avid reader qnd so sincerely wanted to give it a chance. I can force myself to read it no longer after making my way through a third of it. I would not recommend this book to anyone"},{"rating":"1","title":"History of the Dictionary","review":"\\"This has been a story of an American soldier whose involvement in the making of the world's greatest dictionary was singular, astonishing, memorable and laudable - and yet at the same time wretchedly sad.\\" - Prologue. Well, that certainly could have been the story. But what it was was a history of the dictionary (as in \\"the history of the horse\\") with W.C. Minor's contributions finally gotten to on page 116 or so. Winchester, the author of several other books I'll avoid, also seems to suffer from the common malady - or unwillingness - of not knowing how to end a book. So the last fifty pages sink the poor reader into...the history of insanity/dimentia/Alzeihmer's, whatever you want to call what Minor suffered. Whereas I should have shed a tear when the main character - assuming it wasn't a dictionary - was laid to rest at age 85, I was fairly glad to see him go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the story...?","review":"The theme is interesting enough - an American inmate of a British lunatic asylum contributes much to the creation of OED. Unfortunately the book doesn't have much beyond the outline of the theme. As some other reviewers have noted, it would have made a decent magazine article, but instead it is filled out to book length with repetition, semi relevant trivia, and melodramatic hyperbole of the \\"superior\\" Victorian English kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"There isn't much of a story","review":"Yes, it is an interesting aside that a \\"madman\\" helped write the Oxford Dictionary. It would have made a very nice article for a scholary magazine, but padded out it makes a very boring book. The fact of the matter is, the author really doesn't know all that much about W.C. Minor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite Novel","review":"Winchester's tome covers well trodden ground in a meticulous fashion. Its appeal to both American and English bookbuyers is granted but unfortunately it does not deliver on its strongly implied promises of mystery and intrigue. As a concisely constructed recounting and correction of facts about Dr Minor's contribution to the Oxford Dictionary it is very interesting but could have taken but a few pages in a magazine such as 'Vanity Fair' (not quite a novel's worth of reading !).The author's liking of repetition in his prose is also offputting rather than tension building. Bill Bryson's tome on the history of the English language covers much broader fields more lucidly and without the pretence for those interested in the history of our language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Received a glowing revue about this book. Could have been much better. Can I ell it back? Maybe the (P.S.) in title meant Pretty Stinky! Bob"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and boring","review":"Another talentless writer lands on the bestseller list due to good publicity. The subtitle on this book is completely misleading---murder had nothing to do with the OED. Winchester describes the history of the dictionary ad nauseum. What could've been an interesting ten-page article is padded into a deadly boring 250-page book, with little interaction between the title characters. And, there's a particularly gruesome scene near the end. Don't waste your time or your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really boring book","review":"I really don't have much to offer beyond what others have written criticizing the book. I just felt the book needed another one star rating.I thought the topic of this book would be interesting. Maybe in someone else's hands the book would be, or maybe the topic just needed to be a magazine article as others have pondered. This book is really boring. I cannot even remember much about it other having what seemed like stray facts thrown at me. I mainly read history/non-fiction books, and this book ranks near the bottom of all the books that I have read in the past decade.Note: I listened to the book from an audible.com purchase. The narrator was fine. The material was just presented in a really boring manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read for all word lovers!","review":"For anyone interested in words, psychology, or Victorian England, this book is essential. Winchester has woven a rich tale about the development of the Oxford English Dictionary, its first editor, and its most prolific contributor--a mental patient. As an Anglophile, psychology teacher, and linguistics buff, I enjoyed this short book tremendously and would highly recommend it to anyone with similar interests."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic read for armchair etymologists","review":"This book is an absolute must for anyone with an interest in language.Winchester's telling of the saga behind the creation of the Oxford English Dictionary is at once dramatically engaging and philologically illuminating. The story will open for you exciting vistas in the scholarly world before and after the OED...fascinating stuff.Winchester's style is eminently readable, and his affection for words is abundantly clear. Any wanna-be linguists would do well to read it.Its only shortcomings are (in my opinion) an overly-extended examination of the history of schizophrenia at the end of the story and an epilogue which dragged somewhat.All in all, however, a TERRIFIC read which would be worth anyone's time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quick-read; diverting and somewhat disturbing.","review":"The subtitle is apt: \\"A Tale...\\" Simon Winchester tells a story that is \\"a fine conjunction\\" of three entities (Murray, Minor and the OED). Initially put off by the frankly scary details of Minor's problems, I finally began to enjoy the book and was awed by Winchester's telling of how Dr. Minor endured his years at Broadmoor.Therefore this was not only a story, a true if possibly embellished story, but an insight to the life of an intelligent, disturbed man forever incarcerated.And although I have no quibbles about the bulk of Winchester's content, I don't really think we needed to read the specifics in the chapter entitled \\"The Unkindest Cut.\\" This marred a telling that had otherwise not indulged in shock exploitation of the book's subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak writing, fascinating characters","review":"I wanted to like this book more than I did. It had great promise, witih undelivered results. The repetitious writing gets in the way of the character's story. With a fascinating teaser intro, I was expecting more than I read. Apparently the author didn't read what he had written in the preceding chapter, or wrote out of order, because each chapter repeats itself, maybe to pad it into book length."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Reading","review":"This book presents a fascinating historical account about the making of the OED. Although the book is a bit repetitive in places, the author manages overall to maintain a decent pace to captivate the reader. Simon Winchester himself is the master of English language as he weaves this entrancing tale. My book group thoroughly enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sonic masterpiece","review":"\\"Between The Dim And The Dark\\" is Jumps best album to date. This is one of the most well produced albums, if not the best produced album I have ever heard. Everything sounds crisp, clean, and perfect. The 3rd track \\"Rains in Asia\\" is a beautifully melodic song that makes me wants to dance in the same way \\"Dancing Virginia\\" from the bands first album \\"The Licorice Tea Demos\\" made me dance.\\"Education\\" is another early favorite with its bluesy harmonica solo.

Best moment - from \\"Requiem\\", the sublimely redundant:It's up to youfor every passing dayto not let the past pass awayGenius."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"It's surprising and disheartening to find that a band capable of producing a song as perfect as \\"Hold You Down\\" can proceed to produce an album with no other redeeming qualities. The first track is decent as well, but I found the rest to be way too soft for anyone claiming to have testicles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment after Vertigo, Eloquence Lost","review":"Usually when a band changes its name it is a meaningless act of marketing. Sadly, that is not true here. The reference to greater art gone, leaving only the mindless verb: Jump, serves as the perfect metaphore for a truly talented and literate band gone trite. To now write such bland, conventional songs and arrange them in such a candy assed way, resorting to lightly swirling electric guitars and breathy vocals articulating vacuous lyrics is for the members to completely fail to understand their great debt to introspection, intellectual reverence, and a classically fueled quirkiness. Not one song on this cd has any spiritual or intellectual rigor or genuine vigor. These lyrics say nothing in a common and trite way. The arrangements are unimaginative although performed flawlessly. The fault is not in their inability to fret notes, but rather, to fret notes uniquely. They have lost their voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Amazing Album","review":"I had high hopes for this album after the last release - Vertigo - and they were all met and then some. This is one of Jump's best albums: Jay Clifford's vocals have evolved, the instrumentals are sophisticated...it's already one of my favorite CDs.

A perfect alternative the usual backyard party! This summer, we decided it needed to be freshened up a bit...so, we cleaned it and then, painted it with Rustoleum's Barbecue Black spray paint (it handles the heat without compromise).

The unit is well-constructed and heavy enough to hold up for years in all weather. The width and depth are just right to hold enough wood for a warm circle of 6-8 people.

At half the price of many comparable units, this is a no-brainer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice product and value","review":"Lots of reviews here, so will only bring up new stuff... the ring assembles fine, if you have it upside down you will have problems. Shouldn't one drill a small hole or two at the bottom of this thing so it will not hold water? Especially if sand will cover it. forget about the 2-cent Landmann cover sold separately.This pit holds more wood than my whole-house woodstove. Got 7x 16\\" logs in there at one point. It never looks that big though and that's a good thing.One minor gripe is there is no burn control (not sure how they could do that anyway), so this thing has mega-oxygen available all the time, so burns fast and white. Maybe its the side shape-vents that prevent a deeper layer of coals from forming.Having our fire up on the deck now is priceless.

The removable grill top is a perk most of the others don't have, and we've roasted marshmallows, hot dogs, and hamburgers on it. You can use wood or charcoal briquets. We layered about 3 inches of sand on the bottom, and used 3 large rocks as a \\"grate\\" to set the wood kindling on. Overall very happy w/ it! We have a smaller patio (10' x 15') yet it visually doesn't take up too much space, and is easy to move for wind conditions. Make sure you get a cover for it as it doesn't have a drainage hole for rain, plus you don't want rust. We've had so many compliments on the charming stars/ moon design.

In what must be presumed to be the haste with which it was put together, however, it is riddled with errors and inconsistancies.

I have not read it cover to cover, but I have used about half the chapters while trying to learn various aspects of VB. As an example, I used the chapter on creating a help system and found it to be very frustrating. The examples given were very poor and way too sketchy.

I hope Jennifer Haigh writes something new soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put it down!","review":"I read this book nearly in one evening because I couldn't put it down!!! I thought this book was excellent. The editor's review states that there are holes in this book and that we never understand how Kimble became a jerk, how smart Joan could fall for him, or why Dinah stays with him. This is the stuff of life. We don't often understand the people around us and this makes the book, the story, and the people in it all the more real and poignant.Thanks Jennifer Haigh for an awesome book.

I found this book very depressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great debut novel!","review":"Mrs. Kimble is a very enjoyable read. My test of a good book is when I continue to think about the characters long after I have finished the book. I think Ken Kimble will definitely meet that criteria.

I look forward to reading more of Jennifer Haigh's books as she clearly has talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Book!","review":"Jennifer Haight has written one spellbinding, debut novel, MRS. KIMBLE. Ken Kimble, handsome and charming, appears to be a dream-come-true for the three women he marries. However, each Mrs. Kimble discovers in time he's a con man. Throughout the span of the story each becomes disillusioned at his distant nature and solitary pursuits. As we become more acquainted with Birdie, Joan, and Dinah, we feel sympathy for them. They are real; Ken is hazy. Also the book is an intriguing study about men, women, and marriage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read","review":"This book is well written and pulled together with all the characters connected in some interesting way which makes you realize that none of the meetings are by chance.

I found the ending somewhat disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poignant, well-written","review":"How much is a woman willing to give -- or give up -- for love? That is the question at the center of this book. The tale of the three wives of a handsome sociopath, Mrs. Kimble traces the wreckage Ken Kimble leaves in his wake. Each woman is distinctly different, yet each is willing to sacrifice everything for the man she loves. While it is at times unavoidably depressing -- like watching a train smash into a car stalled on the tracks -- the resolution is, indeed, a tale of just rewards and redemption.The characters are finely drawn and all too real. The occasional plot clunker (Cohen's brother showing up on Dinah's doorstep???) keeps this from being a five-star novel. But I look forward to more books from Haigh in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some holes, but a captivating debut novel","review":"I loved the premise of this book - to follow this one man through the lives of his three wives. It is true, as other readers here say, there are some holes, but the story is just too captivating to put down. I read it in less than a week. The story and Jennifer Haigh's writing style will keep you intrigued from start to finish. Each character in the story is so interesting that they could have a novel just devoted to their own tale.There are still many unanswered questions, right down to the last sentence of the novel. However, don't let this keep you from reading and enjoying this book. This is definitley a must-read for some years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great beginning, stupid ending","review":"I kept looking for the redeeming portion of this book. I won't give anything away, but the ending was ridiculous. You get through an entire book and that's the ending? I was intrigued by the back cover which stated that we would \\"get a glimpse inside the mind of Ken Kimble\\". We never did! Aside from his second wife, Joan, who you can see fell in love with him because of her loneliness and her disease, was a good character, but the other wives were ridiculous. I bought this book for a penny from a used book seller on Amazon. So glad I didn't spend more money. A penny is about what it's worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic women","review":"I can't even finish the drivel! Honestly as a woman I cannot understand how another woman could find this interesting or worth her time. Yes, there are horrible men in this world, but you don't simply bend over and allow them to destroy your entire life! You realize that you have made a terrible mistake, you dump the bastard, you grieve, and you move on. Dreadful, dreadful, dreadful! Yes, the story is well written but I was nauseated by the pathetic behavior of these women!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow","review":"The benefit to this book is that you can read it before falling asleep at night and not worry that you've missed something.

This is a Christian book with Bible citations throughout. I stopped reading when I realized the author's obvious bias. When I'm looking for information on immune system health, I'm not looking for highly-biased presentations on religion. My bias isn't against Christianity per se, it's including Christianity without fully disclosing that personal bias nor making a connection between that personal bias and the supposed educational material of the book. The author needs to be more open and honest, or she needs to leave her personal religion out of her desire to \\"educate\\" about health. She quickly burned her credibility with me.A better book is 4 Weeks to Maximum Immunity: Disease-Proof Your Body by the editors of Prevention Magazine (2008)"},{"rating":"1","title":"For Christian Readers primarily","review":"I hadn't expected at all that this would be a Christian-oriented book. The author mentions God and praises God in a Christian way on almost every page. This can be off-putting to readers, such as myself, who are looking for medical information free of religious fervor. There are many things I wish the author had done instead of praising her God, such as provide more scientific/medical explanations for some of the things she suggests, e.g. purging/colon cleaning. This book had some helpful information in it but not much beyond what you probably already know if you've been halfway paying attention to news and talk shows for the last decade. It certainly wasn't what I'm looking for in my desire to repair my immune system following a serious illness."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a Christian book","review":"As far fetched as it may sound, this is a Christian book with biblical quotations throughout. Neither the front nor the back cover provide any indication of this whatsoever. That's the most upsetting part. If you want some health information along with your bible study this is an interesting book. But if you are interested in immune system makeover, don't pay for a book for which half the research time was spent poring over the pages of the Bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paine in the context of his time.","review":"I had bought this book because I wanted to learn more about Tom Paine. Paine is one of those historical characters who keeps popping up on the edges of discussion, and about whom I knew very little. I became a lot more aware of him through my media studies, given that he was one of the first radical figures to use media effectively as a weapon.In any case, this isn't a biography of Paine, and assumes that the reader already knows (or isn't interested in) many biographical details. The book is more about Paine's reception by the society of the time, with a focus on issues such as the role of artisans, balanced government, republicanism, and free markets. It tracks how Paine was received as political pamphleteer not only in the revolutionary US, but also in the UK and revolutionary France.I think that the book would have meant a lot more to me if I'd already had more background, but the chapter notes did a good job of pointing me to the best books for further reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"In depth study of Tom Paine","review":"Tom Paine's Common Sense was one of the most influential writings of the American Revolution. Eric Foner covers this period of Paine's career in 30 pages. The rest of this tome is dedicated to the founding of new political systems in Pennsylvania and controversies surrounding the establishment of the Bank of North America. Although these topics are of interest to scholars, they were of limited interest to this more casual reader. I found much of the book tedious and difficult to wade through. It would probably be great for those with a thirst for rarely documented parts of early American history. Probably this would not be a good choice for those with a more casual interest in this period."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S A KOOSH!!","review":"Not educational, but fun to throw around!

The plot involves a mirror which is not only seemingly haunted but has attracted attention from more than one party. Our heroes have to sort all this out. Things get ugly with assault and kidnapping.In this book the limitations of not having your own transportation are really front and center. In previous books the various authors used various crutches to get around this - the junkyard truck, the rented Rolls-Royce, etc. In this book the plot requires all the stops to be pulled out. Taxi rides abound and even a commercial bread truck gets worked in.The artwork is handled by Jack Hearne. A capable artist but one misses Harry Kane. M. V. Carey's text is well up to her usual standards.The page count is down from the standard set in the earlier books. It is about 150 pages instead of 180 pages.Great stuff for young and old.

It is not quite as detailed as I would like, but it is a good book for the reader who desires a fairly detailed general description of the Bronze Age collapse. The author gives different theories and their strengths and weaknesses, and he admitts that there is still too little evidence to fully support any one theory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great companion piece to \\"Islands in the Sea of Time\\" series","review":"I used this book as a reference-companion while reading S. M. Stirling's \\"Islands in the Sea of Time\\" alternate history trilogy. After I started reading the series, I found I did not know as much about the late bronze age as I thought I did. I don't suppose that should have been a big surprise, but it was. A friend loaned me his copy of \\"Collapse of the Bronze Age\\"; it made all the difference. Granted, Stirling's fictional account (of modern-day Natucket, plus some Coast Guard ships, being snatched back to approx. 1200 BC) soon diverted from \\"known\\" history (by the actions of his characters), but I found I was still in need of a guide. Stirling uses many historical personages and locations in the novels, often referring to them by names only scholars would know and not those we all learned in high school. I'm sure Robbins' book stands well on its own. I just thought some of you might like to know one of its other uses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, but not like the origional","review":"This film is very good, almost exactly like cannibal holocaust, but it is not as classic as the origional in my opinion. The blood guts and nudity are all there though, and gore hounds wont be dissapointed. Its still a fun movie (if you think this kind of movie is fun) to watch with a bunch of friends, and for hardcore fans of Cannibal Holocaust this is a must see!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"Purchased this item with the impression that it was truely quality, couldn't be further from the truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Felling Axe, for cutting down Trees.

I like to sharpen mine myself. Also having 2-sides lets you stay outside longer.Again, it is NOT meant to be used as a log splitter because its much too light.

I find it sad to see that Pathfinder books, which many years ago produced a lot of worthwhile literature, is now devoted to the musings of the senile leader of a bizarre sect (i.e., Barnes). So, in short, save your money (Pathfinder's books are over-priced anyway) - and don't bother with all the so-called reviewers (members of Barnes' group) who give his book 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Eye Cream I Ever Used!","review":"I have tried several expensive eye creams and always come back to this one.

THIS page is for a British television anthology series that was supposed to be a follow-up to the popular Hammer House of Horror. This one (which I'm trying to get hold of) never actually aired and was rather recently released in two sets for the home video market here and in the UK. I can't rate the series or the release since I've never seen it, but I can certainly assign a single star based on the obtuseness of a particular online purveyor of goods and its inability to get things straight EVEN AFTER THE ERROR IS CITED."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another unknown, underrated band!","review":"This is the only album the Midnight Creepers made ( as far as I can tell, and I've looked!), but they are/were as tight and as driven as any band I've heard. They're another in a long line of bands that quietly make great music - Jack Mack and the Heart Attack, Cold Blood, Chris Daniels and the Kings, etc. - bands that fly under the radar but which have legions of devoted fans.

The UNKLE mix is fun also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugggh.","review":"What is it with Depeche Mode remixes and how they all sound the same? They've been doing this for 15 years now.

I've had it for about 5 years now and it's still going strong, in fact I'm writing this review on it. Not really. The earpiece holder thing broke off so I replaced it with part of a hanger, and that's mostly ok. I'm almost ok with that, I think.The main problem is that this thing is that I keep finding uses for it. First I used it with my ps3, then with my computer, then with my phone, then with my blender (not really), then with my iPad. I'm somewhat worried Jabra is going to go out of business unless they start working on their planned obsolescence tactics. Then there would be no support! At least the support is fantastic right now.I would strongly suggest buying this headset if you want a reliable earpiece with a diverse set of talents, but only if you have access to a wire hanger."},{"rating":"1","title":"DANGER!!!!","review":"DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT.

Producing three singles, \\"Islands In The Stream\\" is the biggest C/W single in history - written originally as an R&B song! Every song soars with Barry Gibb providing much needed backup singing. The Gatlin Brothers enthusiastically join in on \\"Buried Treasure\\" and the Bee Gees sing back on the only odd song selection, \\"Living With You\\". However, the rest of the tracks are some of Rogers best to this date, \\"Evening Star\\" representing a high point. Probably only temporarily available, it would be wise to purchase this CD now. It's a landmark album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a country girl but....","review":"One day..on the TV music channel...I heard Kenny Rogers singing...but the sound...the music...had to be..and it was...from the album of the songs written by the Bee Gees.An awesome CD....great songs...and yes...you can \\"hear\\" the heart of the Bee Gees in each song...undoubedly...And BONUS...the Bee Gees sing most of the back up in all the songs!Bonus!Makes a girl go country!Excellent mixture all the way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful songs for a great voice - Bee Gees writes country!","review":"The Gibb Brothers songs and the great voice of countrysinger Kenny Rogers is a good match. As a Bee Gees fan in the beginning I was most fond of songs with the typical Bee Gees sound as This Woman, Eyes that see in the Dark etc, but after a few listenings I found myself singing Buried Treasures and Evening Star - country style songs - with pleasure. I did'nt like country music before this album, but now I love it - when The Gibb Brothers makes it! I love all the songs. I also of course have to mention Islands in the Stream - the duet with Dolly Parton. I have read, that it is the best selling country song ever. You would understand why when you listen to the song! A super CD!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!","review":"This is the worst product I have purchased.

I like Sci-fi and action/adventure what can I say. But I found myself drawn into the film, particually by Sheen's preformance. The film does have it's shortcommings. But overall it is a stark and very upfront portrayal of the people and events.It shows how easy it is for things to spiral out of control and how guys who had everything could never be satisfied. Give it a go. You may be surprised with what you find."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad wigs","review":"This movie could have been handled so much better. Doesn't help that the brothers Sheen wore terrible bald wigs which were so noticeable in parts it made the film so silly. Just keep your eye out for the really shiney moments when the wigs look so plastic. That aside, what is wrong with this film. Besides the fact it did nothing at the box office, the film just doesn't have enough punch to pull you in. I really felt nothing for any of the characters involved, and you need to be able to do this to appreciate a film.The Sheen brothers team up again for this film (remember \\"Men at Work\\"?). Someone must have told them that they make a good combination, but I am afraid that this partnership couldn't save this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet and uplifting","review":"I originally rented this just so see a glimpse of Jeremy Sisto, who I adore in all of his films, but i was surprised to find myself completely swept up by this soft, quiet story of a woman who lost her husband. So true to life, the way she grieves over him. Can't imagine losing my husband so suddenly and swiftly that you feel like all the air's been knocked out of your lungs. Elizabeth Perkins, Whoopi Goldberg and Gwynyth Paltrow all do well in their roles of family/friends who laugh and bicker and live life as best they can while helping each other along the way. Whoopi's marriage is crumbling and Gwynyth is afraid of falling in love, even with Jeremy, who is completely captivating in this movie and only gives me another reason to love it. A really good film to watch alone so you can get immersed in it and enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like real life...","review":"The movie accurately portrays the heaviness, oppressive emotional qualities of life after the death of a spouse. However, it also shows the hopefullness and healing that comes from true friends. This is an emotionally heavy movie, addressing such a solemn event. And if you can hang on through the agonies of the grieving widow, you will find, in the end, hope for the future and a belief that life can and will go on.By the way, Yes, Jon Bon Jovi was in the movie. If he is the only reason you're getting this movie, you may be disappointed. Although he handles it well, he has a very small part in this show.I connected with this movie in many ways. I recognized a sense of familiarity in the characters portrayed in this film. And I felt satisfied with the conclusion of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific movie","review":"I purchased this movie (some time ago) because it was great. Many of my friends have seen this because of me and have all agreed with me. Not to mention an AWESOME singer, Alechia James has a song in this movie too. During the scene where Perkins is on her bed shutting the world out crying and such - that's Alechia. I think this is a female movie especially seeing the review one male reviewer gave."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why put Bon Jovi here??","review":"I love it and I bought it not because of Bon Jovi but rather thought the movie is talking about relationship between friends and how to keep your lives going when encountering sudden crisis which makes me want to watch it. It did talk about something really real happened in life and it still sticked to my heart.But I found the place for Bon Jovi is not really necessary, I don't see there's any place for him to enter Rebecca's life .. and or had any effect on those women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jon is Great, this movie isn't...","review":"Yes, in case you missed him, Jon Bon Jovi is in this movie... he has a very small part.

In order for the movie to make sense it has to be that way, but i was shocked at how 'depressing' that first half hour WAS....don't worry it gets ALOT better after that though.Jovi is in the movie long enough for you to know he's in it, but not long enough that they really make a big deal about him being in it.Really worth seeing a few times, but it probably won't be a movie that you watch all the time. just a heads up. good addition though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Without Jon Bon Jovi, I would have given it ONE star.","review":"This was honestly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The plot was boring if not non-existent.

However, like all reference works of this type, it does contain errors. Some of those errors were absent in the Seventh Edition.For instance, it is not proved that Lt. Col. Thomas Ligon of Henrico Co., Virginia (Line 84C), was the son of Thomas and Elizabeth (Pratt) Ligon of Warwickshire, England. And there are other lines in the book that won't bear scrutiny.I use it because it covers people not generally treated in other references, primarily lines in continental Europe. For that purpose I rate it 4 Stars. As with any reference of this sort, be prepared to check documentation."},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolute must","review":"Gary Boyd Robert's updated volume is an absolute must.

(And proves David Arnold was a worthy successor to John Barry, despite having to score some of the worst Bond films ever made...)Definitely a must-get for track 4, \\"Blunt Instrument\\", but it is not a complete soundtrack album. Chris Cornell's piece should have been included. (His album featuring the song, plus another 13 is available elsewhere and is definitely worth the listen... It's also nice to have real musicians doing the title music pieces again...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of the title track drops this to 1 star","review":"I don't own this soundtrack, but I own the DVD so I know the songs well enough. I have no problem with them, but I do have a problem when the best song AND TITLE TRACK is not included on the soundtrack. I could not listen to this soundtrack without thinking of what it's NOT, rather than what it is. Not having the best song on here is like having a sausage pizza without the sausage. Considering that the DVD also includes an actual video of Chris Cornell's \\"You Know My Name\\" makes wonder how in the world Cornell was allowed to keep exclusive rights to this song. Choosing between this soundtrack and the CD single of the title track, I chose the CD single. Too bad I couldn't have everything wrapped up in one neat little package as it should have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somethings missing?","review":"The Chris Cornell theme song \\"You Know My Name\\" is NOT on the CD!

I purchased this CD under the mistaken impression that I was getting the movie soundtrack. Only to find out after receiving it that the TITLE SONG IS NOT ON THIS CD!!!??? Echoing another reviewer....I find myself thinking, \\"What the #$%^???\\" I am an avid collector of 007 things, and this CD will find a place with my other 007 music but I can't, for the life of me, figure out why a James Bond movie soundtrack gets released without the title song on it? Cubby Broccoli and John Barry are rolling in their graves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, terrible soundtrack....","review":"Easily the worst Bond soundtrack yet by the worst Bond composer ever, David Arnold. Why do the producers persist in hiring this talentless individual when people like John Barry are available? We haven't had a good 007 soundtrack since Barry's 1987 THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS. It's time for a change!Unfortunatelyy, I've collected all the Bond soundtracks that have come out so far so I guess I'm stuck buying this one too to complete my collection. But I'll wait a few months until I can pick up a used CD for a couple of bucks - all it is worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Main Title? I'll Wait For a More Complete Soundtrack","review":"I saw Casino Royale yesterday and loved the soundrack and score. Chris Cornell's \\"You Know My Name\\" had been brillianly reworked to include string and horn flourishes that put the tune up there with John Barry's best. Sadly, the exciting jolt of that song has been omitted from this CD, so one never gets to feel immersed in the experience of the film. This was a stupid, stupid decision, if you ask me. Chris Cornell has said that the decision to leave his song off the CD was his alone. First, it is hard to believe that two major forces like Sony and the TWE organization would give Cornell such a right-of-refusal. Second, what kind of moron decides to take his song off of a Bond soundtrack? Cornell is either lying or a complete idiot. He does, however, sound great on the main titles track. It should have been here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unmemorable","review":"1. No title song? - A total disrespect for the customer. Sony needs this feedback. This action appears to be a way of suckering dedicated Bond fans into buying an additional piece for their collection.2. David Arnold has done good work before but here he does not seem to draw inspiration from John Barry's great 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' so much as rehash his own tepid 'The World Is Not Enough' score. Although the music adequately matched the scenes during the movie, the tracks do not stand alone. Casino Royale's soundtrack does not evoke images of the film the way a soundtrack should."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripped Off","review":"I felt that leaving the Chris Cornell song off this \\"Soundtrack\\" was dishonest.

It is not worth the money, it needs the theme song on the soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Barry - Where Are You?","review":"I vowed that unless I heard 'proper' Bond music in Casino Royale, I would never waste my money on another Bond film.Unfortunately, the soundtrack provided a form of compromise. What we got was a 'Barry-fied' mixture of action-music and strings, the tunes of which I cannot for the life of me recall a day later.John Barry was a genius. I remember running home from the cinema after seeing the Bond films of the 60s, with the music still playing loudly in my head. Even the more unpopular Bond films such as OHMSS, were blessed with wonderful, stirring, immortal themes. I saw OHMSS three times for the music alone! (Ok, ...and Diana Rigg).As others have said on this thread: John Barry is still alive. Bond actors have come and gone, but he was the true success behind the franchise. And he hasn't to my knowledge even been knighted!!!Maybe David Arnold will grow on me, but he does compare badly in my humble opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Theme No Deal","review":"I have always enjoyed the James Bond film themes which usually featured a top notch performer and a very exciting opening to the Bond Films. I'd never heard of the performer who did the theme in the movie and was frankly disapointed that it was not included in the film soundtrack. Without the Main Title any soundtrack is incomplete to me. Madonna and Sheryl Crow did the last 2 Bond themes, so why didn't they get very popular pop star to sing it? And why didn't they put it on this album?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as good as Barry's scores","review":"Strong, very strong Arnold score (probably is best effort in the Bond series).

I found the idea of a female knight very entertaining. But by the fourth book I was downright disgusted! Not only did Alanna get over her fear of love, but she slept with three guys! There is a word for that today and the only thing preventing me from saying it is because Amazon probably considers it profanity. Great idea, but it sizzled out after the first book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutly Wonderful!","review":"I loved this book! In fact, I like all of Tamora Pierce's books. I liked the idea of the Dominion Jewel, but the relationship between the Shang Dragon and Alanna could have been left out. If you like science-fiction and fantasy, this is the book for you! Alanna has so much courage! She does amazing things that I never could have done. Other than her many relationships, Alanna is my role model! I don't usually like science-fiction and fantasy, so these books suprised me! These books are awesome! Keep up the good work, Tamora Peirce!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The First Two Were Better","review":"I read this series and thought that 1 and 2 were the best. This one disappointed me a little. It does give a nice twist though. I hoped that Alanna would marry either Jon or that Shang Dragon Guy (forgot his name). But George?! It put a real shock on me when I read that last page. I still recommend it but the first two were much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed after the first two books","review":"I really enjoyed the first two books in the quartet; they were amazing. The author brought the storyline together and built likable characters. Alanna's character was solid and endearing as well as the other characters. Made me want to go out and purchase the other two books. Having read a few of Pierce's other works, I had no qualms about buying these last two books in the quartet. I was aghast. A strong, determined woman does not have to be one who is also promiscuous. My goodness! Was Alanna willing to sleep with anyone who was interested?? Would not want our young girls getting it confused. A female does not have to be a bed hopper in order to be successful or strong. So, if you have issues with unrestrained sexuality, do not read these last two books. Just enjoy the first two and call it a day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tamora Pierce is a genious! Great book!","review":"Mmk, I got the first book in this series from a friend that had gotten it from the library (she hasn't read that book yet...) and I just have to say: TAMORA PIERCE IS THE BEST AUTHOR EVER~! I highly recommend that you read this book, if you're 5, 10, 15, 20, whatever! You will love it, just as I have. Right now I am finishing up In The Realm of the Gods, The Immortals Quartet, by Tamora Pierce; it is just as fantastic as the other books.--Niomi"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I truely enjoyed the other books the Lioness series and they remain my favorite series. I especially loved the first two books. Whereas 'Woman Who Rides Like A Man' irked me, 'Lioness Rampant' really tore my hopes down and I was horribly disappointed. I respect the other readers who enjoyed the ENTIRE quartet, but I must say that it was not the book for me. The characters seemed to lose their 'edge' and became too single-minded. The first two books were a perfect blend of love and war. However, the third book was almost entirely about love and the fourth book was almsot entirely about war. I bear no grudge against Tamora Pierce and I believe that she wove the stories with wonderful imagination and care, but I wish I hadn't read the last two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sucky epilogue but great story","review":"The epilogue doesn't feel like an epilogue, more like an unfinished chapter. That's why I took a star. I HATE lose endings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic! Full of Adventure!","review":"This book was great. You should not read it if you have not read the other books. The end is sad with the deaths of Thom, Liam, and Faithful. Alanna's adventure on getting the Dominion Jewel was cool. It is so odd how Alex was a friend in the first book, but turned to the Evil Duke Roger's side. I'm glad that none of the Characters from the other books didn't die. I reccomend this book to anyone who likes/loves adventures."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lioness unsheaths her claws","review":"This book is the heart-wrenchingly wonderful conclusion to a heart-wrenchingly wonderful saga. DON'T READ IT UNLESS YOU'VE READ THE OTHERS!A basic summary:Alanna, Lady Knight of Tortall has grown restless in her peaceful life with the Bazhir tribes. She follows a map to the Roof of the World to search for a treasure thaat will bring glory to herself and, more importantly to Tortall. Along the way she gains unexpected companions. But when at last she returns to Corus, she is happily reunited with old friends. Still, her enjoyment is short-lived when she realizes horrible truths about her twin and discovers that her worst enemy is back. This book concludes Alanna's story with a finish that will mark her as one of the greatest heroines of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best in this fantastic series!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This book was the perfect way to end this series. I was glued from the first page to the last. I love this book and hope either an extention to it comes out or Tammy writes some on Alannas' daughter, Alianne, [I've heard rumors!}A wonderful book, perhaps the best in the series, and last [weep] in this unexplainably wonderful quartet."},{"rating":"2","title":"A REALLY great book!!!!!","review":"This book was VERY exciting, and I couldn't put it down. The end of the story was satisfying, in my opinion( Hey- I know SOME people would rather have Alanna marry Jonathan but if they weren't right for each other-it even says that in the book- than why bother? If ya wanna book where someone marries a prince, go read Sleeping Beauty or some other silly story like that.) and I enjoyed it a lot. Alanna is in the Immortals, so I didn't go crazy like I am now waiting for the new book called The First Test. My mom even preordered the paperback version which is going to take even longer to come out! AUGHHHHHHHHHH!!!!! Well, ANYWAY, once you finish this book, you'll be hooked on the rest of the series about Daine, and so on. I've read this book (as well as all of the others) at least 3 times and now any other books I read seem just plain silly. Even ones by authors I've loved forever. If you're a sane person, you'll love this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd best book to the Bible","review":"This honestly was the best of the series, the suspense of this book was almost unbearable, from when Alan, oops, went in search of the Dominion jewel, to when to when she confronted the Duke during the great battle. I totally enjoyed this book and had to pry it from my hands to put it down, out of all the books I've read this is my 2nd favourite. But the best bit of this book was the fact that there was a focus on george and his kin, and hats of to Tamora Pierece in coming up with the idea of introducing Ralon of Malven as the infamous Claw, it was truely ingenius. (Sorry about the spelling and punctuation)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughts 'bout Lioness Rampant","review":"Well, Lioness Rampant is exciting, yes. However, I feel Alanna: the first adventure is somewhat better and I know most people agree with me. But, everyone should definitely read this one because practically all of Tamora Pierce's books are worth it, especially The Song of the Lioness Quartet, Protector of the Small Quartet, and Circle Opens Quartet."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful tie-in","review":"I absolutely loved this book. It had lots of advernture and excitement, but more, in this book all of Alanna's escapades and doings cumulated. You can see how so many things from past books all came together in this one and if things hadn't previously happened just so, things would have turned out very differently. For instance, if she hadn't fused Duke Roger's sword with Lightning in The Woman Who Rides Like A Man, she wouldn't have been able to hold the sword when Roger called it to him, but if she had just had lightning he wouldn't have been able to call it to him at all, and she wouldn't have been able to kill him. Look at it again and you'll see how perfecly everything fits together!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL!","review":"I love this book, a new romance, more adventure, and brand new characters.

Alana should have married Prince Jon. I think that the second and first books are best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good conclusion","review":"I don't mean to be the only reader that gave this book 4 stars, but in my opinion, it didn't have it all. I started losing intrest in the quartet after about book 3. Book 1 and 2 left me hanging for more, but I kind of lost interest in 3, and 4 wasn't what I thought. It was good, but Alanna and Prince Johnothan make a better couple, and not that George is a good guy, but you know, the Prince kinda grows on you. All in all, I think that this quartet is Tamora's worst, but her worst isn't bad! I like the Immortals and Circle of Magic the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"too simple to read, for the simple minded","review":"This book is for juveniles only. The perfect example was that of a previous reviewer, who's nine years old and said her and her friend understood the book. Oh really, so where does that leave us older readers?

I have read the book many time before buying this copy and it is a fantastic book, just not the one I recieved from Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent finish to the series with one last concern.","review":"I think I need to say I rate this series highly. Nonetheless, the parents of young readers may have to think over the presentation of a hero who engages in un-married sex. I also must emphasize that the sex in never graphic in any way and is simply alluded to in the story line. At the end of the book Alanna agrees to marry one of her lovers for one year. The story continues to involves the lady knight and her amazing cat in conquering the evil around her and protecting the king."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Go Alanna!","review":"I thought that this book was absolutly wonderful what with Alanna whipping the Duke's butt, and killing that freak with her awsome sword. But, I didn't really like how \\"Lightning\\" had to die with her little kitty. But I loved how she married George, even though Jon was pretty cool! But I think that that one princess was perfect for him. The ape thing was a little odd, but, still, what a great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"People","review":"Alanna was meant to be with Geogre not Jon. it is shown from the beginning of the series. she was never going to be a leader. it was clear. she needed someone to follow in the end. she wants to explore but as a queen it would drag her down.Geogre is there as a friend and slowly progresses. Geogre would be the only one to deal with her temper as Jon would run of - look at 'Woman who rides like a man'.AS A TEENAGER i personally feel (as well as a school survy - Lily) that the marriage between Alanna and Geogre was great and unexpecting. Alanna has been his love for yrs and finally they have come together. as us teens get emotionally attached to a charactor i feel that Ms Pierce as ended the series extremely well and i hope to see the loving couple pop up somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"I THOUGHT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ROMANTIC","review":"I was rather depressed after reading this story. I can't believe that TP wrote this book. I kept hoping that stupid female would wake up and go back to her first love. I thoughtthe book might get better at the end but it didn't. I wish I had never read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought ...","review":"I loved the first two books but the last two were a total letdown! HOnestly! Alanna likes three guys but she can't choose between them. Liam is just an excuse for her to cheat on George. Then he dies and she marries George who in my opinion will always be a theif. What happened to Jon? He loved Alanna for so long and then he ditches her for a woman he's known for like 2 days. I guess I'm exagerating a bit, but still!Alanna went from being a strong determined girl, to being a self-centered jerk with a temper problem. Alanna and Jon were fine until they didn't get married then they turned into weirdos with attitude problems. They get even worse in the books about Daine and Kel!"},{"rating":"2","title":":]","review":"I absolutely love this series! I was completely captivated by Tamora Pierce's world and unique characters. However, I am still slightly upset that Faithful died."},{"rating":"2","title":"3.5...","review":"I won't spoil the plot for you because many people before me already have. However, I have to say this isn't one of her better books (It seems to me that the last book of each quartet isn't as good as the others...).A few of the twists are extremly predictable (Thom's experiments *hint* *hint*). There is still enough of the \\"Pierce Magic\\" in it to keep you from giving up half-way. Compared with may of the books out there, it is just above average, but by Tamora Pierce's standards, it fails to deliver that *oomph* (supstitute the oomph with, \\"power\\", \\"force\\", \\"meaning\\", etc) that I had adored in most of her other books (aka all by Lady Knight)."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST","review":"I've read all the Tortall books and this is the best one yet! I really don't understand all those whiners who complain that Alanna should've married Jon. I mean, how could she still be a knight and the queen. And George is only 8 years older than her. No, there's people who'll whine about anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"if you desire morals...","review":"I'm afraid this series ended horribly. If you love reading about moral characters who stick to doing what is right even though its hard...dont read this book.I felt so cheated to discover my heroine was nothing more then a naive, and insecure sword fighter.When I read the last few pages I was in shock. I mean, it felt like a gossip girl meets medieval times. It was that bad. The main chara hadn't DEVELOPED into anything any woman desires to be.The view of love in this book is screwed and leaves a bad taste in my heart. An interesting storyline is nothing when the chara comes out not a better person, but a desperate one willing to sleep with whoever will have her. PLEASE, dont waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad","review":"I can't really say anything about this book except that I HATED HATED HATED it....I thought the writing was phenomenal, the characters exceptional, the plot fantastic.

City of Industry is a treat for Keitel fans as he is at his best. With the seedy underworld of LA as the backdrop, Keitel methodically searches for the man who killed his brother. You won't get a lot of clever dialogue in this one but you will get a fun to watch Keitel and a compelling Stephen Dorff as the paranoid pyscho. If you want a modern day western with a tough guy, this one's for you. I for one, loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"really GOOD","review":"harvey is hard to beat, a really great actor. i love most all his movies and this is no exception. the plot is exciting, the action mostly non stop, and i found to be an exceptional screen play with lots of thought put into the overall product. entertainment value is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern Film Noir","review":"Interesting characters, believible plot. I have watched it a number of times, and enjoyed it each time. Probably my favorite DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty darn good crime thriller","review":"Harvey Keitel (Roy) plays his usual self-assured character leading a group in a jewelry heist, and then goes up against a myriad of contract killers.Famke Janssen is very convincing as a mother of two and wife of one the jewelry heist gangmembers who gets caught up in the mess. Famke is very attractive with or without makeup, (and very tall-with those long legs). Timothy Hutton, Roy's brother (killed off early by Dorff) and Lucy Liu have minor parts.All I can say is you'll be so very happy when Harvey Keitel smears Stephen Dorff's brains all over the pavement, towards the end of the movie. Stephen Dorff gives and absolutely first-class perfomance of a double-crossing, short-tempered, quick-drawing psychopath, who won't be double-crossed (as he has double-crossed) by anyone. Why does Harvey Keitel always seem like that \\"cleaner-upper\\" character in Pulp Fiction? You'll love the lawyer's office \\"laptop computer\\" scene. Classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap Action and Famke (Harmony)","review":"Harvey Keitel is pretty old and he needs to lose weight. Stephen Dorff needs to go away. Timothy Hutton is still around?

This book is not a \\"Twinkie\\" or a light beach read. This is an \\"excuse me...uh hum...sir?...EXCUSE ME...we're closing now and you have to leave\\" kind of book. Mesmerizing, haunting, unexpected. Read it and learn about the first round of ethnic cleansing this crazy planet produced in the 20th century but more importantly for the cutting emotion the reading evokes."},{"rating":"1","title":"just meh","review":"I bought this book cause I really love fiction based around developing nations, especially the middle east. So I was hoping for a vivid portrayal of life in Lebanon through the wounded characters eyes.I just wasn't able to get into it because of the style of writing. It jumped around a lot, and not in a particularly exciting way. While I very much enjoy side stories, these did not pull me in and I did feel like I was really getting to know the character, unless the character is one of those boring people who can describe things really well, but not make them meaningful to the reader.Needless to say I never finished it, but maybe it gets better towards the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a wonderful cookbook for frozen desserts","review":"This book is the absolute best cookbook if you like frozen desserts.

It's got EVERYTHING you need to know about ice cream, related desserts, sauces, mix-ins, toppings, etc. Working in an agricultural product store I especially appreciated the sections pertaining to the science of making ice cream.

The main character, Jeremy, inadvertantly enters the world of the gods when he puts on the face of Apollo. Driven by the god who he now shares his body with, Jeremy learns to harness his magic so he may ultimitly confront the Lord Hades.

Don't the people at Tor read these things?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much repetition.","review":"This is the first Saberhagen book I've ever read and most likely the last. It sounded interesting and could have been really good, but I can't take the style in which it was written. It was inconsistent in a lot of places and SO repetative. It would probably be half as long if everything weren't repeated twelve times. I really can't stand it when someone says the same thing over and over. It gets irritating. It's almost like he wrote some paragraphs twice, couldn't decide which version he liked better, so decided to keep them both (or all three or four). I especially didn't like the way Jeremy had decided that the masks were taking over the wearers and totally changing their personalities, and then suddenly two pages later(after a lot of repetition) everyone is back to normal and the masks don't seem to have such an influence over them. I really regret reading this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have doubts about Saberhagen writing this himself...","review":"Maybe he wrote the outline and then gave it to a high school student to finish.The repetition is extremely annoying. At one point (page 171 to be exact) it is mentioned that a character is lucky not to have been injured in a fall. Then it is mentioned twice more in the next few paragraphs.There also seems to be some confusion in the flow of time. Days will appear to have gone by and then it turns out to be the same afternoon. I hate to say it, but it is almost like Mr. Saberhagen would write a few lines, have a couple of cocktails and then write a few more. Doesn't TOR have editors that read these books before they are printed?I have read almost all of Fred Saberhagen's books and am terribly disappointed by this one. I will read the next in the series, but if it isn't any better, then it is time move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"A protection that do not protect...","review":"You see, when you first buy this product and receive it, you can actually see why it's so cheap !

A great read if your looking for something light and quick."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only small thing about this book is its size.","review":"Told in chapter stories, it starts in 1962 when Roxanne is 12. It ends when she is grown with a child of her own and she completes the circle and returns to Annette, Texas to live.The writing is so beautiful and clear that when the author describes the corner drugstore with the marble soda fountain, I could remember sitting in Vern's Drugstore with my friends ordering lemon and cherry cokes and wonderful chocolate malts.This is a sweet book complete with recipes for wonderful desserts such as \\"Mabel's Angel Food Cake with Chocolate Sauce\\" and \\"Aunt Ruthie's Lemon Pound Cake.\\"So settle back with \\"Doreen's Frozen Fruit Salad\\" (page 41) and enjoy a small (but big) book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light, easy reading","review":"I enjoyed reading about the young Roxanne growing up, through her teen years into an adult and a mom. Her childhood sounds like the perfect 1950's youth. There are frequent trips to the local drug store/soda fountain, family get-togethers, the pie contest, boyfriends... and more.The only part that will shock is the brief, but somewhat incestuous encounter that Roxanne has with her cousin, Tommy.I recommend this book for a relaxing Saturday afternoon, during which it will be quickly read and enjoyed (and perhaps will make you hungry while reading all the talk of food... and the included recipes). Since this is such a quick and short read, I recommend buying it with the intent to pass it on, or checking it out of your public library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspiring","review":"This book had so many chances to develop thought-provoking story lines, but instead jumped out of a story as quickly as it was started. The characters were quite bland, as many weren't even given a chance to be explored before the focus changed yet again. This was an easy read in terms of the length, but a hard read due to boring storylines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"Funny how this book got an average of four and a half stars and Toni Morrison's The Bluest Eye got three and a half. That book was about a girl growing up too, but people don't like to be disturbed. This is the perfect American book- it is cute, short, entertaining and empty. A few dramatic moments are added to fend off triviality. It doesn't have a purpose, doesn't make you think. Yet another charming, feminine portrait of small-town life in the South. Read it and be comforted that things are the way they should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love it","review":"I'm 13, and I loved this book! I hate to read, but i needed to read something for school. I thought that it was a little too adultish for my age, but the story is great! If your over lets say 15, read this book! also, i think that its more for woman than men. Ok, so enjoy your reading! you'll love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good summer read","review":"I was a bit confused when I began this book; I thought it was only about the character Roxanne as a 12 year old. It is actually the story of a small town girl, Roxanne, as she grows up in the wonderful small town of Annette, Texas. Each chapter deals with a fragment of her growing up moving from baseball, to best friends to nail polish and love. Intertwined in all that is the lives of her parents and other family and the loved ones who come and go. It feels very true to the time and place, beginning in Annette in 1962 and moving where time takes her. The characters are interesting and true to life and very likable. The recopies throughout are actually pretty good, the fudge sauce divine. It is a slice of life in the 60's and 70's and anyone who ventures to Annette, Texas is in for a treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"World of Pies...Yummy","review":"Karen Stolz has written a charming little book of life in Annette, Texas in the '60s and '70s. The story begins in 1962 and twelve year old Roxanne Milner is more crazy about baseball than boys. This was the year of the Pie Fair, an event that changed Annette, Texas in a small way and started Roxie on her journey to adulthood. World of Pies is a smart, witty and often poignant look at a young girl growing up, told with such insight and humor, that it will vividly take many back to that time in their own lives. Ms Stolz's characters come alive on the page and are memorable with strong voices. Her scenes are true to life, as Roxanne moves through each rite of passage towards adulthood. World of Pies is a very human story and a wonderful snapshot of small town life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read for All Women","review":"This is a delightful book that I would recommend to all women. It is a fast read and you will wish that it would just keep going. It covers Roxanne's life from childhood, to teen years to college, to marriage, to having children with many of life's trials and joyous moments mixed in. I liked the structure of it--it was arranged as short stories all about Roxanne's life, rather than one long telling (similar to \\"A Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing\\" ). As a 24 year old woman, I identified with so much of this book it was eerie. I plan on recommending it to all of my friends and my mother and her friends. Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummy!","review":"This book is quite a pleasant way to pass an afternoon. its a short,easy read but one that is all pleasure. There is no hard drama or plot twists, just sweet flowing writing. Its very nice to read about a normal person's coming of age in the South. I would say its a true tribute to all us Southern girls and how much we love our mommas. Just be forewarned - the recipes will have your mouth watering!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a great sterling silver ring","review":"I love this ring. It comes in larger sizes. Nicely designed.

I have to give it 5 stars because of the impact it had on me. Looking at it now as an adult, it seems almost comical. But it was effective then. Also, this is one of the first films (if not the first) with the theme of alien invasion. Important film in my life. It definitely is worth a look. This is a classic film of the sci-fi genre. Watch it and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Famous Mothers of Filmland","review":"Although I had seen this movie on TV many times beginning in the mid 1950s it's always funto watch again. I saw it again the other night on TCM and the host informed us that thethe sweetheart of the film, Margaret Fields, was none other than SALLY FIELD'S mother.Small world this 'Planet X.'In addition to the above TCM's (great channel) host mentioned that nobody in the cast even knewthe name of the poor guy in the X Man suit. It was remembered though that he could be heardduring shooting breaks that the suit (costume) was unbearably hot and that he wasn't beingpaid enough for the torture.Back in the 20th century when a complete amature (see 'NOVA' PBS') discovered the planet PLUTOit was originally named Planet X ! Now that PLUTO has been downgraded to a non-planet due tothe latest definition of same, the poor guy can't even go home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scarey Alien","review":"I haven't seen this one yet, but from what I understand, the Alien bears an uncanny resemblance to the Kid From Deliverance. Now THAT's worth watching!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a lot of improvement","review":"This is probably one of the worst books on food history I've ever read. One would think that since the publisher released the book several months late, they might have used that extra time to proofread. The number of typographical errors truly astounded me, and made the book difficult, if not agonizing, to read. There is very little actual text, as this is primarily a picture book. While the pictures are of fine quality and brought back many memories, I noticed that the captions didn't always match up with the pictures. And while the brightly colored pages did make a visually interesting background, it also made the tiny type rather difficult to read. Overall, there is very little to learn from this book, and anyone who is interested in food history would be better served by one of the many other books already on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"No windows 64 support","review":"I purchased this for the same reason the other reviewer did - middle of the road price. Big mistake!Despite their advertising drivers for Windows 64 bit, they don't support Vista-64 at all. They also don't support Windows XP Professional 64 bit with Intel! When tech support is contacted, the basic response is tough luck - you have choosen the wrong processor, we only support AMD!Avoid this product if you need future-proofing.

I began exercising in August 1999 - first with one mile a day walks which led to 4 miles per day. After a few months I felt I needed more and I got it with this video. Susan has been where I am and she is inspiring to say the least. The routine is not difficult to learn, you get a marvelous workout, and she is there encouraging you all the way- showing you how to build a stronger fitness level. If you are serious about getting Lean,Strong& Healthy then buy this video- it will change your life. Another great thing is the different people in the video- they are all different sizes at different fitness levels. They are not all size 3 - they are real people who are working REAL hard at getting healthy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this workout","review":"I wish this workout was on dvd, I have burned through 3 copies already.

Unfortunately it became an endless exploration of who was on whose side, who was going to fight whom and why, and what the political consequences would be. Characterization is fine, but this is anything but \\"character driven.\\" It's another exploration of an author's imaginary world. Well-written, but became too boring At about page 100, I skimmed to page 200 - no change, same things going on. I won't finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Protestat Bashing at its worst","review":"I read this book as part of a required class in college. It is an appalling lambasting of Protestant faith shallowly disguised as a guide to Catholic Christian Faith. Shame on Peter Kreeft.I as a Protestant who never critized Catholics was angered and insulted at every reference to Protestantism. It definetely generated much hard feelings toward me by my classmates and has created in me a bitterness toward catholics that greives me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Presentation","review":"I teach Intro to Catholic Theology at a non-Catholic Bible College in the Philippines and have developed the course from Keeft's Catholic Christianity. Though not a Catholic myself, I teach the course as if I were. It is an eye-opener for the dozens of pastors and church workers I teach, many of them former Catholics, to receive a compelling case for Catholicism. Here in the Philippines, where animosity between Catholics and non-Catholics is intense, refutations of Catholicism are often based on horrid anti-Catholic publications and exploit the theological ignorance of many undereducated Catholics here. Kreeft's Catholic Christianity is the most accessible and articulate presentation of Catholicism I've encountered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catholic Christianity","review":"This book is excellent for helping a person to understand the Catholic faith as explained in the Catechism of the Catholic Church.

Not everything lines up with the Scriptures, and that is the not so good part. If it doesn't follow the Word of God, it isn't of God- it's of Man.

But I just ordered more, and I saw that the content is down to 21%. I wasn't sure if the 4% would make a difference - well, guess what, it does!

A Congolese group delving into the history of Cuban rumba (the songs of Guillermo Portobales). Recorded in Paris with overdubbed arrangments by Venezuela's Nelson Hernandez, recorded in New York. And featuring Cameroon's Manu Dibango as sax soloist (I like him better here than his customary Afrobeat), with vocalists singing in a raft of languages, including a star turn by New York's Isabel Martinez.Oddly, this mishmash mostly works.

Along the way, he meets a real woman played by Melanie Griffith. Eventually, he falls in love with the real woman and abandons the robot.I like the story and the special effects.

I figured that the bulb had gone out, but it was still emitting a little bit of light from the edges of the bulb, actually. I bought a replacement bulb, and it did the exact same thing with the brand new bulb. The light fixture clearly has something defective about it. Do not buy this brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seemed to work almost ok, but..","review":"The lamp worked ok at the beginning, even though the wire was loose and it would lose contact and make the light flicker every once in a while. However it completely stopped working after ~1 week. We're going to see if it's fixable, but it's a pain! You think you solved a problem and you find another one.."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor life expectancy","review":"Two of two units have been replaced due to failure in 2 years I would not recommend this item for that reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thinest fixture I could find!","review":"This fixture fits neatly in the 1 inch space under my kitchen cabinet; except for the switch is slightly invisible - a good thing. Replacement bulbs, that last for years, are hard to find in stores but are also available on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't last long","review":"Bought two lamps in November 2009. One died on Sep 24 2010, the other one today Jan 21, 2011. The bulbs are still good, the cords are still good, the casing seems good, but probably the starter went bad, it glows red a bit at the edges.I was very happy with the lamps while they worked, they buzzed a little until they warmed up, but they were bright, light, easy to mount, daisy-chain-able, and all-around comfortable. If I knew how to replace or fix the starter, I'd probably still be happy with it, but lasting a year on average I'm not. Please comment if you have a small fluorescent lamp recommendation to try."},{"rating":"1","title":"This series started out so well","review":"The first two series was so good. I especially liked the second, where things got more romantic, and I really enjoyed Tamora Pierce's humorous edge. However, in this book, she totally changed the personality of Jonathan to make him arrogant and pigheaded (on purpose) so Alanna would go to George. I also dislike how Alanna's character evolved in this series, notably in this book and the fourth book. She goes back on almost all her previous beliefs that made her so original. Now she just seems to have a lack of morals and sleeps with George and later, the Dragon. Also, her personality, which was so charming before, makes her seem so annoying now. I find this book a very disappointing sequel to In the Hand of the Goddess, which is an excellent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book but not as good as the first or second one","review":"Now that there is no major enemy (Roger) like before, it is as if the plot is our of aim or something. I think Jonathan is good in the first book, but starting from the second one he expected too much of Alanna. But sometimes, I think Alanna should make out her mind. She loves him but she ALWAYS hesistate about the marriage thing with him and never with the final guy. (I don't wanna tell) I think Alanna should just tell Jon she likes him as a friend or a protector or something instead of always vowing love to him, which make him very fustrated, too.This book is not with as much action as the other three, and much of the plot can be easily guessed. But in order to get to the fourth book, you will have to read this. But don't take me wrong, this is not as good as the other ones, but I didn't say it was bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I don't know what Tamora Pierce was thinking when she wrote this book. I am a reader of all of Ms. Pierce's series, and this book is the worst. Alanna is way too soft, and nothing happens. If you want a good book, read the rest fo the series. I hope Ms. Pierce never repeats her mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another amazing one!","review":"Another splendid tamora pierce novel, The Woman Who Rides Like A Man is a perfect masterpiece which I will read over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a great addition to the series","review":"Okay let's be honest, this book was not as amazing as the first two. However, it plays a huge role in Alanna's life. It's her first year outside of the palace and she's in this new place and doesn't know anyone. it's much more serious than the first two because Alanna is changing. She is not the naive child she was, she has her own spirit and fire. She is desperate to repair something that was broken (those who read it know what I mean) and she changes a small village for the better by being a teacher to the young children. I agree that the book is a little boring BUT... I still feel that it had it's purpose for telling the story and I love it for that (but in all honesty when I re-read the series, which I have a ton of times, I usually skip over a lot of this book).Tamora is still my absolute favorite fantasy author, she is tied with J.K. Rowling as my #1."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par","review":"Wow! After the first two novels, I thought I'd discovered a winner in Tamora Pierce. But I found \\"Woman Who Rides Like a Man\\" to be quite frankly, boring. Alanna's character has changed- instead of being an aspiring swordswoman she becomes a shaman and her character changed to a whiny-superior-know-at-all.What made Alanna interesting was her desire to do unorthodox things. IE: Becoming a knight, going on adventures. Now its as though the character backsliding. I read Alanna books to learn about her adventures.. Not about her learning to weave.I also don't particularly care for the older men Alanna keeps going out with, as an adult reader, I find it off-putting... Don't these men have women their own age? George is *way* too old for Alanna.I was disappointed in \\"Woman Who Rides Like A Man\\" It did not hold my interest, and seemed quite forced."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not even worth it's price in PaperBack","review":"I looked forward to reading The Woman who rides like a man, because I had so enjoyed Pierce's previous novels. Part of the enticem ent to continue reading a book, however, is an identification with the characters. In this case, there wasn't any. There was none forthcoming. Instead, I kept on wishing they would use their native intelligence, rather than pure emotion (or in Pieces's world, the scent or essence of emotion). I actually kept on reading just to see if they would come to their senses!! I was keenly disappointed, and in the end, their fates did not concern me. That is the ultimate failure of the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"If You're Desperate Enough","review":"I guess that I was just too old for it(somehow I doubt that), but I found this series (and this book in particular) to be tiring. I enjoyed the first book and Alanna as a heroine (and as a role model), but as I read on, I realized her for what she was...a flat and an annoyingly perfect character who was set in an underdeveloped book.The plot itself would have been interesting were it not so quickly gotten over with. I honestly would have been patient enough to read a much, much, longer book. The plot is weak because it is not developed enough, and the climax...often momentous battles or events...is very disappointing.Young girls who need a feminist or a strong role model would like this series. Older girls who want a strong but flawed role model and a lot more development and quality of writing would not. For the later group, I would recommend the Trickster series (also be Tamora Pierce) which are much more palatable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but not the Best","review":"I thought that The Woman Who Rides Like A Man was a great book, but not the best. It had some things that I liked alot, like the feeling that Duke Roger was there, and haunting Alana, even though he was dead. I also liked the tension at the end of the book whether Alana's brother Thom raised Roger from the dead or not. Some things that I didn't like in the book were that Prince Jonothan was a total snobby jerk and that Alana seemed to have lost her \\"power\\" and gotten weaker emotionally. Over all, I thought the book was pretty good, but it could've been better. I'm just warning other readers to look out for those parts, and hang in there, because book 3 (Lioness Rampant) Is one of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Continuing the engaging story but with an added complication","review":"The story continues but includes what might be called casual sex. Alanna has sex without commitment with two men. I must emphasize that the sex in never graphic in any way and is simply alluded to in the story line. Nonetheless, parents may want to consider if girls as young as 11 should view that activity as proper for the hero of this story. The story continues with Faithful, her amazing cat as Almanna fights the evil in the land. I highly recommend this third story in the series. All the books are exciting and a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different from the others but still just as good.","review":"...I still read the book but I was quite dissapointed because it wasn't was mysterious.The book takes place in a Bazir (type of native) tribe. Alanna and Coram are not aloud to leave until they can train another Shaman to take over the tribe. Alanna is being held responible for an accident the happened with their last one.The book involves much controversy with Jonathan and George. You can really feel for Alanna and how confused she is. If you have read the other two make sure to read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great story of life on your own!","review":"The Woman Who Rides Like A Man is a great book and takes a different turn than the others. Alanna goes to the south and stays with a native tribe. I thought Mrs. Pierce did a wonderful job with this book, creating more adventures for Alanna, even though she was out of the palace. Not at all boring and Alanna most certainly is a woman who rides like a man! Wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You go girl","review":"Ding Ding! Round three for Alanna. In this book you at frist you think man all the chacters are gone that I knew. No way hang in there they are back and better than ever. You will love it. It is like you are Alanna and you are feeling her love, pain and her worst fear. All I want you do is read it you will not regret."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dragon Lady","review":"What a shame. The author created a story with so much potential and just threw it into the trash. It was a great idea, to make a woman knight, but the heroine that started out so strong and likable turned into a person with low morals that jumps from one man's bed to another. What sort of heroine is that?This series started out so well. The first book was great, and kept you at the edge of your seat. But in the second book, she started to sleep with men, and in this one it only got worse. I'm sorry that it did.The story, apart from the dissapointing romance, was quite good. I enjoyed reading about the Bazuir ( yes, I know I didn't spell it right ) .I'm sorry to say that because of the HEROINES bed-hopping that I can only rate this book 2 stars out of 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the other two","review":"This series started out really strong, but I didn't think that there was the same kind of humour and spirit as the first two books. Alanna seemed to grow more bitter and less interesting. George and Jonathan only became stereotypes of their former characters. I loved the first two, but I would not recommend reading this. It spoils the series somewhat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loathing Beyond Words","review":"I don't exactly know how it has happened over the years but Tamora Pierce is the one author I loathe...with a fiery passion. I've tried reading The Song of the Lioness and Protector of the Small series. It's been years since I've read them simply because I found them to be utter junk. I loved Alanna but the series just slid downhill from there. They are completely immoral.I suppose this would be OK except that Tamora Pierce's books are targeted to teenagers. I know lots of teens are sexually active but I don't think it's necessary to market books to them where the characters are morally depraved in that area. I really haven't found any other series in teen lit that seems, in my opinion, to condone sleeping around like the Lioness series does.This series is utter junk.Just thought I would throw in my two cents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, anything Tamora Pierce writes hasta be good, right??","review":"I liked this book a lot. It's a bit different from the other books in the quartet, but that's only to be expected. I thought it was rather eerie. Or, eerier than the other three. I like Alanna of Trebond and Olau. She's the perfect heroine, and the author makes everything so real. Everthing is very well written, and the characters are great. I would recommend this book to people who like tales of fantasy, magic, and chivalry."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"I HATED THIS BOOK! Sorry, I just did. What happened to the sweet, strong, lovable character from the first book? Alanna is a total ... in this book. She sleeps with way to many men. Isn't that a bit excessive? I think there is a difference between \\"grrowing up\\" and sleeping with two different guys in the same month. Give me a break. If you are a all like me AVOID THIS BOOK IF AT ALL POSSIBLE. If not, well, okay, but..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attention all readers! Throw this book in the trashcan!","review":"This book is not worth the money paid for it.

Whatever happened to the girl we knew in the first book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just.... No","review":"This series had potential, starting out good in the first two books, but this book is where all hope of a good story was destroyed.First of all, I think in this series they could have been a little bit more creative with how people found out that she was a girl. Both times people found out because by some force of magic her clothes were ripped off. Please.Plus, Alanna sleeps with two different men and I don't like the personality of either of them. The author seemed to see it fit to destroy all the good of the story in this volume.Another disappointment of this series is that we never hear much about what happens to her brother, Thom. And when he is around he acts like a complete jerk.There are far better books out there than this one, trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tamora Pierce books","review":"Great books! Almost as good as the Immortals and protector of the small quartets, but still pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"a really great book!","review":"its a great book! alanna is finding out that being a knight isnt what she thought! she goes to the desert, becomes one of the people in the bazhir tribe, becomes a shaman, jonathon is asked to become voice of the tribes, and he proposes to her! will alanna say yes, and become queen of tortall? or will she say no, and go to her good friend george, the king of the thieves? will jonathon survive and become the voice? will they ever find out whats going on in corus?dont listen to those people that say this is the worse book! this isnt! none of Ms. Pierce's books are bad! all the people that say this book is bad, did you think that this book was about alanna finding out what it means to be a knight? so, get your hands on this book, get a few hours of free time, and read! you wont be able to put the book down! trust this 12 yr. old!and thank you, Ms. Pierce, for another great book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SO SMALL!","review":"I bought three of these necklaces for my bridesmaids and returned them the day after they were delivered.

Then it says the cause of the fire was because the spark plug gap was too wide which \\"let raw fuel run straight through the engines and out the turbines and there it had ignited.\\"The part about crashing is sensationalism.

Would not order again from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and buy an OEM battery.","review":"I have gotten better results with Sterlingtek batteries for a fraction of the price...like less the $15 shipped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed with customer service","review":"This is not the item that I ordered. I ordered the duo set remote controls for taking picutres that was a combo buy not a battery. Contacted the seller several time by email and no resonds to correct the order. No phone number to call seller! Now I have an extra battery and no remotes."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong battery","review":"Amazon advertised the wrong battery as a spare for the canon d30 that I bought, so I am now stuck with a useless battery"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fifty bucks for a battery?","review":"There's hardly a reason to buy Canon-branded batteries anymore now that the Chinese have taken to making 3rd party substitutes. For a mere fraction of this price you can buy several at your favorite auction site."},{"rating":"2","title":"SECURE VALUE","review":"This Rechargeable Battery is durable and certainly most liable than others with the same specifications. This liability provides a longer life and the insurance for a safe usage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battery does what it should!","review":"I bought this battery as a supplement to the one that came with my Digital Rebel XTi, because you just should always have a spare. I'd read in some reviews that this battery didn't perform as well as the model for my previous Digital Rebel (the BP-511), but I certainly have no complaints so far. I'm going on about 475 shots on my first charge, and no \\"low battery\\" indicator yet. I should mention that I hardly ever use flash, and that makes a difference. Anyway, it works very well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dependable and Long-Lasting","review":"I have owned two Canon brand XTi camera batteries since 2006, when I purchased my Rebel XTi camera. I use the camera a LOT: I also do real estate photography in addition to my own photography. After heavy use, the batteries are only now starting to show their age. It is well worth the extra cost for the Canon brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better buy a Canon battery and no substitute!","review":"I purchased a battery from a non-canon dealer for my Canon EOS Digital and was very disappointed! The batter lasted about 6 months and wouldn't hold a charge anymore. My Canon original battery kept hopping like the energizer bunny! I purchased the original equipment the second time for a little more money but am very happy with my purchase. Don't accept substitutes!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon NB-2LH","review":"Excellent quality. Always be sure the product is Canon. Only battery that holds a charge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon NB-2LH","review":"These batteries last forever. i've taken hundreds of shot and it's still not dead. I'm an amature photographer and i take a lot of pics and i dont have to charge these for like a week or two. recommened to anyone who wants a long battery"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Generic","review":"I have two Canon-brand NB-2LH batteries and four generic knock-off versions that I use on a daily basis. In two years, I have had absolutely no problems with the knock-offs, and the four of them combined cost the same as ONE of the Canon-brand batteries. Unless the thought of not owning a name-brand product gives you the hives, I highly recommend that you purchase an off brand. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good battery","review":"This is the same exact battery that came with my Canon Digital Rebel XT. I knew when buying an additional battery, this was the way to go. I knew it would work, and it did. Nothing to complain about."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING!!!!!!!!!!! Potential COUNTERFEIT!!!!!!!","review":"This is not just a bad/cheap battery! It is a COUNTERFEIT! (or at least the one I received in November of 2010 is).My G9 has stopped working and the people repairing it have told us that this battery is to blame.It sends too much power through the camera and makes the cameras circuit board swell, eventually ruining it.My next step will be to contact Amazon in the hopes of preventing other people from ruining their cameras."},{"rating":"1","title":"Counterfeit reported by multiple forums","review":"I went for it because of the high amazon reviews, but BEWARE, the battery is referenced as a FAKE across multiple forums see website [...]. There's a clear difference between this battery compared to my original both from the outlook and the performance. For the outlook refer to the website I gave you. For the performance: I've used this battery for 6 months. It performs very poorly compared to my original battery (which is already 5 years old). My old battery can take ~500 shots w/o flash before it runs out even after 5 years old, while the battery sold by amazon dies after ~250 shots. Please BEWARE. For 250 shots, it's definately not performing as an original Canon battery should."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battery","review":"I think these batteries are great. I use mine with my XTi with the grip, so you use 2 batteries at once, and I've shot 1,500 pictures in one day and never had to use a spare battery during that shoot. That's pretty awesome in my opinion. I don't know how many more I could have taken, that's just how many I shot in that one day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made in China","review":"This Canon Battery purchased from you has had limited use and will no longer accept a charge. The battery purchased from a Canon dealer with the Canon Rebel XTi camera years ago is still working great. My original battery is \\"Made in Japan\\". Your battery looks identical to my Canon original, but is \\"Made in China\\".Today I called Canon to report the problem. They want me to send it to them along with my invoice from Amazon so they can take a look at it.I have an additional Canon camera with original batteries from 2004 and all are still working great. This is my first purchase of photographic equipment from Amazon and an independent seller. I want you to know that this battery is below basic quality standards and intend the seller, Jacob Borger, to see this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have product","review":"This is a must have product for any Digital Rebel XT owner. Always carry a spare fully charged battery.Amazon has a competitive pricing structure and very timely delivery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon vs.Other Brand for Canon EOS","review":"I am an amateur photographer and have done a few weddings for friends and I do have to say I prefer the Canon battery over other generic batteries for this EOS camera. I can take about 600-700 photographs with this battery, while a few batteries I got from a secondary company lasted only 100-150 shots and not to mention they threw off my timing with my 430EX flash. I definitely recommend the Canon NB-2LH for Canon original equipment. These batteries have served me well in outdoor photography in Alaska, Hawaii and in the Caribbean, as well as, special event portraits. My recommendation in always to have two batteries. I personally have had my original battery from canon for over three years and it has taken over 10,000 photographs and still going strong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery starting to lose its charge 3 months after purchase date...same as a CTA battery","review":"I bought this battery the same time I bought a CTA one so I can compare the difference. I guess there's no difference as they both are starting to lose their charge. It's been about 3 months since I purchased them from Amazon.I guess it's true when they say batteries are a crap shot.The original Canon battery that came with the camera did a bit better and lasted about 1 year and 3 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great battery, stick with the name-brands","review":"I've tried other off-brand batteries before, and as other reviewers may have said, they just don't have the longevity that the Canon version does. It's worked flawlessly for me and held more of a charge than I would have expected. It's worth the little extra money to get a brand name that you can rely on.Update (8/14/2012) - Four years and 20k+ shots later, this battery is still going strong. I ended up buying a second battery (still an authentic Canon) in 2009, and they both are still working flawlessly. I can get several hours of shooting without having to worry about these batteries dying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never need to charge it ( ALMOST NEVER!!!)","review":"No really, I have never seen a battery last so long between charges. The Rebel XT must use a lot of power between, taking reviewing and erasing pictures, plus the screen use for pictures. I can take HUNDREDS of pictures without a charge between.
