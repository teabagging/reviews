When not put together the tips of the tube things are hard - I definitely had to keep an eye on the kids while they were playing with this.

After months of having my sofa and outdoor furniture cushions being used as walls of forts, I was very excited to have this set in the house. I was extremely disappointed once the box was open. I found putting the pieces together difficult due to the instability of the structures. When put together it is not very sturdy at all. I would have been happier with more pieces to stabilize the vertical supports or better yet, PVC tubing to build the structure. Less flexibility but more support would have suited my purpose fine. This will most likely be tossed in the garbage. With a company like Cranium I would have thought they would have been able to deliver a better product than this. They are on the right track. My kids are starved for a set to build \\"forts\\" with.

So many things to build, safe materials, cool colors, lightweight ... it's wonderful.As for the review which complained that the pieces are unsafe when the kids wack each other with them, well, yeah! They're not water noodles, they're building materials.

Obviously, I would suggest something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cranium Fort was just what my 4 year old needed!","review":"My son is addicted to fort building... you know with chairs, blankets or anything he can find. When I saw this Cranium Super Fort product, I knew it was just what he needed. Cranium has made the styrofoam beans and interlocking balls so easy that a four year old can put it together by himself. He even knows how to clip on the nylon fabric so he can hide in the fort. Sometimes he still wants to extend the fort with other blankets and chairs, but overall you can make a pretty nice size fort, ship, space station or whatever else you can think up. It is also very compact and can be put away in an easily portable bag. We also bought the twisty tunnel to add to the fun of him climbing into his fort. Cranium is so smart!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea, but not as good as the Invent A Tent","review":"I already had a Invent A Tent that my kids have loved. So when I saw the cranium fort I had to buy it as well. While the concept is the same, the cranium is not as good. The Invent A Tent is a lot bigger and has enough material to cover any fort built. The Cranium tent is a lot smaller, not as kid friendly and I found that the material only covers about half of the forts when built. (Most of the pictures of the cranium fort are not covered in the back where you can't see)Anyhow, I think it is a great concept, the Inventatent is just a lot better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rainy Day Fun","review":"The Super Fort is terrific rainy day entertainment for our 6 year old. Her imagination has taken her to tea parties in castles, piloting heliocopters to rescue lost puppies and camping out in the woods -- all in her living room. She loves snapping together the pieces and building all sorts of neat configurations -- and the take down is just as easy. She delights in making all the pieces and parts fit back in the handy carry bag to stow away in her closet. And the whole thing is light enough for her to carry. Of course, she is lobbying for more sections so she can build a tunnel all through the house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extreme Disappointment!","review":"Very, very disappointed with this product. I was expecting something much sturdier. It can barely stand on it's own and when you add my three year old daughter to the mix, forget it. The fort doesn't stand a chance. I purchased this item as a Christmas gift for my daughter and it is the WORST toy she got for x-mas! If you're looking for something your kids can play with and have fun with do not buy this product. I would suggest getting a regular pop-up tent used for camping, it will be much sturdier and will withstand an active child. I expected more from a company such as Cranium."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as toydle forts","review":"This is just an example of someone taking a timeless, classic idea like fort building and making it flashy and plastic. I have a toydle fort as well and the toydle fort is bigger, stronger, and better. And it really is just regular pipe and wood blocks as connectors. It has sort of a nostalgic feel to it. Cranium fort is smaller, feels cheaper, and doesn't give the same classic feel as a real indoor fort.

As for the Palm handheld itself it is very easy to use. If care to spend about hour playing with it you don't even need the manual its all very straightforward. The HotSync worked great with my Microsoft Outlook. Another feature of the Vx is the rechargeable battery. Although this can be a great convenience, it can also be a hindrance. If you're traveling you have to take a charger. This is the only shortfall that I see from this product. Furthermore I would highly recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"It can happen to you","review":"Well... I had read that some people have problems with the green on/off button, but I guess I never thought it could happen to me. Well, it did and I am not happy about it.

I turned it off, and was never able to turn it back on at all! I paid $400 for this thing and it lasted 5 minutes!

Second, was an unexplained (probably the director felt it was too dumb to try) of a young girl that is part dog/part human (sure). Third, were some Chinese vacationers somewhere in between those storylines. Mostly you just see the vacationers doing typical dumb touristy things which goes on for over half the movie but interspersed with the docudrama of the sign waving civil unrest and dog/girl running around on all fours. Finally the dead mother of dog/girl shows up as a spirit and her body is later found floating in a tank of some liquid. Dog girl dies - end of story.I watched the movie a second time and have decided that the dog/girl story was creative/different enough and coupled with a few decent, although inexpensive, effects makes the movie worthy of another star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After all the raves and hype I expected something grand from this book and was sorely disappointed. Acclaimed as \\"highly readable\\", the book is, I contend, just the opposite. Paragraphs addressing concepts are suddenly interrupted by very specific lists of names of ancient people, and the like, so that rather than being an introduction, the book is a review medium for those who already know about what they are reading. Like most overview courses in college, \\"overview\\" is better for those who know the details and want now to draw them together. A true introduction would not overwhelm the reader with arcane material which slows down the process of thinking about the subject. I agree with the critic who said he could only cover about 5 pages at a time. Really slow going and jarring in its mixture of readable and arcane."},{"rating":"1","title":"musings on god","review":"i wish karen had either stuck to her musings or given a studied and accurate assesment of the religions she discusses. just when i am getting comfortable with the historical thread of the narrative, she throws in the most ridiculous unfounded ungrounded unconceivable thoughts of her own as if they were irrefutable facts...she really is a bit of a loony i think. She uses the expression \\"it seems\\" constantly without completing the sentence with \\"to me\\" and then goes on as if this idea seems so to the entire civilized world...oh well i will go back and see if i can find anymore threads of fact in this hodge podge quilt!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"LITTLE UNDERSTANDING","review":"Karen Armstrong is remarkable only in her absence of concrete understanding. She has absolutely nothing of substance to say of the Jewish God. (If you would understand, read Book five of Torah, Maimonides (M-Torah) and Herman Cohen's excellent study of \\"modern\\" Judaism (as explored, not created, by Hillel, Maimonides and a bit of Spinoza), \\"Religion of Reason: Out of the Origins of Judaism.\\" If she has any understanding at all of Jewish ethics or the Jewish concept of God, she hides it well. Her actual understanding of Christianity is better. But she has a conventional, child-like understanding, as opposed to no understanding at all. One could obtain a better understanding the progression of God by randomly asking people on a New York street, but they would have to be over seven, just to be fair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly boring","review":"This book was so dry and boring I have to admit I did not read the whole thing, it was torturous."},{"rating":"1","title":"A History of God","review":"This book would be more accurately titled \\"A History of Gods\\", as it describes the \\"Gods\\" that were worshiped by ancient civilizations as well as today, including pagan idols. Unfortunately, the author lumps the living God of the bible in with the man made idols. To paraphrase the author, \\"God did not create man, but man created God\\". I bought this book primarily to increase my understanding of my creator, and improve my understanding of the interpretation of God in other major religions. This author undermines the biblical God and the biblical word to such an extent that I could not trust her interpretation of any other religions either. This is definitely the most disappointing book I have ever bought!"},{"rating":"1","title":"That's the lowest grade I can give it!","review":"Years ago a fellow student, after being handed back an essay, said, \\"Dr. Robinson, I don't believe this paper deserves an F\\".

I should have read the other reviews before I made the purchase, and I wouldn't have to write this review. I suppose I am one of those hanging on to my guns and religion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic Textbook","review":"This is a college textbook:1-It is dry, lengthy and extremely boring to read. The author goes into obscure detail without creating any sense of coherency or direction.2-Laypeople who are generally interested in seeking God would be lulled to sleep by the first paragraph, in effect shutting down their interest.3-The author (Armstrong) gives the facade of being an unbiased historical scholar, never directly presenting her own beliefs, while passive aggressively promoting her own view of atheism.Armstrong is generally respectful in her presentation of world religion but is highly critical of Judaism and Christianit. Islam is pictured as a revolutionary faith that bravely overcame Jewish oppression for survival. The reality that Muhammad spread Islam largely through violence and bloodshed is neatly omitted in this work.If you are a layperson like me, seeking to learn more about God, find another book and DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mystical approach","review":"Armstrong purports ot write an extensive treatment of monotheism. She writes from a mystical point of view and is opposed to logic and rationality. The book contains unfortunately many speculations that have long been refuted by archaeologists or scholars and that Armnstrong seem to have picked up in old books. An example of this is Armstrong take-over of the documentary hypothesis about the Thorah (The books of Archer, Gleason provide a good treatment of this subject.)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Writing a history of God without believing in God","review":"Karen Armstrong has prodigious learning and prodigious industry. However she does not have faith or belief in God. Because of this her history of God lacks the kind of inner depth and understanding which can come only out of ' real connection' with God. As to the presentation on the whole I feel myself capable of commenting only on her presentation of Judaism. She knows so much and yet here too my feeling is that she just does not somehow ' get it'.So I would say to any reader for whom their own connection with God is most important this is not a very recommended work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not about \\"God\\", but about Judism, Christianity, and Islam.","review":"Don't be misled by the title of this book, I opened it up thinking I might read some discussion about how the concept of God was created and/or evolved within the Human mind, instead I got a history lesson and facts ad nauseam about Judism, Christianity, and Islam (e.g., Adam said this, then Abraham did that). Karen Armstrong was a former member of the clergy, it shows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but biased","review":"I have just finished this book and Jerusalem and found both to be interesting but biased. I cannot attest to whether Ms. Armstrong's \\"facts\\" are accurate or not but I can state that she has an extreme bias in favor of Islam and against Christianity and Judaism. Her language glosses over the barbaric acts of Muslims while highlighting the barbaric acts of Christians and Jews. Her tone and implication is that Islam has been beneficient and Christianity and Judaism have been hateful, especially Christianity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really, really","review":"I would have given this book a 5 Star rating but for one annoying thing.Karen Armstrong uses the word 'reality' far too loosely.She uses it as a 1960s type might have used \\"Super\\" or \\"O.K.,yah\\".There can be only one Reality.

This account is balanced , remarkably well-researched and above all READABLE . Her conclusion is something I've always instinctively felt to be true deep inside my bones _____ Man created God in his own image (not vice versa ) and as man evolves (for the better or worse) so does the CONCEPTION (no pun intended !) of God he carries in his mind. Going through this book is truly a mind-stretching and soul enriching exercise ."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Must-Read\\"","review":"Karen Armstrong's A History of God is a fascinating historical survey into the roots of monotheism as seen from the Jewish, Christian, and Islamic perspectives. I learned so much I don't know where to start. Did you know, for example, that the Romans thought the Jews to be atheist because they only believed in one god? Did you know that the Muslims wanted to align themselves with the Jews, but were repeatedly rejected? I found the larger issues of God, however, to be the most insightful aspects of her book. These larger issues refer to how God has changed over the centuries, how different cultures have used God to their own purposes, and how God becomes a reflection of a particular culture at a particular time. To me her most gripping prose introduces the Eastern thought of God as beyond all (transcendant), yet right in the hearts of all of us (immanent). This book is a must-read. She will say things that you have been thinking, but have never articulated."},{"rating":"2","title":"An extraordinary work","review":"The research that has gone into this book is extraordinary and impressive. Karen Armstrong paints a fascinating picture demonstrating how all religions not only influenced each other but also developed similar concepts in line with societal change. This book not only promotes understanding of different religions but also creates a context for much greater understanding and tolerance. As such, fundamentalists will not enjoy this book, but all others will find it a worthwhile and first class read. Strongly recommended, this book genuinely contributes to peace and understanding in our time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding historical and philosophical perspective.","review":"I had been looking for information that traced the history of not only the creation and growth of the three Western religions, but also information that would help the reader understand the changing point of view expressed within each of the religions, especially toward God. I was pleased to find in one book everything that I had been seeking. I intend to reread it, using it as a study guide to better understand how our relationship with God and our concept of God's will has led us to where we find ourselves today. The references throughout give the serious student of religion sources of additional information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful Work Without Depht","review":"This isn't so much a history of God as much as Armstrong's view of a history of God. Parts of it is beautifully written and she is honest enough about the intolerance and cruelty that has been an unflattering part of the Abrahamic faiths. However, her sources remain dated and in dealing with Christianity, a lot seems lost in her translation of Christ from a divine figure into a historical person and she seems oblivious that any of her statements may seem controversial. I certainly do not feel I have learned anything about the Protestant view of God (or maybe the God of the Protestants) from reading this work. Then there are the little things, like her reference to Origen castrating himself which she takes at face value even though it comes from the writings of Eusebius who had his own theological ax to grind."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Our Changing View of God Has Changed Our World","review":"I suppose there are those who will take offense at the theme of this book. However, open minded believers and non-believers alike will find fresh insights in this book. It is one of a handful of books that I have listened to or read that has been able to take complicated issues and clarify them in a way that gives genuine insight. By the way, for those of you who missed the point: This is not a biography of God, it's a study of mankind's changing view of God. Don't be threatened by the book, read it and see if it doesn't give you insight into the human condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"History of God","review":"If someone wants to understand the history and connection of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, this is a must read. Simply written for easy understanding. Educational and entertaining. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly Detailed and Well Sourced Overview","review":"I'm amazed (and slightly skeptical) that this book is able to describe in such detail, and with such clarity, such an interesting subject in a way that makes it more enjoyable than your typical \\"historical\\" book. At times I did seem to get bogged down with seemingly trivial details and had to skim past. I am fascinated with books that describe the origins of things, especially religious, and they can often be disappointing. Depending on what your expectations were, you won't be disappointed by this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true work of scholarship","review":"This scholarly book traces the cultural and philosophical evolution of the human conception of God surrounding the 3 major monotheistic faiths. Armstrong explains the common lineage, the similarities and the variance of the conceptual understandings of God that shape people's lives...for better or for worse. This book is best understood if you have a little bit of background in religious and world history and it does require concentration. I particularly enjoyed this audio version because I could listen to certain chapters a second time. However, the audio book is abridged. This book encourages people to understand that no single person, group, or religious tradition has a monopoly of truth. It also calls people to learn about history to avoid the tragic consequences of claiming human agendas as the will of God."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased","review":"Somewhat interesting but very biased. Even on the A@E special tv review of this she made some biased unfactual statements ref Christianity - that Jesus himself had never claimed to be God...not true. A patchwork of biased information ref all the covered religions."},{"rating":"1","title":"superficial and misleading","review":"Ms. Armstrong has done a poor job of relaying the essence of the three great monotheistic religions. She is terribly biased against Christianity and her narrative reveals a superficial understanding of biblical and church history and well as theology and philosophy. This reviewer would recommend reading either Jaraslov Pelikan's \\"The Christian Tradition\\" or J.N.D. Kelly's \\"Early Christian Doctrine's\\" to get a more accurate and insightful appreciation of the development of Christian ideas and doctrines. Since, I am less schooled in Jewish and Muslim traditions, I cannot recommend a good source, however, I'm sure that there are many better books on those traditions than what Ms. Armstrong presents."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Like a History of Atheism","review":"Of the 8 sides to the cassettes, one side would suffice to consolidate the beneficial information about the 4,000 Year Quest of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.The remaining portions of the tapes are filled opinionated speculation, cynical views of Christianity, and a quest for the \\"ideal\\" of Atheism.It is not until the final dissertation on the last side of the last tape that the listener finds out that the author had a bad experience with \\"religion\\" as a child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that bad","review":"The book is rather a narrow examination of the philosophical conception of god. This is something which over time has altered with the change in the way that people think. The book is thus somewhat remote and rarified rather than being a history of religion or of the various churches.The book is not nearly as much fun for atheists as other works such as the Barbarian Conversion by Fletcher which describe the changing nuts and bolts of how the church works as a very human institution. The looking at doctrine tends to limit the mechanics of how a religion works in day to day life or how it affects people.I would also imagine that the book although clearly written by may seen as a bit academic for some."},{"rating":"1","title":"No history here","review":"I was hoping to get some good history on God. All I got was 600 pages of contortionist philosophy. Reading this book was like wading through mud. If you believed in God before reading this, you won't afterwards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"This book succeeds only in proving that the author has a scholar's understanding of the historical underpinnings of monotheism. As a means of educating those of us who lack a formal education in theology, the book is a soulless, meandering failure. Whoever reviewed this book for the NYT and described it as witty and compelling had either not read it, was a close friend of the author, or both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another plea for superstition and reaction","review":"Karen Armstrong only confuses matters with her ignorant remarks about science and religion. She praises the pre-modern world because it understood that there were two ways of arriving at truth, Plato's myths (mythos) and science (logos). But mythos is not a way of arriving at truth; it is an idealist philosophy which undermines knowledge and science by boosting belief and faith (i.e. wishful thinking and self-deception).She writes, \\"our education and society is [sic] fuelled entirely by logos.\\" If only this was true! In the real world, we have a government full of religious zealots, pushing for faith schools that promote segregation and superstition.The ancient illusions of religion and idealism are still with us and are still dangerous. We should oppose Armstrong's reactionary sermons: they have no place in modern society."},{"rating":"1","title":"unenlightened","review":"While Ms Armstrong is very well researched on Christian and Moslem beliefs and customs, her understanding of Judaism was not as strong and it was quite apparent in my read thru. Ms Armstrong presents an out dated view of Judaism with a revengeful and jealous G-d. She would be best served by visiting an Aish Hatorah web site the next time she chooses to write about this subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"good idea wrong auth","review":"please contact me if you really want a page by page breakdown, Karen just is not educated enough to write this book. She comes off as a disgruntled Nun which she actually is. every other page represents a outdated theory, popular when she wrote the book as the mainstream consensus. Also the entire thing is a work of Teleological tunnel vision and is ridden with anachronism. If you wish to learn more about religion consult authors like Pagels and Pelikan, doctors and eminent scholars in their fields. I do not give this book a one lightly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A dismissive view of the God of the Universe","review":"Armstrong's book is typical of its genre. The Author dismisses the God of the Bible, His strength, His majesty and His glory. She focuses on the god made in her image and how that god might have dealt with things. All miracles are, of course. fantasy, and she rejects any conservative scholarship regarding authorship of the Bible and makes the various gods of various religions all equal and presents Yahweh as a \\"tribal god\\", confined to Canaan. It's an awful book for anyone with sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure about this one","review":"This is a very popular book, which is sad because it's highly biased. She provides evidence, but only uses the 10th that corroborates her story.Christian study maybe, Christian fact, VERY loosely."},{"rating":"2","title":"More like the history of why the world's insane","review":"Armstrong successfully plugs the reader into each culture by giving him a detailed account of the three major religions of the world. I, being a neophyte in the way of Islam, felt like fighting in a jihad after her astounding account of Muhammed and the way the Muslim people have progressed. Armstrong's research and insight is incredible and she also slips in a few of her own diatribes (ex: love is used to make up for an abscence in one's life.)One qualm I have is Armstrong, as a nun in the Catholic church, didn't focus near as much on Christianity. She also discounts all the miracles performed in the Bible and tells the reader how they should be interpreted.However, this book is the 101 for the history of God."},{"rating":"2","title":"A stunning history of humankind's descriptions of the Divine","review":"Ms. Armstrong brings her enormous intellect and spiritual insight to the exploration of how the three major monotheistic religions have understood God throughout the centuries. She tracks how similar descriptions of the Divine have arisen within each of the three religions, and discusses how the different understandings of God have affected believers' sense of themselves and their compassion for others. Ms. Armstrong continues to combine superb scholarship with spiritual sensitivity in this stunning book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historian? Or creative manipulator","review":"This book is okay for a broad view of how religions developed; the problem comes when you focus in on the details. If you are detailed oriented, then I hope you really know your religious history because if not, you will not be aware of her inclination to misrepresent, omit crucial facts, and make statements that are not referenced. Also, do not expect an unbiased scholarly text, her disdain for Christianity and her empathy for Islam is very apparent. Ms. Armstrong seems to have an agenda that is cloaked in \\"historical\\" writing. My impression of this book echoes criticism of her previous works from actual historians. Just because she is popular does not make her accurate, and this book is just yet another example that she is not a trained historian, merely an avid reader who can write.I would recommend reading the customer review of zenoofelia who details Armstrong's lack of factual knowledge. Thank you zenoofelia for an excellent review."},{"rating":"1","title":"glad this \\"a\\" history of god","review":"Because if it were \\"the\\" history, I would call this author a liar. This is a biased work against \\"western\\" Christianity and seeks more to draw you to Armstrong's idea that man is god."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Armstrong's work is a very well written, very captivating lie.Basically, Armstrong, a former nun turned pantheist wrote this book from a pantheistic standpoint and twisted her sources to legitimize her argument. If you don't believe me then check the source material. Go to the actual Biblical scripture and check it against what she has in her book. Also, compare her comments on Plato against the introduction to \\"Great Dialogues of Plato\\" written by Matthew S. Santirocco. Anyone who actually has any real knowledge of the Biblical texts would not rate this book more than one star or give it a positive review."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incomparable educational experience.","review":"Karen Armstrong shows a unique talent in bringing an unbiased, dynamic and educational approach to one of humanity's most complex subjects.

But I found it fairly difficult to read and rather dry.I think my problem with it is that I was hoping for an exciting story about the the history of god/religion....but the book just doesn't tell a great story.

A must read for serious questioners of theology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still good... even with its shortcomings","review":"This is a very thorough look at the changing idea of what these 3 monotheistic religions consider God. It ventures very little outside the 3 religions and does seem rather heavily weighted toward mysticism and Islam. Perhaps Ms. Armstrong does focus more on lesser known historical figures or aspects of the religions, but I think it is with a purpose. There are plenty of other books out there about Thomas Aquinas... Going to be a dry read for the casual reader, but in my opinion a \\"must read\\" for someone who really wants to delve into the history of any one of these religions. Follow it up by reading other histories though to temper this books biases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb. A well- researched study.","review":"This book answered many of my questions. The author presents the writings about God in the epochs they take place, in a historical context. Without being blasphemous, Ms. Armstrong weaves a pattern of God being molded by man. I consider myself to be religious and a believer in God. This book helped me to see the way others may view God. I learned a great deal and thoroughly enjoyed reading it.

I was looking into other monotheistic religions at the time and he kept asking a lot of questions. I don't think he particularly liked the book - I'm not sure he even read it.

These books were very useful because they actually completed proofs instead of leaving them as exercises for the reader. Someone new to abstract algebra is also typically new to higher mathematics. This means a book should have clear and full explanations, not skip major points like Rotman does. Rotman commits another sin by failing to provide homework problems which correspond with the material he presents. One nice thing is that the book does provide a wide array of material (much more than most other introductory texts). This virtue soon turns astray however because by providing so much preliminary material on congruences, functions, divisibility, .... you'll be lucky if your teacher gets to groups by halfway through the semester."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd skip this one...","review":"I was very disapointed with Rotman's attempt fix his first edition of this book. The wording is still overly dense, the topics skip around too much, and the examples are less than illuminating.

It's also interesting that he follows it up with a song about a guy who's a big ole stubborn butthead, \\"Can't Tell Me Nothin'.\\" Yeah, I guess if I was a country superstar who had as much trouble holding a melody and writing or picking a good song as Tritt does, I'd probably go after the Dixie Chicks, too -- less competition on the charts, if you're lucky.

Pleasure at the novelty of following Ware's unique visual grammar was overshadowed by the general leadenness of the story, characters, worldview. The theme of \\"Child is the Father of the Man\\" and insights about alienation across generational lines were ultimately too banal to sustain such a long work. I really, really wanted to like this.

Chris Ware's techinque is to give us Jimmy Corrigan. If Jimmy is hapless or bereft, it is because each day disappoints him in his attempts at finding something he lost (or never had). We are more than painfully aware of his efforts to dog embarrassment & failure. Because his hopes are so large, his yearnings continue beyond the pages of Chris Ware's wonderful book and engulf us. And when we, like Jimmy, shine our needy lights out into the night, it is the darkness of the whole aching universe, that consumes us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chris Ware, Smartest Graphic Novelist on Earth","review":"Ware's masterpiece. (So far, at least.) The story follows three generations in the hapless Corrigan family of Chicago. Hilarious, heartbreaking, beatifully-drawn, it's serious art and compelling fiction at the same time. With Art Spiegelman's MAUS, Chris Ware's book seems to me the one that lets graphic novelist's out of the garage and into the art house. He reinvents the genre or cartoon-writing and opens our eyes to the possibilities of the drawn papge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chris Ware: The Smartest Cartoonist on Earth","review":"380 pages of pure genius.I recommend this to all graphic designers,comics fans,or anyone considering Radial Keratotomy. If you can\`t find inspiration from Jimmy\`s tales you had better check your pulse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hugely Disappointing!","review":"Why are there so many positive reviews? The story is very bland and extremely depressing. Nothing profound to be found here.The illustrations are quite good, but this cannot hold the viewers attention through the meaningless events contained.Not recommended, unless you want to feel depressed after reading this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad, depressing, emotional outlet for...someone","review":"The book is beautifully designed and drawn. And, techniques of film are used successfully to tell the story through 'thought bubble' equivalents, and flashbacks. But, in the end, the story is just sad, does not redeem itself, and doesn't leave you with any significant insights. For this, I see this work as simply the venting or emotional outlet for the author, either actual or imagined. Not too different from Woody Allen's simply using his art as an outlet for his neuroses (with a very few exceptions).My kids were picking up this book, attracted to the colorful images, so I threw it in the garbage. I couldn't think of anyone who I would want to share this with, and certainly didn't want my kids looking at it. I truly hope this is not the experiences of the author, relived through this sad and abused character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious nonsense","review":"Having read the first chapter in the New Yorker and some early reviews, I thought this would be a seminal work in the graphic novel genre. I was wrong. After a promising start, the novel completely loses itself (and the reader) in self-indulgent surreal nonsense -- it's arty but not artful.With almost no plot or character development to sustain itself, Jimmy Corrigan is ultimately a beautifully drawn yet shallow work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jimmy Corrigan: Suckiest Comic on Earth","review":"I usually LOVE graphic novels, and I was really excited after I heard all the great reviews for this book.Then I read it, and it was awful. Really Awful. And it wasn't one of those things where I'm not smart enough to understand it. I get it, I understand what he is trying to say, and I've seen a lot of great graphic story telling. It was interesting, to see the artwork, but the story was awful and the characters were completely unlikable.This book is not worth the time it takes to read it, and is ultimately diappointing. There are so many great books out there, don't waste your time with this, read something else, like \\"Lost at Sea\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not live up to the hype","review":"Let me state for the record that I adore Chris Ware and his meticulous, precisely rendered artwork. And then there's Jimmy Corrigan. I truly wanted to like this book - everyone else seems to - but I just couldn't.The artwork is typical Chris Ware, of course. That is always pleasing. The storyline is well thought-out: the awkwardness of the decidedly less than stellar adulthood of the title character. There are awkward moments aplenty, all presented to the reader with subtlety and skill.If you like the graphic novel of sadness and depression, this is for you. The main character faces constant disappointment and rejection at every page, and much is made of the disappointments of growing up and viewing it naively through the eyes of a child. Is there any redemption in the end of the book? Sorry, no. Jimmy Corrigan remains the same depressed person.This is one hour of reading that I'll never get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"if you are a normal human being do not read this book","review":"Jimmy Corrigan has got to be the worst graphic novel that i've ever read, the story is dull and boring, the art looks like clip art from a computer, and the charcters in the story are so hard to relate to that you wouldn't mind if someone took a dirt nap at the end, which I was hoping for the whole story. So do yourself a favor and buy a graphic novel by the greats like Neil Gaimen,Alan Moore, Brian Micheal Bendis, and Art Spiegelmen. Those are the guys who are defining graphic novel not Chris Ware in this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poor, poor little Jimmy","review":"So sad. So poignant. So honest. Identifiable. It's got elements from all the human and humane strips we've read: Peanuts, Calvin and Hobbes, Ziggy. Ware has created a rare treat."},{"rating":"1","title":"about the paperback edition","review":"this is an amazing book. buy it right now. however, i would not recommend the paperback edition. it is binded with very inferior glue; two days after i recieved it, the cover had fallen off, and as i read it (quite quickly i might add, as i could not put it down) the pages were literally falling out one by one. i'm not sure if anyone else has had this problem with the paperback, but i can assure you that you're going to want to have this book for a while, so just buy the hardcover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad but True","review":"One of the \\"Must see\\" graphic novel. Provided by the syntetic and accurate drawing line of Chris Ware. Retrospective journey with Jimmy Corrigan, looking at his lost chances and not utilised bargains of his looser life. Meet with incarnation of AntyHero everyone has inside and face with: \\"You Fail everything\\" - Sad but true.Warning! - avoid contact during depressive states of mind!"},{"rating":"2","title":"moving","review":"This is the most amazing work I have experienced in a while. Chris Ware brillantly pinpointed the certain flavor of those who are extremely isolated. I have never encountered a work that deals so honestly and accurately with this particular area of alienation. I encourage those who are not usually fans of comics, like I, to read this work. The images are sadly beautiful and explain much more than words often do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This graphic novel is one that I find myself returning to time and again. It's heartbreaking each and every time, so if you're looking for a light \\"comics\\" experience, look somewhere else. The story of a middle-aged man fumbling through life, apparently doomed to abandonment and confusion, is well-written and beautifully drawn. I recommend it to... everyone, if you can handle it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and haunting","review":"I bought this book because I was absolutely charmed by the back cover (I found it in a bookstore), and I've been looking to start reading more graphic novels (because they're really cool!) Like other reviewers, I had some trouble reading the book because the order of the panels change, and the characters slip in and out of daydream without warning to the reader. However, I'm giving it five stars because all of the things that detracted from my enjoyment of the book were more my issues rather than anything that should be different with the book. The plot itself is pretty sad (plot already covered by other reviewers, so I won't do it here), but it creates this interesting tension between the creative, playful way in which the story is told, and the rather somber subject matter. I'd recommend it to anyone willing to follow a story on it's own terms, without any preconceived notions of how it should go!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fiction Writing Demystified: Techniques That Will Make You a More Successful Writer by Thomas B.

I am picking up so much good stuff that I'll be able to implement in my writing.I'm very happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing book","review":"This book was very confusing and very indepth. My professor even confessed that she had to read chapters multiple times to understand this book. This is definately above my reading level and difficult to understand. This is a tough read. I wish I never had to buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"great net, but...","review":"This is a great net. It worked in sand no problem. The bottom of the net doesn't get supper tight, but it is by no means loose. If you do read the instructions, they say to separate the poles when not in use. Nothing against amazon, but I ended up needing another net the day of and had to go to a local store. I found another Park and Sun net, the Spectrum 1000. It was cheaper than this one, and the only differences I could find between them was the 1000 had cheaper steaks, and also came with a ball and pump. So as far as I can tell, this net is a 1000 rebranded with a higher price. I can't find the 1000 on amazon, so it must have been discontinued. With this in mind, I would say try to find the 1000, or shell out for the Spectrum Classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Net!","review":"We love this net!

They are like two dozen angels singing with heavenly glory. A Choral Fantasia, The Cloud Messenger and The Hymn of Jesus are excellent; superb playing from the London Symphony, breathtaking and articulate singing from the Chorus. Ode to Death & A Dirge for Two Veterans are absolutely haunting. The Part-songs are worth the listen, and the Ave Maria and the Motets sound fresh and fabulous.If you are a fan of Holst's Planets, then you'll be an immediate fan of his choral works once you start listening to The Cloud Messenger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forever Amber","review":"I have seen this movie only once....probably 25 years ago. This was one of the best movies I had ever seen (right up there with Gone With The Wind). It was on TBS and that was all I ever heard or saw of that movie. I do remember that Linda Darnell was absolutely great and that the story line was one that captured you immediately. There was a lot of intrigue. The costumes were wonderful, the acting superb. I look forward to seeing this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAKE SURE YOU READ THE BOOK!","review":"I recently finished the 1944 book, giving it a 5-star rating. I was intrigued when I discovered the movie. It is roughly edited and the plot is very choppy. I was glad that I had read the book prior to its viewing. There are too many characters with little to no background explanation or development(and they all look alike). The storyline is abbreviated (leaving out major segments of the book and its plot development), but you do get some idea of the culture of King Charles II's court and times, and Amber's \\"Me 1st attitude\\" and total self-absorption. Not worth the buy, but rental an option for a rainy day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nostalgia","review":"I had to \\"sneak\\" and read Forever Amber when I was in Junior High.

Good acting, good story line & great actors. scenes are beautiful"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"but films from books usually are. Forever Amber is one of my favorites but I'd never seen the film until yesterday. Having experienced book to film disappointment before (the first time at age 13 when I saw National Velvet. Even at that age I could recognize a good story sacrificed for cheesyness and I can never buy Micky Rooney in a dramatic part. And of course Velvet had to be beautiful. They even changed the color of the horse...)I wasn't surprised that I didn't like this film. Books to films can be done well (Gone With the Wind) but it's not the case with Forver Amber. Of course a large part of the problem is what had to be left out because of the morals code but still very poorly done. I enjoyed George Sanders as Charles II but the rest of the film reduced this fabulous story to pure drivel."},{"rating":"2","title":"This stuff is so great.","review":"I love this lotion. Its thicker so you know its really going to soak into your skin and nourish it, and it doesn't clog pores. It works so good on every part of your body especially elbows and knees when you rub a thicker amount on them and just let a thin layer sit for a little instead of completely rubbing it in. It also has a very light kind of fruity smell. After I apply this stuff, hours later I can feel my skin, and it feels so soft! I just love this stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Body lotion","review":"I have been using Curel for many years now, and I find that this particular version is the best for my needs. It is advertised as fragrance-free which I like, as I hate most of the synthetic scents that many personal products have, although it does have a very slight citrus scent which is actually rather pleasant. It works well as a body moisturizer and also as an after-shave lotion, which is really what you need instead of one of those alcohol-based after-shave lotions which only serve to dry out skin which has just been punished with a razor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Senior Moments","review":"This program is an \\"OK\\" for seniors. Actually, if might be better than OK, but the presentation seemed remote and stiff. If you really want a GREAT program for seniors ( especially targeted for disabilities or beginners) try Gentle Fitness by Catherine MacRae. What it does better than most is to incorporate a very wide diversity of many types of exercises. The actual video shots are some of the best and MacRae and the group seem to make themselves at home with you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too outdated and confined!","review":"This book is basically a reminiscence of the author's stock investment experience between 1966-1969 written in 1970. Though it had been revised in 1991 with addition of, primarily, charts covering to 1990, it helped very little coz the author had only slightly revised his very descriptive, accounting report like and boring words, based mostly on history in the aforesaid 60's.

In addition to him I have loved the rat pack since as far back as I can remember. And for Robbie to combine two things that I love is just BRILLIANT!!! This concert grabs you from the beginning and never lets go. Robbie Williams is one of the most tallented singers we have currently and he proves this here. He takes music that is legendary and makes it his own, a feat that is difficult in of its self. I give this concert five stars it deserves nothing less.

No one that is not a dedicated fan of any program is going to buy a complete series knowing it has been cut from what originally aired.

They saw the set and bought without first reading the reviews of others that had made the same mistake. I also wonder how they can call it a complete series when it has been cut.

It doesn't matter how nice the outside packaging is- it would be helpful if the DVD's WORKED!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I HAVE BEEN DUPED","review":"I was so thrilled to find/get this but I had no idea about the quality and the cuts. I noticed the poor quality right away. Also, the \\"fancy\\" cardboard packing arrived damaged. So disappointed!! Can I return this defective product?"},{"rating":"1","title":"How is this \\"Complete\\"?","review":"These are the edited for commercial reruns. They are chopped up. I have no idea how the title can say with any conscience - \\"complete\\" unless it means \\"complete..ly mangled\\" or \\"complete waste of money\\". No thanks I will wait for the UNEDITED versions to come out if they ever do. These are NOT remastered, and these are NOT uncut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning - Episodes are cut/edited","review":"As others have stated, this set is heavily cut and therefore missing MANY scenes. The only ones I know of (for a fact) that are NOT cut/edited are the ones on Amazon.de called \\"Kleine Huis Op De Prairie\\". They have English audio so there's no need to worry about making a purchase. There are also some with the title \\"Unsere kleine Farm\\", but I have not personally seen them & cannot comment on if they are cut/edited or not (or if they have English audio or not). I have the \\"Kleine Huis Op De Prairie\\" versions so again, I can 100% confirm that they are NOT edited and DO have English audio.No idea why other countries can get 100% uncut episodes, while the US get's this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO EXPENSIVE FOR THE QUALITY","review":"I bought this speakers hoping it will serve its purpose.WRONG.They always die and the volume does not stay.Does not charge the ipod (although you can purchase an optional charging system).You'r better of buying other portable speakers with lesser price."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best bone players today...","review":"In addition to his studio recordings, I have seen Wycliffe play live several times. His respect for jazz tradition and obvious love for entertaining the audience always shines through."},{"rating":"1","title":"mindless trash.","review":"Elizabeth Peyton is proof you don't need talent to make it as an artist. she herself cannot explain what her art is about without mumbling like an idiot and storming off. her work pushes no boundaries and exist only for the suckers who buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not necessary with 3.5","review":"If your playing with the 3.5 player's handbook, monster manual, and dungeon master's guide; this book is unnecessary. Because many ELs and LAs have been adjusted, and the entire system for LAs has been simplified with 3.5, this book has been rendered somewhat obsolete. It's best remaining features are some of it's example content (spells/feats/example progressions), but this book isn't going to be as helpful at a 3.5 table running a game using level adjustments."},{"rating":"2","title":"surprisingly good","review":"I must admit that the movie had a slightly dragging quality about it. If you have the attention span of a typical MTV watcher, it may be difficult for you to engage with this film. However, the premise was interesting and the acting was way above average. I enjoyed it immensely, as I do many of Robert Townsends films. I know other reviews mention the film quality...and yes in some spots it's filmed a bit dark...but the film I watched wasn't grainy and everyone fit on my tv screen just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ineffective rosin","review":"This is rosin. Ugh. What can I say? I've been using it for a couple months now and this rosin just sucks. It doesn't grip the violin strings well at all and it produces so much dust. Good for beginners I guess but if you get this rosin youre going to need a cleaner to get all the dust off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Woohoo!","review":"This book was just great. Funny as heck, but there was some good action tied in. This book would have gotten five stars from me, but I thought that Dartimien was written too much like Raistlin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice reissue of obscure vocal jazz","review":"This import CD (in addition to its companion volume) is a fitting replacement for the 2-LP package that RCA issued 24 years ago - nearly impossible to find now.Generally, if you like the Mills Brothers' early material (\\"Swing Is The Thing\\", and the sides they cut with Louis Armstrong for instance), you'll find this stuff very entertaining. Ahead of their time, their fast-banter scat singing presaged Bop stylists (ex. Lambert, Hendricks and Ross) by almost a decade. The ballads are typical of the period, and while not the highlight of the program they do serve to round it out.Small caveat: the sides presented here are from private collections, and not from RCA's vaults. Surface noise has been reduced nicely, but there's some needle wear on the louder passages."},{"rating":"2","title":"highly recommended","review":"This is really exciting music from around the early 1040's. Four beautiful voices harmonizing through jazz ballads and fast tempo numbers- fascinating rhythms, pretty guitar solos, neat tempo changes. The songs are all really well written and simple. From what I've heard of the Mills Brothers I see the resembalance only in that they both are jazz vocal groups. The Cats and the Fiddle are much less refined which gives the music more a feeling of excitement and raw emotion (depending on the subject of the song).I was recommended this music a few years ago because the person thought that since I liked the Beach Boys I would like this. Well, I don't exactly see how they pieced that together- although there is a lot of heart in this music. I don't mind carrying on that idea though... If you like the Beach Boys... You definetly like this!highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasing Acting","review":"Shreyas acted well as the role of the boy who cannot speak/listen. He plays the role of Iqbal,18 year old, son of a farmer in a small village somewhere in India. This movie is not a \\"Black\\" yet it seems to have all the makings of a winner. We may never see a deaf and mute man play for our cricket yet this film fits the bill.Nasserudin Shah predicates the role of a drunk; who goes on to coach Iqbal in the film. The role played by Iqbal's sister is substantial to the plot. The film is simple and even though there was no mention of this film anywhere in the award shows and no awards were handed out to Shreyas, the fact remains, it's worth a watch or two.I've said enough. Enjoy what works for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"unedited version=Good Action","review":"In the unedited version...it's better. More action and I mean in all genres. Of course in the edited version, there is going to be things that are left out but in the oringinal unedited version it explains it all with blood, violence and sex? yes the oringinal has more sex scenes, panty shots,nipples and other things which could be considered rated 'H' but it's still very good with the action as it delivers. If you are looking for bloody action with a little rated 'H' on the side then buy the Oringinal unedited version of Mezzo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some info for reviewers and a review","review":"I am wondering if people are getting Mezzo forte mixed up with Intermezzo. Having seen Intermezzo a few years ago now and Mezzo Forte now, from what I remember Intermezzo was the same group of people however it was full of unedited sex. And the girl seems to be a few years older in Intermezzo than she is in Mezzo forte.Personally Mezzo Forte for me was just as good as Intermezzo was. Whether or not you see the busty babe having sex she still has that same sexy attitude and kicks ass in a big way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"creator of Kite soars to new height","review":"Slick and stylish, mezzo forte is deserving of awards. top-notch animation and artwork with plenty of dizzying action sequences, ultra violence, and cleverly placed panty shots. Clearly has the potential of becoming an over-the-top series.some of the best stuff out there! more episodes, please!note: this is the edited version, if you are interested in the unedited edition, try punching in \\"mezzo forte: director's cut\\".i own both copies, and surprisingly, i liked this one better. the director's version seems almost distracted; interrupted even, by gratuitous, hardcore sex scenes which, in my opinion, altered the flow of the feature.choose one or both, and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good anime. I enjoyed it...","review":"In my opinion, it's not as good as \\"Kite\\" but it is very entertaining and it is definitely not for kids. The story, involving a bunch of happy-go-lucky mercenaries and violent gangsters starts off with a bang and keeps going until the last scene. Bullets, bombs, and blood fill the screen in between the car chases and fistfights. Perfect entertainment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent pick","review":"This is an excellent anime. I really enjoyed mezzoforte. the art work was outstanding. The story could have used a little work though, there were alot of \\"things\\" left unsaid that could have seen a little more depth. I think over all it was very entertaining though. And I don't mind watching it more than a couple times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Speculative violence and expilicit rape scenes.","review":"I have only seen the uncut version of this film, and I must say it's really bad. The plot is virtually non-existant. This is anime exploitation filmmaking at its worst, and the reason a lot of people shun anime. I do however rate it 2 stars because it has some excellent animation (shadows correspond to characters' mouth movements etc.). This film is highly offensive and has little artistic value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super super super koool","review":"AMaZING.... IF YOU DONT LIKE IT, your missin big time dudes/dudets..... :) FREEEKIN amazing BUY it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Story worth Retelling","review":"The book was in excellent condition. It details the life of a man who was determined to do more than make a lot of great movies and a lot of money. He was determined to leave a legacy of love. While the rest of Hollywood became crasser and more vulgar with each new picture, Roy Rogers insisted on making films that extolled virtue instead of vice. This cost him dearly but he never recanted. This story of a real American hero should be preserved and retold. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book & skip the movie!","review":"this movie is terrible...i give it one star because the scenery is beautiful. i loved this book, i loved quoyle and missed him in the end. kevin spacey is not quoyle--mr. spacey doesn't even seem to know quoyle--which is such a shame. how can we come to love quoyle if we can't get to know him.spend some time reading the book--the two hours you would've spent watching the movie would be better spent with the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sentimental Canadians","review":"This is a story about Kevin Spacey who is an idiot who has a kid with an even bigger idiot played by Cate Blanchett. Spacey gets stuck with a kid from the relationship and somehow Judy Dench shows up. They go to Canada or some damn place where it's cold in May to raise the kid and discover the hidden past of the family. Every person in the film seems to have some mysterious secret which you can assume is better explained in the book and this is supposed to lead to intrigue. ... If you like sentimental drivel set in Canada you will love this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A search for healing","review":"Tragedy mars the background of nearly every character in Shipping News, a very good but not perfect video made from Annie Proulx's book of the same name. The widowed Quoyle (Kevin Spacey) and his daughter head off with Aunt Agnes (the inimitable Dame Judi Dench) to the old abandoned family homestead on a heartlessly barren piece of rock on Newfoundland's coast, hoping to begin their lives anew."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the book wanted to see the movie","review":"If I read and enjoy a book that has been adapted as a screen play I like to watch it to see how well they done in the transition. i felt they did a fairly good job. The main character in the book I got the impression was sometime of a homely person. kevin Spacey didn't fit the part in that way but did a good job of fulfilling the quirkiness of the individual. enjoyed it would recommend it to anyone the read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great cast, odd story.","review":"I didn't care too much for this film. Yes I read the reviews, and gave it my usual chance by watching it until the end. I just didn't see enough good in the movie to warrant the depressing parts. Usually if we have to see things that are difficult to watch, there will be a positive payoff somewhere. Not really in this one. While there is much star talent aboard, it did seem a bit disjointed as some have suggested. Things did pick up for Spacey's character toward the end, but I'm not sure why some things were added. If his life wasn't already bad enough, the author had to add rape and incest. I'm not sure how this really was supposed to fit in, except to add more woe to another character. I'm not confused as to how it might fit in, just why. It became hard not to think his little girl was a bit weird, and disturbing. I wanted to like this film, but walked away figuratively scratching my head. I gave it two stars for the credible cast and their efforts in spite of an odd story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must see movie","review":"The Shipping News is one of the must see movies of 2002. It has slipped rather quietly into the theatres and DVD stores but don't be put off by this lack of fanfare. A solid cast do credit to this Pulitzer Prize winning novel. Actors such as Spacey and Dench are now so dependable that I will watch any movie with which either are associated with confidence. Moore also finally gets a role that allows her to shine. The scenery is spectacular and the subject matter thought-provoking. The snappy dialogue and chemistry bewteen the chief protagonists contribute to a great viewing package. Two thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Flick.................","review":"Good Story, Good acting, overall a Good Movie with heart, light drama and light comedy.Touches a lot of Life altering experiences that I am sure many can relate to in one way or another.Highly recommend for thought provoking and emotional story telling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"Captures the sense of Newfoundland. Those who went to see this in the theater with me were awed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shipping News","review":"This is a movie I never get tired of watching. The characters are very well acted. I think it is one of the best little movies I have seen.The Shipping News"},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie, weak beginning","review":"I liked the plot of this movie, Kevin Spacey was great in this role and did a great crying scene (one of two movies that I have seen so far). Which makes the character more believable. The scenery is great for anyone who has been to Newfoundland. The only thing I found confusing and didn't like was Quoyle being seduced and made into a idiot. Luckily he found a nice woman named Wavey and got a great job as a reporter."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good one","review":"A movie you didn't hear a lot about, but very much worth seeing. Of course the cast is great, but the character development, picturesque location, and careful directing is what made the picture so likeable. Out of 10 it's about a 7."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whats this got to do with anything?","review":"OK, The film was acted well. Everything else had nothing to do with anything. Cold as Ice people, treat people cold as ice. Nuf said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad filmaking and a bad script!","review":"This film has a great cast of course, and Judi Dench does the most, as does Cate Blanchet. The rest are at sea in this melodramatic mess that has about as much credibility as Cider House Rules, diredcted by the same director. There are no characters here and the situations they are in or have been in are so false to the ear and eye, so Hallmark Card and it is filled with laughable revelations of the past that include incest and abortion, told in loud voices, with hilarious flashbacks, reminiscent of \\"serious\\" television.Nothing has strength beacuse the director has no intelligence, nor does this dreary screenplay from a terrible novel, full of shock and schlock.Julianne Moore is lovely and so talented; how did she get ionto this fray? Kevin Spacey is always good, but here he is really bad.Avoid it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD","review":"This is the 3rd time I have seen \\"The Shipping News\\". I wanted to buy it because then I can watch it next year again. It's a great story and a great movie with a stellar cast. Kevin Spacey, Ms Moore, Dench and Blanchette are all superb. Highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shipping News","review":"This story features a man with a really \\"big heart\\" who falls in love with the totally wrong woman (a tramp) who takes advantage of his good nature and treats him terribly. Fortunately, he gets a second chance for a happy life that he deserved. Excellent performances and story line. First saw it on Netflix and decided to make it part of my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"You guessed it -- not as good as the book","review":"As a Kevin Spacey and Julianne Moore fan, I intended to see this movie when it first came out, but it fell through the cracks. Then I read the book by E. Annie Proulx and loved it so much that I couldn't wait to see it unfold on screen.Sadly, I was disappointed. The movie felt like a series of scenes from the book without the emotional fabric to connect them in a meaningful way. Major characters were left out (how about Quoyle's younger daughter, for one?) for no good reason, and the beginning was blown through in such a hurry that you could hardly get a picture of what Quoyle's life was like.In many places, plot points were underexplained to the point that I wouldn't have understood them if I hadn't already read the book and had the background knowledge to apply to them.I wanted to like this movie -- I TRIED to like it -- but in the end, I didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"unauthorized DVD","review":"this is an unauthorized, inferior quality DVD and not from the original Mr Wizard Studios - created by Don Herbert.Go to [...] to find all authorized DVD's from Don Herbert himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bulbs come completely unprotected in packaging","review":"The bulbs sound like a great idea. Problem is the packaging. I've ordered and returned once, and will likely return the second order as well. The packaging used does not hold the bulbs in place, so they crash against each other. Now they might work just fine, but with halogen bulbs that you're supposed to be very careful with while inserting, and at the price, why take a chance. Seems like someone could figure out how to package them in such a way they are protected during shipping!

The antics of Doris's little brother were hilarious! The scene where she fixes the car on their way home from a dance, and her fiance takes credit for it was priceless. I liked the story because it accurately portrayed the everyday trials and tribulations of each of the characters, i.e., the mother, father, daughter, son, beau, boyfriend...even the housekeeper. In spite of all the miscommunications, misunderstandings, anger, etc., forgivness reigns, and love wins out.

Adapted from the Penrod series by Booth Tarkington, the film stars Doris Day and Gordon McCrae with a fine supporting cast.In actuality the film is stolen by Billy Gray as Doris' younger brother Wesley. Gray (who later as a teenager played Bud on the TV hit FATHER KNOWS BEST) is simply perfect in his performance. It has never received the attention it deserves and compares with the best of more famous child actor efforts. His scenes with Maria Palmer (Wesley's teacher) are classics.The songs are fine and the plot ambles along amiably with something for everyone. Family fare at its' best.

I think it's a good introductory text and with regards to grammar, remarkably complete. I've learned things from this book that books dedicated to Turkish grammar had forgotten to mention. There are 4 tapes and they start off slower than another language pack I have for Turkish. I wish there were more conversation dialogues. This is the thing that is missing. This pack along with the Colloquial Turkish (ArIn and Sinan BayraktoloGu) pack seem to cover everything I think I'll need. I'm quite happy with this book.p.s.

I am not sure what was hard to follow for some, but I guess it just isn't for people that need to watch fast plots, with explosions and Special Effects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterwork of a film","review":"I've seen few of Anderson's films, but if one is searching for his masterpiece, one need look no farther than The Royal Tenenbaums, a brilliantly dark and sophisticated comedy. The actors bring Anderson's vision to life in an extraordinary manner. There are actors in this film, like Ben Stiller, who I normally cannot stand to watch, but in this film they sparkle. You'll immediately fall in love with the wonderful quirks of each and every character, and at the plot's end, will feel fulfilled.This is truely a film worth seeing as many times as is necessary to memorize the endless wit."},{"rating":"1","title":"An over-abundance of style...","review":"...and a paucity of substance. And any substance that's there is either unapologetically cribbed from the works of J.D. Salinger and Irving's \\"Hotel New Hampshire\\" (and numerous others), or is completely reliant on the inclusion of warm and fuzzy chamber pop from the 1960's to make you \\"feel\\" something that isn't there. Ho-hum. If not for the presence of Gene Hackman (a man who should have gone with his gut and avoided this one), there'd be nothing at all to recommend. Twee, retro outfits and Rolling Stones songs alone don't cut it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasure to watch on a rainy day","review":"If you didn't think that this movie is funny, then 1)you're not smart enough to understand the humor, 2) your life is perfect and you cannot relate to the characters, 3) you're a republican, or 3) you just don't understand dark comedies or subtle humor.

A group of friends and I watched this in eager anticipation, due to the incredible reviews this movie received, only to be disappointed in the extreme. The actors (with the exception of Gwyneth Paltrow, who is very dull and flat in this) are phenomenal, but it's a testament to how vacuous the script and direction are that even their performances can't make this film interesting. Wes Anderson is perhaps the most overrated director working today. Only recommended for bored college students trying to prove their hipness quotient is higher than their IQ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"My husband and I recently rented this DVD. We had both seen the previews and were expecting a really funny movie. There were some funny moments but overall I felt that the previews were very misleading. Any movie that has a character attempting to commit suicide because he is in love with his (adopted) sister, along with several other no-so-funny moments (a drugged out character running over a dog...but its ok because another dog is found immediately to take the place of this family pet), should have something of its dark nature mentioned in the trailors. I was just not expecting what I got."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh TanenBOMB!","review":"I spent nearly an entire week's earnings to see this disappointment! Being a huge fan of RUSHMORE, I could barely wait for Wes Anderson's next masterpiece. Our local theater was closed, so I decided to drive to Delaware with two of my compatriots. As you can imagine, they were quite disappointed as well.Gene Hackman's performance as primate Gary D'ellabate was one of the few redeeming elements of this atrocity. His lines were relevant and his humorous quips were timely and pungent. Ben Stiller, on the other hand, should receive the Darwin award for his portrayal of Fred Norris, the martian. Gwyneth Paltrow was also inappropriate for the part of Ophelia Quivers.I didn't really understand the plot... I hope Anderson's next movie befits his former legacy, if you know what I mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atrocious.","review":"Absolutely terrible. The most inexplicable comedy phenomena this side of Dane Cook.Nothing happens in this movie (and I mean nothing) except a bunch of sullen characters exhanging \\"comic\\" glances and looking withdrawn and cynical. I don't think a Soviet run production company could suck the life and charisma out of these talented actors better. So on that point it's a success. All the sullen, understated lines and glances are supposed to be funny-they're not, they're boring. Somebody needs to tell Wes Anderson that too.

Fortunately for my pocketbook, I rented first. I was completely shocked at how boring and utterly mindless this movie was. I did not even get a smile from it, much less a laugh, and I have a pretty broad sense of humor. My favorite comedy of recent years is As Good As It Gets, but I also like popcorn flicks such as Ms Congeniality, Meet the Parents, & Legally Blond. Even comedies such as Mr. Deeds, MIB II, and Goldmember, which were bombed by critics, had laughs in them.

The film looks much, much better than its story. One begins to have doubts when this family of \\"geniuses\\" reveal little intellectual heft in conversation and interaction. The Paltrow character is a virtual cipher whose only talent seems to be finding stashes for her cigarettes, despite her promotion as a \\"prodigy\\". The purported love triangle has no apparent basis, in other words, the audience is told to accept the premise without evidence. The problem is that this film was written by people who are not professional, creative writers. Characters must be shown to be \\"interesting\\", \\"conflicted\\", \\"in-love\\", \\"suicidal\\", etc. by their words and actions, not simply because we are told they are.

We watched the first hour of this movie and neither of us laughed, neither of us wanted to watch this mess for another minute. What a sad waste of of some very great talent! There is nothing remotely appealing in the characters; in fact, neither my wife nor I cared one iota for any of them. And we could easly do without elongated narration of very boring material.

My favorites are the Christopher Guest movies (eg, Waiting for Guffman), Dr. Strangelove. I worship Larry Sanders and The Office on TV. There's some lowbrow stuff I enjoy too but I'm trying to establish credibility.But The Royal Tenenbaums bored me like no other movie. No emotions, laughs, or even sly chuckles. Almost a chuckle when he threw his racket. So why am I so out of touch? Maybe I am too dull. Do I need to watch it twice? Caveat: I have a healthy relationship with my family.

The laughs are generally cheap and lowest common demonator -- but at least there isn't a lot of potty humor. Strangely, everyone did a fairly good acting job.

The viewer really has to suspend belief throughout the film (which is OK), because every character is outrageously disfunctional and attempts at humor just made me realize how pathetic and unsympathetic Anderson's characters were. The plot was also pretty hard to follow at times, but maybe that was because I was fighting off sleep.In short, the film was too dark and sluggish to be enjoyable. I left Rushmore feeling refreshed. I left TRT half-asleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you dont like this movie....","review":"I can get a feel for people by the movies they like, (dont like).

Owen Wilson just plain stinks--he ruins just about every movie he is in--and also, he cowrote this one--another reason to be skeptical. Hackman is great. Murray and Glover are way too talented to be doing bit parts in this trashy flick. It's mildly entertaining at times which is why I don't give it one star, but one has a hard time getting over the waste of great talent, and the drabness of the characters. If you're pissed off after seeing this movie, there's good news: in \\"The Cable Guy\\", Owen Wilson gets his ass whooped and humiliated by Jim Carrey-- it'll make you feel better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Drama, NOT A COMEDY.","review":"If I had viewed this film from the angle of a DRAMA, I probably would have thought a little better of it.

The Tenenbaum children are all cartoonish yet shallow. The actors in those roles, especially Ben Stiller, perform them as well as possible given the transparent story holding the film together.Another reviewer hit it on the head, saying in effect you keep waiting for the movie to become either funny or poignant, and it never quite achieves either one. The anecdotal method in which the movie unfolds provides about one funny line every 10 minutes or so. It's a shame the brilliant cast was wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Walked out of the theater thinking \\"who cares\\"?","review":"This movie had its moments for sure, good acting, etc but the critical flaw in my mind was that the characters were such a bunch of idiots that I frankly didn't care much what happened to them and by the time this movie was done, I was bored and ready to leave.

But the second time I had a honest effort to sit threw it and I did. Like I seid already it is so and so nothing to brag about I dont see why credics rave about it?!?!?. Alough a comedic part is Ben Stiller playing a farther who is protective over his children since his wife died. I do admit that there really is NO backround music and Iam a person who beleves that backround music is what makes the scene one to remeber.

His family, of course, features the most \\"comedic\\" and \\"quirky\\" of people: The neglected and emotionless playwrite daughter, the washed-up tennis player, the paranoid maniac who never got over the loss of his wife, and the dorky but loveable ex-wife. *sigh* Gee, how deep and pseudo-clever.Well, if you want to see \\"art\\" at it's worst or how to fool everybody into thinking your are clever, take notes on this movie.

Wes Anderson has an incredible way of taking characters and creating characatures. His direction, cinematography, and soundtrack may owe much to \\"The Graduate\\", but it is appropriate and done with care. Gene Hackman deserves an Award for his role as Royal the curmudgeon.

The trailer that makes reference to Ben Stiller's character making a fortune as a youngster by breeding \\"Dalmatian mice\\" was not an indicator of the level of laughs. For me, that scene was the film's comedic highlight.To sum up an already BRIEF review, I'll defer to the reaction of a 7/8-full-theatre.

I like the work of Hackman, especially lately with Under Suspicion, The Heist, and Heartbreakers. I like the work Paltrow and Huston have done. Bill Murray and Danny Glover _can_ be great, but the material here is so tediously presented, I thought I was watching a Kevein Smith film.Eccentric characters are fine, but these people are not just unlikeable and disfunctional, they're vapid, which is inexcusable in a big screen film. Not to mention, this subject has been much better handled in I'm Losing You, which has wonderful humor and emotional power.In the vernacular, I give it a thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where disc 2 is better than disc 1","review":"THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS is a movie you want to like because of the talent it contains - Angelica Huston, Gene Hackman, Gweneth Paltrow, Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson, Owen Wilson. Nice to see a widely accepted movie that is off the beaten track. But the story is ultimately boring and what can be gleaned from the script is placed in capable hands, unsuccessfully. The accompanying disc about the movie is actually more enjoyable to watch. This is just another ho-hum drab bit of Hollywood trying not to be Hollywood.

Gene Hackman was the only light in this slow, dark, dull, depressing movie. Two attempted suicides in a comedy? I found all of the characters disturbing and in need of serious therapy and medication. What's with Ben Stiller and that ugly red sweat suit he's got on 24/7? And if that's not bad enough he's got his kids in them too.

Rental and Otherwise!","review":"I didn't have to pay to watch this tripe (my friend works in a video store and got it for free) and I'm very thankful for that. Yet another movie that critics rave about for some unknown reason even though I saw nothing original nor overly creative about it. Firstly I didn't really get the sense that Royal Tennenbaum had treated his kids all THAT bad; sure he was a jerk about a lot of things, but he was still there unlike some fathers. So I didn't really get the sense that he was the reason his kids turned out to be such failures. Overall I would simply have to say that as a comedy it failed, ditto in the drama department, and I barely made it through the entire thing. Oh and not too sound like a seven year old or anything, but Luke Wilson's character being in love with his sister, even if she is adopted = EW! That was just a little too V.C. Andrews. So please, people, save your money and rent something genuinely quirky!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Royal Suckenbaums","review":"I'm going to spare the wrath on this one cause it's not worth my time, or yours. This thing just landed in my top 10 worst of all time list and is closer to the top than Billy the Kid Meets Dracula. I'm still looking for the humor in this pig, subtle as it may be. My girlfriend was relieved to find a family as dysfunctional as her's so she thought it was funny. My son was humored by the painted face mescalined-out Austin Healey crashing thing. I was mostly irritated by it all.If the popularity of this movie is not proof positive that Armageddon is near then Jackass surely is!

This is just one more example of a movie that is loved by critics because of its quirkyness, but in fact is really just a boring and unfunny movie.

The story was horrible. A good cast of characters were horrible, (except Gweneth Paltrow who was hot and horrible). The most aimless films like \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,\\" were more poignant than this. If you want to see good comedies with a wry, ironic and intangible humor watch films like \\"Buffalo 66,\\" or \\"Waking Life.\\" I saw a behind the seens look at Wes Anderson while he made this movie and he is as clueless as the plot.

The tone is all off, swinging listlessly from silly jokes and sight gags to \\"quiet dramatic moments\\" that don't go anywhere and, as often as not, end with characters moping around, staring emptily into space.The movie wants to be literate and important. Instead, it just [stinks]."},{"rating":"1","title":"So many great actors, so little for them to do","review":"'Tenenbaums' starts out slowly, and for the most part maintains its plodding pace throughout the whole -- well, I guess it was really less than an hour and a half, but it felt like more.This film is trying to do too much and be too many things, and it succeeds at none of them. It is nearly impossible to care about most of the characters, because they don't really become characters: they're sketches, caricatures, without any depth or substance. Even though only Eli is really on drugs, everyone in the cast seems to be -- particularly Richie and Margot, who seem to have had all of their affect surgically removed.Don't waste your money or your time: there are lots of better films out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a Royal something....","review":"This movie was slow and overly contrived.

Danny Glover is also good in a not-very-demanding role. But mostly this picture is a waste of good talent. The director/writer could not make up his mind whether he was making a soap opera, a true drama, or a spoof. Nor could he decide what to do with the plot. I went with my grown son, and we decided half way through that this movie was going nowhere.

I am, however, kind of an actor (meaning I love to do it, but am not that great), but I have been around good actors a lot. To get to my point I find the acting in Royal Tenenbaums to be amazing. I thought their reactions fit their characters to a T. They reacted not as they might in real life, but as their characters (with their unique background) would. I do not know about camera angle or dark humor (although I did find it humorous); I give it Five stars because I think that the acting (and the writing) were really were amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you must see it \\"RENT DON'T BUY'","review":"If they had a Zero rating I would have chosen that.

I found the entire experience mind-numbingly bad, even offensive, and deadening to my few surviving brain cells. Time stands still but not in a good way. You begin to doubt your own normalcy or whether you indeed have a sense of humor yourself. So be forewarned. Even during the special feature interviews the cast members seemed completely out of it and dysfunctional, and they weren't acting. I suggest that people run for their lives rather than subject themselves to this paean to deadpan humor. Awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strike one","review":"I worship BOTTLE ROCKET, Wes Anderson's first movie. I love RUSHMORE, his sophomore effort. Both are witty, innocent, sincere movies which snub their nose at slackerdom and everyhing blaise. The moral in both of those movies was it's not whether you succeed. It's to do everything with gusto, verve and panache.But this movie, number three? More like \\"number two.\\" What on Earth were Anderson and co-writer Owen Wilson thinking when they made this one? To quote from Magnus, the hilarious Scottish bully in RUSHMORE, this one's \\"all show and no results.\\"Anderson spends nearly the first half of the movie showing off with mannered, show-offy flash back sequences very much like the priceless yearbook montage in RUSHMORE. That's a great one minute scence. But in this movie, Anderson beats the joke into the ground. This movie never picks up steam.

The soundtrack is also very good, Anderson choosing perfectly fitting tracks to enhance the background of the movie. Definitely would recommend to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A triumph for modern filmmaking","review":"I think that The Royal Tenenbaums is probably the most original, intelligent, and clever this year. The film starts by developing its characters and setting the scene. This is important because the scene that it sets is not exactly real. In every scenario, something is not quite right. The New York you see is not the real New York, and the characters are odd, quirky, and have very interesting makeups. The humor in this movie is not like something you would find in Zoolander or Billy Madison, it is a more intelligent brand of comedy .The movie twists and turns through highs and lows of each character. But during a \\"low\\" point, there is a one-liner, or clever device that makes it funny. ..The other reviews for this movie are dishearting to me because they do this film no justice(especially that one by Tyler, are you in the first grade?). Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson have developed another trimuph for modern filmmaking and an all-around hilarious movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"good movie.........","review":"I wont bore you with all the details of the movie, you can get that from other reviews. The movie is good. The second disk on the dvd is the biggest reason why i gave this a 4 instead of a 5. The cut scenes on the second disk just play one after another. The viewer is not able to choose which scene or is even told why the scene is cut. This is one of my biggest gripes about some dvds. I enjoy the way that the kevin smith (clerks, chasing amy, dogma...) dvds are layed out. You can choose which scene you want to view then there is an intro to the scene and then it plays.

The movie takes place in New York during the 60's 70's or 80's, im not even sure and the characters are so boring and dysfunctionally weird. The actors act as if they are being held against their will to act in this movie. Also the stupid character gag that the actors look exactly the same when they are young as they do when they get older (same clothes, hair styles, etc.) is so far fetched. The story itself is cluttered and impossible to follow.

It reminded me of AMERICAN BEAUTY and SEX, LIES, AND VIDEOTAPE, which I also found a dull mix of monontonous characters, plot, and weirdness just for the sake of weirdness."},{"rating":"2","title":"a brilliantly rendered family portrait","review":"This film is wonderful. There are moments of hilarious humor, and moments of heartbreaking emotion, some of it unexpected but nonetheless completely effective. I was floored by Luke Wilson's performance, and the rest of the cast, especially Gene Hackman, play their parts with uniform excellence. Wes Anderson has crafted one of the best films of the year. Visually fascinating and totally absorbing. The Tenenbaum family is a family that I'll be happy to visit again soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"An artful cinematic tragedy","review":"I didn't laugh at all when I first watched this movie. This movie is not a comedy. It's not even a black comedy. It is, for lack of a better phrase, a \\"pink tragedy.\\" The whole film made me want to cry. The acting is excellent, although the star-only cast is rather distracting, and I have no complaints about the film except to say that I got a completely different feeling from this film than anybody else I've discussed it with. Perhaps a new era of emotional slapstick is dawning, but I don't think widowers are hilarious, or slit wrists, or dogs pinned under cars. This movie may be a pioneer in a new tragedy genre in which unrelenting grief becomes laughably absurd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seen in three times in the past two months","review":"My one admonition to those who might be baffled by 'The Royal Tenenbaums' is to see it once more. It's such a subtle film in its dialog and imagery and story that it becomes easy to forget that at heart TRT is a film about a family that has fallen apart over 20 some odd years. The characters may appear to be oddballs, but once you view this a few times you will begin to see the heartbreaking effect of Royal's return to the fold. It unlocks decades of resentment (for Chas), disappointment (for Richie), and unfulfillment (for Margot.) Outstanding performances all around, with Gene Hackman, arguably the greatest living actor, leading a stellar cast."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites!","review":"I won't even care if there was a story (and there is) I just think these are some of the best characters I have watched. Great great movie and so funny too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Over-rated, but good none-the-less","review":"I have heard many people talk of this movie as if it were the savior of cinema. I don't think so. It is a great dark comedy though. Where this movie really excells is in it's character development. Every character in this movie is memorable. The story gives you a great idea of each of their though processes and emotions. I would definately recommend picking this up."},{"rating":"1","title":"riveting, I don't think so... see Rushmore, it is excellent","review":"I could not make it past chapter 3, dissapointing,I felt nothing for these \\"eccentric geniuses,\\" and I the movie fell short on many levels, even the cast of great actors could not save it. Although,I do acknowledge that it could be my misconceived perception that the movie was a comedy, and was thrown off from the start. Each to their own"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been Funny, but somehow missed.","review":"This is one of those rare movies that is so full of talent I honestly don't think the producers knew how to handle it. Just look at it... It's a cast of \\"who's hot in Hollywood.\\" But for me, as much as I tried to watch this movie and find the humor in it, it just missed.Look at the cover. That's about as funny as it gets. I hate to sound so negative, but if you're a Hackman fan, this isn't his best... if you want to see Ben Stiller being funny, rent \\"Meet the Parents.\\" If you want to see Owen Wilson being funny, rent \\"Shanghai Noon.\\" If you want to see Bill Murray being funny, rent \\"Kingpin.\\" In this movie, this wonderful cast just never clicks.My advice would be to watch it when it comes out on regular cable... Trust me... you can wait!Sorry! Only one star!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Royal pain","review":"First, a note to our sniveling, self-appointed \\"IQ\\" experts who have deemed to enlighten us with thier laughably cliched psychological profiles of anyone who doesn't wet thier pants over this pretentious turkey:1. I am an avid film fan who fully understands the \\"language\\" of film.2. I fully grasp the concept of \\"irony\\".3. I LOVE \\"quirky\\".So why did I feel the \\"Royal Tenenbaums\\" sucked with the intensity of 1,000 black holes? Because even Stephen Hawking would agree that if it LOOKS like $#!+, and SMELLS like $#!+... well you know the rest. For a truly ENTERTAINING story about a \\"quirky\\" and dysfunctional family that SUCCESSFULLY mixes bathos, pathos, slapstick AND intellect, check out the 1972 cult classic \\"The Ruling Class\\" instead (also from Criterion, who have really made a rare, but baffling misfire by adding \\"Tenenbaums\\" to thier impressive canon.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money on this","review":"This movie is like road kill.

The only character worth his paycheck in the farce of a film is Mr. Pagoda. Literally, the only thing that struck me as humorous about this film was the story about Pagoda stabbing Gene Hackman and then taking him to the hospital to save his life. Then, Pagoda proceeds to stab him again during the film. That, and the fact that Pagoda was the only character with an ounce of wits about him makes him the only character worth caring about in this film.Instead of ranking this movie as a comedy, it should be labeled \\"Delusional Genius Movie\\". The only people I know that liked this film are people that \\"think\\" they are sooooooo smart and above the run of the mill \\"dysfunctional family\\" comedies. If you are looking for a movie that you can laugh at, take a pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time & money on this movie","review":"I do not understand why Anjelica Houston and Gene Hackman signed up for this film. It is black humor, but horribly done and we were very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pale Imitation of Masterworks","review":"I went into this film with high hopes . . . good writers, great cast. I came away feeling utterly cheated by what apepared to be nothing more than a poor effort to capture the essence of what is present in John Irving's novels and the subsequent film adaptations. Get iGarp, Hotel New Hampshire, and Cider House Rules to and see how this type of humor works when done right.I will, however, give them credit for the gypsy cab gag."},{"rating":"1","title":"PSeudo-intelligent movie","review":"Trying to make something different, they just made something boring.

I am a frequent movie goer as is a friend of mind and we both agreed this was a horrible, grossly over rated film.Gene Hackman was very good and may be the only reason to consider going to this movie. The theater we were at had a good croud and you almost never heard a laugh at any time. It was more like a morgue.For normal movie fans this is a bomb!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A well made movie but so boring predictable story.","review":"Amazingly slow and predictable one. The director's attention to detail and setup were great as usual. However, there's no point of story. Not amusing. Paltrow underperforms. Highly decorated bright side version of Adams family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought it would be","review":"I was really looking forward to watching this movie on the strength of the casting alone. I've never seen any of the other films written and directed by the same team, so I didn't know what it would be like. The actors do what they can, but the writing seemed disjointed and I just wanted to smack most of the characters and tell them to get a life! Gwyneth Paltrow is one of my favorite actresses, but her character was just too cliched- her adopted father didn't love her so she looked for love from other men (and women in a short scene that was completely pointless) including one of her adopted brothers. This movie did not give the audience any real connection with the characters. I was more upset when the dog died than with what happened to any of the characters. The only reason I gave this movie two stars is because of the cast- and they deserved a better script."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Boring an adequate description ?","review":"So slow that I wanted to turn it off all the time.I gave it a whole hour and it never picked up"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy the original DVD minus the second disc","review":"This was a great movie, but don't watch the bonus material on the second disc. After I futzed around on the second disc, it made the movie feel a little more boring than it actually was.Great movie, trash bonus material, beautifully aranged soundtrack. I'd buy it just for Luke Wilson's big scene with Elliot Smith's Needle in the Hay."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Royal Success!","review":"Who wouldn't want to work with Wes Anderson? After his first two movies (Rushmore, Bottle Rockets) won great praise from critics and viewers alike this was one of the most anticipated flicks of last year. Take a heaping of Gene Hackmans dry delivery and sprinkle in a hip cast of the best of young hollywood has to offer then cover it all with Andersons painterly scenes. One of the best things about Anderson his his use of music and though Tenenbaums is a little heavy in the soundtrack department he still uses tunes as well as anybody in hollywood. For those who are surprised by this brand of film making try out some Hal Ashby (Harold and Maude)."},{"rating":"1","title":"THOROUGHLY UNIMPRESSED IN DALLAS","review":"Other than seeing the faces of some of my favorite actors and appreciating their ability to act within the limited scope of this script, I was struggling to keep awake in this film. What did keep me awake was the optimistic hope that good actors would only be involved in this movie if it were entertaining in some way at some point. Perhaps it was just not at all my cup of tea. Little plot, action, development. It reminded me of the television show: \\"Married with Children\\" in its level of humor. Frankly, I thought that the concept was good, but not developed well. I felt like asking for a refund. As a regular fan of Hollywood's best movies, I admit that I, like others, have been sorely disappointed in most of the 2001 releases."},{"rating":"1","title":"WIERD!!!","review":"Went into this movie thinking it would keep me laughing. Well, it didn't! There are a lot of well known actors in this, but it fails to produce the laughs. The storyline is disjointed, and quirky. The film is shot in documentary style format. I sat through the film, and just kept saying \\"how wierd\\". It was a big let down. Save your $8.00 and go to another movie!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ditto \\"Major Disappointment\\"","review":"Too many players and little development led to less than empathetic roles, a wasted celebrity cast, and uneven pacing. (Think Anniversary Party.) Introduction of new and unsubstantiated character dysfunction (e.g., celeb writer's substance abuse 3/4 through the movie) does not equal a plot twist. For a how-to on multiple character development, try Short Cuts or Magnolia.Most of the humor was found in the movie's opening montage (similar to Max Fisher's extracurricular activities in Rushmore). And the most beautiful cinematography, the moments before Wilson's suicide attempt, seemed out of place, despite the movie's billings as a dark comedy. Also disappointing was Hackman's racism towards Glover (a la Nicholson's character in As Good As It Gets). Gratuitous racism died with Quentin Tarantino's 15 minutes of fame.For a look at why critics rave about Wes Anderson, watch Rushmore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Royal Tennenbaums DVD","review":"This is easily one of the best films of the decade!

I think they tried to hard to shoot some kind of masterpiece, but the final result was not good. Stiller is no in a funny role.

I almost always enjoy the actors that were assembled, some of them great humorists. But in this film there is lots of buildup with no punchlines. I don't think I can remember one really funny scene or line.Hackman, Paltrow and Huston chew up the scenary and are always a joy to watch. Ben Stiller and Bill Murray were totally wasted. Luke Wilson was the only one that was given a role in which he could cut loose, yet he doesn't have the comedic ability that Stiller does and could not do much with it.I think the funniest moments were given by Kumar Pallana.Who would have thought that Hackman/Stiller would yield so much fewer laughs than Deniro/Stiller. Not me."},{"rating":"2","title":"probably my favorite movie","review":"after seeing all of the low ratings, i felt that it was necessary for me to say my part. this, along with pulp fiction, are my favorite movies.

It creates a new film genre for American film. Every scene was so beautifully filmed that it looked like a photograph or a painting from a child's storybook. The plot moved at a great pace and the acting was fantastic, especially Gene Hackman's performance as Royal. Every character was perfectly cast. Ben Stiller stole the show at times with his wonderfully funny performance. This movie has the perfect combination of humor, charm, and sadness. Watching it I was not sure if I wanted to cry or laugh. In the end, I was only sure of one thing...I wanted to see more. This is the rare kind of movie that makes you want to watch it again and again. The music was fantastic on the level of The Graduate. The story was completely original and the cast was superb!

The watch has a rugged feel to it too. I love the look of the dial. The only downside is that the bigger second hand is not exactly a second hand but the chronograph second hand. The actual seconds are in the lower smaller dial. The chronograph function works beautifully. The alarm is also an added bonus, although the alarm is not loud enough to wake you up but its a good enough alarm for a reminder. On the whole, a very nice looking, incredibly light watch. The only downside being the confusing second hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK Watch","review":"I purchased this watch with a black face. Visibility is a problem. The dials and hands tend to blend in with each other making telling time difficult. The watch is on the small side for a man's watch so the date and subdials are tiny.

Disney had several series such as Gallagher and Toby Tyler but none of them was the equal of the Scarecrow. Patrick McGoohan went on to do Secret Agent, the Prisoner and several episodes of Columbo but his best role was the Scarecrow of Romney Marsh.

When I was a kid, I can remember first seeing him on Disney and thinking to myself, \\"what a guy, I want to marry him.\\" Now that I read these blogs on the internet, I too agree, it is high time that Disney release this boomer oriented classic of the mid-60's.

Even Brahms thought enough of it to conduct the world premiere for his friend. Max Bruch, the composer famous for his beautiful violin concerto #1 in G minor, and The Scottish Fantasy, thought (and hoped) he would be remembered primarily for his Choral music, and listening to this latest offering on cd, you may wonder why he was'nt. It is both serene and powerful music and I for one, only want to hear more of it. The opening orchestral prelude sets the stage for much beautiful singing. Highly recommended. Performance could'nt be finer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different view of Civil War Reconstruction","review":"In Reforging the White Republic Blum takes a different angle at exploring the post Civil War/Reconstruction era. He writes on the different roles religion played in attempting or not attempting to reconstruct the United States. The book flows well and avoids verbose and complicated language that usually turns readers off. It is startling to learn of the different stances religions and religious leaders took, in terms of race relations between whites and African Americans, after the war. Between hypocrisy and outright dedication and heroics, the challenges of reuniting a nation are examined in Blum's work. This is an asset in the college classroom."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Take on Reconstruction","review":"Reforging the White Republic is an excellent book that portrays the American Reconstruction. Historian Edward Blum claims that the Reconstruction consisted of the issues within and between race, religion, and American nationalism. The major overall underlying theme throughout the book is religion. Blum is a master at tying all of his ideas together, and making the book feel so realistic when reading it.

There are parts where you have to use prior knowledge about things and write about it and she didn't have any prior knowledge. Another thing was that she had to write essays about things, I don't remember writing essays on things until I was in Junior High, so that was also frustrating. You pretty much had to have a dictionary and encyclopedia in front of you the entire time. The math section was good, it was pretty much self explanatory.

The melodrama only got worse in season 9, mind you, but it started here. With Mulder gone, all the now-pregnant Scully did was cry and mope. Plus, as talented as Robert Patrick was in his portrayal of Agent John Doggett, he and Scully did not have the rapport that she and Mulder had. The witty banter was gone. The dialogue that bounced between them only happened briefly, in the few episodes David Duchovny appeared in. And as wonderful as the final episode of the season was (that liplock between Mulder and Scully!) it was only the segue into the even more dismal season 9.Maybe Chris Carter should have taken a clue from Duchovny and bowed out after Season 7.

Maybe it was the writers fault, did they really expect me to love the new Mulder/Scully wannabes? Dogget is a poor excuse for a skeptic, Scully may not have agreed with Mulder, but she was never as close minded as Dogget, and Reyes, the female Mulder, just comes off as naive. The relationship between the two is laughable, I could have cared less if they ended up together, or who killed Dogget's son, or really anything pertaining to uninspiring duo. They have none of the Mulder/Scully spark. The only reason to watch this season is for Gillian Anderson, who gets props for sticking with the show, and for the rare Mulder episode, which every once in awhile gives a glimps of why this show was so wonderful in season 1-7."},{"rating":"1","title":"a huge disappointment","review":"Season 8 was a huge disappointment with the newest characters poorly developed and an unrecognizable Scully."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was the last season of the X-Files, in my opinion...","review":"Season eight was a great season, even though many of my friends stopped watching the show somewhere around season six or seven. However, I don't understand why the show didn't call it quits after this season. In my eyes, \\"Existence\\" is the series finale.This season helped pick up the slack that seasons 6 and 7 were creating. Even though a lot of people don't like this season due to the absence of Mulder, Doggett is a pretty good fill-in (or replacement, whatever you want to call it). The only thing I thought was a bit too much, was the whole \\"Mulder's resurrection\\" thing. Although this show always delt with strange occurrences, that was a bit of a stretch for me.I think any fan of the X-Files should own seasons 1-8 (hell, even season 9 if you like it...)."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?!?!?!?!","review":"I have been watching all seasons on DVD and enjoying them thoroughly.

Alas, it was not the case and DD left, the syndicate was killed, dogget was introduced, and the series fell apart. What was even more strange was how Chris Carter saw fit to REPLACE mulder with two clear moves. One, Dogget was introduced as the skeptic who's son (sound farmiliar?) was killed mysteriously several years ago. Two, Scully became the believer. Huh? Scully Believer? What Happened? It's an awful show, and the only good episode left was the series finalie, where Mulder, Scully, and THE SMOKING MAN (YEAH! NOW THAT\\"S THE XFILES THAT I LOVE!) meet and some conclusion is given.

Try as they might to make the stories the center of The X-Files, the truth is out there that the center lay in the incredible chemistry between Mulder and Scully (David Duchovny & Gillian Anderson). The characters of Doggett and Reyes serve here as a painful reminder of what has been lost when Duchovny left. To compound the tragedy, when Mulder returns for the last episodes he does so as a marginal character intended to bolster the potential future of a Doggett/Reyes centered series.More than anything, Season 8 is a sad commentary on what can happen when a show loses sight of what initially made it great."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best season!","review":"If you are a X-files fan, you must own the entire collection.Amazing features and video quality.

As much as some people don't like to admit The X-Files is a character show and the loss of Mulder for half of the season was big. However I think that Doggett added a lot to the show in his absence. Doggett had a big disadvantage of being disliked before he even was introduced, so he had to earn a lot more, because he was seen as replacing Mulder. But the thing is that he didn't try to replace him he tried to fill in some gaps until Mulder would return. I don't think that the actual cases suffered at all and the episodes were still wonderful. I LOVE the X-files and I really like seasons 8 and 9 as well. The eventual edition of Reyes worked well with the dynamic of the show. There needed to be another strong female character and she fit the bill, plus she had a history with Doggett.The cases in season 8 are exciting, well writen, and fun to watch.

Most of the Mythology episodes are in the last two months of Season 8. The spacing of the mythology epsidoes and stand alones are not well done. The Super Soldier story arch frankly did not work. This is more evident in Season 9 than 8 though. The stand alone episodes are first rate. The previous reviewer stated that the show was not intersting until the last 7 episodes. I disagree, the tension in the first few stand alone episodes between Dogett and Scully were top notch. They were feeling each other out. Yes, there were times where the Dogett act of a non-believer was carried on too long. That being said my favorite episode is Salvage. Gotta love Metal Man. The Boston Subway episode was first rate also.

Without Mulder...you're left with people *talking* about Mulder.It wasn't Robert Patrick's fault (though his \\"Mulduhh\\" New York accent started to grate after a few episodes)...or the wonderful Gillian Anderson's. It's just a fact that when you remove 50% of a show's chemistry (chemistry that made this show a wordwide phenomenon) you simply have half of what made this show the best of the 90's.

He seems to shun for himself a part in centuries of Tibetan political manoeuvering except insofar as any present machinations threaten or impede the mission given to him directly by the XVIth Karmapa. In the end, what does the controversy mean, does it matter? Buddhism holds in its means a rectitude to solve human conflicts, by healing individual lives. That has been Lama Ole and Hannah's life work. Is that disputable? Whatever else, practictioners must realize the wild human adventure in stories like this one.

Even $5 a month is kind of pushing it. It should be about $10 for 3 months. Then I'll buy. Until that happens, DON'T PAY ON THIS OVERPRICED GAME.

In many cultures they explain the presence of G-d in their (our) lives. According to Pennick \\"letters in an alphabet are metaphors of reality\\". Read this book and you'll understand why.You'll find here basic information about the hebrew, greek, runes and ogham. In the last chapters the author write about alchemical alphabets and magic squares. I'd like to see something about the egyptian alphabet but he didn't write anything about it.My main interest in this book is the secret/divinatory aspect of these alphabets but you also will find a rich cultural approach in each section and it's very instructive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Theory and a bit boring","review":"A book on magickal alphabets should include a guide on how to use alphabets in a magickal working.

Most of the \\"facts\\" that she gives are things that can be found (...)from watching cable shows that talk about Oprah. Oprah has set the new standard of what talk shows should be, but Ms. Garson did a poor job in showing this. She even describes Oprah as \\"clowning\\" for her viewers and audience when she gets excited about something on her show.

Almost half of the episode is scavenged from former episodes. The limited budget that the studio had imposed on the writers and the rather extravagent special effects used during the second series meant that the episode had to be made on a shoestring. This is a ploy used in many different TV series; Star Trek: TNG is certainly not unusual in this. However, for dedicated fans, such episodes end up in their \\"most disappointing\\" category. As far as the limitations of flashback episodes go, and considering the questionable quality of the first two seasons, this is not a bad result. However, being what it is, it is certainly one of the lower points of the series. I would, however, rank it somewhat better than such episodes as \\"The Last Outpost\\" and \\"Justice.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Point of the Series","review":"This is a 'flashback' episode where clips from previous episodes are used.

While it is a bad episode, I will purchase it just to complete my collection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst","review":"This is the only time that TNG had a clip show. After viewing this episode, you will know why it was the only one. It is obvious that the producers were trying to save money. And did they ever. This was the finale of TNG's second season. It was about Riker getting a disease from a Predatory vine. The only way to save Riker, is to inject him with androphins to try to give Riker, good bad, lustful and primitive memories. And, you guessed it, the memories shown are memories from the first two seasons episodes like Heart of Glory, The Last Outpost, and A Matter of Honor. The clips are put together pretty nicly, but I still give the episode one star, because it was rushed, it had a really, really, really bad script, and it was obvious that this show was poorly thought out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Santa gift","review":"Cute item, artfully done.

That field should just go off forever in every direction but it really looks like some nasty two acre garden. Also, I realize that EVERY single movie now has to feature people who are younger than thirty since it's impossible to believe that anyone over the age of thirty could possibly contribute to society but I have a hard time believing that the wife is old enough to have given birth to that teenager (popped her out at the age of 14? I guess...) and the sheriff is, oh, what do you think, maybe twenty? Are there still sharecroppers? If a nearby sharecropper decided to pull off her top and pour water all over her naked torso, do you think you would even be anywhere to actually see it, if your farm was at least one or two quarters large?

They would respond to what the main character of that portion was saying, but I generally had no sense of what those responses meant.My guess is that Ms. Garnett, in her attempt to stay faithful to the Russian, stayed away from using English idiom, but this sadly resulted in severe loss of clarity.

He recommended it but warned, even then, that although the second disk was marked CD 2, it was identical to CD 1. Given the price I figured it was a fair enough deal for the first half of the set. And sure enough, my purchase verified his warning - both CDs are exactly the same content even though they're marked differently. Apart from that the sound is fine. It comes with an eight page booklet that repeats the track listing from the back but adds songwriting credits.Update: The currently available mp3 download ofBusts Up Las Vegasincludes all Jayne Mansfield songs listed here, including the five songs on this set's second nonexistent disk, plus an interview and a couple other tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super fun game!","review":"This game is really fun to play with a big group of people.

Trying to pass off the sunshine and brown mountains of California for the Scottish Highlands was a biggie. The weird antagonism and indifference of the \\"Scots\\" regarding Nessie was just goofy: these people owe their livelyhood to the tourists looking for a creature in the lake. And the sight of poor Patrick Bergin showing up with a Braveheart-painted face and a harpoon to battle the monster almost knocked the movie into parody.Unbelievably bad in almost every way. Will go down as the first horror film in which the monster was overheard saying, \\"Who do I have to have sex with to get off this picture?\\"Was it a mistake to pay attention?

I have seen more realistic looking monsters in video games! It is not even CGI quality. (which has become very overused and overrated lately in cinema) There is nothing wet about the underwater scenes either. The so-called scots in the film are not in the least bit Scottish I am sure.

The only parts I really just don't love are the buttons and mindy episodes just because they are all the same, but overall this has to be the wittiest show ever. I know there are people out there that complain about not having any extras but I'm not one of those people as long as I have the episodes I am fine. By the way if anyone from Disney reads this, take note I bought this because they announced that the final volume was going to be released so now instead of not having any animaniacs episodes I will soon have them all, so Disney start releasing complete series and people like me will start buying it.

After finishing, I'd say that it's not even close. But the story is still worth looking at.What this book truly is, is just what it says: an inside view. There are significant passages on America's involvement, Pinochet and Chilean society at the time, but Boorstein really concentrates on political and economic conditions five to ten years prior to the coup as a subordinate of the Allende government.Some of the economic details get excruciatingly boring, but some of the historical background and personal experiences are what make Allende's Chile worthwhile.For a more detailed look at American involvement, I'd look to someone like Christopher Hitchens and his book on Henry Kissnger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intersting parts, boring as a whole.","review":"The author worked for the Allende government and the best part of the book is the 'inside' perspective he adds. The highlight is his narration of the efforts made by him and other advisers in the US to protect Chilean interests from American Multinationals lawsuits, embargos, etc..that could come as a result of Allende's aggresive programs against them .However, most of the book goes back to the same old boring common-place of how Imperialists Americans and Pinochet's \\"Bad Boys\\" are responsible for Allende's failure. Even the horrible economic situation is blamed on them. (Because Communism worked everywhere else!!!).Anyway, the book was written in 1975 and at that time that speech was believed. Today, we know almost half of the chileans support Pinochet until today, and that although Americans played a role, the economic chaos was Allende's fault... for his irresponsible and un-professional programs."},{"rating":"1","title":"gazebo ho wood236 was not wood it was metal","review":"was decieved on size i was told it was ho scale it was not it was more like n scale"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"Just not a great model.

Shame on Disney!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Elijah Wood's British Accent is Horrible.","review":"I love Charles Dickens Oliver Twist story and I have seen some movies based on his book that were exceptionally good but this movie was horrific. Have you noticed that most of the positive 5 and 4 star reviews seem to be by girls who have major crushes on Elijah Wood. Sorry but I don't think they can be objective as they are extremely biased! I like Elijah Wood and I generally think he is a superb actor but I'm sorry but he was badly miscast as the Artful Dodger. His British accent was horrible and he looked too old for the part and in his costumes he looked like some kind of sissified dandy instead of a streetwise pickpocet. Sorry but this movie is a clunker!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Atrocious, nihilistic perversion of Dickens' classic","review":"In this \\"updated\\" version of Oliver Twist, Oliver becomes a cunning, greedy little brat who's forever lying, cheating and stealing to get or recover possession of the gold locket his mother left him. Thus an ingenious but incidental plot device in Dicken's novel becomes the very unchildlike obsession around which all the action in the film revolves; in fact, my daughter suggested after viewing the film that it should be re-named \\"The Locket.\\" Dickens' caricatures of figures like Mr. Bumble and Mrs. Corney become stock and cartoonish, as the script strains to present Industrial Revolution England in as bad a light as possible, and Richard Dreyfuss as Fagin betrays a complete lack of understanding of that character. Stick with David Lean's 1948 production of \\"Oliver Twist\\" with an all-British cast, including Obie Wan Kenobe/Alec Guinness, and let this version go into the incinerator!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Little Blue Boy Plays The Artful Dodger","review":"First off I want to say that I'm a Elijah Wood fan so I have nothing against this gifted actor but I was very disappointed in this version of Oliver Twist and I hate to have to say this but I think he was not right for the part of Artful Dodger. Not only was his British accent poor but the way he looked in the movie in his costumes made me think he was posing for a painting like The Little Blue Boy Painting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eisner's Twist: Dismal Disney","review":"Disney under Michael Eisner has an agenda; that agenda is exhibited in this falsified version of Charles Dickens' second novel, Oliver Twist. There is no question that Dickens intended to protray Fagin as a miscreant of nearly supernatural villainy. This Eisner-Disney version has re-written Dickens in order to protray Fagin as a basically benevolent character, with Bill Sykes transformed into the principal evil-doer.Unfortunately this mess of a movie will attract a great deal of attention due to the presence of actor Elijah Wood. But viewers seeking a film faithful to Dickens' original should access the lengthy 1985 BBC production distributed by CBS/Fox on video, or the David Lean classic on DVD.Once again, the venerable Disney name is being misused to market an Eisner counterfeit which censors a classic work for purposes of aligning it with Eisner's twisted sense of political correctness. It should be renamed Eisner Twist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Classic Novel Made Suitable For Children, And Another Job Well-Done By Walt Disney Pictures.","review":"It's \\"Oliver Twist, Or The Parish Boy's Progress\\" for kids. Walt Disney Pictures did a fantastic job of editing the novel to make it suitable for children, as they have done with many of their motion pictures adapted from classic novels and fairy tales. I especially like the scenes with Rose and Oliver. Their relationship has always held a special place in my heart. Kudos to Walt Disney Pictures for making yet another classic novel accessible for kids. Maybe it will inspire them to read the novel in its original form when they're old enough.

What's so mesmerizing about the novel, I think, is that it brews up a potent love story mixed with just enough realism to engage the reader's hopes on behalf of the characters -- what a fine line to walk, and Lori has done it very well. Also enjoyed the fact that the main characters were older women (not the usual 20-somethings searching for love - nothing wrong with that at all, except it's been done and done), and the extremely subtle portrayal of lesbians who are clearly \\"out\\", but face that continual tension about when and how to reveal themselves to new people in their lives. This novel WORKS in so many ways.....another literary victory for Lori Lake!

It nearly mirrors the content and order of the audio. If you are not familiar with Joshua Dressler, you should be.

This outline, along with the Sum and Substance, is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"very helpful","review":"This book was very well-organized.

Our professor liked to stress this in class so it was very helpful on my exam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dressler's clever scheme","review":"The book is fairly useful because it presents readers with a great amount of black letter law. It made me wonder why Dressler's textbook is such an awful and confusing mess of babble. Then, it finally hit me. Dressler simultaenously churns out impossible-to-understand criminal law textbooks that law students are forced to buy, thereby creating a market for black letter law guides and hornbooks. Then, Dressler creates these black letter law guides and hornbooks as an antidote to his shoddy textbook! Ingenius.Honestly, there are better books out there to help you with criminal law. I find the nutshell series to be more helpful than Dressler. The Emanuel and Gilbert outlines are also better. After producing his horrible \\"Cases and Materials on Criminal Law\\" textbook for 1Ls, which seems to be intentionally confusing, Dressler doesn't deserve to sell any of his study-aids."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you have the Dressler textbook, this is a must have.","review":"I didn't have much time to prepare for my criminal law final but luckily I found this gem of an outline. My professor's exam required you to know both the common law and model penal code approaches to the crim law doctrines, and this book recited concisely that exact information. The book went into the perfect depth to study for exams -- you can learn the major doctrine and most (if not all) of the exceptions and caveats.My outline looked superb after combing through this outline.Note: It does not really cover cases in any detail, so if your prof. goes case heavy you will need to rely on the textbook or get another supplement."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good review or introduction","review":"This lecture is very helpful as an introduction to criminal law or a fast review.

The FASHY is the best I have used. It fills quickly (no blow-back like the old ones), does not leak and the heavy thermoplastic (or whatever it's made of) regulates the heat better than thin rubber. It also stays warm for hours. I bought this to replace a 5-year old FASHY just because I thought it time for a new one.

While I did not think much of the former, in this second book Sundarasan writing displays maturity and meticulous historical research. She weaves the intricate historical events with harem intrigue in a very able manner and manages to portray the granduer of the Mughal court. One gets a feel for the characters especially Nur Jahan who was both admired and despised..Except for some parts that read too much like a history lesson, this is an interesing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncompelling writing that lacks insight","review":"I found the Feast of Roses very disappointing. I never got into any of the characters, and the writing was very stilted. Also, lavish descriptions of the palace etc, but one never really gets a full sense of the machinations of the court. I also never fully understood why Jahaniger and Mehrusinna loved each other so. It was just stated as a given. Overall, I learned a little bit more about India at that time, but that is about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sequel!","review":"Beautifully written sequel to The Twentieth Wife. Facinating story about a powerful woman at a time when women weren't supposed to be powerful. Many sequels don't live up to the original book....this one does...don't miss it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good but not as good as the \\"Twentieth Wife\\"","review":"The Sequel to the \\"Twentieht Wife\\" although very well writen is a bit dissapointing for it lacks the passion of the author's writing. It is a bit repetitive, for the author tends to dwell too long re-telling parts of the story that have already been covered in the first book. Having said that I still recomend it, Indu Sundaresaan is a gifted writer that manages to transport the reader back in time to the Mugal empire, providing interesting descriptions of the politics and life behind the curtains in the Zenana."},{"rating":"2","title":"a rich read","review":"Sundaresan certainly has brought a interesting period of history back to life. As someone who has read The Twentieth Wife and The Feast of Roses, I'm obviously a fan of hers. Sometimes her writing can be a bit stiff, and her dialogue awkward, but I'm happy that she has introduced me to a new world.Readers who like Sundaresan, and the era she's writing about, should look into Beneath a Marble Sky. I just finished this novel (which tells the story behind the Taj Mahal's creation), and couldn't have loved it any more.I'm happy to be reading novels set in this period, as it's a fascinating era, and one that most people in the West know little about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amost as good as the prequel","review":"It was almost as good as The Twentieth Wife but worth reading since the story is so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Feast of Roses","review":"This book made me aware of the interesting background of the Indian culture. I feel it was very well written with a lot of detail and information. However, at times there was too much detail and it slowed down the story. The author knows how to weave the facts with an interesting story. I would loan it to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting and Well-Written","review":"Sundaresan's first book, The Twentieth Wife, showed her to be a writer capable of carrying a reader to another time. Her new book, The Feast of Roses, not only takes me again to that time, but reveals Sundaresan's writing skills to be even stronger. The prose is even more lyrical, the characters well developed, the plot suspenseful. A great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Book","review":"Had to read this book for a college class and I hated it.

The typos are rampant and they don't stop with the printed book. The software is okay but has some weak spots and bugs.

I'm a little older than most grad. students & haven't done this type of stuff in a long time. Unfortunately this book has so many wrong answers & typos that it hasn't helped me much. This book also needs to be organized better & cut out all the useless talk. It needs to focus on what's on the test & the specific strategy you can use if you can't figure the answer out.

(good read)","review":"This book is not about riding. It's about the deeper, emotional effect horses have on people.We know there is something special about horses in many categories. We're not quite special enough to figure it out, but we're coming close and Wyatt takes us a step closer with his concrete examples and his own insights into horses and people, and the horse-people relationship.This book should be in the self-help section although it's really about how horses help people.

Mr. Mac is a vet with the Houston Bureau of Animal Regulation & Care (BARC). There's humor, suspense, and an education rolled into one book.

I am now reading Dr. Gawande's other book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An insider's perspective which can help you be a more informed patient","review":"I'm always on the side of self-education when it comes to medical topics, especially in light of the current health care system and its looming problems. Gawande's skill is in writing movingly ab out all sorts of medical issues, including both failures and successes, in a way that illuminates the complexities of practicing medicine in today's world of HMOs, soaring premiums and more.Some of his essays may appeal more to you than others but I urge you to read the entire book, as well as to get his other one, Complications. I've read medical memoirs that put me to sleep and have been baffled by how someone could take life and death situations and turn them into dry writing. This isn't the case here and you'll come away from the book with a stronger understanding of all the factors (and possible solutions) that make up the world of medicine, medical ethics and patient care today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Becoming Better","review":"This book is a compliation of authentic stories that elucidates the importance of enhancing or becoming better at what you do. The book is categorized into three parts. They are dilligence, doing it right and ingenuity. In each case, he lucidly supports his propositions with pragmatic examples that motivates the reader to apply those lessson's to his or a her own personal life. It amazes me how Dr. Gwande find time to write these books as a busy general surgeon. But when he does find time to write these books, he surely do an amazing job. If you are a person wanting to enhance your aptitude at work or any part of your life, this is the book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"worhtwhile","review":"it's easy to see that dr gawande has matured since his book \\"complications\\"- \\"better\\" is a smooth, engaging read, with a great conclusion, but it lacks the worderfully self- efacing nature of \\"complications\\". read \\"complications\\" (5 stars) first!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing insights","review":"Atul Gawande's \\"Better: A Surgeon's Notes on Performance\\" is an excellent primer on a myriad of issues that affect contemporary medicine.

Beginning to end it had me hooked. I was originally searching for a business performance book but I started reading it and thought I could learn from it.

Pick it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Thought-Provoking Book","review":"Initially, I was skeptical about reading this book; I started reading it feeling sure that it would be kind of hokey. Some parts of it WERE a bit hokey (like the afterword where the author gives his five ideas for being a positive deviant). But I was pleasantly surprised to find that there were many points in the book that made me stop and think a little bit more about the training that I am undergoing and what the ultimate goal of it all is. In particular, the chapters about physician involvement in executions, and the bell curve chapter concerning the performances of CF centers, really gave me pause. The book is a fairly short and quick read, but I recommend not rushing through it. I stopped after each chapter and just jotted down a note about what I was thinking at that point. It was interesting to go back later and discuss these issues with my classmates and some physicians, as well as to consider them further myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting","review":"I think you really have to know you want to read this.

I really enjoyed his insights into the medical community and the big issues facing the world today."},{"rating":"2","title":"A timely book for improved performance in healthcare","review":"At a time when comments on U.S. health care are loaded with inflammatory speech and defensive posturing, Gawande offers us a refreshing, moderate, and reflective look at modern health care delivery. Using his journalistic/investigative approach to answering questions, Gawande puzzles through current issues in medicine. His candid presentation helps to strip away the reader's preconceptions.Gawande uses engaging clinical scenarios to describe medical improvement as a sometimes untidy plunge into the unknown. He discusses how progress can be made in improving physician performance and offers advice to those who want to make a positive difference in the world. With his introspective, poignant observations and engaging style, Gawande breathes new life into the conventional medical establishment and demonstrates a clear understanding of the human condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complications is better, better is still very good","review":"Gawande is a witty, practical, intelligent, and interesting writer who can relate and sympathize well with a wide range of people. On top of this, he is an innovator (see the recent article on [..] that describes his new protocols being applied in hospitals and drastically eliminating serious errors). I'm sure many professional writers wish they had half his talent. I think his first book Complications was better because it had more interesting stories and I was captivated about his admittance and depiction of MDs as fallible humans. With that said, Better is still a five-star read. My favorite part and the most valuable take away from this book is his last chapter, \\"For Performance\\" with five suggestions that everyone can use to better themselves, and as as result, better the world around them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bail Out","review":"The picture and audio quality are the worst I have ever seen on DVD except for another movie by this same company.Save your receipt; you'll want your money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad fall from the glory of her previous novels","review":"Being an avid Amanda Quick fan, I pick up each book as soon as they are released, find a quiet moment when I can read the book, then proceed to devour it. This book, once completed, was a sore disappointment. Though I like a mystery mixed in with the romance, this book focused so much on mystery it left very little to romance and practically nothing to character development. You wonder who these two characters are, and how could they possibly fall in love when there are so few sparks flying. I feel this book also echoed too many of her previous books, almost completely lacking an original story. However, since I do love her books so much, I eagerly await her next novel, hoping it will return her to her earlier glory."},{"rating":"2","title":"toothsome but enjoyable...","review":"I agree with another reviewer. Miss Quick's newer romances are a bit longer wordwise. But the longer length is not needed and I hope she goes back to her older writing style. That said-With This Ring's was still filled with Quick's signature humor, quirkiness, intelligent characters and sensuality. It was also refreshing to have a 40 yr old hero and 30 yr old heroine. This book seems written more of a adventure than and \\"I adore you\\" romance but is still quite enjoyable. The love scenes are well written, especially the first love scene-against the wall, woohoo-is smoking!All in all-even a mediocre Quick book is better than most other romances out there:)4 stars-recommended:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amusing and Intresting","review":"This is the first regency novel I've encounted with the hero being --gasp!!-- nearly 40. I was glad that the heroine wasn't some little baby of 16 as I hate those kind of books. But this book, my second Amanda Quick, was good. The 'murder' plot wasn't really that intresting but the situations that Beatrice got herself into were funny. I borrowed the book from my library and I'm not so in love with it that I'll buy it but it does make a good read for a rainy afternoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but was disappointed!","review":"I am a huge fan of Ms Quick's, but was disappointed in this book.

I'm not saying that I'll never read her books again, I'm just saying that her name is no longer at the top of my favorite author list. Her heroine was incredibly annoying and I found myself just wishing they would find the stupid rings so I could get on to reading a GOOD book. If I could I wouldn't even give this book ONE star.

Damn! The words on the back flap of the dust jacket read: \\"Printed in China.\\"I'm sure that Mr. Wilde would have some sharp words to say about a book of his work - words celebrating love of life and liberty - being produced in a country ran by a dictator - one that routinely uses either slave labor (in the form of \\"political\\" prisoners) or indentured servants (as in people who are not allowed to either quit or leave a job once taken) in their state-run industries.I recommend Wilde's work wholeheartedly - but to purchase this tainted volume would certainly be unjust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Interesting!","review":"This VHS \\"Haunted History\\" is the best of its kind.

In this book Rosen brings the whole of the disagreements between the Moderns and the Ancients to bear on the analysis of Hegel. Reading Hegel as a modern, Rosen talks about how Hegel's engagement with the ancients, an engagement which is central to Hegel's thinking, is worked out in the dynamics of Hegel's political thinking. The drama of German thought, its scientism, its radicalisation of philosophical considerations in an effort to arrive at a system of thought, are played against the sober playfulness of ancient thought. The effect is elating, understandable and eminently digestible. Rosen is a god among men."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"Wow this was awful. I was REALLY REALLY hoping to like this book. I LOVE the Midnight Louie series, and almost any book with animals as a main character. But the author spends so much time describing inane things in minute detail that the plot quickly gets lost. The plot itself has promise, and the characters are interesting, but the verbosity plaguing the pages of this diatribe make it a long and boring read. Not to mention the ending (last chapter) was stupid. Even if we are to believe this person turned herself from a cat to a human, are we also to believe she was able to marry, drive and get a job without a birth certificate, social security number or any other identification? I wish the editor had pulled out his/her red pen and cut this book in half - just get rid of all of the superfluous descriptions, and it may have a chance. If you're looking for an entertaining read, please skip this one and try the Midnight Louie series (Carole Nelson Douglas). You'll be better off for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing but the Author is Talented","review":"I was disappointed in this novel for several reasons. One is that it's more like science fiction or fantasy than a mystery. I found the transformations described somewhat awkward and the plot mundane. While this is certainly a talented writer, I was less fascinated by the cats in the story than I was simply creeped out by them. It reminded me somewhat of the Val Lewton film, \\"Cat People,\\" which still holds up as a \\"cat horror\\" story. At times I found it disturbing despite failed attempts at humor, desired to set the thing aside, and interact in a healthy way with my own feline friends. I will definitely not continue to follow the series. I have a house full of cats who I love and cherish. The cats in this book are something else altogether. I'm not sure what."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive unrealistic boredom","review":"Cat on the Edge, by Shirley Rousseau Murphy has one thing going for it. It is truly from the cat's point of view. This book is intended to be fantasy and has no basis of realism. It is extremely repetitive and has little or no action. If you are a Lilian Jackson Braun, Rita Mae Brown or Garrison Allen fan, I believe you will find this book uninteresting and sadly lacking what the others have."},{"rating":"1","title":"disturbing","review":"I wondered why the first books by Shirley Rousseau Murphy were not available in my library until I read them. There is TMI (too much information) about the predatory side of cats, and it does not contribute to the story. I actually was not able to read all of her books because I found them disturbing, something that has never happened before. I can usually read anything, and can usually handle supernatural elements, but as a vegetarian, I found Shirley Rousseau Murphy's early books really difficult to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I am a cat owner and I think all cat owners and others would definitely enjoy this.

You might have to be a cat lover to appreciate all the little idiosyncrises in this story. It was amusing and yet truly a mystery story also. Will read more of these books by Shirley Rousseau Murphy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I quit reading","review":"I love cats, so the premise that a cat became human-like grabbed me. However, this cat story was not what I was expecting. Obviously, Joe's owner hasn't heard about neutering and neither, apparently, have the other pet owners in that town. Joe's antics as far as I read weren't cute or even very noble. If you want stories with animals that can understand humans, read Susan Wittig Albert's stories beginning with The Tale of Hilltop Farm based on Beatrix Potter's life. The animals in her story are funny, brave, and lovable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joe Grey amazing cat!","review":"Love cats? Or even just like them a bit ?

Good read and I will get others in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy read","review":"As a cat owner, ok the cat owns me, but who would have it any other way.

Specially about myths and mythology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vita: Confusion in writing","review":"If one enjoys disconnected dialogue, space and time jumping with widely dispersed segments of Vita's history, and lack of coherent threads to tie the \\"story lines\\" together: then this is for you. Otherwise, the writing is highly disjunctive and hard to follow, with characters and history sliding in and out in confusion (one needs a dance card to keep track of who's on stage and what era they represent). Perhaps if one read the book in the original Italian it would make better sense but I double it. At the end can any one answer the who, where, and what becomes of Vita? Give it a pass unless you like illustrations of less than meritorious writing ploys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of \\"Vita\\"","review":"I am very disappointed in this book. I am of Italian ancestry and my family lived in NY when they first arrived from Italy. I was anticipating a more rivieting story. Im having a hard time getting through it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books","review":"This book caught my eye in a Roman bookstore because of its name. I was named Vita after my grandmother whom I have never met. It is an old name, so the Italians tell me, a name with meaning like Vittoria or Valentina. When I saw the book on display, I bought it mostly out of curiosity.My Italian is rusty and totally americanized so it took a long time to read this novel. When I finished it, I immediately tried to contact Melania Mazzucco to suggest that she have it translated to English. I was very happy to find out from a friend that the English version was now available. I want my family to read it. I think every Italian-American should read it.It was romantic and heroic and I knew that there was truth in it because of the stories handed down in my family. Everyone's history can be a novel, but to be a novel and true is rewarding it a very deep way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not A Bad Movie At All","review":"For a non-Hollywood movie, this Indie film is pretty darn good. The story is fun and easy to follow, the characters are lovable, and it's actually very true in its portrayal of the cultural differences between Americans and Japanese. The director also mentioned in an interview that the budget for the movie was very, very small, which meant that the actors in the movie were cast for their love of the characters and not for the paycheck.All-in-all, I'd say that this is a great movie with a lovable plot and amazing actors portraying deep, rich characters. Definitely a must-see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Witty movie, Meant to put 5 stars, whoops!","review":"This movie was great.

It helps identify the obstacles to leaving an abusive relationship and how likely it is that the relationship can be changed. I particularly liked it's attitude of, \\"One size does NOT fit all\\" and the empahasis on tailoring the intervention to the specifics of the case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent and matter-of-fact;","review":"I hesitated to read this book because I thought that since I had been out of my abusive relationship for over a year, it wouldn't be of much practical use to me. I was so wrong. The patterns of emotional abuse were alive and doing quite well even with a physical separation of 500 miles. This book is so valuable and I feel that I owe a great debt of gratitude to the authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"enlightening","review":"Jacobsen and Gottman differentiate patterns of violence, different types of violent men as discerned by heart rate no less, and give a great overview of the field that is very accessible. The cobra and pit bull metaphors are really, really useful. I mentally transferred them to male patterned anger that is not physically violent as well as violent: the manipulative cobra vs. the desperate pit bull.Most violent acts are committed by men, and this book gives a great non pejorative, fact based approach that shows the authors have thoroughly reviewed the literature.The book is a bit thick and hackneyed regarding advice for women exiting these relationships; they would do well to look closely at traumatic bonding in a future research study.This book is accessible for a lay reader and a good reference for professionals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book To Improve Your Marriage","review":"My wife and I read this book after we were married and it has invaluable insights into building a strong marriage based on God.

In this book, Laurel Shadrach, the daughter of a preacher, tries to live for God, but it 's not easy because the guy she is dating wants to go too far and she doesn't want to lose him. She also faces other problems such as being betrayed by her best friend and dealing with a broken ankle.

It's the Stevie Wonder song -- played straight -- and there's absolutely no reason for its existence.If you have every other 4hero record and you play them repeatedly, buy this.

Otherwise, this is absolutely not worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another French coming of age story","review":"I love a lot of Malle's films but this isn't one of them. I guess if you find a really awkward, ugly, rude, kid who does everything he can to be obnoxious, charming, then you'll love this movie. We first meet Laurent begging money for the wounded soldiers in Indochina, but keeping the money for himself, then ripping off a record store, then trying to imitate his older brothers who are way ahead of him in crass behavior. Let's see what mischief they can conjure up--eating communion wafers is too below him, save that for his fellow altar boy, drinking, smoking, having sex, stealing from their parents, being rude to the servant, the father and everyone else....If all of this strikes you as terribly charming...then this is your film. Oh yeah, a pedophile priest is in it, too.Top it off with incest and there you have it. In the last scene everyone has a good laugh. Tres charmant, non? Non!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If Mozart had been a film maker, he would have made films like this","review":"One of the most delightful films ever made, this is a feast of fluid, elegant filmmaking. The erotic, rebellious content thus is elevated to something sacred-- think of Titian's painting of Ariadne and Bacchus, or the courting of Papageno and Papagena in The Magic Flute. In Malle's hands, life is too exquisite to be wasted on the squeamish, on the people with small souls. This is an inspired, civilized, and absolutely moral film, on a par with Bunuel's The Milky Way and Renoir's Rules of the Game. Nobody who hasn't seen this film should ever be allowed to vote!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not recommend","review":"Not a very good product for the price, little ventilation and not good protection around the drive, flimsy circuit board."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUSABESU KAKUTO RANMA NIBUN NO ICHI!!","review":"Ranma 1/2 never looked better. The transition to DVD is now at its fullest. The original video masters from KITTY TV were used, ensuring the highest animation quality possible. However it is not perfect. There is some level of graininess, and line inconsistency, also their is some color bleeding, especially in the intro.But, the consistency of the animation, far makes up for this. Unlike the first boxed set, the animation is high quality on every single episode. The outlining is crisp and the colors are vivid and distinct. I've never seen Ranma 1/2 look so good.This is a must buy for all Ranma 1/2 fans. The pacing of the story has quickened in the second season. Takahashi's characters are now fully developed. And my look how they shine! You'll love it. And you'll be begging to see the next season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Parts... Not worse!!!!","review":"Yes. This second season brings more: more dvds, more chapters, more fun, more answers!!!. Here new characters are brought in and the quality of the drawings gots better. The martial arts stuff also gets improved, showing one the invincible techniques of Ranma!. This one cames without censure (just like the first season) and is packed with more adventures and sets of several chapters that complete a full story. I warn you, if you start watching one, you will end up finishing one or two complete dvds. Same as the first season, comes in english and japanese with subtitles (japanese in mono). If you have no Ranma at all, go get the first season, then come back and get this one. If you are in a hurry, get both!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking for good laughs buy this!","review":"if you're looking for good laughs you should by the Ranma1/2 Series one of the funniest shows in tokyo.this was the 1st ranma season boxset i bought.

It worked well at first and the little latch to hold the valve open was a plus, but the valve started leaking after one use. My attempts to get it to stop leaking didn't work, and it just got worse. Spraying became a soaking mess, so I threw it in the trash. I see that others have had better experiences with it. Perhaps its a quality control issue with Solo sprayers, but I won't buy the plastic kind again.Subsequently I purchased a \\"Chapin\\" brand metal shut-off valve, wand and nozzle from Amazon, which is working great and doesn't leak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great replacement for original","review":"I bought this to replace a broken wand on my NorthStar sprayer from Northern Tool.

However, I did not find the product satisfactory. First off - it's very difficult to place the Ipod into the device. It requires the Ipod be placed in a rubberized sleeve and forced into a narrow slot. It is very difficult to properly connect it or remove it when done.

In this album she really shows why she's the 'Princess' of the Japanese rock ballad. The first 2 tracks 'Netsu' and 'Karu no rakugaki' lead one into the other with a touching blend of rock riffs, Aiko's own unique vocals and a gradual build up of musical colour. The other tracks deliver just as much as the first two with Aiko's addictive, eclectic sound lending itself to a fine album. The variety of music styles on this and all of her albums show just how versatile she is as a musician. Sadly the normal CD version lacks some of the life of the re-released Super Audio CD version (the version to get if you have an SACD player)."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was a descent translation but the details where skewed.","review":"Carol Larrington's translation of the Elder Edda was good if you just want to read the storys but chances are if thats all you wanted from it you would buy something a little more modern. This copy translated all the names so that it was very hard to read and it also destroyed all the formatting I was sorly disapointed. for example instead of calling one of the charcters Gandalf like I would have liked it named him wind-elf."},{"rating":"1","title":"An horribly inaccurate translation","review":"While it's popular to criticise the Hollander translation of The Poetic Edda for being more poetic than accurate, compared to Larrington's version, his is nearly ideal.I've been studying eddic poetry for years, both in the original and in translation, and recently picked up a copy of this book because several friends insisted it is more accessible and easily read. I immediately saw why it is often suggested as an alternative to the archaic language sometimes used by Hollander, but simultaneously horrified. Of course, no translation will ever convey the full nuances of a text, but I found numerous places where Larrington either lost all subtext to a passage, or was simply inaccurate.I would only recommend this translation for comparison to others, such as Hollander, Bellows or even Thorpe. The work simply does not stand on its own as a trustworthy edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Readable and Useful Edition","review":"This is a very nice, easily used, and inexpensive edition of The Poetic Edda. One of the primary sources for Norse mythology, the Poetic Edda is an Icelandic compilation of Old Norse poetry. Much is only fragments of longer works and due to loss of other texts, parts are obscure. All of this came to us through a single manuscript thought to be compiled by one unknown scholar. Whoever this individual was, we owe him (as he probably was) a debt of gratitude for this collection of often arresting and consistently interesting poetry. Recounting of myth, collections of wise saying, and parts of the major myth cycle involving Sigurd, Fafnir, and the Volsungs, are all contained in the Poetic Edda. While only a scholar with some sophistication in the language can know for sure, the translations struck me as powerful and readable. The introduction, footnotes, glossary, and bibliogrpahy are all useful. A very enjoyable adn readable volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Net System","review":"Overall a good net system -- easy to set up, adjustable height levels, comes with carrying bag, gives decent play off of the net, sturdy when set up. Gave it 4/5 because the stakes on the border lines do not work real well in sand, but simply buying some longer stakes would easily fix it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Love it! Very quick and easy to set up. Handles on the guy line system make it so simple. Easy to adjust net height ... we use the lowest for our kids. Stakes are definitely long enough for grass/dirt ... can't speak for sand though. We haven't had it long, but the quality seems very high and makes it worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Net System","review":"I purchased this recently from Amazon and couldn't be happier about the purchase. I've used the net several times and found it very convenient to set up: unravel net, click-adjust legs to one of three heights, pound in stakes, pull guylines taught by simple use of a handle, and set the boundary. Very, very simple, especially when compared to the cheapo discount store variety of net systems. I've purchased several of those over the years, and found them all to be a royal pain to set up. With the Spectrum Classic, it's easy, and I know I've purchased the last system I'll need for the next 15 years or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I ordered...","review":"I ordered the Park & Sun TS-CL Classic Volleyball Set and actually got something similar to the spetrum 2000. The net that is advertized is one of the best net sets on the market which is why I chose it. I wanted the advertized net because the guides to hold up the poles have handles instead of metal rings and are easier to manipulate. I thought the price was too good to be true and I was right. It was in fact the set with guides with metal rings. Deceptive. I could have bought this net at a lower price if it was indeed what I had wanted. Please be careful when choosing this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Set","review":"If you are sick of screwing around with cheap sets that break, step it up and get this. it sets up fast and it great for tournaments or just playing. Very light and portable and nice to play with on grass. It is regulation size so you need a big area- you can't just set it up in your little yard. You need regulation area to play in. Great for serious players too. I used to do tournaments and this is what they used back then and probably use now. Nice and tight net."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but...","review":"Everything is excellent about the system, except that the stakes are very cheap and I expect the heads to be knocked off when I am hammering them into the ground...You pay a premium for the handles but they slip a little everytime the net is struck which means the net begins to sag in the middle. Would have liked a choice of colors. Would be nice if the bag would also easily fit the ball as well. It does fit, but you have to really stress the zipper to get it to fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality product","review":"Overall pleased with this volleyball net. Easy set up and take down, and seems to be a good quality product that will provide lots of use on grass. Only complaint is that we ordered a blue net and received a white net. It appears to be an issue with the manufacturer (not Amazon), as the original box was in fact labeled as containing a blue net, but with the wrong color net packaged inside."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Brothers have worked it out.","review":"Here's the thing: Everything the ChemBros do is so chock full of confidence that they can't help but lead the pack.

It is clearly and simply written, but is not long. It covers all the parts of the complete neurological exam (cognition, language, cranial nerves, motor function, reflexes, sensation, coordination, and gait). Illustrations are sketches in black and white.I do not think any other book in this price range gives such a detailed overview of the neuro exam.I gave this book 4 stars for the following (nitpicky) reasons:1. I would have preferred if the book were organized according to the traditional order of the neuro exam, i.e. start w/ the mental status exam, not finish w/ it!2. The section on aphasias does not include transcortical aphasias!3. The only apraxia mentioned is gait apraxia!4. Not enough eponyms! No mention of Babinski's platysma sign (although the section on the facial nerve does mention the platysma...a nice touch), the Stransky sign, or the Jendrassik maneuver!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kate and Leopold","review":"My friend and I just went to see Kate and Leopold. CUTE MOVIE! I had never heard of Hugh Jackman, but I feel he will become a huge star with Meg Ryan as his co-star. After doing a net search and asking the question, \\"Who is Hugh Jackman?\\", I found out other movies he had been in. I have already been to the movie store to rent \\"Swordfish\\". Nothing against Meg Ryan, but Hugh Jackman made the movie.It was kind of corny in the sense it involved time travel. However, for a truly enjoyable movie without the intense action or plot, it is a winner!It was a definate chick flick, but I liked it!I would buy the video!"},{"rating":"2","title":"4Star cute movie","review":"I'm a big fan of 18 and 19th century movies and history.This movie is cute, and funny and all the actors played there characters well.I would recommend this to anyone who is found of a sappy, love drama.I would have to add that it needed a little more ending for me for the couple and what happened to her brother and ex boyfriend/neighbor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever and fun","review":"This is actually a second purchase... Our first DVD was getting stuck in the opening credits (after a zillion viewings...) Had to replace it... It's challenging when you don't have one of your favorite movies working at top speed...

Good movie to see after a hard day of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"You won't have to work hard to understand it","review":"Okay, so it isn't James Joyce. It IS an easy to watch, fun fantasy, chick-flick, if you will... Hugh Jackman makes it worth your time just because he is delicious. Meg Ryan is just as we remember her from You've Got Mail, same facial expressions and general demeanor, which is not bad, just predictable. Basic plot can be reduced to everyone's fantasy of jumping in the old time machine to go back (or forward) to someone else's era for awhile to check it out. You won't be disgusted, repulsed, or frightened by this film, because it is clean, clean, clean. Anybody, down to your innocent seven-year-old sister, will go away with something to smile about. And in these times of terrorists and serial killers, don't we ALL need a bit of that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A So-So Movie with a Cute Guy","review":"I was really anxious to see this movie because it looked funny and romantic. Unfortunately, I was dismayed. Meg Ryan is playing the SAME ROLE AGAIN. She is incredibly great in \\"When Harry Met Sally\\", but in this role she is too old, too whiny, and too stupid for words. At times, I wanted to tell her to get a grip and grow up. Hugh Jackman was great and I loved the actor who played Kate's brother. He was actually funny. The character who was Kate's ex-boyfriend was just mean and not very humorous. Beyond that, there is not too much to say ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT EVEN A GOOD DATE FLICK- BORING","review":"Went with a few other late 20's early 30's couples and we all found it boring. Yes it is a cute romantic typical date flick. But it just goes on and on and despite a couple of good lines is generally a weak flick. I usually rate movies 4 ways. Worth $8.50, worth a matinee, good rental, and a waste of $4. This one is a good rental. Don't waste the big bucks at the theater."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute Romantic Comedy","review":"2 1/2 stars to this light-weight comedy/romance. It is harmless enough, and is cute, but there is little new material here. Meg Ryan ignores the man from the past and is too busy to see him for who he really is until her eyes are magically opened to his true nature as her dream guy. Cut plot, and a decent date movie, but it won't make anyone's top 10 list in any category."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Romance Ever!!!","review":"This is honestly the worst romance and attempt to comedy ever. Meg Ryan is the most unfitting for her role, I mean only Hugh Jackman was the most decent actor in this movie who made me give this movie a one star because he actually lived the role; everyone else, big thumbs down!!! This movie also is historically inaccurate; the Duke of Albany lived in England, not NYC; and whoever head of a Duke living in the US which is not a British colony anymore in 1876; and the time is set to 1876, whoever heard of Dukes living here in the post-civil war (reconstruction) era! Queen Victoria was this person's mother who accually outlived him! Duhh! Do some research James Mangold! Euckkkkkk! Horrible movie...Do not waste your time and money as I have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie worth watching","review":"A very good romantic comedy, Kate & Leopold, brings to the screen the story of a 19th century down-on-his-luck English nobleman who travels to NY in search of an American bride who can help him pay his debts. Things get a bit complicated when on the night of his engagement he enters a portal and ends up in up modern NY...Hugh Jackman, Meg Ryan, Liev Schreiber, Breckin Meyer, and the rest of this AMAZING cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least! All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs.The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all very good!Though not a masterpiece like Sleepless in Seattle or Notting Hill, or even French Kiss, Kate & Leopold is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"Although this movie is sadly predictable, and the stars fail to shine, this movie still manages to be enjoyable. I really don't understand how or why, but it does. The time traveling part of the storyline is about the same caliber as that which is found in the Martin Lawrence film \\"Black Knight.\\"I wasn't overly impressed with Meg Ryan's role. I feel her performance was more developed and appeared less scripted in films such as \\"Sleepless in Seattle\\" or \\"You've got Mail.\\" Hugh Jackman did give a fairly decent performance, and definitely carried the film. However, I believe both stars fell victims to being confined to an underdeveloped script.Overall, this is a decent romantic comedy. I would recommend renting this movie, but definitely not buying it. You will want to watch this movie once or twice, but that will probably be about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meg Ryan - Ugh","review":"I can't recall any movie of Meg Ryan's where I disliked her character as much as in this movie. She is irritating and looks like hell to boot. Hugh Jackman is charming as Leopold but I kept thinking, \\"Why are you wasting your time on this not very interesting dingbat\\"?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ryan was flat and colorless.","review":"I'm really sorry to be the lone voice of dislike, here, but this movie had no color. It was almost like Ryan was saying, \\"The studio is making me do another one of these stupid romantic comedies.\\" She obviously didn't want to be tHere, whcih made it really hard for the audience to enjoy viewing her performance. Because she was so colorless, negative, and almost bored with her performance, there was really no chemistry between her and Jackman. He did a wonderful job, as did Schribner as her nutty ex-boyfriend. even her brother lit up the screen. Unfortuately, chemistry is the main ingredient in any romanitc comedy, and this one had no fizzle at all. I could have walked out halfway through, and never missed a thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jackman is delightful, Ryan is not","review":"This movie pairs Hugh Jackman at his most charming with Meg Ryan at (unfortunately) her most annoying -- he plays a delightful and charismatic nineteenth-century English nobleman while she plays a modern-day working woman who's meant to be spunky and independent but who comes across mainly as bad-tempered and frenetic. Plus, she has a truly awful haircut. They don't have very good on-screen chemistry, and the plot of the movie doesn't have much originality -- if you're a fan of time-travel romance, you've likely found this kind of story done much better elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star-crossed lovers with a glitch","review":"Meg Ryan and Hugh Jackman play the starring roles in this time travel flick filled with romance, drama, and comedy. Breckin Meyer (Charles) plays Ryan's fun loving brother with a soft heart and quick wit. Meyer adds a jester like quality to the movie that will have the whole family laughing.Kate a modern day woman with a high-ranking job in advertising is about to meet a man from the 19th century. Leopold arrives via a time portal to nowadays New York City, and the fun that ensues as he learns the ways of the future are just the beginning.This is a fun movie for the whole family, one you can bring home to the kids and enjoy as a family.

Eventually Kate begins to realize that the handsome, charming, British aristocrat just may be a gentleman out of time. But love really is a function of timing and Kate must choose between 21st century career versus 19th century true love in New York.

I'm not a Meg Ryan fan, but I quite like Hugh Jackman, so decided to give it a chance. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I really enjoyed this movie. I thought it was quite funny and I absolutely loved Jackman's portrayal of the Duke.

I was pleasantly surprised. The entire ensemble works well together, the film has many moments of charm and humor, and (despite a few logical leaps of faith) it doesn't insult one's intelligence. This isn't deep, it isn't \\"art,\\" and it's not going to win any Oscars. But you're not going to feel like you wasted your $8.50, either. (And yes, Hugh is great. But what he REALLY needs is a Gladiator-type role to break out -- he was BORN to play hunky, conflicted epic heroes.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy to have in my collection","review":"I'm very happy to own this movie.

The story line comes straight from a romance novel, time traveler meets modern day woman who steals his heart. It's easy to watch and safe for the whole family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming, But Don't Analyze It","review":"There are many errors with this film. The time travel concept is not very well explained. One reviewer pointed out the La Boheme error, there are several others (including the whole elevator bit). But why nit-pick this movie, which is touching and cute? It is a thoroughly enjoyable romantic comedy that touches the heart without going for the tears. I do agree with those about Meg Ryan being past the cute ingenue stage, but I am glad they didn't cast some young, sexy bombshell for what was supposed to be a woman who has already established herself in an executive role. Maybe Kate Hudson was busy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Hugh Jackman","review":"Saw the movie today and loved it. Hugh Jackman was wonderfully charming and romantic. Great love story. Highly recomend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspend Belief and Enjoy !...","review":"I had been told that to truly enjoy this romantic comedy, I needed to suspend belief, not think about time travel as a reality, and then just sit back and be entertained.I followed this good advice and really liked this movie for what it was....light, bright, and entertaining with no deep underlying message or dark side. Lots of laughs, some pratfalls, and an enjoyable couple of hours.Meg Ryan played her usual light comedy role with presence and her effervescent charm. Hugh Jackman was marvelous in his depiction of a chivalrous 19th century nobleman set adrift on the unfamiliar terrain of today's New York City. A good supporting cast is in place as well. When the Ryan and Jackman characters meet, sparks fly and romance begins."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely watch!","review":"Absolutely adore this movie!I discovered this because I love Hugh Jackman and wanted to see a romantic comedy with him and I fell in love with it!I was skeptical because the description sounded dumb but it was very well done. Jackman plays the part perfectly and is adorable in it!Meg Ryan also plays the other lead very well.I am definitely going to buy it.I don't even typically like romantic comedies and I loved this movie! So I definitely recommend it, especially if you like Hugh Jackman ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very cute love-story","review":"Hugh's performance was great, he was so believable playing a man out of time. Meg Ryan, unfortunately, plays Kate is if she herself is annoyed she plays the same character time and time again. Kate is pessimistic and boring, but Leopold more than makes up for her drabness. Overall, a cute love story with the time-travelling aspect making it unique."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining Movie","review":"Good job mixing the old with the new, even if like a fairytale, with great acting by both Ryan and Jackman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are we sick enough of Ryan's shtick already?","review":"Once again Meg Ryan does her \\"ain't I the cutest thing?\\" bit in another boring film that isn't worth the price of a small Coke, not to mention the price of a movie rental!! Too bad there isn't a negative star rating. Barf! Barf! Barf! A great argument for why American society and culture just keeps getting dumber and dumber (but then, there are people who think Adam Sandler is funny, too, aren't there?)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lighten up with Kate and Leo","review":"As long as you're not an uptight person as some other reviewers seem to be, you'll like this movie. We're not all professional film critics - although this movie did receive two thumbs up - so the rest of us who just watch a movie for entertainment purposes will enjoy Kate and Leopold. Not an oscar winner by any means, but still a cute romantic comedy worth seeing. It is entertaining and I believe that is the purpose of watching a movie - to be entertained by it, not pick it to pieces and over analyze it. Lighten up with Kate and Leopold and just enjoy the film! I would buy this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Have always been a Meg Ryan fan, but gave up on this one.The film has a great beginning, but after a while, the feeling is that it is too light and cute -- I lost interest in the characters, and didn't even bother to see the film to the end. (And this, from a Meg Ryan fan!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Youself a Favor ......","review":"If you get the opportunity to view this film, do yourself a favor and jump off a cliff instead .... you'll get more out of it. How an up and coming actor like Hugh Jackman could associate himself with this garbage is beyond me, but I'm betting his manager got fired.Meg Ryan in yet another attempt to rekindle the magic from her previous film You've Got Mail in Seattle while You were Sleepless. Yes I know those were two films, but I prefer to call them one becuase they were the same bunch of ...Garbage, garbage, garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kate and Leopold","review":"This was one of the best romantic comedies that I've seen in a long. Ladies, if you're looking for a movie to curl up and stay at home with, well this is it. The movie is predictable in the sense that the boy meets girl, boy gets girl, boy loses girl, girl gets her man on the end. However, from the beginning to the end its a really good movie. I was not disappointed when I left the movie theater. I can hardly wait until its released on video on June 11."},{"rating":"1","title":"They didn't match","review":"Hollywood ending doesn't seem to fit this story.Kate divoted for winning in a competition of ads for something like substitute for butter which tastes like soap.Leopold helped her succeed this project, alghough this is against the way he's believing.He shoulnd have aginst this with his belief and shouldn't have reconciled Kate.She doesn't change, she's been still selfish.She eventually picked Leo and gave up getting promotion and her current worldIf she would have done this, She haven't needed to pull off and the assignment of the soap butter's ads should be failed.In Leo's world, Kate must keep being selfish, I guess.It could encourage Leo's man who is an aged inventor invent equipments she knows and used to use.Leo was so gourgeous, Kate's brother was nice and cute.JJ seems pitty but soon he finds an another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I adore this movie!","review":"This movie does have elements of many genres, including science fiction, romance, and comedy, and is broad enough to be appealing to viewers of both genders. In fact, I think some of the male-interaction scenes, of which there are many, are perhaps more interesting to the men than the women. If not interesting, then at least educational: men, pay attention! There are some great old-school clues in here for wowing your women. As for the women, there's Hugh Jackman, so what else do you need? :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chivalrous Romance","review":"Kate and Leopold is the tale of a duke who has never been in love and, by accident, finds his true love in the future. While the plot could have allowed for a bit more character development, the actors all do a wonderful job in their roles. Hugh Jackman is especially charming in his portrayal of the displaced duke. This movie has a happy ending, but it cries out for a sequel. I would really like to see how Kate adjusts to a time without modern conveniences and how Leopold handles their financial problems, now that a rich wife is out of the question. (I believe the film hints that he becomes an inventor.) Kate's brother and ex-boyfriend could travel backward to join them in some plot twist or other -- possibly to save one of Kate's children from danger. If handled properly, the sequel could be even better than the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Major New Star -- Hugh Jackman","review":"until I saw Jackman as LEOPOLD and the wheels started to turn. I haven't been this excited about a new star since Sean Connery. (Yes, I'm that old.)...Regarding KATE & LEOPOLD (and I speak as one who has loved Meg Ryan movies in the past, especially FRENCH KISS, YOU'VE GOT MAIL, and CITY OF ANGELS, which has a similar fantasy element about love overcoming obstacles and about making leaps of faith)I'll give her the benefit of the doubt. But she seems so sad (which fits her character)...KATE & LEOPOLD often reminds me of EVER AFTER --only it's a Duke instead of a Prince being forced into a loveless marriage, looking for a woman of intelligence and independence. The Prince finds her among the common people. The Duke finds Kate in the future.Like the characters Kate and Leopold, we are asked by this movie to suspend disbelief and to make a leap of faith. I find that I can. The haunting STING song UNTIL is a great bonus."},{"rating":"2","title":"my favorite","review":"This is my favorite romantic movie of all times. Actually it is from this movie I found out who Hugh Jackman is. Never heard of him before. (I know, shame on me). I know it is a modern movie in a modern setting but there is something about it that makes me miss the olden times and the way how men used to be, so respectful, gentle and considerate. After watching this move, modern guys just don't appeal in the same way. Eeeh, I fell in love with Leopold. It's very light hearted movie that I can watch over and over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love over the centuries!!","review":"Kate & Leopold is a wonderful romantic-comedy movie. When Kate's ex-boyfriend, Stuart, who is living upstairs of her flat found a crack in time and travel to 1876. There he followed the peniless Duke of Albany called Leopold who is being pushed by his uncle to marry a rich woman.But things goes wrong and Leopold found himself in 21th century! There he mets Kate and fall in love with her at first sight. Kate don't belive Stuart when he says Leopold is coming from past but she got effected by the charm, intelligence and kidness of this misterious guy called Leopold. Well you have to watch the movie if 2 centuries difference can hinder Kate and Leopold's love!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting twist on your typical romance!","review":"Now I must admit...this movie was nothing exceptional. There were no high tech special effects, deep plotline, guns, sex like your typical \\"top\\" movies out there today.On the contrary, this movie is very simple. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure it out. An unexpected couple..overcome the odds (and in this case, time), fall in love, and live happily ever after.Yes, the whole time twist at times was incredibly corny, but it still gives this movie a touch of something unfamiliar to today's audience. (Perhaps that it doesn't take place in an American high school?)Meg Ryan and Hugh Jackman are sweet. They fit their roles quite well, and seem to have thoroughly enjoyed this film.Simply stated, this movie was cute. Nothing exceptional, but surely, something at least worth renting a few times. It's a very good date movie, certainly. I imagine watching this movie cuddled up with a loved one by a fire...ahhh....l'amour. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunningly enjoyable romantic comedy","review":"Much to my surprise, this personable time travel romance is the hidden gem of the holiday season. Of course, the plot - handsome 19th century duke travels to the 20th century where he meets driven but unfulfilled career woman - does require a certain suspension of disbelief. If you can accept the premise, the rest of the story is predictable but charmingly executed. The dialoque is witty and clever, and the acting is first-rate. Hugh Jackman is yummy as the duke, and Meg Ryan is Meg Ryan; the supporting cast is terrific. The writers have wisely mixed comedic and romantic scenes. My only reservation is the internal inconsistencies and improbabilities - I was particularly distracted by the idea that a 19th century duke would have the faintest idea of how to cook dinner. Extra credit for most entertaining use of a \\"sign here\\" sticker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Meg Ryan!","review":"This movie was both romantic and comical. Hugh Jackman was quite convincing as a Duke from the 1800s. He was as handsome and charming as Meg Ryan was witty and cute. Meg Ryan was in true form in this movie including \\"Meg Ryan's\\" quirky smiles and frowns. Her character is lovably as usual. If you enjoyed You've Got Mail, you'll enjoy Meg in this one as well. However, beware...it IS a \\"fairy tale\\" with a modern twist. For us hopeless romantics, it is a win!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leopold's La Boheme","review":"How did Leopold come to know so much about Puccini's La Boheme which was finished in 1896 and premiered in 1900 when he time-traveled straight from 1876 to the present? This nagging question ruined my enjoyment of the chick flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC! HILARIOUS! ROMANTIC! WATCH THIS MOVIE NOW!","review":"I rented this movie, because my mom wanted to watch it and plus I think Hugh Jackman is a good actor, as is Meg Ryan, and I like romantic comedies, so it all went together. I didn't think it was going to be superbly hilarious and so so romantic. But the thing that will turn girls away (or women) from this movie is the time travel subplot that is played throughout the movie. But, it didn't interfere alot with the plot. It's just dealt with in the beginning and the end. Just watch this movie, if you like good humor, great acting, sappy romance, and lots of great filmmaking. Plus, if you want, look for the WTC towers, because this movie was made in NY before 9/11 so they might be in there, I didn't have time to check.

At a time when character and integrity are frequently poo-poo'd as irrelevant by Hollywood, this is a welcome breath of fresh air."},{"rating":"2","title":"This light hearted love story is worth seeing","review":"\\"Kate and Leopold\\" is not a masterpiece, but gets the job done. A story about lovers meeting across time is not particularly original. However, this film works because of the chemistry between Hugh Jackman and Meg Ryan. They hold it together in spite of its obvious flaws. Liev Schreiber as the bumbling time traveler who brings them together gives a solid performance.My advice is not too take the movie too seriously, but simply enjoy it for what it is. It is unapologetically escapist entertainment, and doesn't pretend to offer any answers to the existential mysteries of the universe. Does it deserve any Academy Ward nominations? No, but it will likely bring a warm smile to your face. \\"Kate and Leopold\\" is a good way for you and your significant other to enjoy an evening. It deserves four stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kate Ruined This For Me","review":"Leopold is a man from the past who follows someone into a time warp and pops out in current day New York. He meets Kate, a modern day career woman, and the two fall in love. Will she follow him back to his own time? Hmm, bet you can't guess.The storyline was simple and really could have worked if Kate had been more likeable. Hugh Jackman played Leopold well, really making his character come alive, but I just didn't understand why he would fall for such a plain-looking, gruff woman. There wasn't any chemistry between the two and I couldn't pinpoint the moment when the two fell in love (especially on Leopold's side). There were some good secondary characters, but the primary relationship (or lack thereof) made this movie a dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would have to say 2.50","review":"This was an OK movie. It was not bad by any means, but the film seemed to drag quite a bit and I thought that it could have ended sooner than it did.

It was a time travel movie after all. I enjoyed it, and realized it was special when before the director's cut there was a warning. The studio wanted to make sure that they didn't necessarily agree with the director.When the director explained his point of view about what we've lost, and how career woman might not be the best choice, I could see that it really went against the grain of what the Machine would want us to believe.

You don't really even need to see the movie. You pretty much know the beginning from the end from the title.A new york woman gets mixed up with a guy from earlier in time. Like 200 years earlier. He doesn't know really what is going on and she thinks he is kinda wierd. He shows some old time shivelry by treating her like a lady and she falls in love.But it wouldn't be a true love story if there wasn't a fight and separation. So he goes back to his time and then she realizes what she lost, travels back and they live happily ever after.Same old story, different scenery. If you want to see this movie just rent a film with previews for this show on it. You will see all you need to from that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Im so sorry","review":"Im sorry to say But i saw this movie on my 13th birthday with a girlyfriend of mine and my Big sis and My mom.

I won't dwell on all of the particulars that make the time-travel possible; they are really secondary to the plot. However, what is really wonderful is the juxtaposition of modern mores and \\"old-fashioned\\" social behaviors as Leopold learns to maneuver in the present day.

This guy has no apparent job, and yet he can afford to furnish a 12 room aparment with a river view in NYC? What does he have rent control from the 20's? Why is it in every New York movie, any person central to the film has a beautifully decorated apartment with a view of a river. The only poor people ever seen are either there to provide that bit of squalor to make the film seem dark or to show the nobility of poverty. K & L is a typical meet cute film set in the fantasy land of the beautiful people...pity life is not like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK romantic comedy only has Jackman holding it together","review":"Duke Leopold, played by Hugh Jackman (Van Helsing, X-Men Movies) gets sucked from his century to the present century 2001 because Stuart, Liev Schreiber (The Scream Triology, Manchurian Candidate 2004) found this time portal and Jackman was sent back with him. So, Leopold gets an eye full as he sees the future and all the surroundings (tvs, video cameras, walking the dog and so forth). Enter Stuart's Ex-Girlfriend Kate, played by Meg Ryan (In The Cut, Against The Ropes) who lives below him, she falls in love with Leopold and so forth. OK romantic comedy only has Jackman holding it up together and Breckin Meyer (Garfield, Road Trip) who is amusing as Kate's Actor Brother Charlie. Also starring Natasha Lyonne (Blade Trinity, Americn Pie 1 and 2) and Bradley Whitford (Tv's The West Wing, Billy Madison).

It must be experienced to be appreciated fully.As the previous reviewer noted, the information provided by amazon is woefully inaccurate and riddled with errors. More of it is wrong than is right. The film is set in the medieval Carpathians (NOT during the 19th century). It is in Ukrainian. And it has nothing to do with \\"harsh realities of Russian regional history\\"--the Carpathian region was not a part of the Russian empire until AFTER WWII, and it neither is nor ever was ethnically Russian.If you want accurate information about his film, I suggest you try imdb or Wikipedia instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paradjanov's Masterpiece","review":"This is a vividly visual and visceral film from the brilliantly unique and visionary director Paradjanov. It remains one-of-a-kind with its dazzling, colorful cinematography, hallucinatory and surreal, and its almost ethnographic depiction of ancient agrarian life and rituals in a community of the Carpathian mountains. It is a tragic love story and a story of the earth, which is like a forgotten folk song of intoxicating wonder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just beautiful!","review":"These are gorgeous shoes and the wedge is a very comfortable height.

Shooting Star is giving a dollar from every CD they sell to his foundation. If you like great hard Rock in the style of foreigner, survivor, Bon-Jovi then you'll love this album and several of their older releases. \\"Call it Love\\", and \\"Leap of Faith\\" are just fantastic pieces of song writing filled with emotion and delivered with nothing but talent and desire.

Susan Sarandon was excellent as Reggie Love, and Mark Renfro was absolutely believable as Mark Sway. Tommy Lee Jones was a regular hard-case who turns out alright in the end, and Mary Louise-Parker was terrific as Dianne Sway. I wanted to see this movie ever since it came out in 1994, but i was only 8 years old then. Whoever wrote the script did a fine job. Had I written the screenplay, though, I would have added several more scenes, just to flesh out Mark and Reggie a little more and provide closure to the murder case. The only part I didn't really like was when Reggie says that Foltrigg knows the Bible better than God Himself, which I feel is blasphemy. Other than that, terrific movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"My fave movie ever!","review":"I love this movie sooooo much cos John Grisham is my fave author and Brad Renfro is my fave actor! what a good combination!

And indeed, most of his books have become movies - and I haven't liked most of them any better than I liked that first book (well, except for The Pelican Brief).The Client, however, is really, really good. How could it NOT be, with Susan Sarandon and Tommy Lee Jones? It's a whirlwind thriller based on a secret held by an 11yo kid who knows the identity of a Mob murderer. The poor kid knows he's damned if he does and damned if he doesn't, and he's caught between 3 powerful forced: the federal prosecutor, the murdered, and his attorney (Sarandon), who risks not just her career but also her life when she goes right down to the wire for her client.Super flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies ever! From a thirteen year old viewer","review":"The Client is an excellent movie. I think that Susan Sarandon and Brad Renfro are definitley the best, he is such a great child actor! The brillitantly well done suspense story takes place in the South. A boy from a poor family witnesses a murder, and he gets into way more trouble than he could ever dream! The FBI is after him, and since he is scared to testify he gets a lawyer, played by Susan Sarandon to defend him. Mixed with suspense, drama, and moments of subtle laughter, this film will have you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My best DVD experience","review":"I just loved this film, it was the first I saw on my DVD.

This film is actually pretty high quality film to be honest. Susan Sarandon and Tommy Lee Jones offer their bassic quality performances, and the surroundings are high quality. But, the movie is lacking something that would make it truely likeable: SOUL. Without soul it turns out to be an academic boredom such as here. Now, it is just a straight filmation of the book, and there aren't much space to variate to make it watchable. You see, entertaining to read doesn't necessarily mean it's entertainig - or at least rewarding - to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"A packed interpretation","review":"I didn't really enjoy the screen version of John Grisham's \\"The Client\\"...If you're planning to see this movie, I suggest you read the book first so that you'll understand more of the characters because the movie missed a lot of important details from the book...Moreover, Susan Sarandon's character was not really the Reggie Love I had on my mind...Brad Renfro's character was tougher than the Mark Sway in the book,, I didn't even feel concern for him in the movie...My sister, who was watching it with me was always asking me questions like \\"What's she doing?\\", \\"What did he say?\\" \\"Why's she crying?\\"...The movie was indeed, very, very fast-paced."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Client","review":"Naturally all the actors are A1, so is the story, John Grisham's writing is awesome and fortunately none of the movies his books have been made into have to rely on sex scean to carry the stories.

The Orb media is two to three times more expensive (for now), but look at it this way--you could hold 20 Zip disks on one Orb disk! Add the fact that the Orb drive is as fast (or faster) than many for-real hard drives, and you've got a winner.My one complaint? The fiddly door on the front keeps dropping down, getting in the way, and makes swapping disks a bit of a hassle. A small price to pay, however, for 2.2 gigs of fast, removable storage.

However, like some other reviewers have mentioned, it is definitely not directed towards beginning arabic students. While it is true that most arabic texts do not have the vowel markings (fatha, damma, etc) they are necessary when first learning the word in the absence of hearing someone actually pronounce the word. My suggestion to the company if they want to exclude the vowels would be to include a cd. This book is very useful for everyday vocab however there is always the risk of mispronunciation with the lack of markings. I would recommend the Milet Bilingual Picture dictionary instead or in addition to this one as it has the vowel markings and is more useful for students of Arabic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for Beginning Arabic speakers","review":"For someone who has been studying Arabic for several years now, I find this book extremely useful. It presents indispensable everyday words that I don't think I would have learned as quickly without this book. And I love having an excuse to pore through a book with lots of pictures....they offer a unique visual tool that helps me remember the words even better. The fact that the vowels are absent is a good thing for the intermediate learner because you can test yourself by voweling them and check your work in the Hans Wehr. One caution for the beginning Arabic speaker...if you don't have a good grasp of Arabic grammar and can't recognize when the authors are using the Arabic term as an imperative, present tense, noun, adjective, etc. and don't understand how to change from their tense to the tense you want for speaking or writing, you'll probably be saying a lot of things wrong.

I was surprised to see one of my favorite comedian Carlos Mencia and the notable actor John Saxon. The cardboard acting in this film is unforgivable. The writing and direction of film is like reading a bad comic strip. Nancy O'Dell trying to play an evil villainess was too ridiculous. Obviously, she was having too much fun on the set to take on a serious role. When a film does not do well in the theaters and goes to video rather quickly, that should tell you something about the film.I do not know why this film is rated \\"R\\". There is no frontal nudity nor sex in this film.(Spoiler) Carlos Mencia did play dead very well.

It comes in many pieces and requires a fair amount of cutting of bolts and plastics to accommodate your door. Worst of all once assembled the product quickly fades and falls apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Purely for little kids","review":"My 6-year-old, like many these days, has a fine collection of videos. Some of these we can watch and enjoy together. Not so with \\"Strawberry Shortcake,\\" but that's not a problem. Fact is, this introduction to Strawberry, little sister Apple Dumpling, friends Ginger Snap, Angel Cake, etc., and her pets Pupcake and Custard, is as sweet as the characters' names suggests, and everything is aimed at the level of the pre-gradeschool set. It shows these characters working together and solving problems even when they occasionally disagree. It also has a bouncy musical track and a music video after the end titles.OK, so the animation is the cheapo kind that the aficianado will carp about. OK, so the plot is silly and the characters one-dimensional. It reaches its audience nicely, tells a positive story, and, frankly, creates a desire for tied-in merchandise. What else is new? My daughter loves it and yours probably will too."},{"rating":"1","title":"they ruined a treasured 1980s classic","review":"The lowest rating you can give it is one star - it deserves none.When I found out that my childhood favorite, Strawberry Shortcake was back, I was so excited . . . until I went to the store and saw the new SSC toys and and this episode playing in the electronics center of my local wal-mart. I have the original dolls and a few of the original cartoons - this is NOTHING at all like the original SSC. I can't believe other people wrote reviews stating that the new SSC is the same as what they grew up with. It is NOT the SSC of the eighties - the voices are done by different people; the cartoons look nothing like the videos, coloring books, or stickers from the 80s; and the dolls, as most of today's dolls do, look anorexic in comparison to the originals. This is a very poor imitation for those looking for the SSC of the 80s. At least when they brought back the Care Bears, the cartoons were the same, and the plush dolls were the same or very similar."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT SMELLS GREAT TOO!","review":"My 5 year old got this for Christmas from Santa.

Custard, Strawberry's cat, is all about her own species. She eventually learns that others not like her are not that bad.

It implored me with its dazzling clear blue dust jacket festooned with large sparkly letters in the title and a huge white full moon with Santa's sleigh just disappearing off the cover. The illustrations in this book are lavish and colorful and filled with heart-warming sentimental details and the innocent joys of childhood wonder and expectation on the most magical night of Christmas Eve. In a way this book is \\"A Visit from St. Nicholas\\" but in a different family's home in a different era. Like its predecessor it captures the excitement and the hustle-bustle of that \\"jolly old elf\\" busy at work bringing Christmas fun to children.

We follow his story from the time he was a child being told that he owed everything to the king. Then the day he was conscripted and his journey to Gaze where he embarked on a journey through life.

There was very little factual information at all, rather a sociological posturing that those who built them actually anticipated providing their contribution to the project. When they stated that \\"no slaves were used to construct the pyramids\\" I think that the meaning of the word slave has been substantially redefined from what it really means. Some workers were skilled and probably paid. Others were prisoners of war who were forced to do labor work here. The volume of people required is so great we cannot really imagine how many were required.

The music video series that preceded it was weird and funny, the interview show (which I haven't seen) sounds intriguing (especially the William Shatner interview!), and the US series actually lived up to the movie.But - I've searched all over the internet for Max Headroom on DVD, and all I can find are choruses of people wailing \\"Why isn't this on DVD?\\" When the big brains who own the shows actually put them out on DVD, they're going to make a mint.(Taps foot impatiently...)Meanwhile, this will do as a stop-gap.

The software is clunky and it is difficult to save files into JPGs to print or send. Also the scanner feeds smaller papers in crooked most of the time, requiring you to hold the papers while scanning again and again. Also, I am using Windows Vista and had a very difficult time running the Windows Vista compatible software from their website -- so much so that I now am using it on a Windows XP machine to avoid the difficulties. I noticed too that they've come out with a 'new and improved' software version at their website -- but you have to pay for it!

Really does a nice job of scanning receipts after some experince and quality improves if they are scanned sideways whenever possible.

However when you go to the website and try to download the driver IT'S NOT THERE. Calling the useless tech support is an hour+ long exercise in Futility. The genius that fielded my call tried to go to c program and files common files and look for the software there even I told him several times I don't have the CD and it does not install automatically over windows update. I had to redirect him to the issue at hand. GIVE ME THE F****** driver! Nope he couldn't do that even though he works for this incompetent company.

Yes you can download into Quickbooks but ONLY as a journal entry. I guess if that's where you put your purchases and don't use the checking or register features in QB, it might work for you. Also the dates on receipts did not capture correctly and I had to hand change them. I was also expecting a little more line item detail capture and Neat Receipts doesn't do that either.

I ordered it from Amazon, and it arrived in record time. I set it up, loaded the software, then tried unsuccessfully to scan receipts and business cards. The paper got stuck, jammed, the computer froze up and the entire process stalled. I tried many times to get it to work. Reinstalled the software, set everything up just the way the instructions said - no luck. I even did a clean reinstall of my operating system, just in case I had a computer error. I am no computer novice, but this gadget just did not work. Amazon was gracious enough to accept a return and to refund my money. I am very grateful to them, and deeply disappointed in the Neatreceipt. What a time saver ot would be - if it only worked. Perhaps my machine was just a dud - and I hope that is true.

Scanner hardware is small, light, but mediocre, incapable of scanning all the way to the margins, which causes a lot of trouble since you're scanning small receipts most of the time. Scanalizer software makes too many OCR mistakes, even with well-printed receipts in good condition. If you like the Scanalizer database, you're good, but interfacing with other applications is possible but cumbersome as a recurring practice. I could keep using it if it wasn't for the high error rate. I returned the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"neatreceipts - neat!","review":"The software is fabulous and the scanner works very well also.

Very good pairing of hardware and software to scan and manage expense receipts, purchase receipts, business cards and the like.The only con is that the software would be better if it allowed for a few more folder options (nested folders for one).

Some of the images and characters Burroughs comes up with are so vivid and so realistic that when I read this I actually felt like I was with Burroughs during this subconcious journey.I liked how he used his dreams as education, and how he realized the importance of his dreams; a very Freudian quality. I think that this book represented finally coming to terms with your past, and accepting vicissitude (or change) that others tend to shy away from. This book is a very important addition to Burroughs' extensive body of work, and undoubtedly one of his best books. And often times it's overlooked because it's in the shadow of the Naked Lunch and the Soft Machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing book","review":"\\"My Education\\" is one of the most interesting booksI've read in a while.

Brown and Zasu Pitts are on the screen. Jeanette MacDonald shows why she went on to bigger and better things, while the other men in the cast, including leading man John Garrick, show why they didn't make a lasting impression in Hollywood.The most disappointing aspects of the Kino Video release are the running time - only 67 minutes - and the black and white image throughout. The original print runs for 78 minutes, with the final scene in vivid (for the time) color. This uncut version with the color finale was recently shown on Turner Classic Movies.

That is until I purchased it from Amazon. I remembered it as a GREAT movie when I was a kid and thought I'de give it another viewing. I was pleasantly surprised. It was better than I remembered. If anyone reading this has seen the film adaptation of the Stephen King novel \\"Needfull Things\\", you might want to check out this precurser. The film is beautifully shot and acted. Probably one of the best scenes in the film is the exchange between Jason Robards and Jonathan Pryce in the library. It is wonderfully written and very compelling. This film would be a bit scary for younger children, but the older ones will get a kick out of it. The special effects for it's time are fantastic. I highly recommend this film to all fans of Science Fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wicked and creepy ,it came my way","review":"I saw this film when it was first released, and at that time i was managing a cinema in our town, and remember so vividly wondering if the censors had fallen asleep during their watching of this film, especially as they had given it a P.G cert which in effect made it an open market for the kids.Now i thought the film was supurb, but so sinister and creepy, in fact i recall being more un-nerved by it, than some of the then ' Horror ' films around. certainly i felt it was unsuitable for many under 12 year olds.

Watching it is like realizing the promise of autumn and cooler weather, along with holidays, and Halloween, bringing fond childhood memories.

I can promise you that you will create memories that will last a lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"de javu, something creepy from my childhood .......","review":"I've read several reviews on this film and I agree with the customers more than the critics. This has to be one of the creepiest movies I've ever seen by disney, until years later, I didn't even know it was by them. I was eight or nine the first time I saw it, my mom saw the title and was turned off by it, so I couldn't own it. The DVD is superbly recolorized, even the night time scenes make more sense, I'm not sure Anchor Bay could've cleaned it up this well, I'm glad I waited on this version, the only real downfall is the lack of special features-just a trailer, oh well. Jonathan Pryce is alot like Max VonSydow in Needful Things but obviously a lighter scale.Despite being by disney, I can't suggest this to anyone under the the age of at least twelve, parents really should watch this with/or before their kids do, that's just my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"i SO LOVE THIS MOVIE","review":"tHIS MOVIE SO SPEAKS TO THE HEART OF EACH OF US OUR FEARS HOPES AND DREAMS, WISHES AND WHAT MIGHT BE"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Bradbury!

Yet, the plot is motivated by the actions of the characters of the two boys, Will Holloway and Jim Nightshade who, were inadequately cast (it's hard to find good child actors). Along with not being shot very well (Director of Photography, Stephen H. Burum [the writer of this review simply can't tolerate the day-for-night scenes.]), it seems 10 to 18 pages of the original script are missing from the final cut (the whole Tom Fury, B-Story). Much of the special effects scenes are cut in such a way as to reveal they simply didn't work and had to be cut out all together &/or \\"cut around.\\" Much to my dismay, the story simply falls apart.

The crippled ex-athelete regains his atheleticism, the father the chance to relive a humiliating expereince, the teacher her lost youthful beauty...All of us wrestle with regrets (by comparison Jacob had it easy), which impede our lives.

Unfortunately, it shares many of the same flaws present in Radford's Dragon Nimbus series. There are even errors in spelling and punctuation in this volume! The characters, like in the series before this, fail to come to life, and are nothing more than stiff, and wooden interchangeable sketches of people.

Shrek the Third was a wreck from the beginning. I got the feeling that most of the people involved in the movie just did not care and were on there to do their jobs because there was a multi movie deal in place. If you are not between the ages of about 5 to 8 this movie will cause some pain and suffering. I walked out on this movie after about 40 minutes. The sad part about that is that I was watching it in my living room. The DVD played on with no one in the room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst one of the trilogy","review":"As someone very special pointed out, the Shrek movies are all about pop culture references, and spotting the celebrity voices, rather than watching it properly for a movie.I'm sure if I re-watched the first two movies, I would be ultimately as fed up of them as I am this one. They were good when they first come out, but the third was one too far I think.There's just nothing stand out about the movie. It's the same tired jokes, the same nonsense once again, and it's just got really old.Is it worthwhile seeing? No, it's not, only if you seriously LOVED the first two, but otherwise, put it down and walk away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out for shipping","review":"Shrek The Third (Full Screen Edition)I ordered this DVD on November 28th for a Christmas present.

After watching it I only have one tiny little question:What were they thinking?The characters, new and old, could have mailed in their performance from planet Zarquan, and the plot line, when there WAS one, was little more than a platform for political finger wagging! This Shrek might as well have been written by Michael Moore!And I'm thinkin Walt Disney wouldn't have been too thrilled to see Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, and Snow White hanging out with a drag queen, regardless of how PC the concept. Not quite the Disney image he spent his life creating.For you who do enjoy adult political and social commentary disguised as childrens' entertainment, my copy of Shrek the Third is for sale for 2 cents, and IMO, it's still overpriced."},{"rating":"1","title":"it sucks so bad","review":"It was one of the worst movies of the year it sucked so bad that I really didn't want to finish it but I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shrek is BAACK!","review":"So far, they have hold up on the sequel storyline.

One part which is comfusing is that fiona is pregnant and she is fighing bad guys. What? Pregnant people dont do that. And the fact that when the king died all they said was \\"he is dead\\". They could have made it funny by saying \\"he croaked\\". Anyway this is all I have to say. I hope you like this movie more than I did.

I was so looking forward to this installment of the Shrek movies, that when I finally saw it, I was in shock! It was hands down the most terribly boring movie I had seen all year! I fell asleep about 30 minutes before it ended (something I never do watching a movie) so I asked my husband if I had missed anything good. He laughed. He thought it was as terrible as I did. Come to find out every single person I talked to after watching it said that it was as terrible as I did. Shame on the writers for making such a dull and boring movie after the first 2 were so lively and wonderful. Hopefully the next one will be more like the first 2, I would hate to see them end with such a horrible conclusion like number 3!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable","review":"If the first two Shrek films did not exist, this one would be just a silly, stupid film (due to the dumb dialogue, foolish \\"plot,\\" in-your-face moralizing, excessive vulgarity, and... well, it would just be silly and stupid).But Shrek 1 and 2 do exist; therefore Shrek 3 is an abomination, a monstrosity; it is testimony to the utter intellectual collapse of those who wrote it.If you admire Shrek 1 and 2, I strongly suggest not seeing Shrek 3 at all, for even after you have cut the CD into pieces and thrown them away, it may leave behind a lingering stench that will slightly cloud your enjoyment when you watch 1 and 2 again.I guess that \\"2\\" is the magic number when it comes to film series.

The jokes are flat, the pop culture references are forced, and the big play finale made me squirm in agony. The first movie was brilliant but this one shows that writers are running on empty. Graphically it's a beautiful movie but the movie seems forced to make as much money as possible. The writers clearly needed another year or two to develop the story.

He admitted he might have had a bad day watching it. I thought it was one of the better ones. Sometimes with humor, much of it depends on if you get the humor. The Pinocchio scene where he had to tell Charming some info was hilarious. Charming knows he can't tell a lie and it is clever how they got Pinocchio to answer Charming. The facial expressions of Puss N Boots and the 3 pigs were very fitting.My kids loved it also.

Who would want to see a movie full of burping, farting, butt jokes, and explicit depictions of vomiting? Not me. AVOID this movie, especially if you are sensitive to vulgarity.

Gone whith a puke.Just for my curiosity: why the Shrek's ship sailed with only one crazy skipper aboard and withowt any additional crew? And why that skipper disappeared completely from the screenplay and from the ship then? Seems it did not puzzle Shrek or his bysiders, anyway...I was disappointed, DreamWorks pals and gals.

Shrek the Third has very little plot and no true character development. It's stagnant. It really feels like a collection of all the deleted scenes from Shrek and Shrek 2. Each scene is over the top and becomes irritating before it finishes. Many of the characters phase in and out of character. Worst of all, the movie seems no longer to have an adult appeal. It's a kids movie with a story so stupid you'd have to be a kid to not notice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the Original Shrek","review":"This second sequel to \\"Shrek\\" is funny, but the original was much better, perhaps because it was a new concept then and new plot ideas are running thin now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just keeps gets worse.","review":"Just like most movies series they can not keep the plot or story going.

I wish I could pinpoint exactly why it is not as good, but I suspect it is a combination of small points, from the cliche Aurthur character to boilerplate Shrek fear of fatherhood dilemma. For me the only highlights are Puss and Donkey, even Charming get tiresome despite Rupert Everett's wonderful work. To me these movies are pure escapist fun and I am not expecting anything more, but with this outing it is just no longer fun. Finally I find this Shrek has lost the wit the first two movies have, which may explain why it never worked for me. By the way I am not a very good writer mainly because I refuse to edit.

He's a ogre for goodness sakes, the last thing i want in an ogre is \\"Daddy issues\\".Not only that, but Shrek is due to inherit the throne of Far, Far Away.He doesn't want to do that either. Instead, he goes on a voyage to find King Arthur (WHAT?) who is Fiona's cousin and thus, inherit the throne for him.Lame.Words cannot describe how lame this actually was.Don't buy it if you haven't seen it.If you must, rent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maximum audience age is 10","review":"Shrek 1 and 2 was funny, entertaining, and enjoyable. Really looked forward to the third installment. After reading many negative reviews, thought they must of been biased, still went ahead and watched it.Sorry to say, all the negative reviews were right on target. The movie is completely retarded. It's suppose to be a family oriented / grown up cartoon. After watching Shrek 3, it made my IQ down quite a bit. With how mature the kids are today, even 10 yr olds would see this movie as being dumb.I would still recommend this movie to kids 0 - 10 because the sound track is decent. But to let older kids watch this would simply degrade their intelligence level. For grown ups to watch this is simply insulting to our mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"only donkey and puss in boots make movie worthwhile","review":"if at all.Shrek 3 is bad. for little kids, it's okay, but for adult watching the film, it's bad. Shrek the original was awesome all around.it appealed to young and old.2 was just as good. it appealed all round and Puss in Boots was awesome.but part 3 is bad. like what Jaws 3 was to the Jaws Franchise. horrible.there is a story line, bad, but there is one. i don't understand the point in having Justin Timberlake in this film, as he does nothing special like Banderas did in Shrek 2.overall, Shrek 3 felt rushed, like if they made the movie because they knew they would profit only. there is no heart in this movie, none whatsoever, which is sad because of Shrek 1 and 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"How could you betray us Shrek?!?!","review":"Hi well to start when we herd this was in the theaters we went and saw it the opening day. However we left disappointed. This is a sad follow up to the first two movies. The comedy is boring and not an ounce of it is funny and the plot oh! Don't even get me started on that!! It's so lame simple and boring \\"find arthur so Shrek doesn't have to be king.\\" I mean it's so boring! The movie would probably be a whole lot better if it didn't have such a lame plot. We can think of a trillion things better than what they went with. Well overall this is a boring wannabe follow up to the first movies. Well gotta go hope this was helpful Brooke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shrek 3 - More characters does not equal better","review":"If your household consists of adults who loved Shrek 1 and 2 don't buy this movie.

The HD effects are amazing and add to the viewing pleasure. Rarely do sequels do justice to the original movie, but this one is a must see for both adults and children alike who enjoyed the cast of characters in the previous Shrek movies.

It is poorly written and it looks like it was made at someone's kitchen table. It is only four sheets of paper with a card stock cover and the page layout is very juvenile.

This product shouldn't even be considered a real book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zappy","review":"I read this book when it was first released. It was so easy and comprehensive that even an Astro-ditz like me could follow the information. This book makes working with one's own potential clear and inspiring. I was able to sit down with my own natal chart and correlate sufficient associations as to make significant changes in (personally and specifically) my own line of work; work that requires self-promotion - a thing I have always had difficulty doing.I thoroughly recommend this work to anyone, Astrologer or otherwise, as it is clear and explicit.

No. It is \\"seriously bad\\", as in \\"I just found out my grandmother died in a car wreck\\" bad. The horrendous acting by the \\"leading\\" man (and all the actors - sorry, Ron, you weren't convincing at all), the terrible \\"plot\\", the imbecilic love story aspect, the unbelievable gaffs in continuity - I could go on. DO NOT PAY MONEY TO SEE THIS. And if some else has rented this and invited you to watch, believe me: You can find a million better things to do with your time.

A lot of the text covers the basics which is important in the understanding of drawings and documentation, but I don't know anyone who does board drafting anymore. Everything is done in SolidWorks, Pro-E or some other 3D modeling program and this book touches on it, but it is brief and not very infomative. With the technology we have today, this book should spend the second half getting students up to speed on creating models, drawings and assembly drawings in CAD programs rather than how things use to look drawn on paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"It doesn't make sense? It's not supposed to....","review":"If you are fond of a variety of veiwpoints and differences of perspective, this is a collection for you. Though familiar and similar, none of the stories can be or should be read together. A total of 17 tales, the major theme in abut half of them is of introspection, especially the last one, \\"A Pigs Tale\\", just as one would expect from Alice and her mad companions. This could be given to an older child, but in such a case, I would warn against \\"Hollywood Squares\\" which features language AND casual sleeping around, of which there isn't much detail, but enough that it would be innapropriate.

I really don't understand why people are knocking it. The book is full of fun ideas for weapons and magical items, in addition to plenty of mundane stuff and alternate mounts. As someone else mentioned, if you don't like the way they've presented an idea, you can easily reverse-engineer it for use with your own creations. I am glad I bought the Arms & Equipment Guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"variety!","review":"The book promises as delivered. Lots of neat equipment in this book. I had read that there weren't enough of magical items in this book. NOT SO! They are tons of them in here and not all of them are weapons per say. Now there is a rule for collosions and vehicle controls, which is very handy. Now not so sure about the mounts and hireling rules, but I see where they fit under 'arms' as in 'hiring arms'. Excellent rule coverage on that angle. Also 'living equiment aka mounts' this has some superb rules for even mounts most would not have even thought of. Gelatiounos cubes anyone? I'd never have thought of that. Though if you have to color illustrations, then avoid this book. There are no such thing in this book. Yet the illustrations that are in this book are very detailed and well done. Color isn't everything. If you need to expand on what is in the phb as far as equipment then this is it. Nice cover illustration imo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fuzzy Use","review":"I bought the 3.0 Arms and Equipment Guide because of the new armor, adventuring gear, clothing table, food and drink prices table, poison table, vehicles, and creatures (mounts, pets, etc). I did not buy 3.0 Arms and Equipment Guide because I was expecting a miracle.Good thing, too, because the book didn't provide much more than I wanted. Yes, there are hundreds of new weapons and other random things, but everything blurs together in one run-on list. I'm not that fond of the magic weapons list, but the things I did want were there, thus I bought the book.If you're looking for random information to throw at your DM or include in the game, this can be a helpful book. Don't buy it if you're looking for an awesome addition to your equipment and arms collection, because it probably won't help you much."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your time","review":"I'll keep this short and sweet.

It brushes past those subjects and touches on a bunch of other stuff that has nothing at all to do with the title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so much Arms and Equipment as ...","review":"The Short of it boils down to the one line, \\"you don't need a book that lists every single weapon avaliable. \\" And I'll agree with that. No book should list every single piece of equipment as only a sourcebook about arms and equipment should carry that sort of information, rather I would prefer to see a bunch of poorly thought out rules and reprints from dragon magazine bound and hardcovered.Why anyone would want a book full of arms and equipment is beyond me, I for one LOVE reading through 12 different books trying to find a specific piece of equipment. I personally think this book is SO MUCH BETTER than the 2nd edition AoE guidebook, which was burdened down with pages and pages of descriptions of weapons, armor, equivilencies and rules for their use. They had a hirelings section, it was great because that is certainly what I bought an arms and equipment book for, hiring people.Perhaps I could hire a few writers to actually write what the title says."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book!","review":"I love having this book.

Virtuoso performances yet as always played with great feeling. Excellent compositions with beautifull melodies and strong and varied rhythms. The guitars sound warm and clear as only the real masters of the acoustic guitar can make them sound. It is always hard to pick favorite songs on any Strunz and Farah CD but so far they include Andina, Bribri, Interludio, Capricho Nocturno, Vela al Viento,Estrella Fugaz and Arabesca. Sound quality and packaging/artwork are topnotch. This CD just gets better and better with repeated listening. A real treat for any real music lover.(Also I was happy to find out that Strunz and Farah have a DVD out.....finally!!

All the way through their career in multi-cultural latin-fusion-improvised-ethnojazz rythms and songs Strunz and Farah have impressed and knocked many off their feet with their staggering technique and resembling-impossibility swiftness! This particular disc fulfills S&T's legacy of holding everybody's breath at listening to their compositions.

If you already own those titles and are looking for more excellent Spanish guitar music then pick up this title, Zona Torrida, Wild Muse, and Stringweave.

His backpack was not designed by Gucci and his boots were mostly army surplus but he spent a life time outdoors, not behind a desk finding fault. His writings, his actions and his public appearances brought more awareness of nature and its plight to the public than did the combined number of his critics by a factor of 1000.Borne just before the depression, he did not see all wild game as Bambi or Thumper but, as a child, watched as his father hunted for the table.

Environmentalists who think that Abbey was some kind of hero might be shocked by the elitist arrogance of this \\"man of the people\\" (he thanks nuclear physicists for inventing the atomic bomb) or by right-wing moronics worthy of the most brainless militiaman (\\"the rifle and handgun are 'equalizers'--the weapons of a democracy\\").

The graphics arn't to bad, so their not really nasty, but the humans can't talk right. They look funny so the graphics arn't the best. Still though, for fun I rate this five.

He says the same thing over and over again. But you can't get to perfection in that area. What I liked about the game is the franchise mode. You can sign Free Agents, Release players, Negotiate Contracts, and have a Draft. One thing that bugged me was if a lineman caught an onside kicked it will only track his kickoff stats for the rest of the season. Also what keeps the game alive is the 2000 Madden Points you need to get. Everything from catching a 30 yard pass to beating Green Bay at Lambeau Field.

Every song is either \\"we're such rebels, you're all clones\\" or \\"she's so sexy.\\" These guys should be able to pen some meatier prose, they're over 16.So go get Muse's \\"Origin of Symmetry\\" or \\"Absolution\\" instead for great guitars, vocals AND lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Hard Rock","review":"Though they've made their reputation on fast punky singles, the Ash songs that have spoken the most to me in the past have been mid-tempo songs about love's longing (\\"Shining Light\\", \\"Folk Song\\") or downright dirges (1977's \\"Gone the Dream\\"). So my approach to Meltdown, their fifth proper release after a collection of singles and b-sides (Intergalactic Sonic 7s), was not so much skepticism as dread when I'd read they were forsaking lyricism for rocking out. Yet Tim Wheeler and his able bandmates find their own lyricism in the 4/4 - they not only muscle up (some of these tunes are damn near metallic) but provide a few twists to hard rock's standard themes. So, for instance, \\"Orpheus\\" is both paean to \\"the open road\\" and the mythological character, and \\"Won't Be Saved's\\" iconic rebel remains despondent even as he pledges the eternal love that damns him. The songs that merely appropriate the hard rock verities get by on how hard that rock actually is."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Instant Classic!","review":"I've been playing golf sims since back-in-the-day (any body remember PGA Tour Golf for the MAC?) and I gotta say Mario Golf is one of the most addictive golf games out there. It has meets all the requirement for a good golf sim: several courses, different charactors with different strengths and weaknesses, adequate graphics (considering the limitations of the GameBoy platform)..etc. But what truly makes this game great is what I can only describe as the \\"Japanese Approach\\" to sports sims. Unlike most golf sims you cannot rip the ball 300 + yards the first time you play the game. Much like real golf, you must gain experience on both the course and practice facilites. It may seem a little frustrating as first but stick with it you'll have a great time."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Husband's Obsession","review":"I bought this game because it was on sale and after fighting over it with my husband for 4 days or so, he emerged victorious and has been playing with it every day ever since.

If you don't want to spend money by going out to a real golf course, than you can buy this game. In Mario Golf, you can create up to 3 custom players. When you begin in the game you can choose where you want to go. You can enter a tournament, play against a club champ, visit your clubhouse, or just practice. As you play against other players your golfer gets experience points. The experience points make your golfer grow a level. It also gives you a choice on what you want your player to improve on and he improves by a little bit. A golf dictionary comes with the game (the dictionary is computerized inside the game's cartridge). You should buy this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good for average home owner","review":"This is a solid canister with copper sprayer. Very durable, and does not leak.

It's another rehash of the same old storyline- Beautiful, physically perfect people trapped on an alien planet. How will they ever survive? Probably in the same way all the characters in her previous books survived.I was able to predict the ending with 100% accuracy from the first ten pages of the book, and though the last few chapters did take a turn for the better, it hardly made the previous several hundred pages worth all the time I devoted to them.One never really comes to care about the characters- They aren't presented in an endearing way, otherwise, Ireta would have been a much better book to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"buyer beware","review":"if you own an nolt3 the lens doubler will not fit your unit as night owl optics says it will,,thought my unit had the wrong size lens on it and after talking with night owl they said it was their mistake and they should not show the lens double compatable with the nolt3,,,so just be ware it will not fit this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lens Doubler order form is misleading","review":"The product did not fit the Night Owl Night Vision I purchased as advertised.

I've been exercising for years and this workout has proven to be, by far, the most challenging and effective I've tried in a LONG time. Results are almost instantaneous, I noticed new definition, toning and slimming within the first two weeks. The best aspect of the workout is that it uses a \\"power band\\" (which you can order through her website for [$$]--I wasn't able to find it anywhere else), so that it provides toning benefits without the added bulk. The abdominals are great (you really feel the burn) and all of the exercises are foucused around the core abdominal muscles. All in all, I highly recommend this video. You will see results!! I must admit, however, that the only downside is Denise Austin herself, and the almost creepy over-enthusiastic attitude she displays throughout the workout (you'll see what I mean)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Down, Denise","review":"I like this video but Denise is too fast. She needs to slow it down a pace for the beginners, like myself. Since, I've gained weight from a thyroid problem, I'm not that agile yet. She also doesn't show too many modifications. A good workout if you are an intermediate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for anyone familiar with Pilates","review":"If you are not a Pilates beginner, don't waste your time with this video. The only moves that really gave me a Pilates workout was the \\"ballet\\" legwork at the end. The warm-up is simply a regular aerobic warm-up, not using Pilates at all. I will definitely continue using this video for the fabulous leg work I remember from my days as a ballet dancer, but other than that, it was a waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality","review":"DVD was in very good condidtion.

I bought it a while back when some friends and I started doing various yoga/pilates videos together regularly. We could hardly get through this workout without pulling our hair out and choking the television set, not to mention rolling around on the floor laughing. Denise Austin does not shut up for one single second. And the stuff she says is completely ridiculous -- very little instructional help but lots of cheesy encouragement and nonsense chatter. Eventually we started muting the TV and playing our own music, but pretty soon it found a nice place on the shelf to gather dust. I can't even remember the workout aspect, except that it was hard for some of us but not for others, but I'll never buy another video from Denise Austin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beginners look elsewhere","review":"I bought this thinking \\"everybody\\" meant it was beginner level pilates. I am admittedly not in good shape and found this to be way too difficult to attempt right now. Even when I work my way up to the level demonstrated, I don't know if I could stand doing the workout--Denise talks nonstop all the way through it and has the most annoying nasal voice!! She must be in incredible shape to be able to talke all the way through a work out like this!! Even if you turn her down, her expressions are so fake she looks like a mime doing pilates. I think I'll sell this at a used DVD store...."},{"rating":"1","title":"a pity","review":"It's a pity that Denise Austin's high whispery voice is way too annoying. So, therefore, i find it impossible to workout with this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!!!!!!","review":"This is the worst work-out video I have ever seen.

She always uses poor form, just like she does on her tv show. How does this lady sell vides? She never, ever, does anything but talk talk talk, she does not possess good intruction skills, she truly is not a fitness expert, she is a fitnesss salewoman hussie. This video was terrible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I never did Pilates before and I bought this DVD.

I find the idea behind Pilates interesting, and I will be investing in a different tape, because this one is below-average quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear God...","review":"Where to start?? Well,if you are a beginner to pilates this is not the video to test the waters. I was very excited about this video but was quite disappointed.There is very little instruction for beginners to modify moves, and I understand that Pilates should be fluid with little rigid movement. I am an experienced workout and video buff (a FIRM BELEIVER) but I found this video to be frustrating and I had to force myself to finish. I have yet to try it again, because it is so irritating.I felt unco-oridinated and clumsy, and more than a little irritated with Denise. Her voice, lack of cueing and general presentation sent me back to Amazon to try Pilates for Dummies.Maybe after learning the basics I will try again soon"},{"rating":"1","title":"Might be a nice workout-but it sure isn't \\"real\\" pilates","review":"I thought this dvd was terrible! She talks about precise movements and doing things with the correct form, then she is all over the place with her form. Very sloppy. It almost seems like she doesn't know how to do the movements right and just put out a dvd to jump into the pilates marketing craze. If you are really looking for a good basic beginner pilates dvd, get the Crunch Pick Your Spot. That's a great DVD that really does things right and isn't at all boring. This one is just plain annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible. The worst tape I've ordered!","review":"I recently ordered this video even though it didn't have the best reviews. I had never tried a Denise Austin exercise tape before and thought I'd give it a shot. Boy, was I wrong. What a terrible tape. I cannot stand Austin's voice or instruction style at all. This is one of the worst exercise tapes I've ever purchased. There's no indication of the steps coming up; there are no modification moves and her voice is just irritating. Ellen Barrett is a much better choice for Pilates. She's a great instructor, easy to follow and leads into the steps very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a pilates workout for everybody","review":"I wouldn't go so far as to give this 1 star. Despite the fact that her voice is annoying, she never shuts up, and her instructions and postures postitions are vague, I did get a small workout. However, this is truely for Beginners Only and isn't a true pilates workout. Also it is decieving because it says you work the whole body but she focuses on the abs the most and doesn't do nearly as much with the thighs. I am not a fan of physical activity and don't do it often, so I expected to be a little challenged, but not with this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"tai chi without form","review":"I bought the DVD as a gift for my wife at christmas, she had been wanting this particular title instead of a more generic offering. After she watched it she claimed that it was VERY annoying and hard to get past the loud delivery by Denise Austin.She did however find the Tai Chi video to be almost the exact same exercises with actual form and function, and is now using that instead"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Ab Workout!","review":"I love Denise Austin's Pilates For Every Body. I used to take Ballet classes when I was younger, and stopped for almost ten years. I am now 23 years old and have started Ballet again. I had heard that Pilates exercises can really improve dance technique. This workout has really improved my balance, my posture, my flexibility, and has toned and strengthened my abs and thighs. My ballet has really improved and I have recommended this video to my other classmates. This is a great video with realistic moves and Denise Austin is very enthusiastic and motivating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value for money","review":"I bought this tape after using Ana Caban's beginner mat workout tape... It's much faster than Ana's workout and there is also the implicit assumption that you are familiar with Pilates moves. However, Denise gives great tips as you're doing the exercises and moves quickly from one exercise to another which I like since I've already spent some time mastering the beginner workout. I'd recommend Ana Caban's tape to anybody starting Pilates - she spends a considerable amount of time explaining basic concepts and teaching techniques before starting the workout and even during the workout. This is necessary for beginners and is missing in Austin's video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just AMAZING","review":"I purchased this DVD a few years ago and was so heartbroken when I moved and my roommate LOST it! This was the best pilates work out that I've ever tried. I do this DVD 3 times a week (sunday, Tuesday and Thursday). The floor set might be tough for some people, but I PROMISE you that if you just stick with it you'll be very very satisfied with the results. When I first started this DVD a few years ago, I saw results within a month. I naturally have muscular legs and if you do too than this is the perfect workout that will not add bulk. I'm extremely excited to have found this DVD again now that I've just had a baby. It really is Pilates for everybody no matter what level you are. If you want a defined waist, toned arms and legs and a amazing abs this is the DVD for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"not pilates!","review":"I was very disappointed in this video. According to the box the exercises use \\"...correct form, proper breathing, and mental focus...\\". I did not feel properly instructed in any of these aspects. Other pilates tapes have been signifcantly more instructive. In particular, I found her form bad if not harmful to the back. I would not recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Denise Austin, pilates for every body","review":"This is the worst pilates video ever made. Miss Austin is very good in her other videos but it is obvious to someone who is experience in pilates that she does not know nearly enough about this wonderful form of controlled movement excercise to teach it correctly. Classical pilates , Stotts , Winsor and Ana Caban's just to name a few, are very good . You can tell these people have studied Pilates for many, many years. Thank you , Mary Lyon, Certified Pilates Instructor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout","review":"I borrowed this tape from my local library and liked it so much that I bought my own copy. I've been walking and doing yoga for years, but this tape worked some new muscle groups for me. This was my first experience with Denise Austin and I think she is very motivational once you get used to her style. Just when you're starting to get tired, she reminds you to \\"sit up straight\\" or \\"do your best\\" and it works for me. If you want a good workout that makes you feel like you've really done something good for yourself, this is the tape to use. I did it without the resistance band the first few times and still got good results, but now I've got the band and I'm feeling the workout even more. I recommend her books too: Lose That Last 10 Pounds, Fit and Fabulous After 40, and Shrink Your Female Fat Zones.

A great workout for the abs, back and upper body. I still need to get a resistance band but you can do many of the exercises without one or with weights."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for beginners","review":"I bought this DVD as a part of my new weight loss and fitness plan. I was somewhat familiar with the principles of Pilate, but I found that Denise Austin moved too quickly from one exercise to the next. She spent no time explaining the various positions and moved from a basic form to an advanced form in the blink of an eye. Even after watching the tape all the way through, I couldn't figure out what she was doing. This DVD may be suitable to people who are already very familiar with Pilates and correct form, but it's definitely not for beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"RESISTANCE BAND REQUIRED","review":"It would have been nice to know the majority of this tape requires a resistance band. I was lucky to find [an inexpensive one].My intro to Pilates was Susan Deason's - Pilates for Weightloss and have been using it for 5 months. I've gone from a 20 to a size 16 with lo-carbing and pilates. I've tried several tapes seeking an intermediate workout to increase my results. I don't recommend this program for beginners, but its the best intermediate program I found to add to my current routine. Unlike most Denise Austin workouts, it does not have a scenic backdrop, I wish it did. It does have a very energetic warm-up that is great when you don't have time for the full workout. I'm sure this program will stay in my rotation for a long time as I continue to master the resistance bands and I hope it will increase my weightloss results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps on movin'","review":"I took this DVD out at my local library and loved it so much, I went online to order it! I have other Pilates DVD's which address specific body areas in 15 minute segments. This DVD is more integrated. Denise Austin's introduction to what Pilates is and what it does for the body was a great overview, as I had never really known this information. Starting with her fun warm-up moves, this DVD keeps you moving along, all the while she is talking energetically and positively about the wonderful changes in your body, as well as how you are gaining strength, energy and other overall benefits. This may be over-enthusiasm to some people, but I need this \\"excitement\\" and constant movement so as to stay motivated!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect lotion!!!","review":"I have tried just about every body lotion known to women!

Like the trailer, trivia games and documentary.If you love action movies, you won't regret it this movie!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"nice follow up to First Blood","review":"Personally , I liked this film. The overall picture and the script was a nice follow up to First Blood. Rambo was made to be a \\"bigger than life\\" character , so who better than him to send on this mission? Colonel Trautmen (Richard Crenna) visits Rambo in jail and tells him there is a mission. Rambo doesn't hestate to accept. Captain Murdock heads the operation and tells Rambo that he needs to go on a mission back to Vietnam to see if there are any hostages still there , but he only wants him to take pictures , basically leaving him for dead. As the movie goes on Rambo discovers Murdocks' plan and must survive the Vietnam jungles all over again to get revenge on him. This movie is action packed and very stallonish if you like sly , which I'm sure you do. Besides this is old haven't you seen it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A LIVE ACTION COMIC THAT RONALD REAGAN MUST LOVE","review":"The only good thing about this piece of schlock is that it wasn't boring.It doesn't do much justice to real life vietnam vets nor does it hide any pretense of portraying realism in war.My favorite scene has to be when RAMBO was in the helicopter and he fired a LAW without taking a shred of damage to himself or his copter.If you want an action movie without much intelligence,check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what you need","review":"Just what you need if you are installing an American 3 hole steering wheel on a Miata.

This may be true as long as you are a child or a small woman. The hat was too small for me and I am 5-11 and 170 pounds. Too small and the flap part did not cover my neck. Ad says the flap is 8 inches long and it was only 6 inches at most. I contacted the company and their customer service guy needs some training.

It is different in a lot of ways. But, I have found the game to be alot of fun. Normally when I play my wife because she is horrible at games. But anyway, really the game is great and alot of fun.

There are deep playbooks for every team, gameplay, while difficult to get the hang of at first, becomes easy after your first few games. One of the biggest hang-ups for me is that it's very easy to burn defenses with the same plays, even in the higher difficulty modes. I have sometimes used the same 10 plays over and over and won games 56-10. The AI also run predictable offense, such as, when on the goalline, they will almost always run the ball, and goalline D will flatten them every time. The franchise mode, however, is excellent, and is the most enjoyable part for me, building a dynasty from the ground up. Graphics are wonderful. Despite the sometimes weak AI, I still give this game 4 stars. It's the best NFL game I have played."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madden 2000 - the best yet","review":"This game is probably the best foot ball game on the market at the moment. It has a wide variety of options including create a player, trades, free agency and much more. It has fabulous play control and good graphics.

It's a pretty good romance between a down-and-out Wall Street whiz and an editor of a newspaper. Charlie Sheen plays a financial whiz who loses his job due to a scandal and takes the place of his shallow and insensitive girlfriend who runs off to Brazil with another man. While writing the advice column, he falls for the studious editor played by Angie Harmon.My sister thought the movie was shallow but to me I thought it was romantic as a man was dealing with hisself and the people who read his article."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best romantic comedy I've seen in years","review":"I absolutely LOVE this movie and can watch it over and over again.

I Loved it","review":"Yes, I was 100% shocked that I LOVED this flick.Im NOT a fan of sheenI only like Denise Richards if her mouth is shut & her clothes are off (terrible actress, imo)Not too crazy with supporting cast either, other then Lovitz & even him there is plenty of stuff he's done that I hate.So, I did go in to this movie with solid expectations that I would hate it just due to the cast. But I couldnt ignore the overly positive reviews so I went ahead & watched it.No need to go in to plots & etc as plenty of reviews cover everything, but I did want to chime in with the above & to say I'd give this 6 stars if I could.It was fantastic.Do yourself a favor & check it out.

The other 4 knew almost no answers. There didn't appear to be a strategy to figuring out the answer either - you either knew it or didn't.

He must be caught and punished. But seriously, the director knows how to keep a story moving and Stallone's sympathetic (if over-acted) performance helps but when his character says \\"let it go, or I'll give you a war you won't believe\\", THE END should have come up on the screen. A nice little 45 minute movie ending satisfactorily. Unfortunately, the film goes on and a man in a grey overcoat and silly beret shows up with a pair of water skis and a rubber shark. This toe curlingly cheesy performance ends with one of the most embarrassing moments in film history. \\"Don't do it, Rambo!\\" Yells the afore-mentioned Colonel.

The final scenes, after tremendous destruction and skills with violence, are thought provoking and emotional.A surprisingly thoughtful movie.Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I've grown up with the idea that \\"Rambo\\" is just about big explosions and violence, so when I finally got around to watching the first Rambo movie I was shocked to find that it wasn't an all-out action movie but rather a drama and commentary on the effects of war (Vietnam in particular) with action elements. Certainly the series turns into a mindless bullet-fest with the later incarnations (not that there's anything wrong with that), but this first movie is much more than just a mindless action flick.Highly recommended for anyone who likes a little action with their drama, or anyone who wonders what war can do to a person."},{"rating":"2","title":"BLU-RAY VERSION","review":"In town, you're the law.....out here it's me....Such a great line holy crap this movie is just great.

But the movies story and Stallones character of John Rambo are very interesting as well. The thing that appealed to me most of all in this movie is Rambo barely says 2 words througout the whole movie and at the end he just blows up. He explodes about the war, his buddies getting killed, etc. Its an explosive and dramatic moment....the topper of the whole movie.Again, terrific movie, if youre into action/drama, take a look at this one, its great!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie holds up well, don't miss the author's voice-over","review":"This movie is several notches above the subsequent sequals.

This is a really enjoyable disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's a reason they made sequels.","review":"This is the original, written by David Morell, only slightly altered. It's a wonderful story. Yes, when you think of Rambo you think of the [stuff] they piled on after; but there's a reason they made them... and that's because this movie is powerful and excellent. I was skeptical, but after watching this movie I have to admit that Sylvester Stalone is a much better actor than I ever gave him credit for. I always dismissed him as a beefcake not-much-dialog tough guy; this movie... well, it doesn't break that mold, but it shows you a bit more depth than you might imagine.I read the book years ago and was deeply moved; David Morell is a terrific author. This is the first time I've seen the movie, but I'm very glad to have it on DVD and I'll easily be able to watch it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is like stepping into a nightmare","review":"When your only skill is to kill and you have had enough of that, you tend to wander.

It is the sheriff's duty to protect the community from people wondering around in his/her field jacket.Well push comes to shove when the sheriff verdantly or invariantly draws \\"First Blood\\". Now nether one can back down and the whole town and surrounding hills becomes a shooting gallery.There is only one man who may be able to save the situation if anyone is willing to listen, but will they?

It tells the story of a man who survived one hell, only to return home despised and forsaken because of it. There was a time when America didn't quite know what to think of the lost war, and so it was forgotten - and the men who came out of it as well. Rambo finds he cannot survive this war, because it is still going on within him.Finally, pushed too far by a small town sheriff, Rambo returns to the only thing he can relate to. War. Yet it is a war he almost mercifully wages on the macho egotistical deputies and week end warriors that pursue. To potentially misquote Rambo :\\"I coulda killed them all, I could have killed you.

But not all stories are going to end in ways you want them. It takes imagination to make a unique story. Or rely on past history and spice it up. There are many movies and anime out there but its finding great one's like Grave of the Fireflies or something fun like The Incredibles.

So many writers/directors seem afraid to stray too far from the standard God and Heaven belief and they fail to reach people like me.

I didn't care for the story at all, it just felt rushed and stupid. And the characters... They got good actors behind each character, but just the characters themselves were just dumb, there was only maybe one character I actually liked. And, it just doesn't feel like a Final Fantasy product at all. It's like a sci-fi movie with \\"Final Fantasy\\" slapped on the cover, but isn't really FF.

There is more than 22 Final Fantasy games in the series, most are just now or have not been released in the US. Square has made a couple stinkers, yes, but most have been super. From the 15 minute ending in FF2(US) to the stunning scene of Nanaki returning to Midgar with his young, to Squall and Reiona sitting on the Ragnorok with Eyes on you playing in the background, every script has been different except for a few key Characters. CID, Wedge and Biggs. There is always three characters named that..even if they are minor ones.

The scenes here utilize Quicktime 5, is a degradation of the whole DVD idea. These scenes run in a tiny; 3x2 inches window.* Finding mose of the special features is a pain. They are hidden under several layers of menus and sub-menus.* Many of these special features require Internet access, a detail that is not mentioned on the package.* Bonus trailers include trailers of 2-years old movies, such as Starship Troopres.Overall, ignore this DVD and wait for the Extra-special edition or whatever it will be called."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good animation, dull story.","review":"Although I liked the animation for the most part (some of the skin tones looked inconsistant throughout the film, yet still managed to be terrible every time, some of the non-organic motions were awkward, and other colors were just out of place), the rest of the movie was just plain dull.The story looked like something a B-movie director turned down. Not only was it flat and boring, but it was also quite ridiculous.And this is all ignoring the fact that the movie has nothing to do with the Final Fantasy series. The only thing FFish about the movie were some of the sets, and a few of the character's and their costumes were reminicent of bad guys and footsoldiers from FFVII and VIII.I'm glad I rented this instead of paying money to see it in the theaters, or wasted way too much buying the DVD.The only thing that saved the DVD was one hidden feature.

I guess it's darkly humorous in a way.Aki is the absurdly nondescript female lead, and Grey is the muscle-head action hero with no personality. There's the one guy who in theory is funny, with his blank-faced female audience, and then there's the unspeakable mess of a plot involving some entity called Gaia and a lot of really uninspired action sequences trying to hold it together.No one should be forced to bother with this swill, so don't watch it or buy it.

They seem to want to put in everything but the kitchen sink whether it contributes to the telling of the story or not.

I found myself wanting to find the makers of the movie and give them all big hugs and maybe kisses because it was so great. Not since Lawrence of Arabia has a movie this GREAT come out in theatres. Final Fantasy is great for three reasons:1. It came from the greatest video game ever.2. The makers of it lost so much money on it that they can no longer afford to be in the movie-making business.3. Because of all the great characterization.All of you should see this movie because it will blow you away. Forget Citizen Kane, Casablanca, or even Dr. Strangelove. MAN.

But I decided to rent Final Fantasy first after losing $25 bucks on Titan A.E.From a technical perspective, the film film is hit and miss. Group shots and anything shown from a distance work very well. Backrounds and ships also worked. Close ups of characters rarely worked, though some were better than others. It was obvious some characters (the old scientist) were paid more attention to.From a story standpoint, it was pure goofy anime. I consider myself a typical American viewer, and I will tell anyone interested that I think ships that look like big animals or any other animal related themes like the spirits in this film are just plain old silly.Computer animated movies would have a much better chance of mass popularity if their makers could license a known actor to \\"star\\" - my choice would be Bruce Lee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Anticipated","review":"Pure curiosity is to blame for my decision to purchase the film \\"Final Fantasy : The Spirits Within,\\" and at the time, honestly, I was becoming bored with computer generated movies. (Shrek, Antz, A Bugs Life, Monsters Inc.....) Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed those films, but I felt as if CG film could produce more than just comedies, and \\"Final Fantasy\\" proved that. Full of unknowns and an original story line, this film isn't just another science-fiction \\"save the world\\" flick. (Although the world is saved within the film...spoiler??) \\"Final Fantasy\\" is saturated with facinating enviornments and situations.

Then you get over it. The story, viewed by someone who hasn't played the game, may be a bunch of spiritual mumbo-jumbo, but it had obvious video game elements.

I have a hard time with the criticism that I have heard about this film, especially from Final Fantasy fans. I admit it was far from perfect, but it was the best movie I've seen all summer. One thing some forget is that \\"Final Fantasy\\" has always been a concept, an excercise. The game series always changes in fudamentals with every new installment, ranging from traditional fantasy to \\"age-of-enlightenment/industrial revolution & magic\\" to hard-core sci-fi or an odd melange of all three.

The plot isn't as good as the games, which is understandable; This has 2 hours to tell a story, the games have 40. But for a movie, the plot is great, and borrows many elements from different games. The ending involves a lot of element from FF 7 and 9, for instance. The voice acting is superb, espcially James Wood, who makes a perfert hero/villian hybrid.

The show is talking about some aliens spirit creating havoc and destroying people life and how the heros in the movie going to save this world. This is one of the worst plot I have ever come across. Maybe they are not interested in telling a story but more interested in showing off their CGI. No doubt the CGI is great, but the movie should be at least have some substances. Why not follow story in the PS games? At least it is more fantasy than this. But luckily, the dvd is a gem. It contains many goodies that might worth seeing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Being the game player, I was terrbily disappointed.","review":"Yes, I did indeed think that since the movie was titled, Final Fantasy, it would at least incorporate some of the game series into it. By that I mean, some of the meat of the game. The magic, summons, monsters, towns, people, character interaction, etc. Problem is, all this movie had was the small character interaction. It seems the only thing they took from Final Fantasy was the plot line, and that is so sad, as the games were about 100 times more richer than this movie. The graphics were awesome, but the voice-lip synching was not. I got dizzy trying to follow Baldwin's character when talking, as his mouth barely moved. Only the old man comes across as 100% real. If you really need this move, go rent it as the price to own it, isn't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"This has nothing to do with Final Fantasy. Better off getting the Japanimation DVDs.. I mean, there are no Chocobos or familiar background music in the movie or anything.. I wasted some HARDCORE cash on this one at the movie theater.

Try again buddy..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely a gamers' movie","review":"Beautiful colors and brilliant animation with excellent voicings.That's it. That's about all you can say about this rewarmed pot-boiler. Hackneyed plot, nonexistent character development, unsatisfying conclusion.This is a film that will appeal to gamers and fans of anime. Everyone else can find better use for their ticket money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The End of the RPG Universe As We Know It!","review":"Three words, WORST FILM EVER! It doesn't take a moron to make a louisy film but it takes a special one to make one like this. The worst part is that the setting is in NEW YORK! Where's Spira or Midgar? It may sound weird but the animation pushes it so far that it almost looks real and without any true special effects. Yet another thing, every character is original and American. I want to see Sephiroth and Cloud go all-out on each other! The fights are boring, realistic shooting battles against pyrefly (FFX) rip-offs that feed on people's souls. I couldn't stand this movie and after just 20 minutes of viewing, I stopped watching it. Don't bother wasting money on this movie. Instead, buy something that has even just the least bit to do with Final Fantasy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantastic animation for the time, terrible story","review":"All the tricks in the world can't save a poorly conceived and told story. Dialogue is stilted, and the story truly stumbles all over itself. And of course, with time, even the animation is looking weak these days. It rightfully drove the division that created it out of business."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bigger than life","review":"This film is not technically perfect, but it is a taste of the future of filmmaking. My first thought was that great stars of the past might be \\"resurrected\\" using this sort of computer generated animation.

Well worth the viewing"},{"rating":"1","title":"not for everyone","review":"after hearing so much good reviews upon this movie, finally bought it a week ago on blu ray. well, i am not a Final Fantasy's fan, this movie didn't do me any good, the blu ray format is so so. nothing to write home about. the story line, for me, so so too. will check out the [7th] soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I just watched this movie and I have to say I am sorry I wasted an hour and 45 min.

Where the hell is all the grain coming from? It's so bad it looks like there's a neverending sandstorm layered over the top of the entire movie.

I own 150+ plus DVD's and go to the theaters as much as possible. When I went to this highly anticipated film (at least by me and my brother), I was suprised to find it not so great (to say the least). Sure the CG is fantastic and the production values are spectacular, but does that make up for a confused cliched script and emotionally hollow voice acting? I think not. If you wish to see great CG and a great movie, watch Toy Story or The Abyss. When watching those movies in a theater or on a 8 inch black and white TV, they will still make great film.When reading other reviews on this site, keep in mind that the people giving 5 stars to movies like these are essentially claiming that this film is as good as other _truly deserving_ 5 star films. Is \\"The Spirits Within\\" as good of a film as Star Wars or The Matrix? Ponder this when you watch this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"needs a better script","review":"Ok if this was cartoon it would get 4 stars however, this flick tried to put itself in competition with a real movie by giving us these realistic textured effects therefore I am rating this as a sci fi movie. The special effects were unquestionably remarkable and the characters were one hair short of being viewed as real however, this movie suffered in giving us good suspense, drama, and diolague resulting in dull moments and a lack of excitement and anticipation. They need to perfect all those factors for a movie of this type to be considered a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good animation but bad acting and awful plot.","review":"This video game turn movie needs a lot of retooling and better storylines. I see Shrek and that was a 100 times better. This movie no doubt spoiled the other video game turned movies. I just don't like it. The action wasn't that bad, however it could make it more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliant Animation, Lousy Script","review":"I don't think the actors actually knew what they were talking about in this let down. It sounds as if they were just reading the script, not being able to inject personality into the animation. Still, this was a good idea, as the animation was incredible, the planets, landscapes and creatures all made it an enjoyable visionary experience. I am hopeful this will inspire similar style movies, just with better scripts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting sci-fi action","review":"Definitely one to add to the collection. I've only heard of the FF games. I haven't played any of them, but as to the film, it's makes for riveting sci-fi action with varied and complex characters, which are far more interesting than the usual stereotypical Hollywood characters that they usually put in animated features.Aki's dream is spectacular ! I just found the finale could have been a little less predictable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"Nothing like the games, but that doesn't detract from the movie at all. Excellent graphics, and I love the bloopers on the bonus disc ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tomb Raider is much better!","review":"One of the most dissapointing movies of this year, are 'Final Fantasy', the animation and the confusing story could have been done better, and something is missing in this 'from console to movie' event, that i thought should be the biggest computer animated movie of this year, don't waste money and time on this underrated movie, go for 'Tomb Raider' instead, even if this movie ain't 100% computer animated!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall, it's great","review":"This movie was packed with CGI goodness, and I'm not just talking about the characters. The many gadgets in this film were very cool and were obviously well thought-out and designed. For eye candy, this flick does not disappoint.But as for plot? It can get a little confusing if you don't closely follow it.. and that's hard, considering all the great visuals that tend to draw your attention away from the storyline. The plot is not particularly complicated, but the wording and terminology can throw people off. The acting is decent.. nothing great, but nothing -too- terrible. The music is great if you, again, notice it over the rest of the movie.Unfortunately, this looks like it will be the first and last movie from Square Pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"After reading some of the reviews here at amazon... I got a little discouraged about watching FF. Even tho the graphics looked spectacular. At the end I just bought the movie on DVD to see how good it was... and I have to say.. not as bad as I thought.Even tho the acting was pretty bad.. and the script has some flaws... it's still a pretty good movie. I guess the thing the flim will be remembered by it's spectacular graphics. Plus on DVD the Dolby Digital 5.1 track is fantastic... gives the movie some BIG bass sound.Still after the movie's falws and acting... I give it 5 stars cause of the amazing graphics. If you like a good animated Sci-Fi flick... I guess this is the one for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible screenplay brought to life with beauty","review":"Hopefully this will be SquareSofts last movie, they should provide special effects for other movie houses, but should not produce any more stand alone movies, they are no Pixar.What's wrong? Well, the movie is boring and rather dark, it's CGI is amazing and the only saving grace here. It would have also been really nice if Square would have tied into the popular video game series instead of just using it's brand name with no plot tie-ins or relation to the game, it just plan disapoints FF fansTwo whole stars because the DVD is featured."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impressive Animation....but thats it.","review":"The most impressive thing about this film is the quality in animation. Unfortunately, films that just have good look will fail. What I mean is... The story was too linear and predictable. When you watch the movie, you know whos evil, you know whos gonna die, and you know whos gonna fall in love.Bottom line: Its worth seeing once, but prepare for a bland experience from the so called \\"Masters of all things RPG\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Final Fantasy is a fantastic movie.","review":"Final Fantasy:The spirits within has a good story and plenty of action.The visuals are out of this world and the sound effects are amazing.The story is set in the future and the enemys are phantoms that I guess kill people by eating thier soul.My name is Mike I'm 12 years old and I recommand this movie if you like awsome graphics and non-stop action."},{"rating":"1","title":"A LOST FANTASY","review":"This movie is an outstanding example of what digital technology can achieve visually. For this, it deserves 2 stars.What a pity, however, that so much tecnical effort distracted the makers and made them forget the importance of a good plot.This is truly a lost opportunity, an anti-statement in sci-fi.Maybe next time the combination of this tecnicians with the ideas provided in the stories of people like Bradbury, Henlein, Asimov, will achieve the final fantasy: a digital masterpiece that will score as Blade Runner did in its time........"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good graphics, simple story","review":"The work on graphics is worth to watch the movie. Some times you'll do mistake a CG character for a flesh-and-bones person.The story is simple, but it gives you room for a couple of exciting scenes. I would call it a \\"light\\" movie, not to laugh, cry, or think too much (or at all). While watching the movie you might remember Ghostbusters, Terminator, X-men or even some news about military decisions, but much, much lighter.If you liked that movies or like harder things, better look for another option for the weekend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great title and mind blowing graphics","review":"I've seen the title before but never in Blu-ray, and let me tell you its a whole new experience.

I really, really don't care what anyone says, this movie was cinematic gold. The only problem people had with it was that it 'wasn't Final Fantasy.' While I do agree that it shouldn't have been called a Final Fantasy movie, it was amazing either way. I saw it back in theaters when it first came out, and back then I had the 'Final Fantasy fan!' mentality so I didn't really dig it, but I went back and watched it again just recently and can't believe I even had a time where I didn't really like it. I should slap myself. This movie is amazing. End of story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"3 stars for graphics1 star for \\"plot\\"Basically, the graphics are wonderful.

If you're not a fan of sci-fi, then this will be too big of a leap.

Still a good choice for a sci-fi junky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great effects Yawning Story Line","review":"The wonderous awe of computer animated humans and effects were beyond fantastic, but failed to keep me from fighting sleep. The story line was predictable and I still wonder what it had to do with the computer game series of the same name. The voices of Alec Baldwin and Donald Sutherland had about as much feeling and depth as footprint on a tile floor. I found the interactive documentary and DVD ROM features much more entertaining. Save your money and rent; it or better yet wait for it to hit HBO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliance","review":"This movie is sheer brilliance.

[why do you think the company who created the film filed for bankrupcy recently?]the most amazing part of the movie was to be able to create very realistic human hair and human figures, and beautiful other visuals.. everything else falls apart and ruins the film. i you are a fan of the games, do NOT watch this movie, unless you want a reason to disown the games as an act of disgust for the name \\"Final Fantasy.\\"..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredible Graphics, No Plot","review":"The 2 stars that I rated this movie come only from the phenominal computer graphics. They are absolutely amazing. The rest of the movie, however is lacking. With very little plot, this movie is tough to get through, and is almost unwatchable the second time around. Unless all you want is to be dazzled by fantastic computer imagery, stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fangirls honest review","review":"Some of the characters aren't developed as well as I'd liked them to have been. They focus on some superfluous things, and could have really ramped up the interest by removing the focus from those things (to which I wont mention and spoil), and focused more on some character development and character interaction development.Voice acting was pretty decent, animation was good for the time it was created. Story is pretty cliché, ending is typical for anime. The first time I watched it, when I was fourteen or so, and I thought it was pretty bawler. I feel it's appropriate for children 8+, simply because if they're any younger they wont understand what's going on. Given how brain-dead/scatter brained the youth of America is these days, I'd have to say 11+ instead.Overall, it was entertaining and I'm a fangirl of FF, so 4 stars... even though it deserves more like 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking","review":"The only reason I give this movie 2 stars is because it was pretty. Once the eye-candy, \\"wow that looks great, I'm shocked,\\" wears off you have to look at the movie for what it is: A super trite and boring plot that makes you want to use the DVD as a frisbe. See it for the eye-candy, buy it because you always wanted to see how far a DVD could travel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but let the name go","review":"as a movie its a good sci-fi, good story and all, but to my disappointment it had NOTHING to do with the final fantasy series. I guess the spirits were like FF crystals, also the scientist's name is Cid. Also, gaia was destroyed way to easily as if they needed to have a main character die to create emotion. Good movie but the name is misleading."},{"rating":"2","title":"It surprized me","review":"I am not a final fantasy gamer...and i confess...i was a little thrown off in the beginning thinking that i had missed something since i knew nothing of the games. But once i got that out of my head i started to enjoy it. the effects in this was great. Instead of watching the movie as a whole..i found myself watching the shirts move as they walked..and watching more of how well they made this movie that watching the movie itself. I had to watch it twice in order to catch everything. After watching it the 2nd time. I was impressed with it. It was a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"All grain is all pain.","review":"Back when The Spirits Within was released in 2001, the makers added fine artificial grain to give this CGI title a filmlike look. In my humble opinion that was a terrible choice at trying to make an otherwise beautiful CGI movie into something it is not.When the title was released to DVD, the significant reduction in picture resolution virtually eliminated this artificial grain.Blu-Ray does however offer a much better resolution than DVD and this also means it reproduces the grain, much to my annoyance.I would have given this title two stars for story and two stars for visuals, but the grain makes it seems like a high resolution analog release, so I am going to leave out the visual stars.Once again, I realise this is not a flaw in the transfer, but a flaw in the original cinematic production. But none the less, it shows."},{"rating":"1","title":"How about negative 5 stars?","review":"I have almost never been as upset about paying for a movie as after this diaster of a film.

I heard there is another Final Fantasy movie coming out but it's actually the sequel to Final Fantasy seven. Hopefully that one will be much better than this one is and actually have something to do with Final Fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Jesus all mighty. If you havent watched this film in the theater yet, steer clear of it in VHS and DVD. I almost fell alseep watching this! I was highly awaiting for this one to hit the theaters, and i was dissapointed in the highest form. The movie was so bad that it FAILED in the box office misserably, even tho it carried the \\"final fantasy\\" name. The storyline was bad, the ending was bad, and the action was low. If you have problems sleeping at night, i suggest you buy this and play it before you go to bed...youll be snoreing in no time.

I'm not sure why people said it sucked?The spirits of a dead alien race are looking for peace and the planet people live on has the means to create it... how is that not a compellingly original story?The story telling was good. You could easily see the value in the bonds that were created between the characters.There was a love story element...This was good stuff...Unfortunately the voice acting was not so hot. But it wasn't horrible.All and all this is a Visually Spectacular film with more than an average story.The music is solid, the \\"Aliens Movie\\" style space marine types were \\"tough guy\\" awesome!This is good stuff don't let the game fanboys steer you from it.

It should have been called \\"Sci-Fi Spirits\\" or something. :) No characters or villians from the games. No magic or fights.

Unfortunately the whole experience was let down by an extremely silly story, the thought of the earth having a spirit makes the story more fairy tale than sci-fi action which is what I expected. The action scenes are average at best and not in the same league as films like Aliens or Starship Troopers. The bloodless battle scenes are obviously geared to a younger audience but they would not be unable to understand the story with its large plot gaps so I'm not sure what the films target audience is supposed to be. I would have rated this film much higher had the story not been so lame, it is really only worth while watching for the CG effects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Final Fantasy - Cult Hit?","review":"This movie will never be anything more than a cult hit with those fondly termed \\"fanatics\\" such as myself. It wasn't fantasy, they tried to make it reality, and that's where it all went wrong. Final Fantasy is meant to be fantasy, just as it's name says. However, I did enjoy it, and I felt the computer generated images was amazing. I was disappointed slightly at the amount Square strayed from the video games. I'd suggest it for anyone that loves the games, but it's not a must-have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"The scope of the story was vast, but maybe a little TOO vast. Square is used to making stories for 60-hour games, not 1.5-hour movies. If it wasn't so rushed (I don't mean production time, I mean running time), there would have been more room for character development, and I would've definitely given it 5 stars. As for the DVD version, Square will most certainly not disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be a 1 star or a 5 star","review":"We bought this same Screen Tent 4 or 5 years ago.

Well, duh! When I asked why the 1st tent NEVER rotted they didn't know. (I'm guessing that they must have thought it should have rotted!)

Unfortuntately, David Manners as the lead is terribly annoying and ruins every scene he's in. But there are a few twists, and I WAS surprised by the killers' identity.This movie's only real appeal to movie fans lies in the presence of Bela Lugosi, but his role is very, very small and doesn't give him anything interesting to do. His Dracula costar Edward Van Sloan fairs a little better in a more featured role.The DVD of this film didn't do anything to try to clean it up, though it actually looks a little better than some of Lugosi's Poverty Row flicks. But I don't recommend this as a purchase, even at the cheap price; Lugosi fans will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"An awful book.

The entire swat shootout from Terminator 2 is featured here and so is the semi / bus chase from Universal Soldier. How low could artisan entertainment sink to to allow this to happen.

Myth doesn't have that problem. The tactical aspects of the game are amazing; if you hope to survive, you need to know exactly how to use each of your units. You can't rely on \\"tank rush\\" tactics like in traditional strategy games, because in most cases you are completely outnumbered.

I don't know why they turn brown, if they're really \\"pulling out toxins\\" or if it has some herbal stuff that absorbs into your body - I really don't care. As long as I feel better.

They start off like a packet of herbs, but in the morning the part touching your foot is hard. If you bend it, it will crack like that old baseball card bubblegum. I only gave 4 stars because this brand has a funky odor to it, which isn't too pleasant. If you wear socks you don't smell it much though.

I'd been looking forward to this film ever since I read the book by Jean-Christophe Grange and read Roger Ebert's wildly enthusiastic review. That's why the actual experience of viewing the film was such a disappointment. They took a riveting book and threw out so much of what made it memorable, that the resulting film doesn't make a whole lot of sense (if you watch the documentary included in the DVD, wherein the writer and director talk about some of the changes, you'll get a sense of just what's missing). The reason a film like _The Silence of the Lambs_ was so successful was because the screenwriter and director had such respect for the book it was based on. _The Crimson Rivers_ bears very little resemblance to its source material and it is all the weaker for that very reason. All I can say to those who're raving about this film is: READ THE BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tres Bien","review":"J'aime le film parce-que c'etait un film passionannant.

Not surprisingly, the director -- who some may remember for once having made an interesting film -- went on from this to make his Hollywood debut (the stinker Gothika).

The two fall in love, all too immediately. The author has White Shield searching for Janice's lost brother and adopted daughter in a very disjointed way - back and forth to Tacoma - until it becomes boring. A malevolent \\"Stumpy Jackson\\" threatens to upset their lives (about ever fourth chapter). Just as visiting a foreign country does not make a visitor an expert on native lifestyle, the reader cannot learn about the Skokomish Indians by learning that \\"ah-hah\\" means \\"yes,\\" even when the author uses it redundantly.

Not only do the characters not particularly endear themselves to the reader, they \\"fall in love\\" much too easily, and from there, the story becomes so painfully predictable that this novel quickly goes from being a so-so paperweight to a wallbanger and doorstop. What a good romance needs is conflict - and there is no real conflict between Janice and White Shield, making their story flat and uninteresting.What the \\"Savage\\" series needs is either to die off quietly or some new, fresh ideas.

He doesn't have the makings of a good likeable lead character. The answer to the \\"who did it\\" question is so obvious from the very beginning. The book really breaks some of the most defining characteristics of mystery novels, which is: don't make the answer to the \\"who did it\\" so predictable. This must be a puzzle that bewilders the reader to a facsinating degree. The reader should enjoy doing some wild predictions only to be proven wrong later in the book.

I'm a decent cook who makes a lot of Thai food and am happy to try new recipes that sound good.Based on the tremendous reviews, I ordered this book and a bag of Szechuan peppercorns and waited with excitement. Drum roll please...very disappointing. There are only a couple of recipes that seem appealing and it is frankly difficult to tell which ones might be good and which of the many specialized ingredients can truly be substituted without sabotaging the dish if it may have been good in the first place.The book seems rather academic and true to authentic Szechuan, which may be what some buyers need.

I try to watch the amount of fat and starch in my meals, and Chinese cooking usually is pretty good in these areas. I was hoping for some soup recipes or reasonably low fat chicken recipes.

I have seen older Disney movies and most of them insert a bit of comedy in them and some even have a little suspense; however, this one fell flat.

The whole explaination as to why the child disappeared was lame...almost as lame as the special effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disrespectful of Bette Davis talent.","review":"Bette Davis had a lot of good performances in her career, her long career. But as she grew older, she began to parody herself more often than desired. And never was it more obvious in \\"The Watcher in the Woods\\". Essentially, the movie doesn't quite tell anything in particular. We never really understand why this family moves into this house at the beginning, nor their motivation on doing so. Basically, this film has a goal of firghtening the audiance, but it never quite reaches its goal. All the clichés of the genre are cumulated in it. For example, when Bette davis comes to help the young girl from drowning in the lake under the three. It is really unpleasant and disappointing to see such a good actress in such a bad role. This old woman has nothing new to offer as a character. The grief of losing her, which is suppose, to have wounded her deeply, isn't never really shown clearly, except at the end. This movie is just plain old flat. That's all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable suspense for the younger crowd","review":"An English-American family rent a summer home in the English countryside, enabling the father/musician to work on his upcoming opera. As luck would have it, their landlady/neighbor is the reclusive old woman known as Miss Aylwood, played with conviction by the legendary Bette Davis, who appears to be slightly eccentric and rather mysterious. Soon, strange dreams, strange visions, near-death accidents, the appearance of a mysterious girl-in-white, and an unsettling feeling of being watched coming from the woods next to the family's house, all begin to occur. Just what does this loving family have in store for them this summer?One of Disney's first non-G-rated productions is rather enjoyable, if not rather hokey. Nonetheless, it does a fine job in maintaining a gloomy atmosphere, which no doubt heightens its suspense level. Altogether, a fine little Disney ghost story which should satisfy the kids (and the kid in us all) on Halloween night."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was so scary...","review":"I haven't seen this film in a long time, but it will stand as one of the most frightening film experiences I ever had. I don't rememeber how old I was - probably around 8 - when I saw this, and it scared the pants off me. I distinctly remember the part when the younger sister names her dog and writes the name in the window - YEOW! And what about the scene at the river? And the climax was extremely unsettling. I didn't sleep well that night. An amazingly effective film, and I still give kudos to Disney for making it. A creepy creepy ghost story.

Things fall of shelves wierd voices in the night. An elderlly woman who lost her child with no trace, she just vanished. The little girl talking in other people's voices.

I can't help but laugh at it when it tries to be serious:-) Lynn Holly Johnson gives a one-of-a-kind, out of this world (literally) performance. (Air-head comes to mind.) I have no idea how Betty Davis was pulled into this film. I'm glad she's in it though! This cinematic experience leaves some quotes in your mind for life. \\"I looked and looked\\" & \\"She had to push you down to get you free\\" are lines that stick with you for all time:-) This film is fantastic!

I love movies that are spooky because of suspense instead of scary because of blood and gore. The only things this movie suffers from, in my opinion, are Lynn-Holly Johnson's whiny voice and the ending, which was just a little bit too quick and easy for me. Having recently seen the alternate endings available on the DVD, however, I am pretty glad they stuck with the ending they did. It leaves a lot more to the imagination and it does make sense, even though I thought it was too simple. In comparison, it made for a much better conclusion.I wish they didn't describe Bette's character on the back of the box as mean and eccentric! In reality, this was one of the nicer characters she has played! We don't know what is going on with her character at first, and she is a bit mysterious, but you can totally tell she cares for the safety of the two young girls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary fun for the whole family!","review":"I loved this movie as a kid and couldn't wait until my girls were old enough so we could watch it together.

Artists get exposure, fans get to expand their horizons. The album itself is of varying quality, but anyone with any sort of interest in the genre should find something worthwhile on this album. As the cover says, the music consists of gothic, darkwave and ethereal.

So I went out and bought it. Well, I must say, I had a totally different experience: I didn't like it very much! Though I found the instructor Kim Haegele to be very friendly and clear in her directions, I did think that she could've been even more so. Because this was allegedly aimed at beginner's, I think it would've been far more helpful to have someone else besides the instructor demonstrating the modified poses, as opposed to just occasionally flashing them on the screen and hoping that we'll remember them! Needless to say, by the end of the tape, I felt more nauseous and confused than relaxed. For a tape that is truly accessible to the beginning student, I recommend Crunch's Fat Burning Yoga as an alternative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible text book","review":"If your professor chooses this book, plan on having a bad semester.

I must admit to being impressed initially, but the more I played the less I liked it.The pros: Combat and movement controls are superb, inventory system is simple, spell effects are neat, graphics are fairly nice, very stable.The bad: Running, running, running, running... restrictive environments (canyons, dungeons, etc), limited number of items/spells/monsters, terrible voice acting, some glitches in the graphics engine, short (20-30 hours of total gameplay), no replay value.Bottom line: Unless you're a die-hard adventure gamer, wait until this one hits the bargain bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great idea that died by management.","review":"This game had a good look to it but it was rushed to market and it shows.The quests are completed in order with no side quests. The method of transport is probably the marjority of the game; running! If you like watching marathons, then this game is for you.The fighting is predictable as you watch your opponents attack and easily see patterns.The spell list is ok but most of the spells you don't use. The method of buying and selling is confusing at first. The weapons are ok.The final fight was uninteresting. I found one quest(the ice titans) more of a challenge then the final villan.If you can get it cheap, then what the heck.

I was fortuenante enough to come across an old copy of this book from the 70's and am pleased to have done so. I disagree with the person who wrote in saying that the chapter on weight loss is offensive. If you dont respect yourself enough to stay fit then of course your going to find the material offensive. The book is not disgusting it is honest, something which is far to hard to come by anymore in metaphysical literature.

I'd always wanted to get to know more about herbs, but a lot of herbals I've looked at are so dry, so the same.This one was different.

First, Pokemon were too easy or near impossible to snap. Some Pokemon just stand still, while other react to items, making them too easy to snap. On the other hand, some Pokemon never come out, even after \\"Pester-balls\\" pester them. Also, that stupid feature where you can't snap Pokemon's backs because \\"they don't like it\\" seems like a ridiculous add-on. Another flaw (in opinion) is that every level is a \\"course,\\" set out on a railroad track. It would probably be more fun if the little yellow car-thing could manuever freely. Otherwise, PokeSnap was a success. There are many courses, and each one requires brainpower and cunning to reach. They all hold different challenges and rewards, not to mention Poke' diversity! I think this game deserves my four star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little kids fun","review":"This isn't the greatest game in the world. In fact it kind of ...

Another thing that occasionally happens when you get enough points is you'll get new items to attract the pokemon, you can get better shots this way. This game is easy to learn, but hard to master.

I am an avid video game player, yet I don't like this one at all. I think the game is very monotonous, with very little clues or instruction. The graphics are good but the motion of swinging around to take pix can make one extremely nauseous. My daughter is completely lost playing the game but seems to enjoy it just the same. However, it is the least played game in our house -- maybe 1 or 2 x per year. Kirby and Super Mario are much better choices. Pokemon Stadium is even more fun. I'd skip this one or rent it at (...) -- it's not worth the money. Why are these games so expensive?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wake Up America!","review":"This book is an opportunity for the so called U.S. Democracy to wake up.

They really ruined a good thing. When the new version appeared at the local store I bought some and did not tell my family that it was a different ingredient list. The comments went like this: \\"This isn't the same\\" \\"This tastes like a cheap chocolate bar\\" \\"Do you have any Lindt 70% chocolate?\\" and so it went. When my current stash of the old style is gone I will be looking for a new favorite bar.

Looking at all the other reviews, Lindt has made an identical mistake to Coke of releasing a new version and discontinuing the old one.I wouldn't be surprised if its cheaper to make (soy emulsifier wasn't on the original ingredient list and it tastes like they are using inferior coca), but this bar is an insult to the intelligence of every person who's tried the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why???","review":"Oh why did they mess with the old version?

Here goes:What's good: Silken texture, the Lindt trademark, and strong chocolate flavor.What might be good for some: Intermediate \\"dark\\" chocolate flavor, richer than traditional \\"dark\\" chocolate, but without the bite of 85% or 90%. Personally, I like the sharp edge that this only hints at.What's not: Vanilla. I meean, I like vanilla, and the warm vanilla musk fills my nose more than with anything else I can remember - including most vanilla ice cream.

I'd rather eat a Hershey bar. No idea what Lindt is thinking. Their website says they made this change after extensive consumer tests showed folks wanted a \\"smoother\\" taste with a \\"less intense cocoa flavor.\\" Who on earth would buy a chocolate bar advertising 70% cocoa content and expect it not to be intense?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"The new formula 70% Lindt chocolate bar is terrible. Nothing at all like the old formula which was one of my favorites. I wrote to Lindt about this and they responded that marketing research found more people preferred the taste of the new formula bar.I wonder if they used the same company that recommended \\"new coke\\", that British Airways change their tail design, and that Citibank start issuing their PDF statements on 7x14 paper size!Yes, the average American prefers a Hershey bar to most other chocolate, no surprise there. It's what we grew up with. But they're not going to pay $2 for one in a fancy dancy euro-style package."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyers beware!","review":"their New Recipe for 70% is totally atrocious and horrible.It's greasy, cheap tasting with soy lecithin \\"to aid the chocolate flowing and molding properly\\" according the their QA.I don't buy it because their other bars are just fine without soy. Keep in mind that the lecithin is most likely derived from GM soy.Many people are allergic to soy - they don't care!Shame on Lindt!

The seller blamed it on Amazon putting in the wrong information. The ad was marked as sold out for a few days. Yesterday I was checking and the same ad was back on. When I contacted the seller they again blamed Amazon. They were again offering a pack of 12 for $[...]. Today they have changed it to a pack of 12 for $[...]. I will be keeping a close eye on them and hope you do too! An honest seller would have checked their listing and honored their ad. They are saying that Amazon confused thier listing with other sellers of this same product.

My mother was an herbal life dealer and I grew up with a wide variety of protiens and other additives. Many drinks are just like eating steak, eggs, and fish. You'd be better off just eating that good food. When you want or need somthing more than food and don't want to put on any fat, or if you want to loose a little fat while building muscle, this is the good stuff. I frequently work nights, frequently 7 days a week, 12 hours a day for a month or more without a break. You need superfood to be healty in that kind of environment. Taking these shakes before bed also works great for cutting fat. Your metabolism will keepgoing all night, you'll twitch in your dreams and burn off fat, in particular because of the \\"lean lipids\\" in the mix. I buy these over amazon fairly regularly and the always get here quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vanilla Cream","review":"This review is only for the Natural Vanilla Cream flavor. Get the regular vanilla, tastes much better and is a great product. I bought this, figuring it is natural and would be a healthier alternative but ended up throwing out the entire container due to the terrible smell. Curdled milk with cottage cheese would be a good description of the flavor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great options without artificial sweeteners!","review":"It's very hard to find decent protein powder options if you're avoiding Splenda and other artificial ingredients.

However, the \\"naturals\\" drink just has a weird, unnatural taste. First time I thought the fruit I was putting in the drink had gone bad, but turns out thats just how the powder tastes. I think its the stevia, and its possible I just have defunct taste buds that dont like stevia, because I know several people that like the stuff. Either way, I would suggest you try something with stevia in it before buying this product.

The first season was amazing and when shows are amazing the second season is put under a lot of pressure. The show surpassed the first season with such ease. Eric Kripke and company filled the season with funny episodes, scary episodes and heart wrenching episodes. This season was also filled with outstanding guest actors. And the lead actors showed just why they got the job. Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki's acting was darn near perfect. They each had their episodes where they shined but the season belonged to Ackles. He showed why he's a former 3 time Emmy nominee especially in the gut-gripping, edge of your seat 2 part season finale. In \\"All Hell Breaks Loose Part 2\\" the season ended with so much promise for season 3. No one is left disappointed just itching for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series","review":"This is one of the few shows on television worth watching. I am afraid that it will not last much longer due to the trend in TV to present irreverent and inane content. The show has shown love between family members and concern for the fellow man.

I can't wait for the third season to come out on dvd....I'm hoping a fourth season is being written and that the show continues to have great success. I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great DVD for those who like the offbeat","review":"Sam and Dean never fail to disappoint. This DVD has great episodes.

Can't wait until season 3 comes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sags in the middle, and then picks up!","review":"We really liked the first season of Supernatural because of its original theme (we love watching scary movies and shows) and because the repartee between the two stars gets to be funny sometimes. Not to mention the fact that both stars are quite hunky. This second season has the same type of stories as the first season, however we found that the writing was a little too soft at the beginning and in the middle of the season, between the 3rd and the 10th episodes. We were actually considering not to buy the next season when it goes on sale, however, as we watched the last 12 episodes of this season we were hooked again. Now we're really looking forward to see the 3rd Season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummo 2","review":"OMG!

Thank you again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING and underappreciated series!","review":"Ever since the show premiered in 2005, I have been HOOKED. Season 2 especially raises the bar and everything just continued to get better and better with each new episode. Both Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki are just amazing as brothers Dean and Sam. Season 2 especially focuses more on them than the monsters-of-the-week from season 1. The last few episodes especially are jaw-dropping and simply wonderful. PLEASE give this series a try, you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"This is an amazing show with a great plot line. Came well packaged and on time as promised.

I was finally able to figure out that disc one will only play on non-blu-ray machines (at least it won't play on my particular blu-ray player, which is a sony BDP-BX1).

Padalecki and Ackles are solid and watchable leads, and the show deserves extra kudos for actually being filmed fairly well, impressive for what I can only imagine is a tiny budget and cgi demands. One senses the showrunner Eric Kripke has earned his keep here: the fact that there are even some genuine scares here and there only seal the deal. No awards-bait here, just good storytelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Questions and Answers","review":"Everything promised in Supernatural's freshman season is delivered in its sophomore offering.

The one thing I didn't like was Dean bargining his soul but that is part of the show. I have to say I love this show and I say this with caution because evey time I really like a show the Ex's of the shows decide for some stupid reason to take the show off the air:Dresden Files,Dark Angel,Fiefly,Stargate SG-1 and there is more.

It looked good, so I decided to buy Season 1 when I found it at a great price. I quickly was hooked, and when I'd finished watching Season 1, I hopped onto Amazon and ordered Season 2. I have to say, I think it was even better than the first season. A lot of series suffer in their sophomore season, but not so with Supernatural. Their series mythology was even more compelling, and woven successfully into their \\"regular\\" episodes; episodes that weren't necessarily crucial to advancing the season arc. I love both of the brothers, their interplay, and the poignancy and sorrow of their tremendous family loss in the destruction of evil. Great series! If you like suspense, and don't mind some horror mixed in, you will really enjoy Supernatural Season 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUPERnatural","review":"I already had the first season so I HAD to get the second one.

I tried uninstalling & reinstalling several times - I could get to the Internet no problems without it on my computer. Checked Creative's Website for a patch or download - of course there was nothing.

This product was one of those purchases I wish I hadn't made. For starters the software wouldn't load. After much angst and downloading software from the mfr's site I got it loaded. I bought it specifically for video conferencing with Messenger. It wouldn't do that either. (no video on the opposite end) All tech support could do on the first contact was direct me to a microsoft site. No information there but more help available for $35. Now I'm contacting the mfr again for ANY instructions on use with Messenger. Most computer hardware is straight forward and not too tough to figure out.

The filming itself was good... as was the background music. The acting not bad. But the plot!!! Once it began unraveling it was very very clear they borrowed heavily from Alien, Predator and Jurassic park. To the point where some actual scenes were recreated such as the scene in aliens where the little girls hands come up through a grate. The scene in jurassic park before the mayhem when they're in the computer room and Samuel Jackson has a cigarette in his mouth while he tries to save the system is another.The Special Effects for the monster were mixed. When it was CGI it was terrible, when it was a costume it fit.If you have time to waste... this is wastable. Otherwise, don't go out of your way to find this one.

The acting in this version was was so painful that I had to turn it off. Not one of the actors tugged at your heart strings and that is the whole reason behind this story.

It also works well for multiple users such as at the nursing home where I work. It can be use for interviews with seniors or to help them participate in group activites such as exercise groups, social meals, or crafts. Even with those who have severe hearing loss but refuse to wear hearing aides, it can be helpful to avoid misunderstandings and frustration. At this price, we don't even worry about losing the odd one if means independance for someone for a period of time. The easy and cheap battery replacement (AA batteries) also mean we don't worry about having forgetful seniors leave them on and let the batteries go dead.

This CD is for the collector, or for the fan who just discovered Love Shack and wants to hear more like it. This CD has some of The B's best early songs, along with some of the wacky ones. This is a party album(as every B-52 CD is), and it's highly amusing. Let's see, we have Planet Claire (a classic song, but highly simple.) Lava with nifty guitars, and nicely contrasted voices. Downtown, a funky new wavish version of the original. Strobe Light, a song focusing mainly on having a good time, sure to lighten up a dull atmosphere. Future Generation, a song as interesting as it is true.

The chapter contributed by Dave Witzke adds further to the substantial information presented. The chapters on photogrammetry, IR/UV photography, special situations, and legal aspects contribute to a very good foundation for grasping the concepts necessary for success in crime scene imaging.

There is an amazing storyline on one hand and on the other, there is a fair balance between problem solving (great puzzles by the way) and fights. The level of violence is fine, Hype never kills anyone, enemies faint when they die and never the player can uses unnecessary brutality. Nevertheless, combats are fun.

'The Pub' is described as a social setting when it should be described as a social ill. The 'Character' chapter starts off with, \\"Moderation means a lot to the English\\".

This book covers them both. If you love couture and embroidery this is the book for you. The text is interesting and the photos are first rate. A wonderful insite into the most famous embroidery house in the world! Take note, this is not a how-to book. It is about the most creative facet of couture history - embellishment. A must have for any fashion and/or embroidery enthusiast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"I didn't realize when I ordered this, that it has 4 subjects in the book. It's a very large book chalked with 6th grade curriculum. My child does public school at home and he needed some extra help getting ready for state testing. This has helped him as we spend 1 hour everyday using this book. We call it, tutoring time. The book is set up in a fun way for the kids, the stories are fun to read and the curriculum has pictures, which kids relate to well if they are visual. My son likes this book and I would recommend it, he is on 6th grade level, he is not advanced nor is he behind and I find this curriculum spot on with the public schools in Texas. We are also using 2 other State books but my son always wants to work out of this one. I think the explanations and instructions are clear and the pictures and content keep it fun. Fun is the BEST way to learn!! My only regret is that I didn't buy this at the first of the school year!!!

The book has great lessons, but perhaps could use a little more instruction.

Bad punctuation, missing words/letters -- but most of all, written in a boring and amateurish style. What a shame -- since the story, based in truth, is very compelling. The presentation and style just got in the way of my being truly moved by this story, when it should have been a service to its characters and content.

I highly suggest this game, as long as you can keep calm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun but...","review":"As a pinball sim, this games falls way short. I hoped that the programers would have been able to come up with a better physics model for the game then what they included. Many targets were too difficult to hit due to the balls tendency to only go in a handful of trajectories no matter where on the flipper the ball was or the speed at which the ball was going. The rumble option ended up being annoying at best.

He prefers the red and yellow versions of the Pokemon game (and can now import those Pokemon into the N64 Pokemon Stadium game).However, I started playing this and quite enjoy it. I guess I'm old enough to have experienced hanging round pubs and playing pinball in my misspent university days, so purely on a nostalgia basis, a pinball game is atttractive!

It's fun and addictive, and the music and sound are pretty cool (for a GBC title). The graphics are great, too. The only minus that removes the star is the fact that the player can't put the PokéMon they captured in the Blue, Red, or Yellow RPG titles into the pinball game (and vice-versa). It would be cool if you can take the PokéMon you captured in \\"PokéMon Pinball\\" and transferred them into the RPG title!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NO GOOD","review":"I think that the game is not that fun because all that you do is just flip the ball up and down on the screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"I bought this game and it was so stupid!","review":"I bought Pokemon Pinball just because of Pikachu. The box has Pikachu on it and it looks stupid. Anything with Pikachu or a Poke Ball is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo stupid and this game has Pikachu sitting in a Poke Ball. That is even stupider. I thought Pikachu disliked Poke Balls. He didn't seem to care about being in a Poke Ball in Red and Blue or in this game he shouldn't be in a Poke Ball either. I hate Pikachu and Pikachu is on the box for this game! He isn't on the stinking rumble cartridge thank god. I played and Pikachu was on the start screen. I closed my eyes and picked Game Start. I picked a table and started in Viridian Forest. I found a Pokemon in Catch Em Mode. It was Pikachu! I took out the game and sold it! The Pokedex is the worst and Pikachu isn't only on the box and start up screen, he is also in the game itself. I sold this game because of Pikachu and I hate it and always will!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Code Enhancers","review":"Pokemon Pinball is a great game. If you're not a fan of Pokemon, don't let that hamper your interest in this game. It is a solid game, and if you complete the level you get the Pokemon you caught. But, you can't choose your pokemon, so if they keep giving you the same Pokemon time after time, use a gameshark to help you earn the Pokemon you want."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing - an unscientific hodge podge","review":"Mr Heinrich is touted on the inside back cover as a scientist. Maybe so, but he didn't bring much science to bear on this book. It is a thinly disguised peon to Barry Sears' work on the Zone, with a lot of personal anecdote and opinion thrown in. The bibliography is telliing - too many popular articles and not too much science. I have nothing against Sears' work - in fact I'm a fan - but this adds nothing to the genre. And boy did I get sick of the phrase 'pasta, pasta, pasta'!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Nutrition or Diet Book, Simply an analysis.","review":"Well written, well researched, but not what it purports to be, nor what many consumers think they are buying. This book is simply an endoresement of Barry Sears \\"The Zone\\" diet, which the auther himself wholeheartedly supports. He even confirms that The Zone is how he lost and maintains his weight. If you want a book that does no more than describe why The Zone works, buy this one. But if you want a plan to meet your goals, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not only the how to but the why's of effective dieting!","review":"An excellent analysis of the theory behind effective weight management.

In fact, as I got it home, I could smell the ink, and feel its texture on the cover. In the UK, many LP covers were actual works of art, with textured or finished card stock, fine inks, often devoid of group name or company logos, and were very close to being 'hand-made' up until the mid-1970's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer release","review":"Probably the best album Renaissance ever released. It contains such classics as 'Black Flame', 'Mother Russia'. 'Things I don't understand', 'Running hard'. These tracks are essential Renaissance. Good sound quality/packaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Beast In The Beauty","review":"Something funny happened on the way to this third album (fifth, if you count the original line-up's two records). The ersatz, chirpy optimism of the first two albums has been replaced by a darker and less circumspect vision. When Haslam sings \\"Know you're dying all the time\\" in \\"Running Hard\\" there is no allegory--it's a piece of advice, and the intimations of mortality hit home despite the soaring melody. (By the way, the stately, majestic raga-coda to that song is arguably the band's finest recorded moment. Absolutely beautiful.) Likewise, \\"Black Flame\\" and \\"Cold Is Being\\" (what would Albinoni think?) manifest a side of the band the first two albums barely hinted at, a side which renders \\"I Think Of You\\" irrelevent and gives the lie to \\"Things I Don't Understand.\\" Sound like they understand better than ever, actually, and have left Wordsworth behind, at least for a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-done dictionary","review":"For any student of the Ilocano language, a comprehensive dictionary such as this is needed.

I found it easy to use. I could feel that my breathing muscles were working harder. After a few times, I learned to breath out slower so I wouldn't build up too much oxygen from the deep inhaling. My only complaint is that saliva drips out of the device. Not a big problem, but I wish it had some kind of containment system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Amazingly","review":"This product works very well. I use it before a workout and it helps me breathe better. I was suffering from shortness of breathe due to being out of shape, and it helped me get back in shape. It also helps to relax when your tense, a few deep breathes allow you to clam down. I gave it 4 stars because it works great. I didn't give it 5 stars because it is expensive for the plasic that I'm sure cost $2.00 to make and then there's shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible chemical taste and smell","review":"Do not waste your time.

But, everything considered, it's a sure bet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read, solid info.. incorporate juices!","review":"Jay Kordich, better known as \\"The Juiceman\\" put together a fine book here. The information about the benefits of being a vegetarian is bar-none, as solid as it gets. There are many great recipes for different juices. I love the section about what each different fruit and vegetable does inside the body. Wonderful information. Drinking but one glass of juice yields as many phytonutrients as most American's get in a few months from food alone. Gary Null, my idol, fully backs up the Juiceman's beliefs.

The book also contains a section devoted to dissecting the health benefits of the various fruits and vegetables. I was a little wary of this portion of the book since Mr. Kordich has no medical or nutritionist background and because he claims that carrot-apple juice saved his life from some serious illness that he suspiciously neglects to mention.

The 2001 release of \\"Everybody's got their Somethin\\" was CRAZY with two hot summer tracks that are still being played on movies and commercials to this DAY! It's funny that people still won't give her proper acknowledgment. Now, four years later I feel like I understand exactly where her spirit lies. I am truly blown away by Nikka's style, voice and tireless energy. \\"Funkier than a Mosquito's Tweeter\\" is a classic cover that Nikka performs with originality and pizazz. With Lenny Kravitz, ?uestlove, Justin Stanley and others (like Wendy Melvoin) kickin in, the vibe of \\"cantneverdidnothin\\" is catchy, fun and memorable. I love it, love it, love it. \\"Till I Get To You\\", \\"Around the World\\", \\"Happy in the Morning\\"-- I don't know where to stop. I love Nikka!

Nikka is funky and workin it, taking us into musical bliss. I've read some reviews on here, please do not compare Nikka to Teena. No comparison. Nikka ROCKS!

There is a good mix of songs, something for everybody, but I like when Nikka's rockin and wailing. My only complaint is there arent more songs! See her live people, it will change your world. (And if you want to hear her really belt it out, try to get a copy of \\"butterfly rocket\\", the cd before \\"every body got their somethin\\".) Anyway, definately buy it, if you like good music then you won't be disappointed! Nikka is hardly hype, and deserves whatever success she gets!

She still keeps the R&B sound going with the singing which is an unique combination. Although my father did not die, I can relate to the whole family disfunction thing and how hard that is. There is that song in which she screams and sounds like a little girl. It was cool because she sounds like a rock star. The only thing that is wrong is the title. What kind of grammar is that?

My Mother continues to play, probably because she has a greater attention span than myself, the teenager. I enjoyed the game at first and it was challenging enough but it did not spitefully mess up your civilization. I found the simple city building things dull because eventually you run out of space to build and then it's just over. There needs to be a high score list too for greater competition with fellow players. The game gets dull after a while but all games do, eventually you forget about it and can go back to it.

Very good graphics, simple interface, and the lowest learning curve I've seen since Diablo. Remember those old commercials for the board game Othello? \\"Easy to learn... hard to master.\\" Describes this to a T. My only real problem with it is that the AI seems as if it could be a little more intuitive; places you think your sims will walk don't, and sometimes sims will stroll right by a non-operational place without working there in a city with 25% unemployment.

No, you will many times go to an area several times trying to figure out how to kill without being killed. It is a challenge before you get very far, which might turn some less patient gamers off, but will keep people who are persistant coming back for more.The graphics are pretty decent for a Nintendo 64 game, but the textures are WAY too visible. The frame rite sufers at times.The control is good, but not spectacular.Overall I would reccomend this for a gamer who as the patience to experience a great game."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring....","review":"if i had reviewed this game 3 months ago,i would have given it 5 stars. what can i say? i lost interest.i mean c'mon!there is absolutely no storyline at all.the point of the game is to run around killing bugs and rescuing teddy bears.fun at first-but wait for some thing better to come out."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a RIP!","review":"In all of my existence upon this mortal coil I have never been so insulted by such an immature attempt at amusement. I pity the individual who finds this so-called \\"game\\" fun and enjoyable to play with. I did not appreciate having to run around and save little \\"bears\\" all the time. Give me a break, here, \\"bears\\", for crying out loud, are we not a little more mature than that? The weapons were so repetitive. How many games have you played where you can get the machine gun upgrade? The enemies, if they can be called that, were a joke, what's the default setting on this game, two year old? Overall the game was not very impressive to me. That is why I never even started the gameplay, personally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do they have any lower ratings?","review":"Could there be a worse game? Jet Force Gemini is highly overrated, it has bad graphics, the choice range for the weapons is small, and it has horrible control. ...I would rate this gave with a half star if I could!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jet Flop Gemini","review":"Jet Force Gemini, a space alien (bug) shoot em' up. In the beginning of the game, you start out slaughtering Mizar's evil forces. Soon the game progresses to nothing but puzzles with little action. Camera angles constantly leave people laying on the ground wondering what hit them. The auto-aim feature is terrible compared to Goldeneye 007's auto-aim. JFG's auto-aim switches camera angles while making your character face a certain way making it hard to explore other areas. To deactivate the auto-aim you must run away from the foe while letting him pummel you just to leave the room. The limited arsenal makes killing the bugs boring FAST. In my opinion, choose a different game such as Goldeneye 007 or Winback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well it's good BUT....","review":"After tearing my hair out for several hours, I came to a conclusion. JFG is a good game, but it's simply no fun to play. Unlike other Rare games like Donkey Kong 64, Bango-Tooie and Perfect Dark, JFG seems more like a challenge than a game: a challenge to see how good you are at video games. If you're a pro, this should be a lot of fun. But for everybody else like me, it gets VERY tedious. And unlike DK-64, Perfect Dark or Banjo-Tooie, it offers very little replay value.About the rating: It's a \\"Teen\\" but that mostly counts for bug 'blood'. There's no human blood or profanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, but could've used some work","review":"Aside from the horrible controls that often leave you dead, the somewhat poor animation, the occasional feeling of never being able to finish a level, this game is great. Filled with fun weapons, enemies, characters, and bug goo, I absolutely loved this game when I was younger. Upon playing it now nearly ten years later, I'm better aware of its flaws, but still enjoy it immensely; this game is one of an above-average level. Probably one of my favorite aspects of this game are some of the great and expansive landscapes; everyone knows most N 64 games just had some background pasted onto walls, but this game doesn't do that (much).I took one star off from those infuriating controls."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best games I've played","review":"Yeah, this is one of the good ones. It has an interesting plot, and there is no obcenities. It is also two player (co op) after you get far enough into the mission. The only problem with this game is that to FULLY beat it, you must collect all these little tribles (teddy bears) to beat midas. There is no blood and gore, except for green blood that squirts when you shoot ants. The only distasteful thing is you collect ant heads.

But once you get the hang of it, this game delivers on all fronts. The sound is excellent, the worlds are beautifully designed, the various multiplayer modes and secrets to be discovered are really cool. Also, once you get to the point where you can swap characters between the different worlds, there is an incredible challenge, which doesn't get boring.

Although it has a couple bugs it is still a great game. It has many puzzles and is also very challenging. It has huge levels and there are three charaters so this game is incredibly large. I recemend this game for anyone who likes a good game and just wants to have fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best ever! A must have!","review":"This game is the best!

The levels are vast , graphics superb and characters involving and gameplay intuitive. BUT it is NOT Zelda ,This is far more shoot'em up than RPG. And it hasn't got the same gritty feel or linear gameplayer of Goldeneye (with JFG you sometimes wonder what on earth you supposed to be doing or where you are supposed to go). It is still a great game in it's own right but if your expecting a Zelda or goldeneye sequel you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jet Force Gemini: An Epic Game","review":"I have been playing Nintendo games my entire life, and just let me say that this is definately one of the best ever made. The depth and challenge of this adventure is stunning and immense. The legnth is perfect for gamers such as myself who despise short and easy titles. The graphics are incredible; everything looks vibrant and realistic. The control, regardless of what some would say, can be mastered (I did so in a few hours), and is no reason to shoot the overall game down. I wouldn't recommend this game for novice players because it is incredibly hard, nor would I for people with short attention spans because it is incredibly long. I would recommend it for anyone who enjoys a good long challenge because you probably won't get one this good for a very long time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating study of a cult","review":"The progenitor of the Salem Witch trials documentary materials collected.

Wow, was I ever dissapointed. Don't get me wrong...it isn't a waste of time to watch this movie, it's just not what I was led to expect. For one, the beast on the cover looks pretty damn cool...well, it's not. In the movie it's pretty lame. As a comedy, this movie wasn't all that bad. It was definitely the comedic moments that kept this movie alive for me, as it definitely wasn't scary at all. This is a good one to rent if you feel you've seen everything in the video store, and you're willing to watch this with an open mind. Oh, yeah...do you believe in the power of the human soul?

It rips off so many movies such as The Exorcist, Evil Dead, and Raiders of the Lost Ark. This is so funny. If you see this, I promise you'll enjoy the off the wall humor. Some reviewers claimed that this was a horror film that wasn't scary, but this is more of a comedy than anything, so if you're ineed of a good laugh, I recommend seeing this movie as soon as possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertainment fit for us college students!!","review":"A friend of mine did sound editing for Soulkeeper, and because I had seen bits and pieces of it without any sound I was rather bemusedly intrigued to see what the plot of the movie actually was. So we rented it one night when it finally came out, and we were pleasantly surprised! It kept a dorm room full of college kids amused for a couple of hours. Definitely keep the comedic factor in mind: don't expect a horror-extravaganza. But this movie is good because it's humorously self-conscious, i.e. it doesn't take itself too seriously and if you don't either then you'll have a quite a few good laughs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horror's New Star","review":"I have to say that there are two things that strike my interest in this world, horror and Deborah Gibson (yes, I am a freak). So to see a movie combining both, was enough to sell me. Okay, so she only makes a cameo, but I'll take what I can get. Aside from her, I found the movie enjoyable. The plot was fairly unique, the sfx definitely up to par (for an indie flick) and the humor, while cornball at times, kept the whole thing entertaining. All in all, an enjoyable watch. The only thing I would change is... yeah, more Deb. As a matter of fact, look for SoulkeeperII directed by me as soon as her people start returning my phone calls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dying display + lousy company response = 1 star","review":"I used to love this product--I even bought four as Christmas gifts! But never again. As another reviewer has complained, the display on my OZ-750 started losing vertical lines of pixels, beginning about 6 months after the 1-year warranty had expired. Eventually I won't be able to read the entries at all. So I called Sharp's technical support folks. I was hoping they'd say that since this is an ongoing and unresolved flaw that directly affects usability, they'd send me the latest model free of charge. Fat chance. They never even acknowledged that this is a recurring problem. Instead, after implying that it was probably my fault for exposing the unit to extreme temperatures, they gave me the number of a third-party repair center. The repair people told me that if the display is bad, the unit can't be fixed. However, if it's a bad circuit board, it can be fixed ... Forget it. I'm done with Sharp organizers. For a few bucks more, I'll buy a Palm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"The author travels all over Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union.

If you're interested in Russia, I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black Earth","review":"If your down, out and chronically depressed this book is for you. The book was written from an extremely negative point of view. The author is a reporter following the same format as the first few minutes of the evening news. One sad story or tragedy after the other. I don't recall even one positve or optimistic comment.The way the author writes is annoying. He starts talking about a particular subject, then with out warning starts on a different subject. Eventually half way through the chapter he gets back to discussing the origin topic. With all the authors travels and research this book had great potential. I do not recommend this book at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very insightful","review":"I read this book while I was on vacation in Russia and the Ukraine. I thought it was quite good, although I thought the section on Chechnya rambled slightly.As far as this book being an example of too much bad news, my response is this is Russia, for God's sake. There is no shortage of bad news there. How could you write an upbeat book about Chechnya, the history of the Gulag, Sakhalin Island (the section about that actually does have some \\"good\\" news), or the mafia state that has emerged in post-Soviet Russia?Face it. You can't. As for this book's merits, all I can say is that reading it made me far more informed about current affairs in Russia (something my Russia tour guides remarked about frequently).If you want \\"cheerful,\\" don't read books about countries with these kinds of problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Russia as it is","review":"Meier writes about the transition pains that Russians have and are experiencing as he travels there from 1995 to 2002. From Chechnya to Sakhalin to Norlisk, Petersburg and Moscow, Meier meets with ordinary and not so ordinary Russians to get a sense of their new post-soviet existence. His knowledge of Russian history and literature makes the book even more interesting as he commonly draws from the past and literature to explain the Russian character. This is by far one of the best accounts on contemporary Russia, a travelogue that gives the reader a real sense of not only what it means to live in Russia today but a good sense of where Russia is headed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show to Watch on T.V.","review":"I loved watching them on reruns on Disney Channel and to find out that they will be on DVD that is so cool.

Unfortunately, the show really started to go downhill in terms of the writing late in the series. (Everyone seems to get this \\"stupidity\\" complex and act dumb all the time, just for the sake of jokes.)But this season truly was inspired by something great. The dialogue is witty and sometimes emotional. The relationships between Cory, played by Ben Savage, and the rest of the cast are truly great and still ring true today. I especially like the episodes when Mr. Feeny, played by William Daniels (the voice of KITT in \\"Knight Rider\\") has something meaningful to teach Cory. (Which in the first season, is almost all of them.

This show is filled with laughs and even better morals for any boy who thinks he wants to grow up so fast. The show is also filled with some of the best characters especially Mr. Feeney who basically helps Cory most of the time with their classic over the fence talks. But i also can't leave out Cory's parents who are also very great and entertaining to watch. There is also Cory's best friend Shawn. There is also Minkus and Topanga who are also great characters. There is virtually no flaws with he box set with great Special features which is the commentary on some of the best episodes."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Show Ever","review":"I am very excited that this show is coming to DVD.

First, everyone of these stories, regardless of actual plot, includes the use of kif (marijuana). Secondly, this is one of the few true Beat works that is set outside of the American continent. In fact, it is more a collection of folk tales inspired by a merge of Jewish, Moslem, and European cultures. It was not unknown for the Beats to travel to such exotic places as Morocco.

I am a firm believer than the cover of a book can indeed change how you view the stories inside that book.The stories are wonderful, and the insect studies at the end of the book are very interesting. The insect studies talk a lot about Chinese origins of stories related to them, especially butterflies.The stories themselves are great, and the way Hearn writes is very smooth and not boring. This is a book everyone should have a copy of if they are interested in short stories, or Japan.This is the kind of book you can re-read in a few months and still enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap","review":"Incredibly cheaply made item.

Being a sci-fi buff, I though \\"what the heck!\\". We were happily surprised! The wife and I were both addicted after just 1 or 2 episodes. In fact, she bought seasons 2 & 3 while I was on a business trip, not having finished season 1 yet.Jonathon Frakes involvement with the project was a pleasant surprise to me, being a long time Star Trek TNG fan. The several episodes he directed showed his excellence in bringing suspenseful, yet thought provoking stories to the screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"TiVo does it again","review":"I have to say, the only reason I picked up this series was because my TiVo randomly recorded something like the 6 and 7th episode in season one.I had forgotten about this series until that point. I remember liking it when it was on- in no small part because of Shiri Appleby (hey, I'm a guy, what do you expect). Naturally, I had the curiosity to see if I could pick the first season up on DVD. When I checked here and saw it for $15 (at the time) I thought why not.Upon finishing the first few discs of the first season I promptly bought the second and now am eagerly awaiting the third. And waiting, and waiting..."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's about time!","review":"All I have to say is that this was a great show that should have never been cancelled. Even though we, the fans, couldn't get it back we sort of compromised and asked for DVD Box sets. It took us about two years but our hard work paid off. This sounds like a great box set and it will greatly appreciated it my collection. The only thing I ask is that the unaired pilot be included in the third season, so everyone can have every episode. I have already preordered this set and I am sure to be happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!!","review":"I have been a Roswell fan since the pilot and was very upset at what the networks did and then took it off the air. This is truly my all-time favorite tv series. I love the 1st season, but I want more - I want the other seasons to come out. I know so many people will buy all 3 seasons if you give them a chance. The DVD brings back all the memories and feelings that I had when I first watched it. I will watch it over and over again. It has me waiting for more. So, please continue with the last 2 seasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show","review":"Season One of Roswell was one of the best shows in the series.

We now have two Disc 1's and no Disc 4. BE SURE TO CHECK YOUR DISCS IMMEDIATELY!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING... Key scenes have been BUTCHERED!","review":"Because of the extreme greed of the music companies, the Roswell DVD's lost a lot of music, and the producers only did a half-hearted job of picking replacements that lived up to the originals. In particular, Max and Liz's first kiss now has a very lame song over it instead of the original Gomez song. It ruins a well-known scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show","review":"An amazing supernatural show that will capture your attention. While I found the whole Ms. Topolsky storyline a bit rubbish, the season was pretty good. The Max/Liz scenes are addictive, and Maria and Michael are an interesting dynamo. Unfortunately, Tess comes in to annoy the audience, but she has her moments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ah, Yeah, Roswell","review":"You know, I remember when this show debuted I thought:\\"The storyline seemed kinda interesting.\\" Although, I could never find anyone who was an avid watcher. That should've been a tip off right there. I found this show to be extremely boring. The first few episodes are a complete snoozefest. I was really expecting a lot more from the writers, actors, etc. It was as though someone said: Let's get a bunch of pretty people in a drab environment and see if we can make a hit show. I was really dissappointed with this one and grateful at the same time, 'cause I was on the verge of buying all three seasons at once. Thank GOD, I said lemme see how season 1 goes and take it from there. I will give the writers credit in one area, they did not take years to get to the bottom of the sheriff finding out whether those kids were what he thought they were. This show was just not for me. But prices and delivery from Amazon is always GREAT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome!","review":"Ive never been a believer in aliens, i don't believe in them now, but for some reason this TV series caught my eye on TV. i loved the drama between all the characters. the show has a rather large number of star characters. Max, Liz, Michael, Maria, Isabel, Sheriff Valenti, Kyle, Tess, Alex. The next season has more.Every character has an important part. The story is really too long for me to summarize. All i can say is that everything begins when Max heals Liz after she is shot by some men in the restaurant. Max has had a crush on Liz since childhood. Liz refuses to let it go. Max tells her the truth and Liz is now tangled in the life of an alien."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roswell Season 1","review":"Just completed the series and loved it.

It is worth every penny. Some of the songs have been changed...but for the most part you do not notice it. The only place where it is very obvious the songs have been changed is in Sexual Healing. The Cafe scene where Max and liz makeout,\\"I smell Sex and Candy\\" song is not used. The one they used in its place is not good....but other than that the DVD is great. Also check out \\"Sexual Healing\\" with commentary on option where Shiri Appleby and \\"Maria\\" are talking...it is so funny. Plus we learn that Shiri like all of those makeout scenes with Jason Behr and that \\"Maria\\" was a little envious...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Includes cutting edge songs selected by the original music team!","review":"And then,when you watch the whole thing,you realise the songs from the TV airing are still replaced.Don't they forgot to mention these cutting edge songs are NEW or am I just wrong fussing about it?!..."},{"rating":"2","title":"If only it was avaliable in australian format","review":"roswell was definately one of the best tv programs ever! i only wish that it was avaliable for its australian fans to buy in a format thet we could play here! :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Just saw it this year","review":"I was amazed at this show. They don't have stupid teenagers but real human beings [and aliens ]. I'm sure I didn't watch it because of the title.It is like watching old friends now. Got my sister hooked and several others. I don't believe I'll ever get tired of it. Just something so different about it. Something always happening and keeps your interest. I now own all the episodes. Just wish there were more. A movie about what they are doing now. Cross between the immortal and the fugitive. The Immortal starring C. George and the fugitive starring D. Jansen. What a great series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dawson's Creek...WITH ALIENS..","review":"This show is absolutely horrible. Period.The acting is terrible, the main plotline about descendents of aliens undergoing teen angst between battles with \\"evil government\\" types who want to control them, is tiresome. The only real good thing is the opening song by Dido. Just like Smallville, this dreck is for ritilin-addicted 14 year olds who think that this show is something greater than the invention of fire.This DVD collection simply puts all the garbage into one gross pile."},{"rating":"2","title":"2010 and a Cult classic?","review":"I saw this show when the pilot aired back in early 2000 and was very impressed or hooked you could say. The show quickly became one of my favorites and I watched as much as I could. Nowadays they do not play it on the Scifi(SYFY) channel anymore. I just watched season one which i bought in 2005 two days ago. This made me instantly addicted again so I came on amazon to see that I could buy all 3 seasons for 48bucks.

I am disappointed muchly.I just wish i had the original soundtrack it brings back so many good memories."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"I just purchased Season 1 of Roswell. I had never been able to watch the whole season until now. I live in Canada and never had the WB until the show was moved to UPN in the third season. I had to watch it on The Space Channel. They did have a Roswell marathon but having a small child I could not watch it everytime it was on. No matter I was hooked! Now I own the series and I have watched it twice now! I do not even notice the change in the music. In my order there was a note from Jason Katims explaining the change in music. He said it came down to changing the music or not releasing the DVD's. I think he deserves a pat on the back for going through with the release. He did a great job. I do not like change but if it means I can see Jason Behr and Shiri Appleby whenever I want then change is good! I highly recommend this set to anyone that every watched and enjoyed the show. It is too bad that it was only three seasons!

Can't wait for the rest of the series on DVD, especially season 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS SERIES","review":"I remember rushing home everynight that Roswell was on. I can't explain my joy when I opened my mailbox and found Roswell in it. The show is great. I love the connection between Max and Liz. I know many people complained about the music being replaced. I really didn't feel it as much as the others. I will say this, I am happy the theme song (Dido, Here with me) stayed the same, I LOVE THAT SONG! I think this is a collection a Roswell fan should have. Oh let me tell you this too, my dad even bought his own copy! That's how great this series is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed and Confused","review":"Where is this gag reel they write about??? I knew I shouldn't expect much considering the fact that the show got short changed every chance it could. Season One Roswell was the best by far and I suppose I wanted to have it on discs...good quality instead of the countless videotapes I have.What they don't disclose is that they have changed the music in some scenes. I have only watched two episodes \\"River Dog and \\"Blood Brother\\" so I don't know how much they have ruined the episodes. The originals worked, they should have left well enough alone. Unless they could not get the rights to the songs. Who knows.At any rate. You'd be better off just enjoying your video tapes, unless you don't mind spending $42 on something that has been tampered with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This is the best show ever, I love it!

I have hope again that we will have well written television shows that have great story lines, inspiration, and actors. 1999 was a great year for television."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roswell the way it should be.","review":"I came late to the roswell craze i caught it last year when sci-fi channel was replaying it. I was impressed and fell in love with the story line. So when i herd that it was coming out on DVD i preordered it in Dec 14. It was in my mail box two days after the release date. I was surprised when i read the note that is included in the box set about the music. I feel that replacing the music or not releasing the series was a challenge for them and Im glad they chose to replace some of the songs in it. I am a huge wide screen fan and was excited to see that all 22 episodes are in wide screen. I cant wait until season 2 comes out sometime this summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"<3 The #1 Roswell Fan ever <3","review":"I love Roswell so much and hope and can't wait until they come out with the second season because the first was just amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extras?

But for those under 25, or those who just like watching teen angst--this show is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be \\"duped\\"","review":"This is just another way for Fox to suck money from consumers. There is nothing new with these sets, but the package art. Katharine Heigl was not the star of Roswell as this new cover art makes it seem. I feel offense on behalf of the other actors on the show. This is just a way to sucker \\"Grey's Anatomy\\" fans into buying this.If Fox wanted to spend money on something, they should have shelled out the money to restore the original music to the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT SCI-FI SHOW AND A GREAT LOVE STORY","review":"First off, the dvd set is wonderful, everything works as promised. An amazing amount happens in the three seasons. Fortunately the writers were actually able to bring a very cool ending to the show when they found the show was cancelled. So the show runs from season 1 to season 3 quite smoothly. I am a male, and I really like the love story element in the show. Roswell is unique in its ability to bring off drama, suspense and comedy all in the same episode. You will not regret buying this and it is nicely priced, especially compared to such sets as Farscape and the last 2 seasons of X-Files."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show!","review":"When I first saw Roswell (in 2004), I was 17 years old, and going through a really bad time in my life. My dad had just passed away, and I was extremely depressed for several months. One day I turned on the TV hoping to find a show or movie I could get lost in, when I found Roswell. I fell in love with the show from the get go, mainly because it was the type of show my dad would watch, in fact after telling my brothers and sister about it, they informed me that he had indeed watched it. After watching a 8 hour marathon of the show (taping the last 5 episodes) I was hooked. I began watching everyday, and now I'm purchasing the first season, because I am still in love with the show today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smallvillesh type series for the family","review":"I ordered this series because I am a SciFi fan and remember watching the series when it first aired. My children are fans of Smallville and thought this series had a similar feel to it. This series satisfies my science fiction preferences and also entertains my young teenagers with the relationships of the characters. This SciFi series is a well written epic of 3 teen aliens trying to find out who/what they really are and what their destiny is. I recommend this for young teens and older. Enjoy it with the whole family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait to buy this DVD!","review":"I'm very excited to see this show finally coming out on DVD. I guess just like many other fans here I was so dissappointed that this great show was canceled. It was so different from anything else out there, that I think this should've been the reason for the network to keep it on. Interesting plot, very cute and appealing charachers/actors, combined with just enough drama to keep things heated, and plenty of humour to keep you smiling."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazig show","review":"I always enjoyed the series when it was on The WB, but when it switch to UPN I lost track of it. Amazon had all 3 season at an unbelieveable price & I had to buy them. This show works great acting w/ creative story lines into each episode. You won't be disappointed w/ the Roswell. Get all 3 seasons & enjoy the alien goodness!"},{"rating":"2","title":"About time!","review":"I have been waiting so long and now that I have the first season what I really need now are the next two!!!!!!!

I've seen at least one other review with the same problem. Hope the replacement is correct.This is a great series. Enjoyed it again through disc #3."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank You!","review":"Overall, no show has ever moved me like this one did. Yes Season 2 and 3 might have been lacking during some episodes but overall the best short lived 3 years of tv I've ever had the pleasure of watching. The Christmas Episodes made me cry... I'm a guy for the love of God! You want something good for you and the whole family to watch? Look no further. I have never pre-ordered anything until I found out about this."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting and enjoyable","review":"This is a really good series, well done and interesting! The acting is quite credible and the episodes are all very enjoyable. I think that Max and Maria are the two best characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite shows","review":"I kept telling myself that this amazing tv show has and still is underrated and i can't understand why. This tv show is one of the best sci-fi shows i have ever seen and i would recommend this to anyone who likes a good teen/alien show."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little love in Alien form...","review":"You know I started watching this show way back on when it first aired on the WB. My first response...Aliens...Give me a break. However, I must say that I started watching it and was hooked. I have seen every episode and still watch them, as reruns on the Sci-Fi channel. I hope that you all enjoy the Show as much as I do~"},{"rating":"2","title":"Roswell is done so well!","review":"Roswell was one of those shows, to me, that started when I was really young and when found flipping through channels, found this show. It would be a lie to say I watched it but I watched some scenes and in early November of this year, found myself with this great idea to watch the show. I knew I could get into it. I'm obsessed, I can say. Every single episode of Roswell is amazing (of course some are better than others) but this show is so amazing. All the characters are so real and this season never goes downhill...it goes uphill! Get this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Crash Landing","review":"This show was a great introduction to teen dramas, especially if you are a sci-fi and fantasy fan. The richness of the characters and the complexities of their relationships makes this an accesible show to just about anyone. The cast was also well picked with Jason Behr as Max and a career making role for Colin Hanks, who played Alex in the first and second seasons. I also felt that the blend of strong story, great sci-fi action, and attractive female leads helped to make this show a great watch. I strongly recomend buying the DVD version of this season. It includes some great music changes that better accentuate some of the more intense moments. A great watch, go buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A missed series","review":"If you enjoyed the show this set will be a nice collection to have. However, i didn't read the reviews here and was skipping around watching the special features and listening to commentary and the first episode i saw was Tess, Lies and Videotape. I was quite surprised that the chemistry scene that had used Sneaker Pimps' Six Underground song had now disappeared with some incredibly dull new song. The music of the series and songs used by their music department were a big part of the driving force of a lot of the scenes and i hope they can license the other songs for any other dvds they produce. The show was great, but really the episodes don't quite match up with the originals because it's lacking the original soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humor and adventure mixed with angst and struggle","review":"This is not your typical teen angst show, though. It's about some regular human teens and some others who happen to be from another planet and were engineered rather than born. They have special powers which they are unable to hide for very long, as the others in the small town of Roswell soon find out what's going on.The stakes climb higher as we get to the end of this season and the alien teens are in danger not only from their own neighbors but from others who want to control or destroy them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I Loved this series. I was so excited when I watched this season. It had everything that a good series should have. A great cast, drama, mystery, and good dialogue. The first season of Roswell was catchy! It brings the wonder of science fiction to live and makes it real. I love the characters; each one was unique, but at the same likable. This first season enticed me to buy the second and third seasons. Aliens on earth is a wonderful concept, and this series brought that to life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roswell Season 1 review","review":"Love this show. Its great.

If you missed this great series on television, you now have a chance to see it on DVD. It offers something for everyone.

Now, if they will just get around to releasing the next two seasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's about time!","review":"This has got to be the only TV show that has ever moved me. It has captured something so rare that you don't see on shows today. I will always be a Roswell Fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good series ruined by bad DVD release","review":"For some bizarre and inexplicable reason, the producers of the dvd went in and replaced the original score of this series. One of the highlights of this show was that it featured throughout each episode a soundtrack that represented the the time it was filmed...the original music is a part of the series in the same way the title song is a part of the show. To have gone in and altered one of the key ingredients in such a blatant way has done it a great injustice and frankly, it really ruined it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Album - without the great vibes in this remaster","review":"What an incredible album, recorded and mixed at the legendary Hansa Studios in Berlin, where Bowie's Heroes was recorded. Oh, wait. This version was mixed recently, using pro-tools, without the wonderful ambience of Hansa... without Gareth Jones and Alan Wilder at the helm.Unfortunately, it shows.However, the extras are worth getting, and I dare say it's worth buying just for an A/B comparison with the original issue just to show how real acoustics beat out convoluted (their word, not mine) reverb algorithms EVERY TIME."},{"rating":"1","title":"CAN'T PLAY BONUS SONGS ON A NORMAL CD PLAYER","review":"Got as a Christmas Present.

I just fell in love with it. It was so magical and mysterious and moving. I felt like I was transported every time I read it.I'd been trying for years to find it so that I could finally have my own copy. I always checked any book store or website I found to see if they had it, but they never did. Then, this Christmas my aunt gave me the best present I've ever received--my very own copy of To Nowhere and Back! She was able to locate it through Amazon.[com.] I was so happy, I literally cried!I just finished reading it again, and it was just as wonderful as I remembered. It was just as magical, and even better, this time it reminded me of how it felt to be ten years old. The twenty year search was definitely worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding display of adventure and daydream.

In the last few years my memory has rested upon finding it and owning my own copy for me and my grandchildren's pleasure of reading. I was dismayed to find out that this wonderfull book was out of print and had been for over forty years. My heart sank. I still have not been able to find this wonderfull book.

The book was already out of print at the time, but I loved it.It was one of the first books that actually caught my attention long enough for me to read it all the way through. Before this book I had regulated myself to the ranks of Sweet Valley Twins books, and the slightly higher quality Baby Sitters Club series. I might go so far as to credit this book as turning me into an avid reader that has resulted in my being an English major today.This was just such a touching and magical story. I wish they would re-release it so that someday I can share it with my children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was really disappointed by this book.

The drawings were quite average and useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting studio alternates of two of his best songs","review":"This is a studio EP (or CD-single) released in support of Grant Hart's solo album Intolerance back in 1988. The first two tracks are alternate recordings of two of the best songs from that album; the third track is a quasi-rap B-side probably done for novelty (one of the verses is mostly about cookies).I like the alternate versions of \\"2541\\" and \\"Come Come.\\" They're paced more calmly than the album versions and have a nice wide mix with some reverb (not too much) and female backing vocals. On the down side, the lead vocals aren't as impassioned --- Grant really raves on the album versions, in his classic \\"Keep Hangin' On\\" style. But if you like Grant's songwriting and voice, and especially if you like the Intolerance album, you'll definitely want to hear these tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite Gardens with A Rich History Are Beautifully Described","review":"It is a pleasure to find one of those rare books that is well written, well researched and informative. Having visited a small portion of the St. Petersburg and Moscow gardens this year, the plentiful photographs are as beautiful as the visually abundant gardens deserve. It would be a rich adventure indeed to visit all of the gardens and parks described in this book. The author engrosses the reader both with his understanding of the cultural history and landscape architecture that comes together to create some of the world's finest gardens and his delight in discovering these remote garden masterpieces.

Required reading for any Jefferson buff"},{"rating":"1","title":"A real let down in the end.","review":"This book is good if you are interested in the events of Thomas Jefferson's life before he became Secretary of State. It is poor if you are interested in what happened while he served in the federal government. The first couple hundred pages are devoted to his law career in Virginia and the next couple hundred to his time in France. It is not until page 493 of 595 that the book gets to the year 1790 when he became Secretary of State. There is only 100 pages devoted to the last 36 years of his life. I kept expecting Mr. Randall to tie in the first years of his life to the events that helped shape this nation but in the end I just felt that Mr. Randall got tired of writing about him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thomas Jefferson: A Life (Paperback)","review":"OUCH!This was a really tough read.I had to read paragraphs sometimes 2 or 3 times as the context was very bland.A lot of information to be sure, but its presentation is less than stellar.Of the first 8 presidents I have read, this book took a couple years off of my life.Not nearly enough about his presidency or his politics in general.I would recommend another book on Jefferson, although I couldn't tell you what one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I felt like I needed to have prior knowledge of Jefferson.","review":"I was a little disappointed with this biography. I never really got used to Randall's writing style. I think he expected the reader to come to the book with substantial prior knowledge of Colonial American history.

The author's blatant disregard for the art of heraldry and utter disdain for the idea of good design will cause this book to grate on the nerves of anyone who appreciates a real coat of arms."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the dogs...","review":"This is a terrible book. It may have started with an amusing idea- coats of arms for breeds of dogs, but the designs are usually hackneyed, trite, or just plain bad. They are also repetitive, so half-way through the book, there's nothing left to see.Basically, it's boring for those who don't care about heraldry, and insulting to anyone who does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for the first couple of reads","review":"This book was interesting when I first read it. I had no idea that there was a coat of arms for every breed of dog. However after the first few times of reading it cover to cover I got bord with it. It really is more of a kids book. But as I said it is interesting only the first few times ( for adults) you read it. I would recommend checking it out of a library rather than buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listed as 'NEW' but received an old, worn-out piece of junk","review":"The seller refunded ALL the cost, including shipping.

For about a few dollars more than a new replacement toner cartridge, I got a cool Canon color copier/scanner/printer that's wireless as well.

After 3 hours of trying they handed it back over to me and gave me a Canon customer service name/email address -- so basically two IT team members couldn't figure it out. I followed up with Toshiba with a few back and forth emails... but after all of that, blood pressure rising, I was actually ready to throw it out the window.

I really enjoyed it, first of all because the stories are totally origional and not clearly derived from other stories or traditions. At the same time, the setting and characters were well developed and memorable. The Dread Mary, Bleakaard the wizard, the magic buttons...it all seemed very real to me, like the better Narnia stories or Le Guin's works.

Gerry Adams helped organise a widespread campaign of bombings, kneecapping, and mass murders as leader of a group of terrorists, before he was justifiably sent to prison. Here, he uses the hardship of prison life in an attempt to arouse sympathy. Are we really supposed to feel sorry for someone responsible for such horrific crimes? The stories of prison torture are rediculous. I don't believe a terrorist, with a hatred of all things British will give a honest account of the UK justice system."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow","review":"Too much beating around the bush here.

Archer only got better over time and this is an early example of how the series grew."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a mystery classic (but don't let that scare you)","review":"I hesitate to call this a classic because some people consider \\"classics\\" as dull and out-dated. And there's nothing dull or out-dated here (well, maybe that paying $10 to be driven from Las Vegas to L. A. is a bit out of date).Archer's hired to discover who sent his client's husband a letter accusing her of infidelity. Introduced to the family and friends at a party as a Hollywood agent, he is sensitive to the growing tension and explosive atmosphere. The reader knows of course that somebody's going to be murdered, but these early chapters are among the most skillfully written to build suspense that I've ever read.Written in 1950, the inclusion of a homosexual couple was quite daring although there is not graphic description, and isn't significant enough a factor of the plot to either offend or attract a reader.Read this and I'm sure you'll find it on your own list of crime classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard-boiled prose at its very best","review":"Of all the classic heroes in hard-boiled fiction (Spade, Marlowe, etc.) I've always found Lew Archer to be my favorite. Maybe it's because MacDonald does such a superlative job illustrating Archer's flaws, doubts and shortcomings. Rather than some iron-jawed superhero, he's a compellingly complex person whose battered conscience ultimately makes him more heroic. Many readers consider The Drowning Pool to be the best Archer book and it's hard to argue that contention. If pressed, I might rank The Way Some People Die just a little bit higher, but both books are so good it's stupid to quibble. I haven't read The Barbarous Coast yet, but look forward to diving in soon.. and afterward I might have to revise my opinion regarding Archer's best case once again."},{"rating":"2","title":"rayjoy@ipa.net","review":"I would have rated it a 7 but 5 is as high as the rating goes.Having been with the LRRP/RANGERS in Nam I really did enjoy the book.

I was wary because the price was low, so I carefully read all the descriptions and other information I could find on Amazon. Nowhere did I find anything that said these were not new. Finally, thinking Amazon would never purposely misrepresent a product, I placed my order. After I received confirmation of the order, I went to the pending order pages and confirmed that I had ordered new HP cartridges. I was sent remanufactured off-brand cartridges. I contacted the supplier, through Amazon, by email and was ignored. I have since seen other complaints about this in Amazon reviews.

The author has yet to master the art of forming a coherent thought or sentence. He routinely writes in the vernacular, rather than a formal researcher's form. Topics are generally discussed by listing a heading, then inserting some ramblings which are devoid of proper paragraph structure and citations. Once you get past the dire lack of high school level composition skills, you find an author bent on slanting his readers toward his own views, which, unsurprisingly, are quite socialist. Rather than begin with premises and present supporting arguments and research, he automatically assumes his own slanted view is correct. I find it hard to believe this book is published and used in classrooms, but I suppose the socialists have to make up for a lack of logical thought with print volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Required text for a course","review":"I don't actually believe in sociology and I think Mr. Thio's reasoning is mushy at many points.

I kept a running list of the questions I didn't find answered in the book and e-mailed them to the author, who is intending to try to answer those questions in the next edition in a few years' time. She was really friendly and answered my e-mail personally, by the way. So if anyone else has suggestions about things that should be added to the next edition of the book, you might want to do what I did and e-mail the author. Her e-mail address is in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank You Ann Douglas!!","review":"Your book was my pregnancy \\"bible\\" for a whole nine months. It is now in my neighbours hands as she goes through her pregnancy, and she loves it too! Giving her a copy of your book is one of the best gifts I have ever given to anyone.Just found out my sister in law is pregnant and I'm planning on buying her a brand new copy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Pre-Pregnancy/Pregnancy Book I've Read So Far!","review":"This book truly is the Mother of all Pregnancy Books. It has so much information in it, tips, and websites such as the website to sign up to be informed of baby/child product recalls the day that item is recalled. I would recommend this for anyone thinking of becoming pregnant or who already is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"This book is very readable and detailed. In comparing it to the famous \\"what to expect....\\", I find that this book is much more laid back and has a more \\"up to date\\" feel. I am having my first child and at 6mths, I still refer to it quite a bit. Very highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a must have for moms to be","review":"This book is great! It is well written with fun facts, helpful information, and great perspectives. It has been the most informative book I've read yet and would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This book was very informative and covered a broad range of subjects. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than most others!!!","review":"I really liked this pregnancy book, it's the one I reccommend to other women. I lost my first baby due to HELP/pre-eclampsia, and this book offered some information, and comfort. It's really not judgemental, even on \\"hot\\" issues like breast vs. bottle, and work vs. staying home. I donatated a copy of this to my local library, I wanted this valuabe info on the shelf for other women in my small community."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This book was extremely helpful. It gives you the pros and cons of pregnancy and doesn't leave anything out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative book","review":"I bought this book for my daughter because of its ratings. She wanted a different one, but when she got started reading it, she liked the fact that every question she had was answered. The format was a little different than she had expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"a wierd combination of flippant and terrifying","review":"I thought this book had some good information (better available elsewhere) but was really flippant about breastfeeding and really scary in its use of statistics. It isn't incredibly well organized, and it has as has been mentioned, lots of typos. I wanted it to be better than it is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"This book looks like it would be a good one but definatly not worth it. It does have some good info about pre conception care and some good info here and there but other wise it basically tells you that your awful if you don't choose to do a homebirth with a mid wife without drugs and if you have a boy you shouldn't get them circumsized. i thought this would help me make choices but instead she pushes only her views and definatly isn't non- biased. I would recommend getting \\"what to expect when you expecting\\" definatly alot more info on every option and with and non biased view they give you the information and then you can make your own choice it also goes week by week to let you know whats going on in your body!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pregnancy primer perfect","review":"After two miscarriages, I was at a loss and needed a book that dealt with my fears and multitude of questions. A friend gave The Mother of All Pregnancy Books as a gift when I found out I was pregnant the third time.What an insightful and thorough book... and honest and humorous. Ann Douglas knows what she's talking about, it helped me through my pregnancy step-by-step. The section on losses was a huge help and going through all the phases of the whole pregnancy was great. I now give it to my girlfriends who are pregnant. Truly one of the best pregnancy books out there in my opinion.Kim(Mother of a beautiful baby girl)"},{"rating":"1","title":"father bashing","review":"After reading the book, as preparation towards OUR pregnancy the book seems to only concentrate and point out that men (future fathers) are not interested in their wife or their kids - other the finance, sports and yes even other women. From a male perspective this book treats them at a very low level despite the fact that we all women and mothers know that a successful pregnancy is done by BOTH parents. Not to mention of how personally depressing it can be to read that I would be on my own, without any affection or support from my husband, it motivates you NOT to have a child at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Had read all the reviews - and was expecting something far better than it turned out to be. I will say it touches on a lot of subjects - but that's all it does is \\"touch\\" on them! There's no more information here than you can find on most pregnancy web sites for free - and it doesn't go into enough detail to offer much help. It's a good book if you don't know anything about pregnancy and want to learn a little bit about a lot of different aspects. But it's not a good book if you are seeking substantial information or meaningful answers to your questions. I think the author just tried to put too much in one book and as a result gave too little on every subject. Think twice about this one - or buy it only if you want simple, basic information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Informative","review":"I strongly recommend this book to anyone who is thinking about starting a family to those who suddenly find themselves without that choice. Ann Douglas has a wonderful way of taking the reader through all the steps. She provides insight and references real couples and what they did in the different situations. What I really liked about it is the fact that she presents different alternatives to handling situations instead of taking a dictatorship tone \\"you must do this\\". She also has a way of presenting the multitude of issues that need to be kept in mind through out the pregnancy in a way that doesn't make you feel too overwhelmed at the prospect of having a child."},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique pregnancy guide","review":"This pregnancy book is quite unlike any other pregnancy book I have read. It covers a broad scope of topics (preconception through postpartum) and it includes hard medical facts and personal stories from pregnant women. The guide manages to touch upon all the pregnancy hot topics and anticipate your worries and concerns through labor and beyond."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Bummer!","review":"This book was a quick read. I flew through it in less than a week's time. Yet, by the end, I felt miserable! I put the book down with the impression that pregnancy is every worst ailment I've ever had all rolled into 9 months. There is much to be paranoid about after reading about all the problems, issues and things that can go wrong. I've read similar reviews about the classic \\"What To Expect When You're Expecting\\" -- that it's a Debbie Downer of a book. I suspect I'll refer to this book as needed and glean a couple facts from it, but overall, it's not what I expected. Instead, I recommend something like \\"The Mayo Clinic Book\\" about pregnancy (for reliable reference and symptom-checking, without scaring you) and \\"Brain Rules For Baby\\" (for a positive, enjoyable read with lots of scientific studies cited.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I prefer the What to Expect Series","review":"I was very disappointed by this book. It contains the same information that every other pregnancy book has but the way it's organized is very annoying. All of the pull outs and blurps scattered in the text are distracting from the content and I found the chapters didn't flow with my pregnancy. I was very excited about getting this book because of all the posative reviews and I didn't bother to buy the What to Expect series because so many people thought this was better. Thankfully a friend gave me a copy of What to Expect which I found informative and easier to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not the Mother!","review":"I just bought this book amongst others and it is average, not \\"the mother\\". Ironically, the book I was most hesitant to buy \\"What to expect when your expecting\\" had more information about DHA, supplements, etc. than this one did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"Really liked this book - lots of useful information. More than just a week by week book, there's information on pre-pregnancy, pregnancy and even information about after giving birth. Glad I bought this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mother of All Pregnancy Books","review":"I am a health professional and I do not recommend this book unless you just want a brief summary of the major topics listed in the title. You'll have to buy other books to supplement the knowledge you're really seeking. It does not go \\"in depth\\" on anything except the explanation of some prenatal testing in some charts. Some of the info is even incorrect: for example, in the \\"nutrition\\" section, the sources it lists as the best oils to eat to get essential fatty acids in your diet is inaccurate (the best source is flax seeds, sunflower/pumpkin seeds). The best books I found for pregnancy were at my local half-price books store, at least here I was able to flip through and read the books to make sure they were worth while. The books I bought there were over five years old but had excellent info."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased","review":"I am not pregnant, but my husband and I are considering having a child sometime soon. Also my sister-in-law is about 23 weeks along in her pregnancy. I found this book to be very helpful for me and my sister-in-law. On top of seeing what other people who are going through some of the same things as you have to say, this book also had a birthing plan worksheet, information on how to contact different Dr's and Midwives, websites for any numbers of pregnancy and parenting concerns and many more very helpful facts. I would absolutely recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Much Information","review":"There's so much information you get overloaded. This book has everything. But its a bit overwhelming for me. I ended up using it more as a reference guide. My main pregnancy book I used was 'Your Pregnancy Week by Week'. I'm not a big reader so this suited me well, I could just read each week as my pregnancy progressed. It had all the same information as the other pregnancy books, but in a more organized fashion."},{"rating":"2","title":"The one & only book you'll need","review":"This is the one & only book that you will need before & during your pregnancy. It is crisp, concise and packed with easy to understand graphs, charts & references about every pregnancy topic. Three things that I referenced time & time again... 1.) The Due Date Calculator, 2.) The Pregnancy Side Effect Chart, organized month-by-month & the accompanying side effect explaination, 3.) A concise month-by-month summary of baby development.This book gives you all the knowledge you need to know without a ton of fluff. It is a quick read, and the way the info is presented, it sticks with you. I found that most pregnancy books on the market are flowerly, sentimental stories and have very little practical knowledge. Althought this book has personal quotes and short stories, it delivers the good to with the knowledge you need to know to get pregnant, what to expect during your pregnancy and practical knowledge for delivery.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive, easy-to-read","review":"This book is full of all the information expectant moms like me want to know, and is written in a conversational style that makes it engaging and easy to read (without being corny, like some books). I'm currently expecting, and I refer to this book all the time when I have worries or questions. I find that it's more informative and engaging than other pregnancy books I've read. Plus, I appreciate that is includes pre and post pregnancy sections."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive and down to earth","review":"A terrific book introducing pregnancy from conception through third trimester. I appreciated the down to earth style, rich with information, including interjections from real people that directly related to the topic at hand. Recommended, especially for the first time prospective mother, before or during the first trimester and beyond."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good information between all the sarcasm","review":"As a first time mother, I was looking for a book that would answer my seemingly endless list of questions. While this book does provide some good information, it is hard to decipher the facts from the sarcastic comments and attempts at wit. Every section and statement is worded in what I assume the author saw as a clever way, but after trying 5 or 6 topics, I gave up trying to get any useful information. If you're like me and are looking for a more straight-forward, well-researched book, try Your Pregnancy Week by Week by Glade B. Curtis. It is by far the best organized and most clearly worded pregnancy book I have read - having tried The Pregnancy Bible, What to Expect (too cynical and scary), as well as The Mother of all Pregnancy Books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"If you are thinking about having a baby or your already expecting this book is a wonderful resource. It gives hard facts but in a girlfriend style. No preaching here! Well, maybe a little about not drinking while your expecting but that is pretty standard in all baby books. The book reads quick and is very enjoyable. I found it full of useful information and able to answer a lot of my big questions but did so without freaking me out or making me mad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I will be a first time mommy and this book definately answered all of my questions and then some!! The author talks to the reader in a down to earth manner, and is organized very well with tons of useful information. I would recommend this book to all pregnant mommies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep searching for a better book","review":"I purchased this book along with a few others and this is the only book that I am disappointed I purchased. I would highly recommend completely passing on this book and getting a more informative book like \\"What to Expect When Your Expecting\\" and or the informative and light hearted \\"Pregnancy Countdown\\" book. Over all this book is a total waste of your time - pass on this book and take a nap instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby book","review":"This book was okay. It of course is a \\"pregnancy\\" book. It touched on several subjects, but alot of the information I was already aware of. This book is okay if you have NO clue about pregnancy or how to prepare for it. It does however have an excellent section on multiple pregnancy or abnormal pregnancy, but that doesn't apply to the average mom-to-be. My husband wanted to read the book with me, but he didn't like it. It was about the yucky parts of pregnancy that he didn't want to know. Husbands need a book about after baby gets here and how their lives will change. That is what a man needs to know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money...","review":"If you walk into B&N; and flip through (not even buy!) the other \\"well known/recommended\\" pregnancy books you'll get much more information than what Douglas offers.If you're lazy/wanting a quick read, this book is for you.If you're looking for a comprehensive tell-all (which the title and reviews lead you to believe), this is *not* the book for you.This was a total waste of money! If I had know it was this bad I would have just used my money to buy diapers instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"HELP FINDING CANADIAN VERSION","review":"I just ordered this version and now feel terrible that I didn't read the reviews first - it seems that this is a US version (even if the publisher is Canadian) I really would like the Canadian version but it doesn't seem to be posted here.... can anyone help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glaring Error","review":"For all the experts enlisted for technical review and such, shame on Ann Douglas for not catching an obvious error on pps 86-87: the cervix is NOT high during the beginning of the menstrual cycle.Incorrect information is bad but to place it in context of pregnancy achievement is blatently irresponsible.After catching this error, the book left a bad taste in my mouth.There are much better books on pregnancy than this one..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent start to your baby reading material","review":"This is the first book i've read on pregnancy, and i'm sure it will not be the last in this vast see of pregnancy books. It is so well layed out in terms of easy to read information, with charts on symptoms, problems that can go wrong and other info. The author writes as if she's sitting down at your kitchen table chewing the fat, in a simple and non alarmist way about the joys and dangers that can occur with births. Excellent resource!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrifying? You've got to be kidding","review":"Another reviewer just described this book as terrifying. I don't know what she was reading, but it wasn't this book. This is a pregnancy book that actually sees the humor in things like stretch marks, popped belly buttons, and the fact that your sex life may end up going AWOL for part of your pregnancy (or that you may have to get a little creative when it comes to positioning thanks to that increasingly big belly of yours). If that's scary, then yes, be afraid, be very afraid..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very realistic description of labor","review":"A lot of pregnancy books really beat around the bush when it comes to telling you what labor is going to be like. This book gives you the facts, and answers all your questions about what to expect from a cesarean or vaginal delivery. You will feel prepared (or as prepared as you can every really be for something you've never experienced before) if you read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who deleted my negative review?","review":"This is my second posted review of this book. Somehow authors or interested parties are able to delete negative reviews, depriving the consumer of information.This book covers the basics, but sorely lacks in medical and nutritional knowledge. The author is a midwife, not a OB doctor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative but not overwhelming","review":"This is a good beginners book! I have since read more in depth (and boring) books but had a better understanding because of the great intro to all things pregnancy from this one. Get this one first!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"Similar to What To Expecting When Expecting but with a little more gritty detailThis book is not about glossing over the rough parts its straight to the point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Answers all your first-time questions","review":"... and some you didn't even know you had. The information in the book is very comprehensive. I'm at the beginning of my first pregnancy, and for a person that used to be relatively worry-free, I've found myself worrying a lot about my activities and so on and how that affects the baby. Douglas gave a lot of detailed, sensible answers to almost any question that I could think of, and when there was some discrepancy between women / care providers on an issue, it was noted, and I appreciated that (i.e. it laid out the facts, rather than preached on what a person should or shouldn't do in those circumstances).The only drawback, and this I can't completely see as a fault, is that the book was SO complete that I ended up worrying MORE about things that I never even dreamed would be an issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy reference","review":"This is an excellent resource which answers the many questions you have. Since it is based on interviews with real woman the questions are about the real things that we worry about. Very user-friendly, fascinating facts, and easy to read. Great to flip through to find out the things you didn't even know you had questions about! I'd also recommend The No-Cry Sleep Solution: Gentle Ways to Help Your Baby Sleep Through the Night - it addresses the number one issue you'll face during those early months and contains an excellent chapter on newborns."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK for expecting mothers, but not wonderful","review":"I bought this book, along with What to Expect When You're Expecting and I definitely prefer the latter of the two. The Mother of All..was not put together in a month by month format, which I've found rather annoying now that I'm pregnant. It also has the author's \\"humorous\\" insights, most of which are cute and unnecessary. It was good reading prior to my pregnancy, but now that I'm 5 months along, I've found it difficult to pinpoint the information I'm looking for unless I turn to the index. I would recommend it for the \\"trying to conceive\\" chapters, which explain temperature charting and provide a chart which you can increase in size and make multiple copies of. I found that I was referring to the book a lot before I was pregnant, but now that I am, I turn to other books which are more reader friendly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"Against the popular positive review of this book, I think this book is awful. The humor in the book is really humorless. It didn't tell me anything new or that other books haven't already said in a better way. And, the first third of the book is on whether you are ready to be pregnant, how to get pregnant, etc. I am already pregnant and didn't expect the book with its title to spend so much time on this topic. On the up-note, it is written at a 4th grade level, so I have breezed through most of the book in a night. I bought another book at the same time, the Mayo Clinic's pregnancy book and like it so much better. It is truly a valuable, well-researched reference book. Although a bit hefty in size, it is truly useful. The Mayo Clinic book I shall keep for a lifetime. On the hand, I am bringing the Mother of All Pregnancy books straight to Goodwill or the recycling bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good advice, but nothing new","review":"Decent advice, but if you've read these sort of books you will find nothing new. How does one objectively give financial advice while shamelessly self-promoting a product for sale? There are better books out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"I have been using this \\"thing\\" for months now and didn't write a review right away and thought if I keep using it for some time it might actually work! First of all you have to spend one minute on each single hair before you can pull it easily, sometimes it doesnt come out at all, and if it did, it WILL grow back (no such thing as permanent hair removal), so might as well go back to the traditional hair removal methods to save time and energy and you'll get the same results,In my opinion, this product is very inconvenient and impractical to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WAIST YOUR MONEY","review":"If you have enough time to use this product than you really need to re-evaluate your life! It says it takes 20-30 seconds per hair-which is actualy quite a long time if you have alot of hair to remove. But it really takes much, much longer, several minutes and I was only able to get it to remove one hair. I tried it on short hairs,long hairs and fine and regular hairs and it was all the same. It's claims of being painless are true, it does not hurt at all to use the item-but if life causes you no pain than your probably not doing anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silk rocks!","review":"I bought this as a 2-tape set for $10 @ Target-- one hell of a great deal! The music is fantastic, Silk is an excellent instructor & very personable & likeable. I'd only ever done Tae Bo instructional & basic & I think that helped a lot, since these tapes are a wee bit more advanced. All in all, it's fun & a great workout. Just keep your eyes away from the background people-- they get, like, every other move wrong & it'll throw you off to laugh @ them... now put down the bon bons... put 'em down... :o) & get Khi Bae-ing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beam receive MUST be on?!","review":"I will start this rant off by saying that I only received the product last evening, so I haven't had much time to evaluate the keyboard -- BUT, I must say this now, because I hadn't seen anyone mention this before. Apparently, you must have 'Beam Receive' ON for the keyboard to work.. (Which uses more battery) ..also, you HAVE to make sure the visor is off, before you dock it into the keyboard, or else the keyboard doesn't work. This is a bit annoying. Otherwise, it is a decent looking keyboard. The included software is a nice bonus.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely handy!","review":"Just picked this up hoping that it would help me get my editing done without having to sit in front of a computer. Three cheers to LandWare for making such a useful product. It's not exactly plug-in and go out of the box, but once you get throught the confusing process of getting it set up and learning all of the shortcuts, it's FABULOUS! I highly recommend it to anyone who spends a lot of time using a word-processor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than the Stylus / Lesser than the Targus","review":"I purchased 2 of these when I pre-ordered and thought it would be worth keeping both to share in the office. I was wrong. While the GoType for the Visor is faster to use than the stylus for straight entry, it was difficult to master the keyboard buttons that correspond to the PDA. It is also a little large to carry in a pocket, although a woman may get away with carrying it in her purse/backpack. At that point it loses the immediate practicality in my experience.I also bought the Targus folding keyboard for a few dollars more when it was introduced, and that would be my Handspring-down choice. The Targus folds neatly into a suit-pocket appropriate size and has a roomy feel when extended for typing. I would say that the Targus is twice the keyboard for 10% more in price. Borrow a GoType to try and then buy a Targus to keep and use. You will definitely prefer the Targus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't compare with Stowaway","review":"I bought this thinking I'd save [some money] compared to the Stowaway. What a mistake! I eventually gave this away and bought the Stowaway and the difference is like day and night. (Shows buying cheap costs more in the long run). The GoType keys are not the high quality keys found on the Stowaway, which are just like my IBM Thinkpad. They are small (spcing between keys vertically is really small) and they rock, and as a fast typist I get occasional errors. It seems sometimes that the keys do not register if I press off center on them, which happens when you type fast. The small size of the Stowaway allows me to carry it everywhere, while I found I left the GoType in the office. So I end up using it so much more. ...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny","review":"All of the material was from Winters' earliest years. Very dated and just not humorous.

Its all about Cookie Monster getting kisses. On his nose, at the door, at bedtime, etc. Its great, all done in rhyming so perfect for reading to the little ones. And the last page has a nice touch and feel insert.The only thing I have to say about this book that is moderately negative is that it doesn't fit into the 0-6 month \\"Stage 1\\" set of the Sesame Beginnings Series. We have all the books in this series, and the other stage 1 books have one or two words per page. This book has much more, and is more suitable to Stage 2, 6-12 months and older. But it could be read to younger babies. It just isn't as simple as \\"Baby Faces\\" or \\"Clang Clang, Bang Bang\\", which are other Stage 1 books in this series.Because of this book my 12 month old knows the word \\"Cookie.\\"Overall, its a great addition to the Sesame Beginnings series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Adorable book","review":"My daughter Rebeca (16 month old) loves this book.

While there isn't a ton of background, with the focus being on the kisses of Cookie, there are cute additions like his pillow case has chocolate chip cookies on it.

That some reviewers report that this may be the only place to find some of this information says more about the paucity of good IBM documentation (or perhaps just the poor organisation of the IBM portal support site) than about the quality of the book.This book is fairly limited to the \\"To save your data, click 'save'\\" brand of instructions (I thought Microsoft owned the patent on this technique?). Since many many portal configuration pages are self-explanatory, much of this instruction is wasted. And aside from a brief foray into Portlet development, which is a not-too-bad treatment for a neophyte, there is nothing for a developer.Finally, the name is misleading.

Having experience with California and Mexican ports, I have thoroughly enjoyed the well researched plot that travels down the California Coast to its conclusion south of the border.This authoress has a gift for drawing the reader into the unfolding drama, and the precise descriptions of various boat ports brings the story to life. All of the elements of a great murder mystery that I enjoy come into play: real locations, greed, unexpected turns, life at sea, psychological insights, etc. This is a very hard-hitting 200 page mystery!I highly recommend both of Lawson's books for casual reading at home or as travel companions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"This book was a complete waste of money. A California sailing couple run into some trouble with some bad guys. After the first two or three chapters the narration starts to wear thin - smug, self-absorbed and prone to pouting is this person. There is a lot of useless dialogue where \`feelings' are evaluated, and vapid pleasantries between characters that lead nowhere. In one ridiculous episode, the wife agonizes about handling some knick-knacks on a shelf in a cop's office, while the husband assures her it's okay that she was \`coming on' to the cop (without even knowing it).

This book just teases you and then leaves you high and dry. As a source of general knowledge, the book is not bad...not good, but not horrible. It's explanations are relatively lucid. As a resource for installing and troubleshooting hardware, the book fails quite miserably. And just to annoy you, after each chapter there are multiple choice questions that the text doesn't answer. At best you have to make a leap of faith to answer the questions from the knowledge the text provides. Don't waste your money. There are far better books out there, and for the price, you can have your pick of the litter.

The PDA (in my case a visor) rocks when you use it, and have you ever tried to pull velcro apart quietly ? Like in a meeting ? Also the battery holders. I have never found batteries to be a hard to find item, and if your batteries run out because you aren't carrying a spare pair, you must be very distracted.

One review mentioned some of it was up on the author's web page so I went there to read it. It was really poorly written, and not even close to being for children. The part I read did not resemble Harry Potter in anyway, but does very much resemble a badly written version of old fairy tales.

Maybe they have smarter kids where Stouffer lives.Secondly, from what little I read before getting so annoyed with the grammatical errors that I had to leave the website, the story is badly contrived, with a plot children won't understand, and adults will find plain ridiculous. The only people capable of reading (and enjoying) this book must have a more powerful suspension of disbelief ability that I have.Basically, if you are really desperate to get your kids away from the TV and make them read, give them something like Roald Dahl's \\"Matilda\\" or Philip Pullman's \\"Northern Lights\\".

He told me, and I quote, that is was 'kinda boring and stupid'. He then proceeded to play with his Star Wars action figures, but that's besides the point.I then had my parents read it, of whom handed it back to me fifteen minutes later with bewildered looks on their faces.

It makes me sick."},{"rating":"1","title":"How is a child supposed to read this?","review":"That was the first question that popped into my head after reading this book. It is aimed at children 4-8, but there is no way a child this young can fully grasp the horrific post-nuclear land that Rah and the Muggles live in. It's quite depressing really. And any children older than 8 are going to be bored with these creatures in a matter of seconds. There is no substance to the story, no connection with the characters that makes you want to read on. I love reading books, even children's books, but this was a huge disappointment. After all the hype surroundidng it I expected something wonderful...or at least readable.

Purple prose abounds as the author tries too hard to create meaning and metaphor in every simple action or statement. Because of the early investment in the character I continued reading until, only 40 pages left in the book, I was too painfully bored to even bother finishing it. I don't know what happens to the main character. I find that I don't even care.

Someone loses their memory and can only remember up to age 12. There is SOO much one could do with this idea. However, I find myself scanning this book's text quickly trying to find interesting conversation or observations. The book transitions to the scientific side when the main character is implanted with a singular memory from another's life. At this point I lost interest.Though this book does cover some of what could be considered typical responses to losing one's memory after age 12 (you don't know your friends, your wife, you don't remember your schooling, you no longer have the education for your career), I was hoping this whole book would deal with more of those responses. Instead, the choices the main character makes I cannot relate to and then the sci fi event when a single memory is implanted into his brain happens. I guess it is a matter of expectations and I wan't expecting this novel to move to the scientific."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Nicole Krauss can write and Man Walks Into a Room starts very well, exploring what happens when a man loses his memory as a consequence of a brain tumor.

Characters are not well developed -- this may be the \\"point\\" but they drift in and out of the pages uttering wise speeches and then vanish into obscurity or dissolve into vagueness.

The story subject has all the potentials for a great film, but the script was completely unengaging. The story is supposed to span 16 years but it felt like only a few weeks. Nobody ages throughout the film. Most surprising is the weak acting performances from a cast of usually great actors like Kris Kristofferson, Derek Jacobi and Peter O'Toole. David Wenham's lead performance is especially weak as he struggles with a Belgian accent.The Father Damien story has all the ingredients for a great film; unfortunately these filmmakers failed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great man, but an extremely embarassing film","review":"I am well acquainted with the mission of Father Damien and the leper colonies that existed in Hawaii, as I was a Missionary myself at one time.

When I called APC, I was informed that the recall ended in 2008. While I can understand that a company may want to put a time limit on a recall, I am comcerned that I was never contacted by APC to let me know that there was a potential safety issue with their product. I am at the same physical address, in the same company, using the same email address as I was when the units were purchased new from Amazon.

My concern is what is in this product? What types of chemicals or pesticides were sprayed on the herbs? How pure is the oil? The product does not have an herbal scent but rather a chemical smell. What is in this? I worry because the scalp absorbs products readily and these things end up in your bloodstream....that includes any hair dye and shampoos you use. The ingredients are especially important here because we are supposed to leave this on overnight thus giving the scalp a lot of exposure to some unknown ingredients. Keep in mind that the chemicals and pesticides that were banned in the US years ago are shipped to third world nations and frequently re-imported into this country via these types of products. I don't know what is in this and it may be great but I am concerned about the smell...it is not a natural scent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap and effective","review":"Had problems with hair.

I loved both - Coconut and Til oil from different company including any local Ayurvedic company in/from India which has herbs into it.Coconut and Til oil has more than 90% hair penetration after overnight use and I am telling this after I searched and reviewed some studies done on hair products, especially, oil.

They could not believe that this movie showed moms being killed (\\"incinerated - turned into dust\\") right in front of their eyes. What could this director have been thinking? My kids state \\"Kids under twelve should not ever watch this movie - they will be traumatized and will say 'Mom I want to sleep with you tonight'.\\" Mary says that any kid that watches this will be scared forever - kind of like the third Star Wars movie.

But, don't expect a TOY STORY, or their delicious TANGLED, because this is just not that type of Disney movie.Describing it is not easy but if you will forgive the pun, MARS NEEDS MOMS is a down-to-earth story of family and relationships. It is mostly a story of a boy who after fighting with his mother suddenly finds she has been taken aboard a spaceship.

Both enjoyed it and so did I.The film was quirky, entertaining and visually impressive. It did have some gentle fun with its pro-family message. Any mother could do worse than spending a couple of hours watching this film with her son.It seems a travesty that so many paint-by-numbers children's films rake in the cash (Gnomeo and Juliet?), while this film was an historic flop at the box office.

Interviewer Kevin Smith remarks that when the Gwen Stacy character died in the Spider-Man comic she \\"stayed dead\\". (An odd comment since Gwen Stacy was brought back as a clone AND is featured in the current \\"Ultimate Spider-Man\\" title). Another disappointing thing about the disc is the frequent mentions of the Spider-Man movie. It makes the whole thing seem like somewhat of an infomercial for Marvel movie properties.

Although philosophy professor Matthew is not a likeable character, his life after his death becomes very interesting. We follow his experiences in the heavenly/hellish realms as he fumbles his way through unfamiliar mental and emotional territory, meeting and interacting with people he knew on earth. Hinkle's imagery is creative. His writing style moves quickly from scene to scene. And sprinkled throughout the story are new ways of viewing old ideas, a broader perspective of earthly judgments. While the reader most likely will not yet have experienced heavenly realities himself, this book provides imaginative grist for a spiritually-oriented open mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good!","review":"Looks very good.The finish is a little rough (in close), but thats what you get for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good herbal section","review":"I bought this book specifically for the section on which herbs are safe and which are not to use during pregnancy.

This book really answered a lot of questions as to what is great to take to nurture the pregnancy as well as what to take if there are problems encountered. I was also VERY impressed and influenced by Romm's perspective on women taking back their right to deal with their pregnancy as a natural occurrence rather than the way western medicine deals with it almost as a sickness. In addition this book inspired me to utilize the help of a midwife rather than a M.D. during my next pregnancy.

While it does fit, barely, it is too snug and applies too much pressure to the PDA screen resulting in battery drain. The loops for the pen work great if you want an average size pen to stick out of your case 2 inches, and the loops are too big to keep a stylus securely stowed away.

Little elastic loops hold two spare AAA batteries so there's no excuse to get caught with dead ones. The wallet also has a handy stash for business cards, receipts, etc. The only drawback I've found is that, without the Visor hardcover, it's possible to turn the power on and drain your battery. My solution was to put the velcro on the front of my Visor's hardover and have it held in place by the wallet. This allows the Visor to be held in the wallet screen up or screen down. All in all, a great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Wallet and Organizer","review":"I've been using this as a wallet and organizer for many months, and i still think it's great.

As its predecessor could have been as well.There were times where I thought to myself: \\"Did an editor really let that slip? Did that grammatical error really mean to be there?\\" Answering yes or no doesn't take away the lack of fluid writing one should expect of this genre. Thus, this book is sadly disappointing because it makes the story less than what it could be. It could've been brilliantly engrossing.Let me reassure you-- the plot basis is actually quite good. Yet, I felt at times that I was reading some paperback romance instead of fantasy. It was not as original as I had hoped, with a very predictable set of scenarios.I wouldn't buy it. Get it from the library if you enjoy the idea of an anguisette. Your money is better spent elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Kushiel's Dart was a book deserving of most of the praise it got. Kushiel's Chosen proves that, more often than not, lightning does not strike twice in the same place.What in Dart was dramatic, in Chosen is melodramatic. What was sexy in Dart is overdone in Chosen. What was interestingly evil [Melisande, one of my favorite villianesses of last year] is now flat and screechy, reminding me of Rita Repulsa in the old Power Rangers cartoons.Some stories are epic enough to nake into series or trilogies. Some do better on their own. The Terre d'Ange is one of those. Harsh as I know it must be to tell a writer who has poured as much effort into world development as Jaqueline Carey has that she should move on to bigger and better things, Jackie, move on. Characterization is not your strong suit."},{"rating":"1","title":"End it soon, please","review":"'Enjoyed' would not be the word I would use to describe how I felt when reading Kushiel's Dart. It made me uncomfortable, not because of its graphic sex and s/m elements, but because I thought the prose was sickeningly sweet and rich, the marks of a somewhat talented amateur, and I also thought the heroine was grotesquely perfect [jeez! Great in bed and she can SING, too! The J-Lo of fantasy!] But I did like it enough to buy this one. What a mistake.This book shows that an arguably brilliant beginning is difficult to sustain. Ms. Carey told a fine story the first time out, but it is now wearing thin. I don't know if I will bother to read the [hopefully] last of the Kushiel books, but if I do, I am certain it will not be in hardcover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book...","review":"I loved the first book and this second one is a great sequel, dealing with Melisande's spinning web of politics and betrayal and Phedre and Joscelin's rocky relationship. Rocky is one word for it, they spent most of the book fighting in the most bitter manner and yet you know these 2 can't live with out each other despite their natures pulling them in different directions. But when they finally come together at the end its just to short giving how much of the book they were being so hurtful to each other I needed more time given to them to understand why Joscelin changed so much its implied but that isn't enough. I understand Phedre it's written in her point of view so I know how she reached her decisions regarding him in the end. They could have talked more it wouldn't have stopped the pacing of the book if they had and it was necessary given how nasty they both were. But oh well what's done is done and I still liked this book very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kushiel's Chosen","review":"In the second book of the Kushiel's Legacy series, Phedre and her Cassiline, Joscelin, journey to La Serenissima in search of Melisande. But, as always, there is more to the game than anyone suspects at first. Phedre must learn to navigate her way through a whole new politcal climate and use all her wits to try and decipher the clues she has which lead her on a not so merry journey across the seas, where she encounters pirates, gods, and ancient rituals. She is forced to look at herself in a new light time and time again, and make sacrifices she never thought she would have needed.I was happy to see so many of my favorite characters back for a second book. The change of scenery and introduction of the La Serenissiman characters was the perfect addition to her already fantastic mix. The people and the setting meshed in a way that improved the flow of the story. Throwing in the action, which never seems to stop for Phedre, you have the perfect combination for an amazing book.5/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't believe it got better...","review":"After finishing Kushiel's Dart, I wouldn't have believed the series could get any better. The Kushiel's series, and this book in particular, masterfully blends political intrigue, a believable smart romance and great action. I got goosebumps equally from Phedre and Joscelin's story and Joscelin's serious ass kicking.The erotica is never forced, but I'd learned to trust that after reading the first book, it serves to further the story and provide insight into the characters' deepest cores.I'm looking forward to the next book and scared as to what I'll read when it's over, being the last one in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not amazing","review":"All 3 of the books in this series are great to read with the rich detail of the world, and all the great intrigue. Kushiel's Avatar is a good ender book, full of action and the author frantically trying to tie up all the loose ends. Like the first two, there are so many political threads flying around, that after a time you either get it and love it, or you give up on trying to keep track of it all and focus on what is happening with the characters.If you are looking to get into this series, definately start with the first book. If you are browsing for a new series to read because you just finished one, or you have a break between books, this would be great for you.The quality of this book compaired to Dart and Chosen, is very weak. Yes, it is written well, but there are certain things that aren't of the same standard. However, the story is still wonderful, and it is definately worth purchasing just to find out the rest of what happens to the people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flabby and overhyped, but still an interesting read","review":"Phedre is back in her ongoing pursuit of sex and power in the sequel to Kushiel's Dart, one of the most praised books of last year. The early review copies drip with praise that has always been over the top in my mind, but there was no denying that Dart was a startling read. Kushiel's Chosen is a decidedly less impressive. The character of Melisande has gone from menacing to annoying, while Phedre is suffering from Honor Harrington Syndrome; is there no trial too great for our heroine to overcome?The excessive praise heaped on this series is just that--excessive. Which is a shame, because it ends up meaning that the praise that IS deserved--this is a mostly interesting, though not earthshattering book--gets lost in the great hype, which only serves to make the experience disappointing..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fantasy-Drama","review":"Just enough of everything to satisfy. Phedre is a spy, a courtesan, a diplomat, a self-made noblewoman, a pain-seeker, and a vulnerable human being --- and none of those dimensions are give short shrift. There's little here to titillate, if that's what you want, but otherwise it's a good story all around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wowwwwwwww!!!!!!","review":"I'm not going to get into the plot here. Several people have already gone that route. I would simply like to disagree with the many reviewers that claim this book to be somewhat less than the first book. I loved Kushiel's Chosen MUCH more than Dart. There were certainly better scenes in the first book, that I agree with. As a whole, however, Chosen is more exciting. I had read 50 pages of Kushiel's Dart and I couldn't decide if I liked it. I wanted to keep reading because the writing was excellent. Whereas many writers speak to me, Carey's writing sang to me. It was beautiful. But the story was dragging for me. Just a little mind you. It kicked in when Joscelin entered the picture. It REALLY kicked when the Skaldi entered the picture. So, as a whole, from page one to page the last, Kushiel's Chosen was the better book. We're all entitled to our own opinions, of course. Just,PLEASE!, don't let other reviewers keep you away from this book. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been a lot better...","review":"Wow-I couldn't put this book down, not for lack of trying. There was a great plot here, but the characters (other than Phedre) lacked consistency. The writing was over dramatic for my tastes.

The readings never come near to the accurate figure. All readings come out to be different. This is not a reliable scale for weighing when you are looking for something that gives accurate measurements.I should have returned it.

The cover art on the DVD also doesn’t help. It’s as if they figured no one will take this seriously so why should they bother. And yet, the movie pursues the story in a solemn manner, no attempt to pass it off as a joke. The movie begins as a mystery, why are so many climbers disappearing or dying on this mountain. In short order, they soon discover why, and then the problem is how to stop it.I liked that they kept the reveal of the creatures until late in the film, because they are a bit ridiculous. I also like that this film was shot in black and white, to great effect. It helps that several of the key roles are played by capable actors: Forrest Tucker, Janet Munro, and Warren Mitchell (a guest star on several episodes of The Avengers). This movie is a sentimental favorite of mine. I’m glad to include it in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old School Horror/SciFi","review":"Was one of the better ones that scared the hell out of me when I was a kid.

I'd seen this movie several times and was looking forward to seeing it again. When it arrived, I was shocked to see that the movie on the cd was something else entirely. The packaging said the name of the movie, even the writing on the cd said The Crawling Eye. I returned the movie and ordered a replacement, investigating the company Image Entertainment. Same thing happened again. The case was for the Crawling Eye, the writing on the CD was The Crawling Eye but on the CD was another movie entirely, Night of the Ghouls, just like the other. Now I had two let downs. I returned them both very upset. I still do not have The Crawling Eye to enjoy like I hoped. I'm hesitant to try and order it again and have no idea how I'm going to find this movie.

The action is slow-going throughout much of the film, which centers around a human female discovered to have a telepathic link with the aliens, as well as a series of murders in which the victims are decapitated. Later, however, in one of the film's more interesting subplots, the aliens decide to possess the bodies of their victims rather than decapitate them, for the purpose of killing the aforementioned female (they don't want her exposing them with her telepathic ability). The big eye creatures themselves, with their long tentacles, look ok, but film plummets in rating from good to fair because of below average special effects.

Eye had kept an Eye out for it for years. Eye almost lost my head when Eye saw it here on amazon. Eye thought the print might be cloudy but it's clear! Had my friends, Irene and Iris, watch it and they loved it. Wish Eye could bring it to school to show my pupils. It's cheesy but scary, there are many other 'B' flicks that are much cornea. Some of the scenes may leave you Tucker'ed out. Overall, Eye had a ball!!Did Eye say Eye?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story. Cheap effects.","review":"Although made with some truly cheap special effects, this is really one of the best films about alien invasion ever made. It could be said that this is the inspiration for The Arrival.Forrest Tucker stars in this film of alien invasion. Our characters wind up an small Alpine village where a mysterious cloud never moves from a nearby peak.We learn that there are horrible aliens in the cloud running experiments to transform the Earth's atmosphere into one more habitable for them.This is a seriously good plot and the first encounter with an alien is quite well done, but it is obvious at the end that there was not a whole lot of budget for special effects.This one is fun and well done.

The reviews said that it was a decent movie in spite of its title. However, many of the reviews complained that disks were sent that had the correct label but the content was \\"The Night of the Ghouls,\\" a totally worthless movie. Since the reports of the mislabeling were ten months ago I thought that the problem would have been resolved, but no such luck.I contacted Amazon by e-mail and got a reply the next day saying that they would refund my money via a credit to my account; very prompt effective service. I did not contact the dealer who sold the disk through Amazon, but I have to wonder why they would not have looked into so many complaints and taken the disks off the market.

People are mysteriously disappearing or at least their heads are detaching. Alan Brooks (Forest Tucker) has seen this happen before and is familiar with the phenomenon so he is sent to investigate. Also, Sarah Pilgrim (Jennifer Jayne) a psychic in a sister act is compelled to go there; if you do not keep your EYE on her, she has a tendency to wander off in a trance.There is something funny about one of the disappearing villagers that suddenly returns.It looks like the only hope for the town's people is to head for the lab at the top of the sky lift as it has thick concrete walls. The lab is equipped the standard 50's SCI/FI equipment. Yet your future is cloudy (radioactive cloudy). When confronted by a mysterious eye will you freeze in your tracks or do you have a tentacle to be lifted by the experience.Do not watch this movie if you are in a cabin."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cult classic !!","review":"Relive your childhood and be scared again!

One very enlightening message of this nicely written book is the dichotomy of feeling toward the Indians by those whites who lived constantly in harm's way on the frontier and viewed them largely as savages, and the far off Easterners who faced no threat and viewed Indians as \\"noble savages,\\" the view that prevails today as the Indian threat has vanished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful artwork, thoughful quote, intesting info on artist","review":"This is a wonderful book for anyone who loves dolphins, whales and other sea life. It has lots of beautiful artwork with thoughtful quotes beneath. There is also some interesting information on Wyland.First, there is a section on whales, followed by one on dolphins, manatees and other sea life. Next, there are several collaboration pieces. Wyland worked with artists such as Jim Warren & James Coleman to create many stunning pieces.I especially liked one with babies & dolphins he worked on with Janet Stewart. I also loved the section on the whaling wall murals. The walls are shown both in-progress & finished.I found the information on each wall and about how the walls came to be fascinating. A detailed list on of all the walls & their specifications as well as a list of all the Wyland galleries are a nice bonuses."},{"rating":"2","title":"An awesome display of Wyland's work.","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book (and continue to do so). It not only incorporated some of Wyland's finest works but the work of other artists that collaberated with Wyland on some of his murals (i.e. the landscape/sky portions). There is a fine display of diversity, beautiful color combinations, and wonderful surreal artistry. I have enjoyed Wyland's works for many years and I highly recommend this book! The quality of the color reprints of his work is excellent.

I love the film but I'm guessing this particular product isn't what it claims to be. Too bad - you'd think the National Archives would get it right!Update: Upon viewing this DVD, this is the shortened version with no Epilogue. Boo.

It will not teach you much Maple.If you want to learn about lots of things Maple can do, including such mundane things as plotting graphs, writing programs, etc etc etc, go and get a user's manual on Maple or an Intro to Maple book. I made the mistake of thinking this book was going to teach me Maple and illustrate what can be done using moderately common mathematical examples. I was disappointed. The first three chapters introduce basics about using Maple's command/response paradigm, but it covers nothing more than what the author abolutely needs for his subsequent tome on mathematics. The rest of the book has precious little Maple code in it anywhere.My 1 star rating for this book is from the point of view of learning Maple; it might be quite good at what it's real objective is.

I loved this book, and found it all plausible and entertaining right up until the party and the trip to Italy. At this point I felt the coherency of the book started to unravel - just how did Lou get on with Robin? Would it be that easy to lose those underworld connections? And what about Connie and Jacko? Did they meet up or not? Did Liz calm down her excessive spending? Did Bill come to terms with the Olive situation? Usually books by this author are great in they way they are all neatly wrapped up at the end, and while it's easy enough to imagine happy endings for these characters, slightly less harsh editing would have improved this book immensely.

The characters are very real and very Irish, and the book is full of surprises. Several characters go through major transformations in the course of the book, in very satisfying ways.

Two such plotlines was one too many."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyable read","review":"The first Maeve Binvy book I read was \\"Scarlett Feather\\" which I found a bit difficult to get into but I was determined to find out what all the \\"talk\\" was about with this author so I tried another of her books - \\"Evening Class\\".This book was wonderful. All i want in a book is an easy read with a bit of romance to read before I go to sleep at night and this book fitted the bill perfectly.Although there was a large amount of characters in this book, the way it was written made it easy for me to follow who was who, and what their relevance to the story was. The characters were just ordinary people heading off to a evening class of learning italian and their lives were all touched in a wonderful way by their teacher Signora.A thorougly enjoyable book, easy to read and if you enjoy reading before going to sleep at night - this is a good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favourites","review":"One of my favourites of Maeve Binchy's collection.

She seems to always have a way of surprising me and turning the plot in the least imaginable way. The most remarkable thing about this book is how, in her classic style, she brought 20 or so characters together and so keenly intertwined their lives.

After about the 5th character introduction, I found myself thinking, \\"Oh no, not another.\\" In addition, I felt the author spent too much time setting up the story and very little time on the wrap-up. Consequently, there were several loose ends that I would have like addressed. For example, I would have enjoyed knowing what Lou did (or didn't do) to end his relationship with Robin.

Binchy's books, as one reviewer pointed out, are either wonderful or horrible. This particular publication falls to the latter. The characters are plastic, the situations boring and the whole of Signora's background histrionic. The subsequent romance is forced and - once again - Binchy's male lead is an adulterer. Worth skipping. Instead, if you want a good Binchy novel, read Tara Road or The Glass Lake."},{"rating":"2","title":"a goor read for spring","review":"I am a fan of Maeve Binchy, and although I didn't enjoy this as much as the Glass Lake, I still had a hard time putting it down.

I enjoyed reading about Fiona, Lou & Connie & but not Signora or Laddy. Signora's story was extremely long & boring. The idea that Aidan can be satisfied with the creation of this Italian evening class instead of getting the principal position is absurd.

But will she still want him when she no longer needs a hero?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the other Joe Grey books I've read","review":"I wanted to like this book, but I just can't get through it. I like the cats, and I'm able to suspend disbelief that they talk. I'm about 20% through the book, and it's just been focused on a burglar that Joe keeps following. Also, Dulcie keeps trying to get Joe to visit a senior's home. There's just so little happening and what is happening is boring to me. There's been little mention of the humans who I've gotten to know and would like to hear about. I've read three other Joe Grey books, which I thought were fun, but this one leaves me cold."},{"rating":"1","title":"What kind of sick mind wrote this garbage????","review":"I was shocked and dismayed when I read this book. I have read several of SRM's books and enjoyed them tremendously. How could any author, who writes about talking cats, clearly targeting animal loving readers, think it would be a good idea to REPEATEDLY include graphic, sadistic, lengthy descriptions of cute, furry, innocent rabbits being terrorized, mutilated, tortured and devoured with glee by her main chacters??? And, as further insult to animal lovers everywhere, harp on it throughout the book??? I can't imagine WHAT SRM was thinking...oh, wait...SHE WASN\\"T!!!! Maybe she let a cat write this book, except a cat would have likely produced a better product. HATED IT, LOATHED IT, DESPISED IT! I may never read her work again.j"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book, I would reccomend it.","review":"This is a great book for types on building your civilization from scratch. I learned many strategies from this book. It is not like other Civ2 books I've seen, that are pretty much a extension of the manual and the Civilopedia. The only thing lacking is the tip's for scenarios from Civ2 Conflicts in Civilization (to be bundled with Ultimate Civ2: Gold Edition.) It had two pages for tip's on some scenarios, and only a half on others. It also didn't rate any of the scenarios. Still, if you are yet to fully master Civ2, I would buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done and informative","review":"This series does a wonderful job of covering all aspects of quilting. It was well-edited, and the supporting documentation available from the project enhance its value. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"A grim overview of quilts","review":"Shelly Zebart has as much business being in front of the camera as a tree. Her appearance, presentation and delivery are gruesome. She is matched by most of the other tedious, pompous, self-important people who populate this series.I have been quilting for over 30 years. I was looking forward to this program, and I was horrendously disappointed. The film is grinding, ponderous, gritty and just plain sad. The producer has managed to drain all of the fun out of quilts and quilting.If North Korea produced a documentary about quilting, this would be it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed blessing","review":"Very tight. I stripped out the padding and replaced it with headliner material to get a Canon XS and strap in it.The picture that I saw with an SLR and a spare lens must have been a mirage.The belt material is too slippery for the buckle. It was constantly loosening and almost got dropped. It had to be sewed.I am not happy with it, but have to live with it, having found no alternative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes little ones get up & dance!!","review":"This is a great CD! We searched on Amazong after seeing the \\"Move to the Music\\" mini-videos of Larie on Noggin (TV). If Charlotte could dance, she would! At 9 months that would be a feat, but for now she happily squeals and bounces up and down when the videos come on.When we play this in the van we often hear squeals of delight. I don't mind the music myself, but my husband & I have been fans of TMBG (They Might Be Giants) for years. (This is similar - not as good, but great for kids music.) After listening to the Little People's Animal Songs CD - this sounds like music for the gods. (Going to the Zoo will drive you insane!)Since Charlotte liked TMBG when they sent a musical \\"letter\\" on the Blue's Clues Bluestock episode, we may be breaking those CDs out for her to listen to also. If your child likes Laurie then I highly recommend giving TMBG a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's good...","review":"I got this cd for my 5 year old after seeing videos of several of the songs on a website he was playing on. It is a lovely cd with catchy tunes and my son quite enjoyed it the one and only time he heard it, but he now refuses to listen to it again due to one song called \\"Running Down The Hill.\\" He has Asperger's Syndrome and likes his music and other things to sound EXACTLY how he heard it the first time, and sadly, \\"Running Down The Hill\\" is considerably slower on the cd than it is on the website video.That is my only complaint. Other than that, it's a great cd for kids!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is awesome!","review":"This CD is wonderful! We also own Buzz Buzz and Victor Vito. My 2 year old can't get enough of it. What a refreshing change from the syrup-y mass-produced mess that most children's cd's turn out to be. He loves to Do The Dragon and goodness knows the world would probably end if he didn't listen to Pig On Your Head and Song In My Tummy at least 10 times a day. And what is even better is I enjoy it too. Every parent should own at least one if not all of Laurie's albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best!!","review":"I was tired of cds of kid songs being performed by kids. In the car, the 102 kids songs by a choir of children who think they are God's gift to music all start sounding the same. I saw a commercial for Laurie on TV and wanted to try her out. I am SOOO happy I did. Her voice and musical talents are great. Also, she mixes songs that you already know with songs you've never heard before which is a nice change. But don't worry about some of the songs being new and that maybe you won't take to them.....they'll become your new favorites. You'll forget all about \\"I've been working on the railroad\\" and be all about \\"Buzz buzz buzz\\"ing!! I highly recommend! The whole family will love it or at least tolerate it (including dad!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"10 stars for Laurie Berkner!!!","review":"My kids (and ME) LOVE Laurie Berkner, she is the best for kids music and we all dance to all the CD's that we have of hers (and trust me, we have quite a few!!)

It's great clean music for your kids - I take them on the field trips with the Kindergarten classes and all the kids sing along!A MUST HAVE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Catchy tunes that are not annoying!","review":"Our daughter enjoyed Laurie Berkner on the Noggin channel so much we found her album and have been very impressed. This is not the average nursery song collection! Her songs are unique and her voice is very pleasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I'm sorry! I would love to leave a glowing review about this cd but I just can't! As a new fan of Laurie and friends, I just purchased her DVD and loved every song on it! Since the music cd that came with it only has a few songs on it, I thought I'd purchase this one (based upon 5 star reviews) and was sorely disappointed! No where on this cd is the energy and upbeat tempo that comes with her newer songs. It's more, slow,hippie, folks-y kinda music that my daughter couldn't even dance to! Granted, \\"I'm gonna catch you\\" is on it as well as \\"Song on my Tummy\\" and \\"Who's That\\" which are upbeat, happy songs, but I really find that most of these songs are played on the \\"Low chord\\" side which to me is kinda dark (Do the Dragon) for example. Not at all a favorite of mine and I will be taking it back. My advice to you is to listen to the clips provided on this site before you purchase. You may like them! Other than the three I listed, I don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED","review":"Not up to the standard of Laurie Berkner's previous CD's.

Both the cover of the case and the cover of the CD is right: Under a Shady Tree. However, when we listen to it, it is totally different songs from different language!!! What the hell can that happen?! I don't even know if we can return it: since it is opened! But it is totally wrong songs!!! Could somebody help me here? How to contact Amazon? Thank you!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What I feared about music when we had kids","review":"We'd heard so much abut Laurie Berkner's music when we had our first child. Our fears of what kids music would be were assuaged by many friends, and Laurie Berkner seemed held aloft as the torch-bearer for all that is good for kid and parent. Then we heard the music. It's the same shallow-melodied, clumsily phrased stuff that we remember from our youth, only worse. Even our 18 month old, who loves almost all music, gets bored in a nano-second when the songs start playing. We'll be sticking to The Beatles, They Might Be Giants, Prince, Arling & Cameron and our own guitars for a long while."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!!!!","review":"This is a great CD.

Much less annoying than most stuff out for kids these days. My kids are toddlers, but my nieces and nephews are a couple years older and enjoyed the songs as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love this music!","review":"Laurie Berkner is like Nora Jones for kids. I really enjoy hearing her music with my daughter. Great for trips in the car!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"As my five year old daughter expressed, \\"I think this cd was excellent. Laurie Berkner has such fun songs. We like to sing and play, \\"Im Gonna Catch You\\" in the back yard.

My 2 year old loves Under a shady tree!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Music SHOULD be entertaining...and this is.","review":"Our household is LOVING this CD. We also bought Victor Vito and really like it, too.The songs are teaching our 3 and 1 year old daughters so much already, through repetition and rhyming. Very catchy tunes, and if you REALLY want to get hooked on Laurie, watch one of her many videos on display at noggin.com under SHOWS....since we never know when Noggin will be playing her videos, we can log on at any time and our girls can watch and play along with the videos. It's a great break in the day!We all HIGHLY recommend Laurie's CDs, and can't wait to someday see her in concert! The smiles she puts on our girls' faces are well worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My 4 year old loves it!","review":"I bought this CD mainly to get free shipping and knew that it had song in my tummy on it. My 4 year old son has not stopped listening to it since we got it (and his baby sister smiles when she hears it too), he sings along to every song (especially drive my car) and even sings the songs without the CD on. It is pleasent and fun listening for the parents as well. Go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music for the kids!","review":"This CD is fabulous. I have a 7 year old daughter and a 19 month old son. Both just light up when I play it in the car. My daughter loves to sing along while my son just claps and sways to the music. Laurie Berkner's style is so that not only do kids love her music but as an adult I can listen to it without feeling like my head is going to explode after the 50th time listening to it. Her rhythms are diverse and very adult friendly. LOVE HER!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pool Covering?!","review":"I bought this arbor to put over a small swimming pool.

After reading this book, I would rank Bing West among the great war writers as W.E.B. Griffin and Tom Clancy. As an Old Corps Marine, one can appreciate the sentence that Bing West writes....\\"no crusty Marine colonel limping along behind them, telling them what to do.\\" Any Marine would see the allusion to Colonel Chesty Puller.

The title track won first place at the prestigious Sanremo Festival in 1996. Ron is a terrific songwriter. His music is both soothing and moving. What he does not write himself he collaborates with the best in the industry, such as Italian legend songwriter and performer Lucio Dalla. Una Citta Per Cantare is a song that may sound familiar because it was released and sung by Jackson Brown in the U.S. Probably the best song on this CD is Non Abbiam Bisogno di Parole,a very moving masterpiece, signature Ron."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally lame","review":"I did not enjoy this CD an all, and I usually love this kind of music.

Being 16 years of age and not being the same age as the character in the novel, I somehow found myself connected to Mary Ingles. As a reader, you start to place yourself in her shoes and imagine all the hardships. James Alexander Thom did a wonderful job writing this story by delicately describing every scene. Some may say that the story dragged on, but this concept was only for suspense. Follow the River has the classic happy ending that you just want to keep reading on. To enjoy this book you definitely need a nice fire, a cup of hot chocolate and the crisp smell of autumn in the air."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"This is the most depressing and overly descriptive book I have read in a while. I kept waiting for something to change but it never did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Follow the River","review":"Book was very old looking, pages turned dark beige. It was legible but not pleasant to read. It was evaluated as used-good. I would judge it to be fair condition or less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Follow the River","review":"Was very disappointed in the condition of this book.

Color me stubborn, just like Mary and Ghetel. I'm longing for something cerebral to appear. I don't think they've eaten brains yet, have they.An acquaintance went reverently to her bookshelf and lifted Follow the River for me, saying it was the best book she'd ever read. As I went farther down and up that river of pain and agony, I became more sure that she was just putting me on. Then I checked into these reviews. Oh, dear -- stick a \\"tommyhock\\" into my scalp.I promise to write again when I finally slog all the way to page 406. I'm sure enlightenment, or at least lightning and Will's hairy body, will have struck by then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Encouraging!","review":"I choose this book because I am researching my family's genealogy and had heard I was somehow related to Mary Draper Ingles. Was I ever surprised and encouraged by such a women. It made me realize that life's little problems are but obstacles to overcome. I think Mary Draper Ingles can give us all a little encouragement, strength and hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a book I couldn't put down.","review":"After reading this book I haven't been able to find another book that draws me into it like this book does. I am an outdoors person so I could visualize everything that Mary was going through during her journey down the river. I am currently reading another of James Alexander Thoms books. It is hard to compare it to Follow The River. It's the first book that I've ever read three times. I've yet to find a book that compares."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ick.","review":"I know this is based on a true story but I couldn't get past the violence in the first 50 pages or so. It just seems to set the whole book up to be a conflict between the horrible Indians and the sainted pioneers. Yeah, and the reference to the hairy man in Mary's life was just...ick.The true details of Mary's story will never be known. What the author has created here is all speculation. Indians bad, pioneers good. Sorry, they were here first, we were just taking away their land and their game. (And you know what? They were right. And white people got to write the hostly books.) I would love to read the same story from the Indian's point of view.Too many adjectives and too much sensationalism ruin what could have been a pretty good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Childhood....","review":"I have never reviewed a book, however I have never remembered any other book so vividly from my childhood. (And I have read so many!) I read this book for a book report back when I was 11 years old (it was one of those 'choose your own books' type of homework).It was amazing. I got an A, however my teacher did think that the details I gave during class were too much for young minds.I never forgot this work and only remembered because I was trying to think of one of my favorite books, and my mind went straight away to my memories of this book, read more than 20 years ago! Talk about a book you will not forget! This is one of those gems that will live on...for a long time. In fact, I'm going to buy it and read it again. It was a library loaned book, so I've never owned it.Can't wait to have it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this Book","review":"I couldn't put this book down until I had read it from cover to cover.

Modern women are not allowed to be as bold and as fearless and as determined. What are you capable of? Maybe if you are lucky you will find out and it will inspire you to try new things and new adventures and realize your own worth.

I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys history as they travel and a must if you plan on visiting the New River Gorge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Follow the River","review":"As a history buff, I found this book most interesting. It is no doubt a blend of known facts and speculationby the author of what actually happened. Due to his extensive research, however, it probably gives a fairlyaccurate picture of the events. I found out a few years ago that Mary Ingles was my great grandmother ( eightgenerations back) which made the story more personal to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've read it twice and will probably read it again!","review":"I'm a fan of James Alexander Thom and have read most of his wonderful historical novels. This is my favorite. Can you imagine the pain and anguish Mary Ingalls and her family suffered? Can you feel the numbing cold and even more numbing hunger as she walks and crawls her way back home...following the river? The courage, strength and bone-basic will to survive described here are hard to imagine. Few would have survived this true-life ordeal and very few could bring this story to life as well as J.A. Thom does here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Follow The River has to be the best book I have ever read. This is a true story of survival. I grew up in the Virginia/West Virginia areas described in the book and am very familiar with the New, Kanawha, and Ohio Rivers and other surrounding areas/rivers as well. I loved following Mary's journey and refering back to the maps in the front of the book as I went. In fact, I now live on the Ohio River and was thrilled to know that Mary's journey quite possibly lead her through what is now my yard. The physical discriptions of the landscape were right on and the story of Mary's determined spirit was amazing. This is a book you can not set down. I am currently reading Panther In The Sky, also by Thom and it is excellent as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Read....","review":"Read about 25 pages of this book but could not get through it. It is definitely not for the squeamish. I skipped ahead and found out Mary had left her baby behind and the idea of a mother leaving her baby behind was disturbing. Also, the treatment of the captives was graphic so if the reader can get through this it could be a good read as other readers indicated. If you are not one for graphic and horrific desciptions you may want to skip this read...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgettable! Didn't want it to end!","review":"Although I read this book when it first came out in paperback, I remember it as if I had read it yesterday.

I recommend highly to all history/adventure lovers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This was the book I was looking for!","review":"I wanted to read a meaningfull, quality book and I found it in Follow the River. Once you get through the graphic beginng, it's an adventure you can't put down. When I finished, I gave it to my husband who hasn't read a novel in 20 years. We were both impressed by the courage and fortitude of Mary Ingals. It is a well written and truely amazing story of human will. It's been 4 months since we read the book and we still discuss it often.

Along her journey she had to make some very hard decisions.As I read the book, I was aware that it is written from a man's view writing as a woman. I kept thinking that this story would be even better written by a woman with her point of view.I did find myself rushing a little to finish the book in order to find out what happens to her and her family.

It's based on something that actually took place in 19th century Argentina. Camila was the daughter of a wealthy landowner who fell in love with a young priest. She was a very independent woman (many thought too independent for that particular time in Argentina's history). Camila and Kate Hepburn would have understood each other quite well. The acting in Camila is superb, as are the costumes and photography. Imanol Arias, who plays the young priest, is very handsome and I, as a woman, understood why Camila fell for him. The movie deals with the always controversial subject of Priestly Celibacy extremely well.I highly recommend this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"I bought this hoping that it was the story of the Littlest Christmas Tree that was omitted from the CD relase of The First Christmas Record for Children - it is not.

The 'real velvet' they refer to is the colored portion in the middle of the dress. The black part is the cheap somewhat stretchy fabric that Halloween costumes are usually made of. There is a matching hat with a little 'velvet' band around it. Not sewn into place, but that's ok.

Not a hiccup from the watch. The crystal is particuarly admirable. It's had and tough and even after these years and activities, not a scratch on it.Only problem - the clasp of the band is now loose and sometimes opens itself for no apparent reason. I guess I'll send it back for a service, but definitely it's a keeper.These watches have risen a great deal in price since I bought mine (I paid $120) but even so, knowing what I know now, I still think they are more than worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bright Idea","review":"The watchhas the entire face act as a softly glowing backdrop for the hands allowing one to see the time in darkness, It also allows better vision of the time in various levels of light.

These books just keep getting better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"I have read several of the other \\"Murder She Wrote\\" books by Donald Bain, and I must say that this was the worst. There are so many inaccuracies in descriptions. For instance the so-called Indian food that Jessica's friends prepared is actually Middle eastern/Moroccan/Greek. Information like this is very easy to verify. Just go to an Indian restaurant and look at a menu or do a Google search.Jessica is also a big busybody in this one. She sticks her nose where it has no business being. The murderer makes no sense or at least how Jessica arrives to that conclusion is implausible.I loved the television series. It was one hour of relaxation after a hard day of studying. The books, on the other hand, disappoint. Give me Miss Marple any day.

This series could have been just an effortless knock-off capitalizing on the TV show - but it is, actually, quite good and could be a standout stand alone series of its own.

Over The Hedge- Cute, entertaining movie. This- Even when you get past the bulls with udders, I thought that there were a lot of elements of this film that weren't appropriate for children under 10. There were some cool jokes and sparse pieces of snappy writing- Sam Elliot singing Tom Petty was fun, but the animation of the few people in the movie and the coyotes was a little dark and ugly for my kid. I felt like I watched two movies- one was the Nick TV show, the other a kind of stark coming of age flick. The animation style seemed to change depending on which part of the script you were in- it just seemed choppy. Both concepts on their own were decently done (except for the bulls with udders), but there was enough questionable content that I won't be owning this one or even watching it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Third Gender Cows","review":"Anthropomorphisation is only funny to a certain extent and when an animal's original character is preserved.

It's fun, energetic and has enough edge to keep adults entertained. Chris Hardwick shines as quick-witted Otis.Now take everything I just mentioned and remove it. The result is Barnyard the movie. It was both boring and depressing, and lacked any semblance of fun. The fact that this horrible film was the transformed intothe great Nick TV cartoon is nothing short of amazing.Thank goodness Kevin James was too busy or too high priced for the cartoon series.

First, and jarringly wrong, the male cattle have udders. You don't have to be from farm country to know this is just not right. But more importantly, the story just does not hold up. You don't believe the hero's journey from irresponsible youth to man - there is nothing to back it up. The music is too loud and the minor characters are annoying.There are loads of better children's movies out there. I recommend Disney's Cars or Over the Hedge from this year's offerings.

Bulls) were depicted as female cattle (a.k.a. Cows). I don't know who's twisted idea it was to make the bulls with udders. I'm not saying they have to show the male anatomy, they could have just put a ring in the bulls noses (which is common)and left the udders on the cows. I don't know how much city children know about cattle, but country children know what's what and the depiction of bulls (although people keep calling them cows)with udders is wrong and confusing to the children. If they were to make a correct version (remove the udders from the bulls)of this movie it would be a very good addition to some ones movie collection.

However, the writing style is more geared to allow the pre-teen and teen readers to absorb information, exactly the intended audience. I can get the technical details from a textbook.

Needless to say they never actually make it to the hospital. At times this reminded me of The Hitcher (Rutger Hauer version), but with a lighter tone and significantly less sadism.

This is a cool toy as far as being a pretty good replica of a real one but it does not work well in dirt or sand. Fine sediment gets caught in tracks and after a short amount of time, the tracks quit turning. Then the handles on the arm do not move the bucket well. My son has since ripped off the tracks and does not do any digging with it but still enjoys pushing it around. Don't buy this if you want your kid to actually dig dirt, it would be good inside toy or outside but away from dirt or sand.

I am surprised this unit is still being sold. I used this machine once and it was dead the second time I tried to use it.

The only solution offered was that if I had a receipt, she could provide me with a comparable machine. This thing was a gift from my mother...

When it works, the espresso is pretty good - it produces nice crema, warms up fast and the water tank is easy to clean. Unfortunately the water tank is fitted with a spring driven intake valve which is easily clogged or not seated properly. When this happens, the water does not flow through the espresso - instead the pump just runs and runs and nothing happens. Once this cycle starts, you might as well give up - you aren't going to get any espresso until the whole apparatus dries out. Nothing is more frustrating than anticipating your morning espresso and finding out that this machine is not going to work for you that day.

My only complaint is that it is tediously repetitious and could be condensed considerably. \\"Eat Fat Lose Fat\\" by Enig & Fallon covers much of the same material and much more besides. However, by sticking to just one main topic this book offers more didactic punch to the average layman who doesn't want to be challenged all at once by all the dietary changes suggested by Enig & Fallon. So, start with The Coconut Oil Miracle and then progress on to books by Enig & Fallon."},{"rating":"2","title":"THe Miracle of Coconut Oil","review":"Was very impressed with this book. It does not contain the usual opinions of a person, the author has backed up his theories with extensive research. I did skim over a lot of the scientific stuff as the depth was a bit much for me. By the time I was a quarter of the way through the book I was convinced of the message. I like the recipes that are included and made coconut biscuits that were scrumptious. I have been using coconut in my cooking everyday now and it is easy to make the change. Having the difference explained between animal saturated fat and coconut fat was of interest to me. I do think that many health professionals just go with what is being said instead of properly checking the research themselves and thus we have a commercially born aversion to coconut oil. Easily written and a joy to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"coco for coconut!","review":"I have had coconut oil for sometime. I have used and then forgot about it. After reading the book, I started using it as one of my main cooking oils. I love the slight flavor and also the side affects. I can feel how soft my skin feels the next day. I have also started using it for boody lotion and it works wonderfully.. Next time I get a massage I am taking it with me.My girlfriend found out that she had skin cancer on her hand. They removed it and it was a very deep cut. They told her she would scar and I made her take some of my coconut oil and made her promise to put it on a couple of times a day. She has been doing that for a little over a month now. That scar is almost gone... she is now putting it on everywhere.I personally love the fact that I am using something that is natural.I would say this was a very good find for me.

However, after a month, I gained up to 125 lbs. I think I originally lost, because the oil upset my stomach and it does clean out your system. So it did NOT rev up my metabolism or give me energy. I cook with it, and use it in my hair, but that's it. I stopped taking it by itself and went down 3 lbs. At first it cured my sugar cravings, but only for a couple weeks.

I was hoping for a readable overview of Thailand's history to enhance my stay. Unfortunately, I came away less than satisfied with Wyatt's book. It was long and tedious. His writing style is pedantic and dull. The author clearly knows his subject well, but his treatment of Thai history was long on details, presented chronologically, but short on interpretation. Surprisingly, there was little in the book about how Buddhism affected the course of historical events. After finishing the book as the plane touched down in Bangkok, I had assimilated a number of important facts about Thailand, but I didn't feel that the book gave me the chance to understand the sweep of Thai history. Yet, my research did not find any other book in English which covers the subject.

This unfortunately is only necessary but not sufficient to write a readable book.The author faithfully recounts which king invaded what place when, he tells us the outcome of that battle.....The book does not tell us at all, how the people lived, what their social behaviour was, etc. In other words, the reader does not get a feel for how life was.The period fron the 80's onward is poorly covered.

Two characters in this movie are in love and the snow queen tampers with that. So the movie is basically about a woman searching for her love. She goes through the seasons to do this. EAch place she has to go through is magnificent. The visual of each season is very appealing. Hallmark has a way of taking you to a different place with their fairy tales, and this movie is no exception to that.On the down side: the begining of the movie is boring, and you start wondering what is this movie about. You also start hoping that its not another one of those old fashioned hallmark movies. Well it only drags in the begining of the movie...just to set the story up. After the snow queen steels her man, the movie is fantastic and exactly what you would expect from hallmark.Overall, its still a great movie, but not 5 stars for starting off slow."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Like....Drag....Queen of the Snow","review":"The lavish budget did provide many beautiful costumes, sets, and location scenery, but the simplicity and innocence of Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale got lost in three hours of paper-thin acting, a very poor screen play, dreadful dialog, bad film editing and lousy direction from David Wu."},{"rating":"1","title":"Indescribably boring and pathetic.","review":"This film deserves an award for one of the worst ever made. It is about two and a half hours too long and simply lacks a plot - it is an insult to the memory of Hans Christian Andersen. The acting was pretty awful as well. I did wonder whether the entire cast and crew were suffering from the effects of several illegal substances - perhaps driven to using them by the sheer banality of the plot (I use the term loosely). If you have not seen it my advice is to avoid it altogether. It is not one of those films that is \\"so bad that it is good\\", it is just bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"I was disappointed in this film. It was too long.

The story was too drawn out. As far as the Snow Queen was concerned, she needed a valium to calm her down and possibly help with her quicksilver mood swings. The polar bear was a creative idea, but why was he there? and why did he turn into a human in the end? I did enjoy the love story, but the young man didn't seem to get a grasp on who he wanted. Add the heroine with her journey to get her love back, and this three hour production became very frustrating for the characters and the audience. The love story seemed rushed, if it could be rushed in three hours, and a bit unbelievable. I felt they should have developed that more and maybe edited the Fall Queen's story, or even the long drawn out scenes with the Snow Queen. Ultimately, this movie was a disappointment to me. I was looking for something with more emotional substance. If you agree, try watching Snow White. It is a wonderful story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snow Queen Flop","review":"Right as I'm writing this review, I'm watching 'The Snow Queen.' And I'm really, really disappointed.It's really, really, REALLY LAME.The movie starts out well with good music, good atmosphere and passable acting. It's like this until we see the adult Gerta, and the whole movie goes downhill.The script is horrible; it makes one feel as though the writers deliberately chose the most awkward phrases for this movie to make one flinch. The acting is wooden, and the two main characters aren't likable in the least. Although I liked the Snow Queen the first time Gerta saw her (in all her dark-maiden glory), this was lessened the next time she came along. I felt they made a major mistake in making the Snow Queen have an american accent and speak casually - it makes her seem much less regal and imposing.

I liked PHAEDRA, RUBYCON, RICOCHET, and the first and last composition of their live album ENCORE. I also like some of their film music, especially the soundtrack for Friedkin's SORCERER. Now I bought ZEIT and realize one thing. The earlier their music, the better. With STRATOSFEAR it became commercial and went downhill from there. ZEIT allows you to enter a different world, another dimension almost. It's perfect meditation music, not like that cheap new age crap, but rich and moody experimental music. It sometimes makes me think of the FORBIDDEN PLANET score. Can't wait to hear ALPHA CENTAURI & ATEM. Simply amazing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost in Space","review":"I'll try to be brief. This album opens with a very promising string quartet (cellos I think), with intense dense harmony. Then the band switches on the organ and puts a few weights on the keys, and leaves the studio for almost an hour and a half. You sit there (or lie there) and listen, waiting for something to happen, but it never does...then you finally hear a little bit of a click or something, and think something's happening, but after 15 minutes of that you realize it was one of the old electric instruments making some sort of recurring buzzing noise. This album is so boring you won't even be able to fall asleep to it. The background hiss coming through from the original tapes is more interesting than the music. I love TD especially all the 70's stuff, but this was a bit disappointing. I guess they wanted to see how little sound they could put on album, but the experiment failed, in my opinion. For hardcore fans of their early period only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was that a flashback?","review":"No, it was just another boring album by Tangerine Dream.

Beyond the space rock of Pink Floyd or 2001 Soundtrack enthusiasts, this is an aural soundscape of something so subjective that even writing this favorable review seems trite. I have read that many TD fans hate this era of their music and that this album is the equivalant of a gigantic comma...a pause of statement rather than a concrete creation. I disagree. This is my favorite. This is the recorded journey of TD. Only they could know what inspired and moved the sounds they chose.

It's written in first person, and the narrator tells of his eccentric neighbor who comes up with crazy inventions. Each one sparks an adventure which the narrator gets caught up in against his will. I'm sure that the book was hilarious when it was written in 1904, but even today it's still pretty funny. Each chapter contains an adventure, so it's one of those books that you can read a chapter, put it away for a while, and then go back to it without having to remember what had been going on. Actually, I recommend reading it that way, because it'll most likely get tedious if read cover-to-cover (or beginning-to-end in Kindle-speak.)The author writes in a light-hearted, jovial manner so even when there's not an adventure taking place, there's often something to chuckle at.

Whose youth wasn't quirky? Everybody has those \\"remember that time.......\\" flashes of total wierdness we love to revisit. The story does a great job of letting us get to know the characters.

Enter Simon Yuen.The first hour has some decent comedy, but the action is not good at all. Bruce Tong has a nice cameo at the start, but then there are a bunch of weak fights. But then out of nowhere Bruce Li has an awesome fight with Kong Do and 2 other guys. Then Tiger Yang shows up. Yang's first fight is good, but the final fight is a disappointment.2/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay so far","review":"The item was just as shown online, even a little bigger than I thought it was going to be. However, the smell is quite strong..and I am not a person who normally has a strong aversion to different smells. However I guess the combination of oils and such create a smell that to me resembles ginger...and I hate ginger..lol. I've only used it on my daughter's hair once but I will continue to use it (despite the smell) as a hot oil treatment and see if I notice any results. Will update my opinion in a few weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but not great","review":"Has good ingredients and could be nice to have around when your go-to products are out...BUT not sure what all the hoopla has been about. Definitely not a must-have."},{"rating":"2","title":"New user, so far so good.","review":"I have just started a new program on my hair, on March 24th, 2012. I have been natural now for almost 2 years but my hair wasn't properly cared for so I started a new regimen. This is part of it, using this oil to penentrate, and also as a seal.It has a very light smell, melts in my hand or when I rub it on my scalp. I can't say if its the best seal, so I seal my hair again with Africa's Best to ensure that it's sealed. All in all, my hair is soft, there is no breakage, and it's a lot healthier than it's been in years. I started with 2, then ordered another package of 4. I think I'll continue with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I had a day with no plans, so I decided to put the oil in my hair during the day and leave it in. I tied it up in a tight bun, ran errands and hung out at the pool. At the end of the day, I showered with my usual products. Usually, it takes me about 20 minutes to brush through my hair ( thick, wavy, prone to tangles, bleached and fried). I didn't even have to brush my hair, and then I went to bed and woke up, and I just finger combed it. Incredible! I'm not a big fan of the smell either. I also could not see this being used on a regular basis as it does make the hair look super greasy. I'm going to use it as a weekly treatment, and on pool days because I don't care what my hair looks like if it's getting wet. Try it out"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I had expected","review":"I was really excited about trying out this product, but it was not what I had expected. The texture was rather surprising. Instead of a thick liquid, it was more solid and lumpy like grits. This made it difficult to get out of the bottle and apply evenly to the hair."},{"rating":"2","title":"best hair product EVER","review":"I have fairly thin wavy hair and this product makes my hair feel thick and healthy, and look gorgeous. I don't notice much of a smell but I love the smell of coconut anyway so it's a plus to me. No negative sides to this product as far as I'm concerned. I DEFINITELY recommend this!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just recieved this product","review":"Heard great reviews about this product, hope it performs to the hype of the reviews, its light and has a unique smell, makes hair shine, has not made it really soft as they say but I have not used it as a deep conditioner yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL!!!!","review":"I used this twice in overnight treatments for my extremely dry ends and within a week my hair felt 100x better! great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vatika Hair Oil","review":"I've been looking for a great product for my hair as it tends to get very dry. If you have dread locks like I do, you'll appreciate finding a product that doesn't feel greasy and that the hair absorbs fully. Definitely recommend to all of us who have beautiful, natural hair..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"These are junk. I'm very displeased with the entire product. I think radio shack would have given me a better purchase for less money.The plastic bit is very thin. This \\"body\\" was so crappily made the the plug was able to thread a good 1/8th of an inch back in.The quality of the plug itself is also uninspiring. The threads are a cast on, and not even cleaned up nicely. One of the solder points is very weak.Its not even worth mailing these back for a refund because of how little they cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"atleast it has the punisher skull on it","review":"All i can say was this piece of metal crap came scratched and I'm pretty sure it was used. and wished the size was 120mm. overall it useless to me"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Tape","review":"My story is the same - I bought this tape years ago - I think in the 80's and used to do it all the time. Just found it and have been doing it again - my body toally remembers the moves! I think it is a great light workout when you don't have time to get to the gym. I have been ill and find that the tempo really is helping me get active again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This Workout!!!!","review":"I first started doing this workout when this video first came out in the 1980's. I wore the tape out. I bought another one, then lost it. I just got one off of ebay. I also wish Deborah Lee would have put out more of these kinds of workouts. I am able to do it. Some other workouts I've tried are just too hard, but this one is doable. I found a long time ago that I felt better when I did this everyday. So now in my 50's, I'm going to start doing it again. I used to be able to do it without even breaking a sweat. I need to get to that point again. I love this video!"},{"rating":"2","title":"29 minute workout video","review":"I had this tape way back in the day and it was one of the only workout videos I could do the whole way thru. I loved that video and I lost mine. Thanks to Amazon I have found an oldie but a goodie.Thanks alot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheep!","review":"I bought it because of the cheep price. It is a very low impact workout, which is fine because I am 60 years old and just starting to workout after several years not doing so. It has a 70s look, made in the 80s. This is an easy workout that I had no trouble with finishing the entire workout the first time. A very good starter video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I bought this for i believe over 5 dollars i am a deere fan but this was a complete waste of money wasnt gonna send it back it would have cost more then i paid for and the real kicker is i found a bunch local in a hardware store for a buck50 each From my experience the company plasticolor makes many diferent products and not a one that ive seen or used was worth the selling price what ever they make is certainly out there and available from different manufactuers and would not purchase another product from plasticolor"}]`),R={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},N={class:"card-container"},M=["disabled"],H={key:0},B={key:1};function C(a,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",N,[(o(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(o(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(o(),i("span",B,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",H,"See more"))],8,M)):v("",!0)])}const W=d(R,[["render",C],["__scopeId","data-v-e728b5dc"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/31.md","filePath":"people/31.md"}'),x={name:"people/31.md"},G=Object.assign(x,{setup(a){return(e,n)=>(o(),i("div",null,[b(W)]))}});export{L as __pageData,G as default};
