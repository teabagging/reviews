I stayed up way too late 2 nights in a row because I couldn't stop reading. I liked the contrast between the two families; the downs syndrome child brought so much joy to Caroline, while the big mistake/secret damaged the Henry family so deeply. Like Paul, I am unsettled by the thought of what it would have been like if life had taken a different path. I would have liked to see a bit more character development. Caroline, Norah, and Paul didn't always seem like real people that I'd like to know. There was a certain distance to the storytelling. Overall, well worth the time, a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"contrite","review":"i found the characters to be completely unrealistic. A mother who thinks that she lost one of her children at birth spends the rest of her life feeling empty. Her husband, albeit a good man, hides the secret (that their child is alive) from her his entire life. come on, you must be joking. i kept reading the book thinking that the characters would become more \\"real\\" but it didn't happen. and, it's a long book!The husband was a good father to their son yet the sons spends his entire adolescent and adulthood hating the father. ridiculous! if, as in real life, the author would have simply let the boy go through what most adolescents do (disliking their parents) but then turning around in young adulthood, it would be so much more believable.very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected . .","review":"I was really hoping this would be one of those books I would be glad I read. However, I was ultimately disappointed. I never really connected with any of the characters and the ending seemed quite dull. I'm not sure what I was expecting. I suppose I was expecting something a bit more dramatic or exciting. Personally, I thought the book was kind of dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was wrong with these people?","review":"I don't know why I didn't stop reading half way through the book. By the time I finished I wanted to slap the author and all the characters. I realize it was the 60's but PLEASE. Although it spanned a 20 year time period it seemed like everyone was stuck in a time warp. I thought The Memory Keeper's Daughter would have focused ON THE DAUGHTER but she seemed to be an insignificant part of the story. The author dronned on and on with flowery discriptions that really didn't help the story line.I was very disappointed with the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"I found the history extremely compelling at the beginning. But eventually the whole story was a drag.The author seemed to have in mind a Lifetime movie for her book and spent all the time with peripheral descriptions that were insulse and annoying.The characters were superfically developed and I spent the whole time trying to feel the drama, but it was not possible.The positive part of the book is that is very easy to read and has a simple history line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even finish it!","review":"I was really intrigued by the premise of this story. The beginning hooked me and I was unable to put the book down. What happened? It seemed like time stopped and I could barely force myself to keep reading. In fact, I lost the battle. I gave up shortly after Paul's recital. I would rather live without knowing how this family turned out than have to read one more sentence. (That is a huge concession for me because I hate leaving things unfinished.) It was death by slow, tortuous boredom. The author had this incredible idea for a story that started out so fascinating, yet quickly fizzled. It's like she ran out of steam and forced herself to finish the book just because. It was a huge shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting Book","review":"This book started out very good. I was very curious what the author planned to do with the story line. To my disappointment it became far fetched, outrageous and actually disgusting. I would certainly not recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking for an ending...","review":"Edwards does a fantastic job of hooking the reader into this book, but the ending is sheer disappointment. It also has a tendancy to skip through time in a way that leaves things feeling fragmented. The beginning though was terrific and I think that is why the rest of the book felt that it was lacking. Overall, I was really surprised that this book has been this popular."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing....","review":"This book was recommended to me, and I was excited to read it, because I thought the premise was fascinating. However, the book quickly became disappointing. The characters were not well-developed, and by the end they felt like one-dimensional clich��s. I did not understand why Norah and Paul were so unhappy throughout the entire book. They never knew David's secrete until after he passed away. The character voices did not ring true to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice writing based on a flimsly premise,","review":"I have a hard time understanding why anyone enjoyed this book. The entire novel is based on a weak premise that just doesn't fly. The author's style is nice, but every character is one dimensional and lacking depth. Do yourself a favor, skip this one. I won't even donate my copy to the library. It was that lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tale of hope and redemption!??!","review":"David and Norah were two of the most unlikable, weak, selfish characters I have ever come across. Norah's 40 years of perpetual lamenting, which interferes with her ability to create a happy home environment for the child that DID survive is selfish and an insult to women. And after she does find her long lost daughter, she... moves to Paris?? Hello, did anyone else find that absurd? And woe is David, I grew up on a dirt farm with a sick sister so I am going to give away my own flesh and blood, feel bad about it but not bad enough to actually do something, be frigid towards my son, and take in some random teen mother.And to add insult to injury, the storytelling is BORING BORING BORING."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too much - too little","review":"I hover between praise and criticism for the Memory Keeper's Daughter. Praise for Edwards for using her talents to focus on this very loaded subject. Praise for the public for wanting to read about something which is easier ignored. Praise for Edwards' prose and visually descriptive passages.My crticism is that the author tries to manage too much in this book. The secrets. The feelings. The real lives. None of these ever actually integrate. We glimpse pieces of each character, but never really get \\"in\\". Its as if Edwards tries to give each character equal weight and all wind up weightless. Too many protaganists here. Too many events. The characters get lost in the traffic.That said, It did keep me turning the pages, and I did find myself crying in spots. Still, I wonder..."},{"rating":"1","title":"draggy and depressing","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I somewhat enjoyed the book during the first half, anticipating what my happen next to the characters. But about halfway through, the book really began to drag on and on, and the characters became more and more depressing. In the end, it just fizzled out.I was also disappointed by some of the odd mistakes in the book, which I'm surprised some editor did not catch. For example, toward the end of the book, Norah goes in to David's dark room, saying that it had been seven years since anyone had been in the room. But amazingly, she pulls a Coke from the refrigerator and drinks it. That must have been one stale Coke! I noticed several details like this in the book.Overall, very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!! Warm! Emotional!","review":"The poetic wording that drew the most beautiful word pictures is my best description. The story never lulled but was rich throughout the entire book. Seeing the lives from all prospectives was endearing. I loved this book and eagerly await anything else Kim Edwards writes in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Have Been So Much Better","review":"The premise of this story was great, however the author just couldn't pull it off. It was like sliding into a whining depression with no hope for escape. The characters were very two dimensional, and just like they weren't there for each other; they were not there for the reader either. I found myself skimming the book just so I could see what would happen. Could have been so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major let down....","review":"I was expecting so much more from this book. I bought it because it was on the New York Times Best Sellers List. It was extremely boring and a huge let down. There was not one compelling moment in the book. The author even managed to make the emotional character moments boring and diluted. The foundation for this story was such a great idea, so I have a hard time understanding how it ended up being so boring. If you like a slow boring story, than this is the one for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creative Writing 101: Show, Don't Tell","review":"I picked up this book fascinated by the story line on the back cover, but as I began to read, I found myself scratching my head in wonder. I felt as though the author had a severe case of ADD, and I had just spent 14.00 to be jarred around in this mysterious world of aimless thought. It was very disappointing. Honestly, I felt the author was trying to see how lyrical she could be with the English language rather than truly telling a story with depth.It's not good to assume your reader has no imagination, and frankly, defeats the purpose of writing to begin with (entertainment via fantasy). It's rather insulting to the reader, not to mention boring and monotonous, and ultimately makes for bad storytelling, in my opinion.In short, I found the author's writing style tedious and extreme which ultimately dampened the story and the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had high hopes, but couldn't finish it.","review":"Like many other people, I truly was excited about picking up this book. The premise touched my heart and I couldn't wait to get it. Unfortunately, once I dug in the book became tedious and I couldn't relate to the characters. Once I realized that I didn't care what happened to them, I had to stop reading. I'm a very soft hearted person (which means I cry at movies often) so if this book didn't touch me, it may not touch you either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brutal read","review":"I bought this book, in part, because the reviews suggested it was a good read that was riveting and hard to put down. I was leaving on a cross-country flight and wanted something to keep my mind occupied as I flew. Usually I can finish a book on a long flight, but this was so brutally laborious to read that I had to put it down. I continued to read a bit here and there throughout my 5 day stay and finally finished it upon returning home. I kept thinking it had to get better. Well, it didn't. Besides traversing a difficult writing style, there seemed to be inconsistencies in the author's writing - as if she hadn't quite figured out who the characters were. Save yourself some time and money, and find another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wordy is an understatement","review":"This book had such promise. The story line is very interesting, but the author's writing style just kills it. I have never struggled to finish reading something in my whole life as much as this. I had to read it for an Ethics Graduate class, and this book I feel was \\"punishment\\". This book could have easily been complete in 5 chapters. The author chooses to muddy the text up with elaborate and irrelevent word usage. There is no need to use 2 or 3 sentences to describe \\"snow\\". I had such high hopes that this book would be as interesting as the description and cover art made it out to be, but I was very disappointed. I couldn't even finish the book, I just read the last 2 chapters for the ending, and I believe I got what I needed from that. I am astonished this book is a best seller."},{"rating":"2","title":"A title I won't soon forget","review":"This book came out the same month as My Half of the Sky. I meant to pick it up, but then kept confusing it with other titles-- Gravedigger's Daughter, Hummingbird's Daughter, etc. The title just didn't stick with me. Fortunately, I saw it in the library the other day and picked up a copy. Oh, what a treasure. With each character, I feel as if I'm walking in his/her shoes. The plot is heart-wrenching: A doctor delivers his wife's twins, one of whom is born with Down's Syndrome. He makes the quick decision to give the DS child away, telling his wife that the child died--a hasty action which has repercussions that keep coming and coming and coming. I haven't yet finished the book because I don't want to. I want to savor each word, each turn of phrase. It's a title I won't soon forget."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great exercise in....skimming.","review":"It's always disconcerting to be bored to death by books that are supposed to be amazing. But by the end of Memory Keeper's Daughter, I found myself, again, in that predicament. Bored. To. Death.I agree with every one star rating. The writing seemed like a paper from a community adult education creative writing course. I skimmed my way through the last 100 pages and I am quite certain I didn't miss a thing, except perhaps a four paragraph description of a scene that was described in 10 paragraphs 20 pages prior.The characters were unrelatable. And I have enjoyed books with unrelatable characters, but in those books, the writing made up for the lack of depth/relatability of the characters. Nothing saves this book.Pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite","review":"Gave up on page 7, after a ridiculous boy-meets-girl scene that is both hackneyed and implausible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Separated twins and damaged lives","review":"I thought the concept of this book was interesting: twins who were separated at birth by their father, a doctor, because one child has Down's syndrome. The wife thinks the child was born dead. The nurse, the only other person present at the birth, chooses to raise the baby instead of taking her to an orphanage. The book follows the parallel lives of the two children, although it focuses on the father, David and the consequences that his actions and the secret have on his life and his family, particularly his wife. I found this book difficult to get into, and was never really drawn to most of the characters. This is not a light story, although there are some pleasant moments. On the whole, it is rather dark in tone. The writing was well done, but the story did not hold my interest and the ending was not my favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"drivel","review":"if you are going to write about seizures know the 1st aid. do not put anything in the mouth. tedious book. sorry but it was just irritating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth committing to memory...","review":"Although I really wanted to like this book, it just didn't work out. It started out pretty strong and then ended so weakly that I couldn't believe I had wasted so much time on it. It took me nearly a year to get through, just because I would pick it up, read a chapter, then ignore it for month. It did nothing to keep me interested and wanting more. I like a book that grabs me, pulls me in and leaves me craving the next page when it's time to put it down, but this novel was just way too easy to put away and forget.I grew up with a sibling with disabilities, which might make me a bit more sensitive to some of the topics of this story. I didn't appreciate the unnecessary use of the \\"r\\" word, either. I realize that the book was written to take place during a period in time before the more politically correct terminology of today, but still...there's no need to abuse it so heavily.If I could un-read this book and have that time back, I'd be thrilled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Long","review":"This book was boring, repetitive and melodramtic.How many times does the author have to write about the loss and effect on lives?Poor Paul. A father that didn't pay enough attention to him so he is angry. Get over it. How many kids grew up in the 50s and 60s who did not receive time or attention from their fathers? This was a lifestyle for many. I like the changes of today but I and my siblings certainly didn't hate my father because he was never there. Nor did others I know. How many parents want their son to be a guitar player? an artist? Such resentment for asking the child to consider alternatives seems over emotional.David was too unreal and finding and taking in Rosemary was over the top and went nowhere. It just didn't sit well for a plot or coincidence. Although I liked Carolyn the story always seemed to drag. Surely the author could have told the story in far fewer words and descriptions.I felt I was reading the same theme over and over in slow motion."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am shocked at the hype this puerile novel has received","review":"Its not a bad story--the idea of twins seperated at birth is archetypal, and the controling distant husband accidentally sending his wife into a spiral of depression is appealing. Unfortunately, the appeal wears off in the first few chapters and the rest of the book goes down a long spiral of melodrama. This novel becomes ridiculously emotional, does way too much telling and forgets to show, is rife with cliches and does a terrible job of attempting to portray the trials and tribulations of parenting a disabled child.I was incredibly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redundant","review":"This book got moving towards the middle and here I was thinking : \\"Yes! It's finally going somewhere. But it was pointless, redundant and moved at the pace of a snail. I would call it a tedious read. I got so fed up that I didn't even finish the last chapter and that's a first for me. I was so let down because the subject of this novel is so interesting and controversial yet the finished product is a flop."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dud that keeps on dudding.","review":"Boring, repetitious, unengaging,..a real snore! And a 'downer' to boot! Try something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drags on","review":"I thought this would be a good book based upon the description and reviews. It caught my attention in the beginning, but it quickly dragged on. I was bored and actually switched to another book with 50 pages left - BORING and not believable. Don't waste your money.Too much drama over the death (or not) of a newborn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Choices, choices, choices...","review":"This is a terrific read. Real, heart wretching and thought provoking. I loved the description of the characters. I was sad, moved and pensive. Our choices, sometimes made in a split second, propel us in a direction that we may not expect. Great writing and a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely slogged through this ...","review":"I was really stunned (and mislead) by the positive reviews for this book, barely able to slog through to the end. The writing is trite, characters uninteresting. Several of my friends shared the same opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long and boring","review":"The story started out good, even though the details are a bit much. After few chapters the story dies. It became long and boring. The non-pertinent details were a killer. Towards the end I found myself skimming paragraphs. I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing ... to say the least ...","review":"I also bought this book because I had heard such great things about it. Like everyone else stated, the book started out strong but lost you half way through ...I was really disappointed by this book - wasn't what I thought it would be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cant put it down","review":"The best thing about this book was the story. Easy to follow. I couldnt wait to see what would happen next. Some said it was very depressing. I didn't feel that way at all, and hate depressing books, therefore I suppose it depends on what you think is depressing. Giving a baby up for adoption because he/she has downs syndrome vs. murders, phys./sex abuse, or occult books, in my opinion are depressing. It was just such a great story and never boring!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just another amateur review","review":"I liked this story. I liked the historical (I was born in 76) aspects of the story and how they effected the actions of the characters. It would be hard to see something like this happening in today's society. It was also interesting to see how one really big secret could effect so many lives. I found myself wondering how the story would've been different if he would've just told his wife the truth from the start. Would she have agreed and sent her daughter to the home? How would the son's life of been different? Considering how important appearances seemed to the wife at the beginning of the story, I'm not sure she would've been happier knowing the truth of her daughter. I guess she would have become just as miserable but for different reasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Michelle","review":"The book was a quick read but pretty depressing and boring at times. I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long-so what?","review":"I'm sorry. This book just didn't do it for me? Where's the story? I found the characters very whiney. Why did Paul hate his father so? Even after David died, Paul whined & whined about what a horrible father he had. Get over it. He wasn't really that bad. David's childhood, Rosemary & Jack, Bree's reaction to Norah finding Pheobe, why did Norah leave for France so soon after finding Pheobe? There were too many loose ends. It was too long and nothing ever got resolved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plodding and redundant","review":"The overuse of imagery & descriptive prose bogged this novel down with too little dialogue and story that moved too slowly. It transpired through decades yet each character seemed painfully stuck in time and never grew from their experiences. Her overuse of flowers as descriptions and repetitive use of photography descriptions distracted from the story. It was such a boring, plodding, redundant book. I'm sorry I wasted the time on it. Better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing indeed","review":"I didn't read the reviews on this first because I bought it when travelling thinking it was an important bestseller and I 'should'read it. A mistake. It really is amazingly emotionally flat and I not only didn't particularly like any of the characters, I didn't understand them either or care much about what happened to them. Norah was particularly incomprehensible. I do get it that a woman truly grieves the loss of a child whether a miscarriage early in pregnancy or a later loss and can grasp that she was depressed but dragging on years of bizarre behavior just didn't add up at all. In fact, she is so strange, I felt thankful early on that David gave the baby to Caroline as this woman could hardly have raised a handicapped child! I hated the way David died and Paul's weird statements that his father didn't love him when he showed his love in many ways at every stage of his life. I wish I had not wasted my time reading it and cant' comprehend why it is a best seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like a bad romance novel","review":"This author seems preoccupied with thin women, their flat stomachs, their hair swept up into chignons, and how they tuck their legs up under themselves. The prose is too precious. The book takes its time early on, then lurches forward abruptly. Every major character seems to have stepped right out of a soap opera: the mother is wildly successful, the father is a successful doctor AND photographer, the son is a successful musician, the nurse is a fierce political advocate--not an average person among them. And for all its empathy toward people with Down syndrome, none of the book is told from the daughter's perspective. This book isn't about the daughter, it's about everyone in the family except the daughter. It's about the effects her existence and her disability had on the family. She is little more than a plot device, which is disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and repetitive.","review":"I'm sorry, but I really do not understand the high reviews here. I lost interest in the book about a chapter in. It's slow and repetitive. let me sum it up for you (w/o spoiling the ending):Couple is in love, they have two children. Man lies to wife and says the girl died at birth because he remembers how hard it was for him to have a sister with health problems. Nurse takes girl and raises her on her own.Wife is depressed about \\"loss\\" of daughter. Paranoid that son will die as well.Son's baby hands look like starfish.Husband remembers his dead sister and the jam his mother made, which looked like jeweled cans.Son becomes older. His hands still look like starfish. Father remembers the jars of jam again, like jewels.Children grow older....Starfish, jewels. Starfish, jewels. Starfish, jewels.In case you haven't gotten it yet, children's hands look like starfish, and jars of jam look like jewels. Got it?The end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plot suffers from Author's style","review":"The plot of this book could have been interesting, but the author keeps telling us the same things over and over such as Norah's eyes are green. One of the characters, Caroline reminded me of a chacter that Shirley Jackson might have thought of. If Shirley Jackson were alive and had written this book, it would have been a third as long and much more interesting. I had to struggle to read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving but sad","review":"Very well written, a glimpse into how the past shapes your future. A split decision and so many lives were changed forever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So boring....","review":"I have to say - it has been a longggg time since I have felt so strongly about not liking a book...It happened last night in bed, I am on page 131 and I threw the book across the room and screamed - \\"this book sucks!\\" Anyone else feel the same way?It is horribly boring - just read the summary and that should cover it. Characters are dull, plot is lame...shall I go on?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A very good example of very bad writing.","review":"This book was one of the worst I have read in years. It is so poorly written that I was cursing aloud at it, and with its weak character development, and such a thin, though sad but hardly believable story line, I find it very hard to believe it made it to any best-seller list. Though I don't like to abandon books once I've started reading them, this is surely one that I should have put down long the end. There are far too many really good, well-written books out there to waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like","review":"I found this story very simplistic, repetative and not well written at all. I thought the book began well, but the same themes and ideas kept being repeated: David's sadness over his sister's death and therefore his overprotetivness, David's guilt over giving away his daughter,Phobe's sadness over the loss of her daughter...I found it tedious and not engaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts off strong, and then...","review":"A decent premise and a promising start fall prey to bizarre plot twists (including an unlikely hostage taking) and finally and lamentably, squishy stereotypes about people with Down Syndrome.Read the first half and then write your own ending. (Gee I wish the editor had done that!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"Picked this one up at a bus station for a long ride because the storyline seemed interesting. Unfortunately, the plot goes nowhere; the characters are shallow, uninteresting, and poorly (if at all) developed; and the writing is painfully slow and amateurishly overly-detailed. I stuck it out to the end just for the sake of finishing it, but it was a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Instantly forgettable.","review":"As others have said the premise of this story is promising, but sadly the writing style is pedestrian and mundane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"This book has all of the elements to be a fantastic story and novel. Sadly, I found it lacked depth and was a little melodramatic. There were a lot of characters and their individual stories seemed to remain on the surface. Any emotions remained in their head and they interacted with each other very little. I'm sure this emotional isolation had a point but it was more frustrating to read than sympathize with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ordinary, mundane","review":"I read this for a book club and have had much better reads. I felt the characters were not that sympathetic and did not draw me in. Norah seemed all too cliche. It was ok, but for someone who has little time outside of working and motherhood, I wished we would not have picked this for book club."},{"rating":"2","title":"The impact of a life changing decision","review":"Great book that chronicles the impact of a life altering decision over a life time. Great character development and storyline. A touching book."},{"rating":"1","title":"300 pages too long","review":"The plotline for this book had such great potential but it was lost in plodding, boring details rather than character development. I was disappointed at the way it dragged on and I found myself skipping over big chunks of the story because they were completely unnecessary. The endless comparisons between photography and life had me saying out loud, \\"All right, already!! I get it!!\\" Too bad it took too long to get to a rather unsatisfying conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a keeper","review":"This book had a intriguing plot and I expected it to be a page turner, but by page 137 I gave up (an uncommon response for me) because the characters and their lives as developed weren't very interesting to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzzzzzzzz","review":"What a pitiful attempt at what could have been a very interesting story. Every time I go into Barnes and Noble I am astonished that this book is a bestseller. I just wanted to cry with frustration. Whenever it seemed that it would pick up and get going, the book would simply just stall again. The author does a poor job of characterizing men and their feelings. They come across as far too feminine. Wayyyy to much description for descriptions' sake, and no informational value. You feel no connection to the characters at all, and really do not care about them, their mundane lives, goals, etc....This is the second book that I couldn't finish this summer, and since I have a reading challenge bet going with a friend I really hated to do it. But trying to forge through was simply torturous. Walk away, far away from this book next time you pass it at your bookstore."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"Complete rubbish. This book was terribly written. It has so many superfluous descriptions and countless cliches. The characters are shallow and are completely unbelievable. I am annoyed that I wasted a part of my life reading it. Do not do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Harlequin in everything but length","review":"I read this for a book club; otherwise I would have returned it to the library without reading past the second chapter. The author starts with a potentially interesting scenario, then kills it with heavy-handed (and pointless) description, inept character development, and just plain clunky writing. For example: Norah, one of the protagonists, meets a man called Howard. She wonders to herself, Where does he come from, and how did he get a name like Howard?Me: From his PARENTS. You blinking idiot.As I skimmed the 400+ pages of the book for the plot points, I mentally shook my fist at the author for her sappy story. For her female characters who are \\"courageous\\" and \\"determined.\\" For that scene where one of the most stereotypical characters in the book whines that she doesn't want to be a cliche.

It's too descriptive and the story was dragging."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring and repetitive","review":"I agree w/ Auliya's review of Sept 1st - It was sooo boring and repetitive that midway through I just started \\"scan reading\\" to see if anything new or interesting happened.I was very disappointed, especially since it was so highly recommended. The quality of writing was just so annoying, and I'm sure this will be turned into one of those made for TV movies.Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lightweight fare","review":"Despite a promising opening, there is too much soap opera in this novel for serious lovers of literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"the memory keepers daughter","review":"As a midwife, the description of this book caught my eye and it did not disappoint. I loved this book. If you like Jodi Piccoult you will like this as it is written in a similar style. It is a touching story that many people will relate to and may think about what they would do under the same circumstances. The book is easy to read and follows the lives of two families who have been affected by a life changing decision made at the beginning of the book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not good","review":"I didn't care about a single one of these characters. Many times an author will develop one character and neglect the others, but Edwards manages to turn everyone into a one dimensional cutout, which is really sad considering the story had so much potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heck Naw","review":"Most of the other reviewers have already said what I think about this long, drawn-out, never-ending story that will put you to sleep after the first couple of chapters. Seriously, it's not even that much of a story since the book is about a fourth narrative and three fourths bizarre descriptions of completely unimportant things (\\"...she was looking at expensive stockings as dark as pig's blood..\\"). But I don't want to get too into what I think about her writing style because everyone else, especially that review called \\"Life Is Too Short to Read Books Like This\\", totally nailed my thoughts. So the only reason I wrote this is to say that I kind of think that Kim Edwards wrote the \\"Read This, read this, read this!\\" review. Actually, I'm almost totally sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much angst","review":"The premise for this book was interesting, but it was somewhat tedious to live through each character's angst. The only happy character has Down's Syndrome. Everyone else has \\"issues.\\" Ranging from depression to cancer--an entire Merck Manual or DSM V of diagnoses. An okay read--but what a downer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Important character dies, insipid one lives","review":"This story offered a wonderful premise, but fell flat for me when the Doctor, the interesting, complex character suddenly dies, and the insipid, travel agent wife lives on to finally feel good about herself. I felt the Doctor/husband had a more compelling story and therefore, as a reader I had much more invested in him. Why would the author spend that time on him and not redeem him in a more satisfying way? That was a nagging question after I read the last page.That aside, the author did have a compelling story line, and a plot that moved well part of the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"It kept going and going and going....","review":"This book started out interesting but I just wanted it to end! The story was believable for it's time but I think the author filled it with about 5 chapters too many. I ended up reading the last chapter to end the agony and then started reading again from where I left off.I found every character (with the exception of Al) cold and distant and I never did get the part about David Henry and the issue around his name and medical school. What was that all about?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I found this book offensive","review":"As a mom of a little girl with Down syndrome I found this book extremely offensive. The author repeatedly used the phrase 'retarded' and portrayed Phoebe as a very outdated steroetype - chubby & short with a pudding bowl haircut, slow thick hard to understand speech etc. Times have changed, children with developmental delays are now having intensive early intervention therapy, attending mainstream schools etc. I hated this book, I really felt insulted on my daughters behalf."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Memory Keeper's Daughter","review":"Dark, haunting, in depth account of man's fear of rejection. I believe this is out of print but it is worth finding."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good","review":"It was an interesting story line but I didn't feel like the plot got much thicker...just more depressing. I ended up skipping through the last 5 chapters or so becasue I couldn't stand reading about the depressing lives of the characters. I guess I thought it was going to be more about the daughter with down syndrome rather than the effects of the lies. Anyway, if you like depressing books that dont get too interesting this book is for you. However, on a good note...the author is a fantastic writer just needs a better story to write."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tread carefully into this dark realm","review":"This book is an emotional minefield. It was 1 of our 1st bookclub books and evoked so much emotion the roon spun. We all could appreciate the writing quality but for me it was a case of I have started so I will finish.

Overated is my main issue with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF TIME","review":"FIRST FEW CHAPTERS ARE PAGE TURNERS, THEN IT'S AS THOUGH THE AUTHOR GREW FATIGUED OR COULDN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO TIE IT ALL TOGETHER SO SHE JUST GAVE UP.

Didn't finish this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just went on and on and on....","review":"It just went on and on and on like a bad movie. I couldn't wait for this book to end. Endless details about unimportant matters, and barely a sentence about things that were extremely important.It reminded me of a very poorly written VC Andrews book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I agree with most of the negative comments. This was hard to get through and I kept asking myself what in the world did other people see in this book?At least with my other negative reviews, I can see why some people were drawn to it. With this book, I can't imagine why anyone would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great beginning, bland ending","review":"I thought this book started out with a lot of potential. The characters all had interesting lives and the various perspectives made me feel like I was peeking in on all of their lives. But midway through the book, the story took a dive. I have been reading other great books like \\"Water for Elephants\\" and \\"The Glass Castle\\" that have a strong story lines that leads you to a great ending. This book leads you to a borefest and you end up having to struggle to get through it. It felt like the author got bored writing this and just went on auto pilot. I am glad I borrowed this book and did not actually buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened ?","review":"When I first started reading Memory Keepers Daughter it really sucked me in and I was totally hooked. I thought this was the beginings of a great novel. But half way through the book it somehow lost the plot and I was left quite dissapointed. The second half of the book tried to go too deep and quite missed the point of looking at the parallel lives of the two children.It just seemed to drag on forever.. I feel qutie sad, the book was so good at the begining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could've used a little editing","review":"The Memory Keeper's Daughter is based on a reasonable premise: the loss of a child and a husband's lie result in lifelong anger and damage to the marriage. This story could have been a good one if it had been tightened up. A Lot. About two thirds of the way through the book, David takes off to his abandoned childhood home, befriends and supports a pregnant teenager, and gives up his life's passion (photography). This is where the story falls apart and the characters become flat. They start to say inane things in order to move the plot along so the book can come to an end. It seems as if Edwards' editor must have gone on vacation and left the author to throw in every humdrum event she could think of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ditto GSK review","review":"Too much purple prose.

It starts in the 1960s, when things were vastly different from today in regards to child birth and children with special needs. David and Norah have twins, but David sacrifices one of them because she has Down syndrome. David & Norah's life is never the same, and the lives of their children are affected by his one decision. A moving book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely, provactive book!","review":"THE MEMORY KEEPER'S DAUGHTER is a lovely, thought-provoking book, more literary and poetic than others in its genre. The ending was a bit trying, but still a wonderful read."},{"rating":"1","title":"unrealistic even for a screenplay","review":"I kept waiting for this to culminate. It had a great plot. The characters are ridiculous in many ways. They are undeserving superlatives. I had hoped for more. There are so many great writers that I have to forgive myself for reading as much as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting","review":"A taut, well-written novel about how one man's spur of the moment decision sets in motion a series of events that have consequences for all involved. Edwards deftly juxtaposes the two families, exposing how one family becomes emotionally distant and the other closer through the years due to one woman's love for her adopted daughter and fight for justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for me...","review":"My friend read this one and could not put it down. We usually have the same taste-not this time! I had to make myself finish it and kept waiting to be interested. I have heard may people saying how wonderful it was, but not for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"REDEEMING SINS","review":"Exquisite despite tendencies to be verbose, this debut novel of Kim Edwards is touching inasmuch as it explores the pains of errors from the past, miscalculations from the present and uncertainties of the future.The reading can be slow in its process of breaking through character histories that tend to bog down what one would wish was a better pace of plot. But when events unfold and characters unravel their feelings as a reaction to what defines their lives, the pain that the writer captures becomes incomparable. The love/hate relationships that define parents and their children, the tricks played by fate and the vulnerabilities of men are all too human ... all to real.There is no such thing as a perfect work ... and because of all its imperfections especially in capturing the human heart and mind, THE MEMORY KEEPER'S DAUGHTER is one of the best reads that leave an undefinable ache after you reach its last sentence."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Secrets and Unresolved Grief Can Destroy","review":"Let me say first: Yes, I live in Lexington. No, I don't know Kim Edwards.Okay, now that that's out of the way. . . .I just finished this book, and I read most of it in one sitting, which is really rare for me. What kept me reading was that the book shows how secrets and unresolved grief not only eat away at a person, but affect everyone in that person's life. It was like \\"Ordinary People\\" with a twist.There were some things I wasn't thrilled about--I thought Norah could've been drawn with a little more definition, and certain events and scenes were superfluous--but she is a good storyteller, and there is a lot of good old-fashioned Russian-novel emotion in the story.I think we all need a book to come along once in a while that reminds us that we can't just forget the past and move on--we have to work through our pain, and, just as important, we have to support each other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just okay","review":"When I read the back of the book, I thought that I was in for a good read. However, once I started to read it, it became boring, due to the fact the author spent a lot of time detailing things that didn't need to be. Overall it was pretty good, but I would be skeptical to buy another book written by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story of misguided Love","review":"Sometimes the choices we make in the name of protecting someone we love can cause the object of our love more harm than good. So it is with Dr. David Henry.When twins, a boy and a girl, are born to his wife, and the girl has Downs Syndrome, he decides it would be better for his wife to think the child died at birth. He puts the infant in the hands of his nurse to take to an institution. Instead, she keeps the girl and the child becomes a blessing to her and her husband. In the doctor's family, the wife cannot come to terms with her loss and her husband cannot forget the child he abandoned and both contribute to the breakdown of their marriage. The Memory Keeper's Daughter is an excellent story of both heartbreak and happiness and the validation of Downs Syndrome children as loving, happy individuals and, although they may need extra care, they can be as much a blessing to a family as any child.Eunice Boeve, author of Ride a Shadowed Trail"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written, but . . .","review":"I had high hopes for this book and was disappointed from the beginning. Although descriptive, it failed to evoke emotion. I found myself wanting to be finished with the book. I love books of all types, but I want them to entertain me. This one didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is a beautifully written, thought-provoking book that explores love, lies, and the spiritual poverty that stems from shame.

It is the best....has great wisdom compassion and veryy heart breaking....i recommend it to all...=D"},{"rating":"1","title":"Search for a Timeline","review":"A timeline of the book's (few) events would be far more interesting than reading the book itself - so long as it wasn't written in the same writing style that Edwards uses! The premise of the book is wonderfully intriguing and fairly unique, but to me the way that it was written sucked the book dry. My advice: read the first 10 pages before you buy the book and if you're annoyed by the writing style, don't buy it. Trust me. It won't get any better, so there's no need to put yourself through the same torture the rest of us did. Look for a synopsis instead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Memeory Keeper's Daughter","review":"Good Book, I really enjoyed reading it.

What a disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"After reading the plot, this book seemed to be a prefect fit for me, however as previous reviews it really goes way of track. The book really has nothing to do with the first two chapters. The character's do nmot have depth, or strength. The author's descriptive writing is unable to hold my attention. It was truly a strugle to finish this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing, Long","review":"I held out to the end and kept reading this agonizing, depressing story thinking the last pages might give me some final gratification...but to no avail.

I was hoping to find out more about Phoebe's life as a child and adult with Down's and try to feel life in her shoes, but there wasn't much written about her.I mainly stuck with it for the book club I'm in - the book left me with nothing - I felt no emotion for the characters either - it was a waste of my time - 3-4 hours I'll never get back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all its cracked up to be","review":"I read this for a book club.

Without giving away the story, it starts with the faher giving away the twin born with downs syndrome, unbeknownst to the mother, and the effect this has on the entire family. Obviously this would have an awful affect on any family, the mother grieving a baby she thought died, and the father wondering if he did the right thing. Still, it is hard to have sympathy with this family, and having children myself, the whole thing just left me sad..I can't understand these people.

I have a long commute in my car, so I listen to ALOT of Books on CD. The narrator on this particular one was very difficult to listen to, and did not have a pleasant voice at all.The story itself was okay - interesting, but not necessarily compelling, or a \\"page-turner.\\" I had gotten it after reading some really good reviews, so maybe I was expecting more. But as mentioned by other reviewers, it felt like there was something missing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"First off, I absolutely hate this book. The first chapter was what got me to buy it initially, and I have to say that it was very well-written. The subsequent chapters, however, were horrid. Even though I had no wish to continue reading it halfway through, I pressed on, thinking that the story would pick up. It didn't. I can't even understand how this book could have ended up on The New York Times' bestseller list. It is beyond me even till now."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed with the ending","review":"I really enjoyed the beginning of this book. It reminded me of the John Updike \\"Rabbit\\" books which transported me back to several different time periods when people truly acted differently due entirely to the culture of the time. However Norah and Paul came across as very shallow at the end of the book with their simplistic embracing of Phoebee at the wedding after the first short awkward meeting. It felt too much like a fairy tale ending where everything is going to be wonderful now that the truth is out. I wonder how Norah would have actually handled raising a child with Down Syndrome as opposed to being handed a well adjusted adult to visit with. Same goes for Paul. I like Dr. David Henry the best. Like Harry, he had real human qualities which he struggled with."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste...","review":"This novel was predictable, I had zero interest in the characters, and the writing was juvenile; I struggled to finish it.

However, I found the characters to be flat, the writing rather boring and, after reading the first few chapters, just started skimming the rest before I gave up entirely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I picked this up after reading Michael Ondaatdje's Divisadero. What a shocking contrast of writing styles; one elegant and spare and this, prolix and unfocused.The plot concept has good potential but the characters and the development of the story needs a lot more work and editing. Others have gone over the weaknesses. I cannot recommend this.(Editors, where are you these days??)"},{"rating":"1","title":"No continuity in the plot","review":"Like a lot of people said, this book started off with a lot of promise. The premise to the story is very promising, but after the first couple of chapters, it goes downhill. The author does way too much editorializing and moralizing in the story. After David gives up his daughter, every single event, even if he burned his pancakes, is because of the \\"decision he made all those years ago.\\" I don't buy it. There needs to be a clearer connection between the events in his life and the choice he made. Many of the characters have no relevance to the plot, and if anything, interfere with it. This seems like a story that is written stream of conscious with no connection from the previous event to the next, and then no editing is done to create a seamlessness in the storyline. There are so many seams in this plot, I thought I was inside of a shirt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plot Holes and Annoying Characters","review":"I do not understand the popularity of this book.

I reluctantly give this book a one-star rating only because the premise is intriguing and could have been developed into a good story. However, after having struggled through most of the book (50 agonizing pages remain to plow through), I kept thinking, \\"Am I nuts? This is really terrible writing and yet it rec'd such good professional reviews.\\" Well, after reading the other negative reviews on Amazon, my faith in my reading taste has been reaffirmed. It is just plain awful, really. Just prior to reading this thing I had the pleasure of reading a Michael Cunningham novel---now there's an author with major talent. Perhaps the contrast made this an especially difficult book to stomach. So, thank you one-star-giving Amazon readers. I don't feel so alone. Now I'll force myself to complete those 50 pages. Maybe a glass (or three) of wine will help, really!"},{"rating":"1","title":"started off great but pages were missing!","review":"I enjoyed the story line and was eager to find out how the characters would develop.

I really lost intrest in the characters and plot after ahile. I raced to the end and not in a good way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly implausible","review":"While the premise of the story seems fascinating, the content is just too shallow for me. This novel would be better as a pulp paperback, and is far from \\"literature\\". The characters are interesting, and most of us can relate to many of them. But the choices they make, and the dialog connecting them, felt contrived and cliche'. I really wanted to like this book. I didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loses steam quickly","review":"This was a book club book for me. One of our members has a son with Down Syndrome and thought it would be an insightful read. It wasn't. The book started out compelling enough, but quickly became redundant, trite and cliche. I agree with previous reviews that character development was poor. There was also a point in the book, around page 300 where the author used the word 'thin' to describe her sister about ten times in the space of a few pages. I think Edwards got tired of her book as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I bought this book because I thought the plot was interesting and the reviews were good, but after a couple of chapters I got very disappointed.The story became repetitive, extremely repetitive with descriptions that are just boring.

A few years ago, it was all kidnapping stories. Now, it seems to be Deep Family Secret time in the popular novel world. I just read two that fall into that category and this one makes three. The idea was intriguing, but the rest fell flatter than a Czech omlette. The characters were not the kind of people you wanted to invite into your world as you read, the plot just plods, plods, and when not plodding, adds new characters. The whole name change thing ?

This book is soooooooo descriptive about every single thing that I don't know if I can keep going. It just seems like there is so much unnecessary detailing for every single thing and it makes the book drag. Second chapter and I notice that I'm already trying to skim paragraphs for information relevant to the storyline. After reading many of the reviews written here, I think I'm going to call it quits.Just updating here...I finished the book. Only read the first line in each paragraph and the dialogue between characters. I must admit that I did skip pages that were completely irrelevant to anything in particular. I felt drained after reading this. These characters were strange and I just didn't get the dynamics being so strained and damaged even given the storyline.

I did not like the characters at all.I kept waiting for the author to tell the story and she just never did. There were lots of lovely beautifully written sentences but we never got to know these people.I felt like the author just kept repeating the same things over and over without showing us the details and the real emotions of the characters. I didn't feel any sympathy for any of them and I am a total self-admitted sap!Avoid this one and read Water For Elephants by Sara Gruen or City of Light by Lauren Belfer."},{"rating":"1","title":"booooring","review":"this book took me so long to get through because nothing exciting ever happened.. i don't understand what all the hype is about! spare yourself and read something by jodi picoult instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Soap Opera","review":"Its a shame that the good writing goes to waste and is trivialized by a weak, melodramatic, screamingly contrived, full of romantic nonsense, plot. This is harsh, but of what value to the author, unless as an exercise that might lead her to something greater, or to the reader that plunks down their money and plows through a novel that is not worth the time it takes to read it.After the corny truck driver bit; finding the nurse and the kid, I started skipping through it--it got worse and worse;the plot became more and more absurd and arbitrary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put it down 2/3 of the way through","review":"... and I have yet to pick it back up. The beginning of the book is compelling and a fast read. But as the characters began to age, the story lost my interest.

There was a complete section that the editor overlooked, somewhere 1/3 into the book. If I read the metaphor about hands looking like starfish one more time I thought I'd choke. It's okay once but it was overused. Too many tangents that slowed the book down. I kept skimming to get to the storyline instead of all the inconsequential drifts in thought. Sure it's an interesting idea for a story but not enough to make into a book. I'm surprised it's a bestseller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very frustrating...made me angry!","review":"The premise of this book was fascinating but I was terribly disappointed by the story. Dr David Henry is faced with a terrible decision in the 1960's and made a choice based on the best information available to him at the time. At the time of the birth of the twins, his wife was needy and dependent. Nothing about her inspired confidence in her ability to handle a tough situation. He was in love with his wife and was faithful to her, loved and cherished his son and worked his tail off to support them and provide them with a plush lifestyle. Yet, he was made to be the villain of the book. His wife cheated on him. His son never appreciated the sacrifices his father made for him. I wanted to shake both of them....they were unbearably selfish! This was a total waste of a great idea....it doesn't deliver...don't waste your time! And just in case you think this review was written by a bitter husband and father....I'm a happily married wife and mother!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Big disappointment....I wanted to kick these character into some action. I never really got any \\"feel\\" for them, and basically found the book dreadfully boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"From reading the story synopsis on the back, I thought this book had a lot of promise. The story idea/plot was a great idea but felt the story didn't develop well. Pretty boring to be quite honest. I also was surprised to see the author use the same similies over and over again to convey images, such as the baby's hand like a starfish.....3 times....come on already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"Okay- I read this book because it kept popping up everywhere under bestsellers and all of the recommended lists BUT it was so hard to finish and the only reason that I did was because my Book Club chose it. You keep thinking that something big is going to happen but it really never does and the whole book is just pretty painful to read- I suggest you move on and read something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book ended my reading slump!","review":"I started this book on a snowbound day, just like Kim Edwards started the first chapter and I finished it in two days. I can't say I found it \\"gripping\\" , but it is the kind of enjoyable,flowing read that you look forward to sitting down with (for hours!)It's one that you really think about the characters and even though the Dr. is given most of the blame, you still are able to empathize with him. It's a good lesson of how lies and secrets can eat at one's soul. It's a story of love-but not at all sappy. I also thought she did a great job with a very positive portrayal of a Down's syndrome child. This story could appeal to many different types of readers, and although there may have been a little bit of dragging at times-I think that was neccesary to reflect the disinegration of the marriage etc. All in all, a very entertaining tale;full of happy and sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"STARTED OUT GOOD.. BORING..","review":"The first few pages are good and i thought to myself i will enjoy this book however it keeps going on and on and on and on.. and we get it.. the father screwed up he has guilt.. blah blah blah. Then within one chapter it ends. Boring...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes you want to die","review":"Seriously, this was the most depressing book I've ever read. I hated it. I don't always need to read fun, light books, but this book was just one character making a mistake after the next. This book lacked any likable characters. I had no empathy for any of the leads. The ending, which could have redeemed the entire book, was just boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Improbable and Incorrect","review":"First, let's get one thing straight. The syndome described in the book is Down Syndrome (not Down's as so many people think). I can't understand how an author could get this wrong. Didn't she do any research? I have a step-son with Down Syndrome, and after knowing him for 27 years, I would say that the description of the child in the book's strengths is unrealistic. The book paints a much rosier picture than many parents and caretakers observe in real life.The premise that this father/doctor could do what he did is too far-fetched to be believable or probable. Therefore, the whole story is compromised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very moving story","review":"In general I enjoyed this book. At times I found myself moved to tears by certain parts, but there were other parts of it that were tedious to get through. It's not a book that I would in any way compare to an epic like Gone With the Wind.I was suprised at how the story unfolded toward the end. A lot happened in the last 40-50 pages, and I almost had the sense that the author was trying to wrap the story up quickly and neatly. The pace of the last part did not seem consistent with the rest of the book.That said, I would recommend this book and will look forward to reading further works by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"the memnory keepers daughter","review":"Very good writen. Good book for our bookclub. Finished the book in 1 week time."},{"rating":"2","title":"inspiration","review":"I loved this book.

It took a little to get into it but once I was in there was no putting this one down. If you like to read this is a book that will keep your interest. I loved it and was very happy that I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing memories.","review":"Save your time and money. I read this book because it got such a high reviews. Unfortunately, I couldn't agree less with those reviewers. Maybe I'm not on the same intellectually level as some of the people that are raving about The Memory Keeper's Daughter. I didn't enjoy the story plot, characters, or the writing style. To tell you the truth it was such a trial to finish the book at all and I was excited that I reached the last page of the book not because I knew the ending but that I accomplished the feat of finishing a book that wasn't required reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long... and Tedious","review":"Overall, I really did not enjoy this book. It was so beautifully written in it's use of language to paint the stage of the book. But the story itself, was was too long and tedious for the it to be enjoyable. Every character in the book annoyed me and made me want to scream at them that they were so stupid. One may argue that the characters did what could only have been done, but no. I don't believe that. There is not time but the present for forgiveness."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is too many","review":"Uggggh. Read this after finishingAlias Grace: A Novel, which was a real nailbiter. This one was sooo awful and formulaic and many climaxes and who cares ? who cares? who cares? I kept asking myself. The premise was interesting, but it needed a much better writer. Like a previous reviewer, I kept thinking I had reached a pivotal moment in the story, only to have my hopes cruelly dashed. And the writing was dreadful, lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of detail. Like a soap opera, only not as good. <sigh>. Read something else!"},{"rating":"2","title":"if you haven't read this book ~ you MUST!!!","review":"To be honest, I have tried to read this book three times. For some reason, it didn't 'take' at first but then it became a bookclub pick so I really needed to read it and I'm so glad I did.This novel is a pageturner so beware - you might find yourself weary-eyed in the middle of the night trying to find kleenex and finish the book in one swoop. It's THAT good.David (a DR) and Norah are married a year when she becomes pregnant. She has twins, a surprise, but one is born with downs syndrome. David fears that baby won't survive so asks his nurse to take it to an orphange. He tells his wife that the baby died rather than telling her what he did.Secrets, lots of secrets in this book and you just have to keep reading to find out the power of this tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time waster","review":"I picked up this book because the title sounded interesting and the description on the jacket was intriguing. This book seems ill edited and inconsistant. I find myself frequently questioning WHY I paid 16 dollars for it. The storyline is bland and unreal, the descriptions are tedious and distracting. And what is up with the character Al?? He meets Caroline ONCE, she moves to another LARGE city without a trace, and he finds her in a back alley?? WHAT? Do not buy this crumby book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, depressing, drawn out book!","review":"So, this book started out quite interesting and for about the first 60 pages or so I could not put it down. After that.... dull, depressing, and dragged on and on. The characters mainly just went on and on about their difficult lives and difficult decisions for 340 pages. I kept waiting for this book to get good, and then I kept just waiting for it to finish. I spoke to 2 people who also read this book and they also told me that they did not like it, but I was determined to enjoy it since the beginning was so captivating. All in all, it was an interesting concept for the novel, but proved to be nothing more than \\"ugh, it is finished yet?\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"Now, let me begin by being honest. I have not read this book from cover to cover... and have no intention of doing so. I read quite a bit and I can't remember the last time I have put a book down and really just gave up on it, until this one.I found it extremely boring, a lost and undeveloped plot. Is it me? Am I just a shallow person and was not able to really get it? If so, so be it. The book was still not good. I guess it did have quite big shoes to fill as I did pick this one up right after I read THE GLASS CASTLE. Now that is a book to read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, heavy going, too many adjectives","review":"I didn't actually care what happened to any of the characters, too many adjectives, very predictable plot. If I read the word 'quicksilver' one more time to describe something...... maybe an ok book if you had to choose between this and another 2 star review in the airport news agent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived and Depressing","review":"I really wanted to like this book. Waited several weeks for it on the library wait list. The characters are too one dimensional, the storyline contrived and the pace agonizingly slow. Good title, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sticky Web","review":"This book is an interesting insight into the world of he 60s when men often made decisions that \\"protected\\" their wives and families from the \\"hardship\\" of real life. The web of lies affects everyone involved for their lifetimes. As the parent of a child with Down Syndrome (It bothered me that this diagnosis was misspelled throughout the book) who is being raised in more enlightened times, I appreciated the story of Carolyn. Her character, in question because of her part in the deception, was rebuilt through her life-long campaign on behalf of her \\"daughter.\\" The writing was terrific and impelling. The story was engrossing."},{"rating":"2","title":"the memory keepers daughter","review":"This is a beautifully written work. A story about love but not a love story in a romantic sense. Love filled with complexities, pain and misunderstandings. The author's descriptions are precise and yet soft and sensual. Sensual in the sense that you can feel the wind touching the hairs on your arms or become aware of how the leaves touch the sky. Like I said, beautifully written. Edward's ability to have the reader sense and feel the emotions while also having you aware of the subtle yet distinct tactile nature of the experience is magical. I liked the fact that this does NOT have a lived \\"happily ever after\\" ending but an ending that is a \\"and life goes on\\" type which leaves you wondering what will happen in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect story","review":"This book was almost perfect. I waited a long time to read this book because I thought it would be a downer. Rather, this book is most uplifting and educational. I do not know any Downs syndrome children. I learned a great deal in this charming novel. The plot development was exceptional and the character development was first rate. I did not want this book to end. You really are introduced to some imperfect, but genuine people."},{"rating":"2","title":"THe memory Keepers daughter","review":"I could not put it down as the characters were so real and the writing so engaging. I think she is an excellent story teller and the secrets the main character hid were affecting the other characters in so many ways that you can see how life can be changed by the absence of someone as much as the presence of someone. It also showed how love behaves in so many ways. THe expression of love whether it be to care take or protect is shown clearly in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good story, told all wrong.","review":"Kim Edwards had a good story to tell, but knowing the \\"secret\\" after the first few chapters made the rest of the book seem like a long, dull slog. The only suspense was having other characters find out what the reader already knows. Not good enough. There was some good character development, but \\"Nora\\" was hard to sympathize with even though she had suffered a great loss. Kim Edwards somehow expects the reader to understand how losing a child at birth is a good excuse for peeling off your clothes the first time a man other than your devoted husband makes eye contact. Apparently, it's then okay to turn into a self-absorbed, money chasing, serial adulteress. But we're supposed to hate the husband because he made a terrible decision under pressure that he regretted and tried almost immediately to correct? Please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointingly Dull","review":"It was with great anticipation that I began reading this story. Afterall, Sue Monk Kidd (one of my favorite authors) had quite a complimentary quote on the book's cover. Mama always said, \\"Don't judge a book by its cover\\" and she was right!There were several characters in this story, yet there was no one to identify with, to feel empathy for, or to even care about! Poor Phoebe was so one-dimensional, she elicited no emotion from this reader at all. She was described as having a \\"bowl cut\\" to illustrate that yes, she has Down's Syndrome and no, these individuals are not entitled to have flowing hair...Trite and boring, I would have rather been doing laundry than reading this book. However, I kept turning the pages and hoping for something (ANYTHING) to happen. Nothing ever did."},{"rating":"1","title":"great concept...fails to a troubling finish","review":"Ms. Edwards has created characters that are not very realistic. I found it difficult to relate to the motives of any of these characters. David was certainly not anyone I've ever run across.His character was totally unbeleivable. Ms. Edwards needs to talk to more men. The passages relating to his photography were boring. Who cares???? I didn't egt the connection she was trying so desperately to make between David's passion for photography and his \\"losses\\".I had a hard time believing that Norah was suffering so VERY much yet since the death of her daughetr at birth, that when she finally meets her...she takes off to France w/ her new husband. Oh well..guess it's too late to have a relationship with my daughter whom I thought dead..which led to the destruction of every other relationship in my life. Ya, sure........ Not very beleivable."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess my expectations were too high","review":"A huge fan of literary fiction, I was so excited about reading this book. Perhaps that explains why I was so disappointed - I expected too much. I thought it was much too wordy with incredibly LONG, dull passages of explanation, thoughts and flashbacks. The book also does not flow very well and I found myself getting lost in some places and had to often go back and re-read passages (re-read those LONG, dull passages). Some of Edwards' characterization almost seemed amateurish and there were also many holes in the story. David's family of Paul and Norah were depressing, spoiled and winey and I didn't connect to any of them. If the entire story had revolved around Caroline and Pheobe, it would have been much more enjoyable and interesting. I had to force myself to finish it and get to that incredibly dull ending. My advice: don't waste your time on this one. It may be a while before I take a chance on a Kim Edwards book again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forced reading !! Move along ..........","review":"We read this for a book club selection. Well, it was all I could do to finish it because I like to be in on the discussion , but it seems everyone in the book club felt the same. When I read fiction I like to connect with at least one character in the book, but found no connection with any. Flat, uninteresting......... blah !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I had borrowed it from the library...","review":"I'm still puzzled about the hype this book has gotten. The story is contrived and offers no surprises. The author tends to write down to her reader, and repeats details overtly, rather than showing the story in prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts off good","review":"Like others, I found the first 150 pages enjoyable. The next 250 pages are tedious, as the story is predictable and longwinded. Kim Edwards does a good job of introducing characters into the novel...there is no need to spend 200 pages explicitely detailing their motives when it was understood in the first 1/2 of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Long, Depressing Journey","review":"When our book club selected this novel, I was enthusiastic ~ the premise appeared to leave so much room for the development of great characters and a great story. However, after the first chapter or so, I kept waiting for the big \\"wow\\" factor...and it never came. I found most of the characters unsympathetic and not very well-developed. Like other readers, I finished it out of obligation, but never gleaned any enjoyment from reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a \\"keeper\\" for me","review":"Well written book about the secret birth of a Down Syndrome child, but a \\"downer\\" for me. Even though it is now on the best seller list, I can't imagine how this book reached such popularity.I thought many of the scenarios were not only improbable, they were downright \\"corny\\". I wondered if this story would ever end, and was relieved when it finally did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Double Yuk.","review":"Not only is this book depressing, it so overwritten that you feel as if you have to weed through all the extraneous descriptions of EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD before you can actually get to the meager storyline. No thought goes unexpressed, no floorboard uncreaked. Really, it was a dark and stormy night, folks. What a great premise, ruined by poor execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an awful book !!!","review":"I don't understand the rave reviews for this book. I'm not going into the plot here because other people have already done that. The book is overly long, with extremely flowery descriptions, trite, saccharine phrases and repetitive stories. The only reason I listened to the whole thing was to find out how it ended. But more than once I found myself thinking, \\"Oh my God, you're not serious!!\\"Skip this one, there are better books out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"I got swirled into the story","review":"As I read this story, there were moments where I felt carried into the beauty of language.

It gets boring and depressing. The characters in this book were incapable of recovering from tragedy...even on the smallest level. About half way through the book, I felt like giving two of the main characters a good slap. What a pathetic existance to not move forward in ones life. I skimmed full chapters. The next time I come across a book like this, I will not skim pages. I will put it down and find something else to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I don't think this book lives up to the hype. I thought the first half was interesting but fizzled out somewhere in the middle. My gut reaction was to stop reading half way through but I thought it might get better. It never did. None of the characters are ever happy. Never. After about 75% it was just plain depressing. I would suggest picking up something else..."},{"rating":"1","title":"bemoan the world of dreary.....","review":"Absolutely the worst book that came into my hands in years. Dreary tale full of holes, the author used little common sense in her writing. The only intriguing part of the book is its title, everything else falls into the abyss of poor language skills. We'd all be unhappy to wake up and find these characters living next door, no redeeming qualities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, not great","review":"I was like many others on here- I thought it would be a great read when I bought it. I could not wait! However, I did not read the reviews on here before buying. I liked the book in some ways because of the timeline and how the families changed, but they did sort of seem to stay the same too. The only significant changes were the children growing up. In real life, all of the characters would have changed significantly. I really thought this book would focus on the daughter, hence the name of the book and the story behind it. However, I do not feel she really was a significant character in this book at all. She was just sort of in the background of it all in a way. I am a rehabilitation counselor, so I really was looking forward to this story. I was a bit disappointed because the daughter was not really a key player in this novel. I would not recommend this as a must read, but okay to pass the time if you just want to read something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a bad dream","review":"The first chapter was good and it was all downhill from there. Parts of the book were like a bad dream where nothing makes sense, nothing fits and you wake up trying to figure out what the heck you ate the night before."},{"rating":"1","title":"One dimensional treatment","review":"Well the book is uneven and the characters unappealing (save one), but that's not my complaint.I was annoyed by the one-dimensional treatment of the daughter character who has Down Syndrome. It only reinforces stereotype, showing people with this syndrome as being a collection of characteristics (smiley, sweet, childlike) but otherwise lacking individuality or personality. For contrast, read The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time by Mark Haddon. You will understand and appreciate the inner life of the character with autism and feel you know him as a person, not a type."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but dragged a bit","review":"I enjoyed this book for the most part, but also felt that it dragged on a good bit. The woman in the book experiences the same emotion all throughout, and it could be that I've never lost a child as it was born, but this story let it pretty much ruin her life. And that got old after a while. Also, the author gives the reader too many feelings and not enough facts. It was just a bit drawn out. Could have been a MUCH better story. It has that potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"Laid up with hand surgery this summer, a creative writing instructor by trade, I must have read 60 current fiction titles. I have to tell you that the one that struck me as the most brilliant was The Memory Keeper's Daughter. I am still haunted by this family. This novel was written so beautifully that I found myself rereading lines as if they were poetry. I will be buying her second and third and forever novels. What a treat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"pass on this go-no-where, repetitive book","review":"This may have been one of the worst books I have ever read. The author's repetitive and overly descriptive sentences quickly becomes tiresome. I decided to finish the book as I wanted to find out what happened at the end of the story but I skimmed much of the book looking only to read necessary material. And, quite frankly, the ending wasn't worth it. I suggest passing on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Secrets Kill","review":"A bitersweet story of family 'secrets,' -how they can kill and certainly do destroy a family structure.

Review by Robert Betancourt, screenwriter and author ofMost Favored Nation"},{"rating":"1","title":"little more than a potboiler","review":"I'll be quite frank, since my thoughts on thsi book did not linger much. With a terrific and poignant beginning, the author manages to point out how a secret can subconsciously dissolve the lives of the people involved - and nothing more.She manages to insert some nice peices of family melodrama, but other than that, she depends too much on a singular point, and the great begining is followed by the usual pages and pages of wondering thoughts and ramblings. It eventually comes to a nice, bland conclusion, leaving the reader still stuck in the indecisive muck and wondering if the author should have had another climax besides the one in the first couple chapters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Memory Keepers Daughter------argh!","review":"This is the worst book I've EVER read. A New York Times best seller? Oh please!I thought it might have some redeeming qualities and was hopeful especially after reading that the \\"Memory Keeper\\" had left his past behind, including changing his name. My father did the same and we didn't meet his family until he was 89!But NOOOO.....it was bad from beginning to end. Incredible waste of time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly overrated novel !","review":"While the book had some vivid imagery and occasional memorable descriptions, it was in desperate need of a good editor. There was way too much repetition, to the point of insulting the reader, as if we had to be reminded again and again of a particular event or character. If the book had been half as long, it might have been a much better novel. Don't waste your valuable time on this book; read something honest that respects you as a reader and will stay with you for many months (such as The Kite Runner) instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Details","review":"I loved how Edwards really gave her characters such depth of spirit and soul. Today many people hide their true hearts and its hard to glimpse what's really going on inside, and how what we think may hurt us in life can really heal us."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry I didn't like it","review":"I wanted to like this book, especially as I have a brother who is mentally handicapped, and I'm really interested in books that deal with that topic. However, I found the characters to be self-indulgent, whiny, weak and unappealing. The two exceptions are the truck driver - a lovely fellow - and the girl with Down's syndrome, who was depicted sympathetically and well.Perhaps part of the problem was that I read it after I read The Girls - a novel about conjoined twins who are anything but self-pitying. After their brave embrace of life, I had no tolerance for the Doctor with everything, who couldn't get past his childhood, and who was so incredibly emotionally crippled."},{"rating":"1","title":"exciting premise bombs out","review":"Begins w excellent promise for exciting things to follow. The first chapters are the best, then it drags out. Characters are well defined, but the story has no spectacular events. Just ordinary people making concrete decisions.(David's--self-serving and devestating; others--well intentioned, yet self-serving--Caroline's) Basically its about living with consequences of keeping secrets.Overall I liked the walk back in memory lane to life in the sixties, but I was looking for more--especially after hearing so many people give this book rave reviews. I continued to read and finished the book only because I was waiting for some kind of \\"aha\\" moment . . . too many loose ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopeful in the beginning; disappointed in the end","review":"This sounded like a wonderfully intriguing book. While it was well written, it was poorly edited. There was much that could and should have been left out. The storyline with the Rosemary character served little purpose and the sudden death of one of the major characters was baffling. There were strong female characters and weaker male characters throughout the story...and this was so blatant that it took away from the story's believability. I enjoyed the first 100 pages or so and finished it because my book club was reading the book. Interestingly, the other members had the almost identical conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Life at Anne Geddes' House","review":"Each day I forced myself to pick it up and read another chapter, praying that my trust would be rewarded. Each day I was wrong. Ordinary life isn't ordinary. The conflicts we face are real and terrifying and joyous, and the author had so many things to choose from (too many to write well about, in fact) ; autism, twins, infidelity, the list goes on. The end result is what sounds like the ethereal rambling of a frustrated housewife with an empty nest. Save your money, read the synopsis."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want a refund!","review":"It's a good thing I got this book as a gift, because it would have truly been a waste of money. Not only was it boring, but the characters were so bland and one dimensional that I imagined little cutout paper people walking around having this drivel dialogue. There was no mystery, no suspense, nothing...just an aimless wander through some really self-absorbed character's lives. I really tried to plow through it but completely lost my ability to care. My cat likes to lay on the book, he obviously gets more enjoyment out if it than I do!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Memory Keeper's Daughter","review":"This is a beautifully written book. Maybe slow at times but definitely worth the great story."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was the point","review":"Between the store hype and my friend's hype, I bought this book. I couldn't stand the main characters. The story was contrived. It did a very good job of presenting a person with Down's Syndrome and how to treat her. Other than that it was a wasted read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy read, little substance","review":"I picked this book up because of the cover. I know, don't judge a book by its cover. However, the quotes on the jacket were quite compelling. To my disappointment, this is no extraordinary book. Just a simple story about two families bound by a disgraceful secert. I expected there would be more emotion, more deepth of character and more interesting scenes. Instead, I found the author stretching to be poetic and using wore out scenerios- like having a character drive dangerously fast to the river, out of anguish. The worst part of this book for me was the introduction a new character towards the end of the book. This interduction was disjointed and too outlandish to be true to these lives. Also, it set up the end of the book for the same type of scenes. The Memory Keeper's Daughter has a beautiful title, and is an easy read, but if your looking for a rewarding, quality read: pass this one by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful book","review":"This story was predictable and poorly written.

Ionabicycle."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Memory Keeper's Daughter - This is Not Literature","review":"I agree with the reviewer who noted, \\"Some ominously saccharine moments indicate that Edwards can slip into the treacly trade...\\" but I disagree that these moments are infrequent. This is one of the most banal books I have read in years. It is not possible to invest in these characters emotionally, plot developments are not credible, e.g., the advent of Al, the truck driver, and every page is filled with comments about the weather and/or the outdoor plants. I had to force myself to finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started off interesting but fell very flat.","review":"This novel started off with an interesting premise. After the first couple of chapters though it flatlined and it was a struggle to finish the book. The only reason was to find out the ramifications of that fateful decision. Well, it was very anti-climactic. The author took the easy way out and cheated the readers. And was it necessary to repeat over and over and over that the Dr. gave away his daughter? We got that from the beginning. It's beating a dead horse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Screwed by Kindle","review":"I bought the paperback version but followed the link \\"to start reading the book immediately on my Kindle\\" and Amazon charged me again for the book even though the Kindle book is only readable on the Kindle and so can't be shared with a circle of friends. So be forewarned, if you want to read the book on Kindle, and keep it too, you will be buying the same book twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"the memory keeper's daughter","review":"Loved the way the book was written. Felt I knew the characters more personally. Keep talking about it to my work colleagues and my 86 year old mother also thoroughly enjoyed it and the way in which it was written. So that is saying something.The story was different and you hoped all along that the Doctor would tell his wife the secret of his daughter all the way through it. Loved it most enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Intentions Gone Astray","review":"The story of a fraternal twin born mentally retarded and her father's decision to protect his wife from this knowledge forges an intricate tale of lies, deceit, heartbreak and triumph. He is forever controlled by guilt, his wife by sorrow and his son by loss. The nurse who makes her fateful decision to raise this girl as her own struggles with her own emotions and inner conflict, but finds joy and satisfaction in mothering this needy child. Some aspects of the story are a little far fectched, however, can be overlooked due to the well developed characters and plot. A good read overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"This book falls in the category of a \\"good beach read.\\" The storyline drags mercilessly once one has read through the initial very engrossing pages. The writing style becomes increasingly tiresome. Towards the end, I was skipping whole paragraphs and didn't feel as if I'd missed a thing. The characters are thoroughly unlikeable. When I finished this book, I read a book by Marily Robinson, \\"Housekeeping\\", and was struck by the contrast between a great writer and a fair writer. Don't waste your time, unless you're on the beach with time to waste!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\" WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY \\"","review":"NOW THIS STARTED OFF KEEPING MY INTEREST THEN, IT WAS LIKE READING SOME OTHER BOOK .

I found myself skipping past the chapters regarding the Henry family, and reading only the chapters about Caroline, et al."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just didn't care","review":"Silly me bought into the hype on this book. I was hoping for an in depth character study that would make me feel anger/sadness/happiness. Instead, I just felt cold towards all of the characters in this book. The only part that angered me was the fact that this story was about a man who decided everyone's fate based on another person's experience. His sister died young which had a huge impact on his own mother, so he decides to save everyone the trouble the second time around. Instead of it being a selfless thing to do, I read it as a very selfish thing to do. This man just did not want to deal with another family upheaval, so instead he lied and then couldn't live with that lie either. It was the height of the male ego. The man will protect us all, and then ruin our lives anway.Very boring read and not really worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This book was beautifully written but I didn't like the characters. Although I grew up in the 60's and 70's, I could not connect to the them and therefore found the book difficult to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow read","review":"The author is a very good writer, however not my style at all. She is very poetic in her descriptions and overly too descriptive for my liking. If felt the story moved very slowly because of this. I felt annoyed by this which made reading this unenjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book started off exciting but quickly crashed and burned. It was extremely hard to get through and I had to force myself to finish the book. There was entirely too much scenery description and little sustenance to the plot.It would be an interesting subject for a book club discussion as there are several controversial topics but overall not a book I would recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"A \\"precise\\" disappointment","review":"I was very excited to read this book and was very disappointed. The story had potential but there was too much detail and not enough dialogue. Her descriptions were dramatic and unrealistic. She used the words \\"delicate and precise\\" to describe everything, those words were used over and over to the point I wanted to scream....Toward the end of the book I skipped paragraphs, sometimes pages, of useless repetitive soap opera descriptions to try to get to the meat of the story. Bottom line, it was a waste of good reading time. You should read \\"The Glass Castle\\" now that is a GOOD book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book drove me crazy...","review":"First of all this book drove me crazy because the author consistently said Phoebe had Down's Syndrome instead of Down Syndrome. I have a son with Down Syndrome and in the past twelve years of living with this diagnosis, reading books, hearing professionals speak on the subject, and talking to other parents, it is always referred to as Down Syndrome not Down's Syndrome. But since I live in this world of Trisomy 21 I figured I would give the book a chance. I tried and kept at it for weeks. Reading it felt more like work than pleasure. The characters were shallow and I never felt connected to them. Although I disliked David in the beginning he became more likable as the story progressed. Probably because he had a little more to him than the others. The premise was great but the character development and story just fizzled and died. I was left feeling I didn't know who these people were even after I read 400 pages of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"overhype,as usual","review":"Ron Charles review was better than the book! I could not relate or warm to any of these characters. I found the book boring ,frankly,through many passages. There was inconsistency(one place where the mom was referred to as \\"old fashioned\\",yet it was already brought out she'd had affairs,and drank..);but,bigger problem,just unlikable people,or worse I felt indifferent towards them-they were sterile. All those years,condensed,of course,for novel-size reading,but left me feeling let-down. there have been made-for-t.v. movies,etc..about Down's syndrome people marrying and all the parental concerns/conflicts..just another book about a bad marriage,'cause of a \\"bad\\"white male,and doctor,to boot. but i didn't find the story stirring,tho' first pages were promising."},{"rating":"1","title":"I may be the only person in the world who hands down, did not like this book","review":"I found it depressing, unrealistic (not that it should be...but really?!) and just disheartening. The ending just felt like \\"yeah, so that is what happened, it sucked, everyone was wrong\\" the end. Which now that I am writing this, is probably very realistic...but I guess I wanted something else. Some resolution, closure, something...blah."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Memorable Not a Keeper","review":"This book has a great concept for a storyline, a good idea for a plot. Unfortunately, I found the writing so poor, I had to force my way through a lot of it. More like a romance novel than a literary one, it was sometimes hard to follow the flashbacks that jump around and are inserted in a clumsy way to provide background information. Dialogue was often unrealistic. The wife's anger at her husband and her degeneration into drunkenness was not portrayed realistically to me; I kept wondering \\"Why?\\" She didn't know what he had done, after all. There were a number of sophomoric stylistics, repetitions, and inconsistencies (it needed an editor!.) It would have been interesting to see this same story in the hands of a really good writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seemed like it would never end","review":"The beginning of the book really grabbed me, but by the middle of the book, it seemed like it would never end. It felt like a nightmare from which I felt I would never wake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to force myself to finish it.....","review":"This book was a book club choice, so unfortunately all 700 times I wanted to put it down and never pick it up again I really couldn't. The characters were so boring and the descriptions went on and on. I actually believe there were about three pages devoted to a vaccume burning up. The story was a great idea, but the telling of it fell more than flat. I am not sure how it became a best seller...perhaps the pretty cover? I am an avid reader, and was extremely dissapointed with The Memory Keeper's Daughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Summer Drivel","review":"Yes, it began interestingly enough but was indeed too long with a sappy ending. And why was David the only parent Paul had difficulty with? How about finding his mom's clothes on the beach or knowing about her many other affairs? That might cause a child to wonder. It seemed like David and Rosemary were the most believeable characters in the book. Many holes in the story. Summer drivel, I guess, but it's hard to see how this is a bestseller."},{"rating":"1","title":"A memory I'd like to forget","review":"My experience has been with the audio book. At about disc three (listening on a road trip) I couldn't decide whether counting the number of red cars that passed me would be more interesting than continuing to listen to the story. I give it two stars because the premise of the book is interesting. Beyond that, it's a disaster. I have never read a story where I could care less about the characters. They are flat, undeveloped, and unlikeable. I don't feel a shred of compassion for any of them. There is an excessive use of bad metaphors and excrutiating detail that oftentimes is irrelevant to creating a visual experience for the reader. It feels like the author tries too hard. I could say so much more, but I'm sure other reviewers have said enough!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"I listened to the audio version of this book. I found certain issues to be annoyingly repetative throughout the book. Also, the fact that the main characters were so stuck and couldn't break out of it... more than once I wanted to scream, \\"Get family couseling!\\"This book left me in the pits!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Book was perfect for book clubs","review":"This book was chosen for my book club. I wasn't completely enthralled with it, but it did generate a lot of discussion. It seemed a little slow and I wanted to slap the woman many times and tell her to move on. I understood how and why the man acted the way he did. I also enjoyed the story of the nurse and her life, but the mother's character I never could relate to. She had a baby die. I can't imagine that kind of loss, but I felt like it was over done. Her affairs and her drama made her an unlikeable person. I like books that I can identify with the characters, and even though I didn't with the woman, I did enjoy the book and the reactions of my book club."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotional Read...","review":"The story was well written but I found it really repetetive. How many times can you mention \\"that fateful snowy night\\" If it was 50 pages lighter it would have been more effective. I liked the story of Norah and David.And when David gave his down syndrome daughter to his nurse Caroline she became the hero of the story to me. She was a great mom who loved Phoebe so much. It was a little depressing..alcoholism adultery and a lot of bitterness. But it still was worth reading because it made me feel the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"I only finished it because its the only reading matieral I brought on the plane :(","review":"It started out well enough but I have to agree with the other reviews, the book was too focused on making the Father the bad guy while the women play \\"victim\\".Two stars because it had potential and was hard to put down during the initial chapters."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"The first half of this book was fairly engaging, but it went downhill quickly after that. I felt like the writer was conveying what she's learned in school about marital dysfunction and deterioration, rather than something she'd learned through experience. The writing was over-wrought. In fact, the last 20% of the book, the writer seemed to lose interest in the story and instead focused on trying to word impressions and scenes in a pretty and striking way. This was very irritating and I really struggled to finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Prose Than Plot","review":"I love the creative use of words and poetic phrases in a novel when used to to propel the story. This author seemed to love her own creative wording for their own sake, more than for moving the story along. Shortly into this book I actually tired of the use of all the lovely phrases that just dragged the story to a slower and slower pace as each page when by. I kept with if for about 1/4 the way into the book, giving it that long to develop a plot line that would hook me in, but it just didn't come about yet, and I put it down. I have not been compelled to pick it up again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A page-turner, but too sad","review":"I could not put this book down! Yet, for all of that, once I finished it, I felt cheated and DEEPLY saddened. The only happy part of the book is Phoebe. Everything else is just...sad. And there are a couple of plot twists that I can't stomach, either because they take away from the story or because they make no sense. I can't say anything more without spoilers, so I won't; but I did not like this book very much and I do not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully Slow","review":"This book had so much promise, but it seems the author got lost in the same blizzard the night that David Henry delievered his twins. Lack of character development, too many descriptions (every. single. detail. must. be. included.) and a disappointing ending contributed to a boring, misguided novel. One star for the cover and one star for the ability to fool so many people into buying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely Disappointing","review":"The first half of the book was interesting enough. The story was page turning, leaving the reader wondering how this was going to turn out and appreciating the writing style of the author. About 2/3 of the way in, I realized that I didn't care for any of the characters and thus didn't mind if someone was hurt. That is what made this a disapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written with unlikeable characters","review":"I was led to believe this book was something more than just a poorly written romance novel, but that's pretty much what it was. I'm game for a good \\"beach read\\" type of book if it's engaging and at least somewhat well-written, but this book is not. There was not one character I felt was well-developed or particularly likable. The writing style was amatuerish, and repetetive, and the resolution was unsatisfying. I was left with a feeling of \\"who cares?\\" as well as disappointment that I had wasted my time on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Memory Keeper's Daughter","review":"If you like Lifetime TV you will love this book. If you think Lifetime TV is nothing but whiney, \\"poor me\\", helpless women movies, you'll never make it to the end. You decide which camp you are in and read or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Characters diminished by bad structure","review":"The author obviously paid very high regard to the characters in her book. Her treatment of them all as sensitive souls shows her gentle approach to all of the book's mechanics and story development. This is what made this book so caring, yet so bland.I'll say harshly; Ms. Edwards should now return to academics of story structure basics and research skills, with a bit of grammar rules thrown in. I felt as if I was reading a draft, not a published piece.In addition to unnoticed skips during the edit process, there are many factual errors, as cited by other reviewers. One that surprised me was about the brochure and the art museum. The other is about bluebirds; Norah expresses concern about the future owners feeding them. Bluebirds don't take to feeders; they are insectivorous."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-So Read","review":"I was so frustrated reading this book. I am not sure I believed the main character, a doctor who gives away his daughter to a nurse & tells his wife that the daughter is dead. The deception causes the family to fall apart and then later on in the book he rescues a pregnant teenager and helps her raise the child. A little unbelievable despite the fact it is fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR PRECIOUS TIME!","review":"I bought this book with such great hope and enthusiasm. The premise of the story was so interesting, complex and thought provoking, how could it possibly fail? But fail it certainly did. I lost interesting after less than 100 pages. The author meanders to random incidents that don't matter, strange tangents, and you find yourself shouting, \\"Big deal! Who cares!\\" I thought I was alone in these thoughts but quickly found out that all my friends agreed. The book is more hype than substance. I imagined it in the league of The Lovely Bones or The Kite Runner. BOY! was I wrong!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Empty characters, too long. and unbelievable plot","review":"I think the story could have worked, but things just went on and on, and the characters were all so stuck in their own little slots. They weren't \\"real.\\" I kept seeing this book and had read the back several times and wanted to read it, and then a friend recommended it, so I bought a copy. Mistake. I didn't ever like the characters (and I mean any of them!). The plot was plodding, and the ending was kind of predictable and silly. I just felt like I wasted good reading time on this book when I was done. I will often be willing to try an author again, but this one put me off to the point where I wouldn't even check one of hers out of the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful premise. Tedious telling.","review":"I was really hooked from that first scene and the description of the main character's meeting his wife & their love for each other. If it hadn't been for that first scene hooking me so hard I don't think I would've made it through the book. Sadly, the relationships felt so void of attachment. The characters were so self-absorbed -- not just the main character. After a while I just found the story depressing - not sad. I always finish a book once I start it, but this one tested me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly Memorable","review":"While the cover and premise drew me to this book, I have to say that both my mother and I were bored with the story. I found myself skipping whole paragraphs in an effort to finally get to the \\"good parts.\\" I felt like a grey haze permeated the book and left the reader feeling relieved after reading. It was something to \\"get through\\" rather than relish. The story itself is interesting, but I think the writing drained the book of all its \\"umph.\\" The characters seemed flat and too tormented. If I had to plot this book on a graph, with time on the x-axis and plot/interest level on the y-axis, there would be a straight line across the page. Needless to say, I had high expectations and felt disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite there.","review":"Interesting plot setup with a lot of promise... but instead, it unfolded into a Lifetime movie. Or soap opera. I've read better."},{"rating":"1","title":"tearjerker","review":"This novel begins with a great premise, but the repetitive imagery in the writing is a drag, and ultimately the book comes off as melodramatic and maudlin as a soap opera. Similar but better book club picks focusing on the consequences of keeping secrets: THE MADONNAS OF LENINGRAD, THOSE WHO SAVE US, or MARCH."},{"rating":"1","title":"**Don't Read This, Don't Read This!!**","review":"I chose this book after reading some reviewers' comments and also based on its high ranks in bestseller lists. I was sorely, sorely disappointed. This book lacked character development, ingenuity, excitement and intrigue. I cannot fathom why it is a bestseller.There IS value in the historical aspect of this novel however. It is worthwhile reading what feelings were like with regard to parenting a child with Down's, the progression of advocacy for educational integration for the mentally challenged, and progression from the traditional roles of men and women in marriage and work lives. Beyond these items, I felt the book was a let-down. It is certainly not one I would recommend save the values cited previously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking in chewable substance","review":"This book, so loaded with promise by it's title, nature and theme, feels more like a book full of one dimentional characters. No one character is fleshed out enough to be believable. I would not recommend this book. It truly is a disappointment. If you must read it, buy it used or better yet the library has it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"This book was highly recommended; however, I found it very shallow and boring. It did have potential, but it dragged in so many places, was redundant in almost every chapter. I think that some of the items described did not even exist in the mid-60', for example David \\"adjusted the car seat\\" for the newborn. If I remember correctly, we used \\"car beds,\\" for our little ones then, and the baby was usually carried home in Mom's arms. There were a couple of other things that I cannot remember, but it seems that this type of error should be caught by editors. I am a person who loves to read a good and well-written novel. This is not one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful Fluff","review":"Very unlikable characters. Caroline was the only character to sympathize with. Didn't think there was a solid resolution. Would have been literature if even one chapter had been written in Phoebe's perspective.Waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT? WHO? WHY????","review":"I like to read good fiction that is well written, but this book was a drag from start to finish. The author seems to concentrate far more on her flowery descriptions of the most mundane acts and scenes, but never develops her characters OR the potentially great plot that falls flat on it's face with a sloppy plop at the end of the book. We really never even get to know our characters at all, or even what they really look like. Some just disappear (Michelle, Rosemary, Howard. Where did they go???)It never did take off, and in fact was the most boring read I have had in years. Vague characters who, you find, you don't really CARE what happens to them. And ultimately, nothing really does. Most disappointing was the rave reviews it got from authors that I have respected in the past. Are they just trying to save face? A real disappointment. I will not read anything by this author again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I shouldn't have bothered reading this book","review":"I think the author has potential. I found myself getting interested for a short time and then positively bored.I think one of my problems with this book is Norah's daily obsession with a daughter that she thought died at birth. It seems like you would obviously mourn the loss but then be grateful for the twin son that lived. I can't imagine that she would ache and pine daily for this girl to the point that she doesn't really enjoy her beautiful healthy son. It just seems ridiculous that 5, 10 , 15, 20 years later you constantly think and grieve for a child you never knew."},{"rating":"1","title":"sentimental and predictable","review":"This book reminds of those stories that used to be in ladie's magazines when I was a teenager. lots of emotion, unbelievable circumstances with a few plucky women mustering through in spite of adversity."},{"rating":"1","title":"too sad and too slow","review":"I thought the poetic wording in this novel was beautiful, but tedius. I never stop reading a book in the middle so I skipped about twenty pages midway through just so I could get things moving along. Another problem was how sad this book is. Everyone is so depressed and miserable. And Norah seemed very selfish and unlikable. I actually liked David Henry the most out of all the characters. Whatever he might have done wrong, at least his motives were pure. Everyone else just seemed so self possessed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written, terribly boring.","review":"This book is beautifully written, but goodness is it boring. The plot moves at a glacial pace in a seemingly endless cycle of sadness, guilt, dishonesty, repeat, with no resolution. I had to put the book down without finishing it as it was simply not my cup of tea. My girlfriend at the time gave it a better go than I did, but even she quit on it before finishing despite the fact that she had an outside interest in the subject matter. It really is a shame as the author is very talented in her ability to put words on the page."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Memories for Me","review":"I found THE MEMORY KEEPER'S DAUGHTER to be disappointing for me. I chose it for the story which sounded wonderful, but I found the writing tedious. The story didn't move for me. It seemed to be in a midst of a fog with far too many details about things that didn't matter and not enough about things that did interest me. After awhile, I didn't care if I finished it or not and started other books, which I completed, before returning to this one. I wished I'd checked it out at the library rather than spent money on it, quite honestly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"I don't get the excitement over this book. I kept expecting something to happen, waited patiently and then realized I was done with the darned book. And nothing much had happened.I don't get the selfish, spoiled son. I can't buy that the loss of her child made Norah a drunk adultress. Didn't know David Henry well enough to digest the difference between what he was before and what he was after he gave his baby away.And the way the big secret was revealed after all those years, for no good reason, was a let-down. Surely there was a more heart-wrenching devastating way for Norah to learn of her daughter's survival.I guess I expected the Henry family to \\"accidentally\\" meet up with the long-lost daughter instead of Caroline arriving for coffee and spilling the beans.Duller than dirt with many missed opportunities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype","review":"This book started out with such promise. The under-developed characters just did nothing for me. I really really wanted to like this book, but the author wouldn't let me. It was boring and hard to finish. There are just too many cliches and no dialogue! It felt like an after-school special. This book is selling by word-of-mouth. Don't believe the hype. I agree with other reviewers who suggest Kingsolver's \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" or Walls' \\"The Glass Castle\\". Those are books that are not a waste of your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really enjoyed this book","review":"This book sucked me in by page 5. It slowed down after a while but was still a fascinating story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Generally good but slow in parts","review":"I generally liked the story and thought it was well-written. I found some of it kind of slow in parts, though. I think the son was the weakest character; the nurse the strongest. I did not understand why the wife hung in with her unhappy marriage for so long, though. I would recommend this book with some reservations."},{"rating":"2","title":"First of all, remember this is set in the early 60's...","review":"That I think is key to getting why the wife did not \\"insist\\" on seeing the stillborn child. Women in those years did just do what the husband said and did accept his word as the end all. Of course, back then children born with Down's were sent away as well. Now they are just terminated (90% +) once the parents know of the extra chromosome.I quite enjoyed the book and the growth of Nora from dependant to independant combined with the changes the world was going through at that time."},{"rating":"1","title":"All build up and no pay off.","review":"This is my first review for Amazon and I will get straight to the point.The first 75% of this book I was entranced. I kept wondering what the outcome would be. What would happen? Well, the remaining 25% of the book was much less than I thought it should have been. It was very lackluster. It was predictable and did not provide any payoff. The story just sort of spiraled and ended. I would have recommended this book had the last few chapters actually been any good. I am dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got tired of the characters","review":"I really liked the premise for this book, and thought it had great potential. About halfway through I was either impatient with or bored of several of the major characters. It was an OK story, but I would have liked to see more three-dimensional characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too sentimental!","review":"I couldn't relate to most characters in this book. It was very sentimental and almost written like it was a cheap romance novel. Thankfully, it didn't take very long to read, hence no regrets about wasting time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a yawn!","review":"Hugely diappointing! I read the media reviews and kept scratching my head wondering, \\"Did we read the same book?\\" I have read and loved everything from Shakespeare to Dickens, to Austin, to Dostoevsky, and I found this book sham literature. Granted the premise is profound, and the questions raised by the novel's ideas, stimulating. But it had so many incongruities, shallow characters, implausible motivations, it became impossible to believe a word of it. And the descriptive passages bordered on the absurd! It began to feel like Forest Gump meets Peyton Place. A waste of time at any price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weel-researched and very believable!","review":"I kept looking for the place in the book where the real characters were referenced. When I got to the end and realized this was true fiction I was in awe! The research that Kim Edwards did was so 'right-on' for the time period, and the story compelling and I couldn't put it down, I had to find out what happened next!while I have a child with Down syndrome, I have since given the book to a friend who does not have a child with Down syndrome and she was as taken by the book as I was.I highly recommend the Memory Keeper's Daughter to anybody who likes to read stories of family, family secrets, and people who will take risks, as well as people who let thier fears direct them! There is every personality in this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. Read it to the end and was left with a feeling that I wasted my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is dissapointing how horribly written this book is.","review":"My sister recommended this book to me because my nephew has Down's Syndrome. The story sounded fascinating so got it. Unfortunately, I was monumentally dissaponted with it.The writer felt an often annoying need to over-describe everything creating a bunch of hyper sensory characters that you could never really relate to. Each description is terribly cliche and seems to have been put there just to fill up space.Also, there is WAY too much going on in this book. Too many sub-stories and ideas that could never be fully explored and seem to have been added because the writer wasn't talented enough to create a full novel out of her main premise (which was more than adequate to begin with).The book really drags. I wouldn't recommned it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time.....","review":"Had I known this book would turn end the way it did, I would have saved myself the time and effort. The synopsis sounded great, and I heard from a reliable source that it was a good book. It took me weeks to read it, because I just couldn't get into it. I kept putting it down, and reading other books in the meantime.I was not able to identify or grow to like/love any of the characters. The plot was good, but to drag it on for 25 years....????? Come on! And the part where David \\"rescued\\" Rosemary? I was about to just call it quits and put the book down. I was very disappointed to find out that David died before he could even admit his guilt. This book could have easily been 150 pages long, and then maybe I wouldn't have been so upset about taking the time to read it. I will not be recommending this book to ANYONE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"contrived","review":"The real question is: so many people recommended this book -- did I miss something? The plot is contrived; the characters are made from cardboard; and it reads like a 2nd rate romance novel.New characters and plot elements are introduced with the finesse of a child forcing puzzle pieces together that don't quite fit; the author used a hammer to knock them in place.Your time is valuable; skip this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived, Unbelievable, and Disappointing","review":"I hated myself for reading this, and can't believe I made it all the way through. The story suffers, because in order for it to be believable, the characters have to be so neurotic and tortured that you can't really find them likeable. It's as though they wanted to be miserable and then expected them to feel compassion for their self-inflicted pain. I did not find the actions, motivations, or reactions of the characters to be at all credible. The Bestseller status of this novel explains why Dr. Phil is such a success. For those who roll their eyes at self pity and navelgazing, you'll likely react similarly to this novel.Given it's substantive weakness, it would have to be extremely well written or constructed to work. Unfortunately, the writing is somwhat amateurish and predictable. I've seen worse, but the best way I could describe it is to say it's a mediocre writer who worked really, really hard and came up with a passably readable book."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAAAAAAAAAY too long","review":"The biggest problem with book is that it was too long. I felt like it would never end. The story is not interesting enough to be novel sized. There is nothing to keep the reader interested. There really wasn't that much of the story. I feel bad and everything for the character, but I kept asking myself, why am I reading this? I kept thinking something interesting might be coming. But it never did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak, Thin, Parts that are Implausible","review":"How did this book get to be a bestseller? It is replete with cliches. Its plot is weak. There is no substance. The characters are pathetic. And I have never seen so many typographical errors in one book. Was there no editor? Spell check can't catch everything, as even my 7th-grade students know. I have continued reading, as other readers have, thinking that something positive is bound to come of the sunk cost of time. Kim Edwards has no editor, but she must have geniuses working overtime in her marketing department."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea - awful follow through","review":"This book was so disappointing. I was excited to read it because I had fallen into the trap of believing it was a good piece of literature from critic's reviews. The story line was also intriguing and I looked forward to reading the tale. Although I did not enjoy it after the first few pages, I continued to read it in anticipation of redeeming qualities that would explain all the hype. Sadly, there were none. The characters were poorly developed and the story focused solely on details while skipping over essential parts of the plot. I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing read","review":"I was hooked by the story line and it seemed to have such possibilities, however, the book turned out to be a total disappointment. The characters were not interesting at all. The story line moved way too slow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chick Lit that didn't deliver on my expectations","review":"Not to disparage chick lit...Afterall, I'm a chick.And I like lit.I *did* finish the book (which I wouldn't have, if it were \\"horrible\\"...)I just sincerely wished it would pack more of an emotional punch... I honestly expected to \\"connect\\" emotionally more with the material, and it just didn't happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Memory Keeper","review":"I was recommended this book by a friend. It was a leisurely read...all summer into fall. I seldom read fiction and it was a chore to finish this novel by Kim Edwards. Although the basic plot was interesting, the characters were shallow and too much description of nothing in particular dragged down the momentum of this novel. And there was something missing in the dialogue of the characters....they were flat instead of round, and this was a disappointment for me. I did begin to wonder how this book made it to the top. Sometimes the top is a flop I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was the editor?","review":"Considering that I have a dear brother who was born with Down Syndrome (not Down's) in 1964, I had such high hopes for this book. The author's insights into people with Down Syndome, and those who love and care for them are beautiful. However, the author's description of places and events in 1964 do not capture the times at all. For example, no one except scientists used the term Down Syndrome. Mongoloid, however awful it sounds today, was perfectly acceptable in 1964. Other examples are less central to the story, but destracting non the less. For example, 13 year old boys did not go for daily, morning runs in 1977. Few people did. I don't think the interstate system had exit ramps at that time. Nylon stockings didn't come in a wide variety of jewel toned colors....etc, etc. I am trying to get past my frustrations with these incorrect details in order to finish the story. But, I'm struggling."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOOO long","review":"I'm only like 200 pages in, which means I have like 300 more to go. WHY? This book is KILLING me. I noticed very early on that the characters are too self aware. As other commenters mentioned, the descriptions of water and light and fans and beauty are very unrealistic, too romantic to be believable. Also, every time Phoebe is mentioned, the only descriptive term is \\"beautiful.\\" In an effort to be politically correct, she fails to be realistic. These are her exercises in mushy writing. The images she creates are beautiful in a broken way, but it's just not how people going about their daily lives think or process their realities. Like Annie Dillard, but with no substance. Every character is a stock character from a soap opera. And the husband, David, is too heavily portrayed as an antagonist. Yes, he screwed up, but his character should be given a little more sympathy. Please don't pay money for this if you have to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Disappointed","review":"I read quite a bit, majority is not 'novelish' but I was struck by the title and premise story of this book. The first 3 chapters were good and intrigued me slightly. After that it was down hill. This book and story line had such potential but it lacked living up to what could have been a good, informative, and sympathetic book. Sorry to say that I would not recommend this book to anyone and I am more sorry that I wasted money on buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was all the hype about?","review":"This book began with a strong storyline. Then halfway through it became a drawn out read. I enjoyed chapters that were about Caroline and Phoebe, but those chapters were few and far between. The chapters about Norah and her family were terrible. They were unlikable characters and the book took on such a whiney tone. I could not believe all the people that said this was an interesting read. It was drawn out and generally dull. I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"i'm glad i wasn't the only one...","review":"I'm so glad that I'm not the only one who ended up being extremely bored by this book. It started off being an amazing book--I couldn't stop thinking about it or wanting to read it. But then, like many others have said, by about page 150, I was just so tired of it. It's like the story line kept hinting that certain events would take place, but they never did. It ended up being much more abstract and far-fetched than it began, and that's what made me dislike it.I almost stopped reading it with about 100 pages left to go, but then I thought about how so many people were raving about it and how it was a #1 Bestseller for so long, and I figured that maybe, just maybe, there would be some redeeming factor at the conclusion. There wasn't. It was a waste of time, money, and effort. I tell everyone who's interested that it was incredibly depressing and not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cries out for an editor","review":"Starts off great - full of potential. Then declines into a real whine. Over & over again the \\"memory\\" keeps them separate & never resolves itself. Over & over we hear about how every slight ties back to that one event. I get it, I get it! Then, just when you think the book might wrap itself up in a pretty bow, you get to page 400 - yes, all the way there - and the editor falls asleep! The \\"memory keeper\\" lives his entire life with no one knowing his full name. One other (contrived) character knows this secret but no one tells the other main characters his full name. Yet, there is shows up on his head stone. Bah, humbug! Waste of money if they can't even get the editor to pay attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I've ever read","review":"I read a volume of short stories by Kim Edwards, \\"The Secrets of a Fire King\\", and was impressed with the dreamy, fluid quality of her prose. Most of the stories were set in exotic locations and/or involved a variety of offbeat characters. I highly anticipated reading \\"The Memory Keeper's Daughter\\" and was sorely disappointed, almost to the point of disgust. The prose was awkward, the story boring and I could not sympathize with any of the depthless, flatly drawn characters. After the brilliance of Ms. Edward's short stories, this was a huge letdown and if I could have given it zero stars I would have. Perhaps short stories are her forte; I cannot recommend \\"The Secrets of a Fire King\\" enough, and I cannot recommend \\"The Memory Keeper's Daughter\\" at all. Why it has received such glowing reviews and wide readership is a mystery to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maudlin and Strewn with Purple Patches","review":"Proof yet again that an MFA degree is extremely overrated. The author attempts to write a book so ethereal, that it lacks characters with weight or substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good read","review":"i enjoyed this book, even tho i don't believe it lives up to the hype... however, it was an interesting concept (giving away a twin at birth and following the two lives), and I liked how the author juxtaposed the two \\"families\\"...that of david henry and his family vs. caroline gill...i didn't exactly want the book to end the way that it did, but i think it was more realistic than wrapping things up neatly. i thought some of the characters were a little contrived, and that the caroline gill/phoebe storyline was a little too pat; yet, the true measure of a book, for me, is how readable it is...does it keep drawing me me in, do i think about it when i'm not reading, is it hard to put down...this book was all of those things..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Novice Writing","review":"Really, I could write this book. I don't know why it has so many good reviews. The premise of the book is fantastic, but the book needed to be given to another writer. So many predictable and well-used novice symbolisms in this book. The characters aren't really likeable. The only reason I kept on reading was that I kept on waiting for the big climax. There was none. The ending was very poor. The beginning chapters went on and on and on...I wouldn't bother reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different time, a different way of life","review":"Wasn't quite sure about the ending - I don't know if the wife would have made a different choice as she came across as a society wife to me. A good read though."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real stinker!","review":"Sorry to be so negative, but I found this book to be so idiotic and stupid I could hardly stand it. How many times do I have to read that someone's hand resembles a starfish? Driving over a hill at night, the character almost loses control of the car because the sight of the city is so beautiful. What city is it? Pittsburgh. A woman who is engaged to a brilliant scientist loses him to an accident when he jumps off a bridge as a stunt. Huh? Come on! There are so many examples of inanity that I can't count them all. If you'd like a full dose of sclock, buy this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I gave it a shot","review":"I read until page 127 and couldn't waste any more time on it. The author uses 10 words where maybe 2-3 would do. Painfully drawn out and dull, over-romanticized and flowery descriptions and repetitive \\"unique\\" and cliched phrases/references. It seems like it had potential, but I just couldn't read any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a painful disappointment","review":"Like others here, I bought this book at the bookstore because it was on the bestseller table and the cover was cute and it had an interesting synopsis. NEVER judge a book by its cover! The writing was tedious, the characters uninteresting. I thought the wife was petty and unforgiving, the son an ungrateful brat, and the nurse too insecure that you don't bother cheering for her. The father seemed a decent man whose normal faults the author made monumental. Give me a break, Lady. I'm feeling generous in giving it two stars instead of one. Maybe because I'm a twin myself, so I liked the idea of a book about twins. The only reason I skimmed the book to completion is that I was stuck in a hotel in Alaska."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"While this book was not the most uplifting of novels, it told a story that was worth reading. I can understand other readers feelings about the characters, you don't really get to know who they REALLY are, but the story gets through in spite of that. I feel it was a wonderful first effort and congratulate Ms. Edwards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Henry: Get on with it!","review":"Although I enjoyed the story, I wanted David Henry to tell all from the first and not ruin his marriage and his life. I found his secret so heavy, I felt tired for him. Did he have the right to spoil his wife's and his son's lives with his secret? I don't think so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great plot but dull","review":"The storyline makes for a great plot but still fell flat. The beginning started out great and then the story just went on and on without any significant turn of events until the very end. I like descriptive authors, but paragraph after paragraph of describing the snow, the darkroom and picture taking..uggh! I ended up scimming the pages to see how the story ended, which in my opinion was predictable. Even with all the descriptive writing, I still didn't \\"get\\" the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"not recommended. good writing, good sub-plot, very sub-par novel.","review":"I'll keep this short. The writing is beautiful, and the idea is interesting. However, this is not an enjoyable book to read. The sub-plot was far more interesting, romantic, and generally compelling than the main plot, which for me was the main flaw. I found myself wanting to skip large sections of the book to get to the better parts. I honestly did not want to read on, but I happened to be on a plane and very bored with nothing else to do. I give this book one star for writing quality, and one star for the sub-plot. Nothing more. I do not recommend this book. If you are looking for a book in this genre of contemp. American fiction, I'd recommend the Time Travelers Wife."},{"rating":"2","title":"In defense of Kim Edward's research...","review":"In regard to the many reviews I've seen referencing the \\"Down's Syndrome\\" spelling in this book, this syndrome actually was called \\"Down's Sydrome\\" until sometime in the 1970s, when (gradually, I assume) people started to use Down Syndrome instead. Because the book starts in the early 60's the use of Down's Synrome would actually have been historically accurate. Granted, the story continues beyond the 70's, but assuming Caroline had used the term \\"Down's Syndrome\\" for most of Phoebe's life it wouldn't have been so strange for her to keep using it out of habit or not to have changed with the times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"I will keep this short and simple by saying read the review RMurray847 posted. It is spot on and my sentiments exactly. Every character in this book feels shallow, self-centered and uncaring about anyone but themselves, with the exception of Pheobe, the character with Down's syndrome. It started out as a good, original idea and went south from there. Unlike RMurray847, I only give it a one star because I always finish a book I start, and this one irritated me to the very end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting premise but ultimately disappointing","review":"The premise is fascinating - a daughter given away because of Down's syndrome and the nurse who raises her instead of taking her to an institution. And for the first few chapters, I was really hooked by the characters, their different ways of dealing with the situation.Unfortunately I found it very melodramatic after that, the way it always focused on how sad everything was for the family. People didn't really seem to change in the family's story, although there was more change in the nurse's side. I found it a bit unrealistic, every moment seemed so charged and emotional, at some point I think the characters would've become a bit more normal through sheer weariness.An interesting book that could've been a lot better if the characters were more explored and given depth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"I enjoyed this book very much and the way the author wrote it. I found it fascinating and very sad. It held my interest through out the entire book. Never ever got boring. I was truly amazed that a family lived this way. My heart broke for these people. An absolute eye opener. It did leave a lasting impression on me. I recommed it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost incredible.","review":"I've read through some of the reviews and I'm pretty shocked to see any bad ones.People complain about the under-development of the characters and the stillness of it all, the ongoing descriptions but why?The novel was itself was those things, why? Because the characters were stranded in time, in that stillness described.I don't have much to say other than this:It was an emotionally tiring and mostly, stirring novel. Which is, I consider, a compliment."},{"rating":"1","title":"good writing; improbable scenarios","review":"our book club read this book. we enjoyed this author's writing, unfortunately her characters were forced into contrived and improbable schenarios. although none of us are writers ourselves, we would have appreciated a more organic character development and less forced plot twist (a la judy picault). promising start, alas, a disappointing ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Plot, Wishy-Washy Characters","review":"The plot of the story is an interesting one, but the characters and their actions are just too sentimentally mundane to be realistic. The book reads far too much like a melodramatic soap opera with little substance. Dr. David Henry comes across as a man with no spine and no ethics, particularly for a doctor. Norah, his wife, appears as if she is a creature in la-la-land going through the emotions, clinging desperately onto her husband's every word as if he is a Greek Adonis. As for Caroline, the nurse who absconds with the baby girl, she is the only interesting and realistic character in the book, but the events in the book all fall in place far too easily to the point where the entire scenario becomes unbelievable and loses credibility. Let's just say, the book left much to be desired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spellbinding","review":"This book was a wonderful read.

Recommend this read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As the grandmother of twins","review":"The book was about love and loss. Love for two very different children and the loss of one very special child who is found again by her birth mother. The love of a very special foster parent shows through in a special way and you can feel the hurt of the birth mother's heart all through this book. It got to my heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Treasure","review":"The Memory Keeper's daughter is beautifully written and incredibly moving. It shows how one decision - made in an instant, under extremely difficult emotional circumstances - can change the course of your life, and the lives of the people you love. This book makes the reader wonder again and again, \\"What would I have done?\\" I highly recommend this book. It's a treasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"I was mad at the book from page two! I could not believe the inconsistencies. And who researched for this book? Norah went through the hormone changes where her hair falls out four DAYS after giving birth? Try four months! And she refers to Van Gogh's Starry Night at the Louvre. It's in the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Ugh!!The idea for the book was a great one. The execution was horrible. It would have been a great if it were a short story and written by someone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Memory Keeper's Daughter","review":"I enjoyed this book and have recommended it to several people who also liked it. It's captivating twists and turns through the lives of three very intriguing characters, David and Norah Henry and Caroline Gill, made it hard to put down. I will say that I was left wanting more. I did not feel closure on certain matters. Without giving too much away, I wish that some relationships would have mended and others would have elaborated further. It is, however, true to life and gives a great lesson about how important it is to be honest with those we love regardless of the consequences. Edwards does an excellent job of describing each tiny detail which really gives you the feeling that you are in the room with each character. I also feel like the time period is accurately portrayed. It is interesting to see how each character and society changed over the course of 25 years. Overall, it is a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"layered consequences","review":"This book is beautifully written.

It was very slow at first and was hard to pick up. I am glad I stuck with it because the story was interesting. I would recommend borrowing from a friend rather than purchasing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A read disappointment","review":"We all know the premise of this novel, and there is no need to repeat it here. But since I don't want to be a spoiler for anyone who has not read the book, I will summarize by opinion of this novel by simply saying that there are too many factual flaws - child is suppose to have died but there is no death certificate, no undertaker, not body???? Woman takes child and raises it and has no birth certificate????Characters always manage to have something fortuitous happens - perfect man comes into a character's life, perfect opportunity, perfect job, etc.A character obviously has a serious drinking problem but apparently it goes away and she lives happily every after. In many situations I kept waiting for something bad to happen, but good fortune comes along and saves the character.For those who liked the novel, dream on. But in my opinion it bordered on being a fairy tale.The author also could have cut at least 50 pages and there would have been nothing lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERRATED.","review":"Although this book is well written, I found it incredibly difficult to get into, which was my initial instinct after reading the inside flap. After several people recommended it, I gave it another try, but found myself skipping paragraphs because they were so dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of Ridiculous Drama!!!!!","review":"This book sounded interesting enough and it was...at the beginning. We read it for our book club so was eager to jump on in. It wasn't one of my least favorites but you keep waiting and waiting for something to happen. Nothing does.

The characters and plot were not as full developed as could be. It had a good premise but I would have preferred a greater climax. David and Norah's family was a depressing situation. How sad that they deteriorated over a lie. Caroline, on the other hand, blossomed, found love and found a greater purpose. Since it read like a typical dysfunctional family situation, it was not as fictionally over the top as I had hoped. Nonetheless, I did enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic attempt","review":"I don't know why this woman is on the best sellers list, or has any popularity at all. She wrote that mermaid chair book, which was terrible, and now I went to read this book, becaue it was a interesting story line, and I have to say that it did have good reviews, so I gave it the benefit of the doubt. I shouldn't have. It sucked.First of all, the book had all the all the makings to be fabulous. But it just fell sooo very short. I swear, I never want to see the word deft again. I don't know how many times I read it, but she needs some new adjectives. It was so flowery and over described. She tried to capture these moments in time, and she just didn't get there. The characters never really connects to the readers, and when the book ends, your more happy that you don't have to read her writing any more, then the characters become content. It was an over done, over written, bad book, that pissed me off, because the idea had the potential to be great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book and it kept my interest, (sort of, it got a little slow towards the end,) but the main characters were not very well developed. I found it difficult to feel much of anything for them (or even like them,) and kept thinking that I would have, given the subject matter, if they had been better written. I also found it very hard to: (1) believe that any real people would act and react in the ways of the characters in this book, and (2) appreciate how the marriage between Norah and Henry \\"deteriorated\\" (or at least I think so, since it's not entirely clear whether it was partly because they just did not know each other well when they got married,) since there was not much of how it was between them before the birth in the story. Overall a decent read, but not deserving of the praise it has received."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to the hype","review":"I had heard from a few people that this book was GREAT and that it touched them emotionally; so I was anxious to read it with my fellow bookclub members. Unfortunately, I thought the book was just so-so. I didn't like any of the characters and had a hard time empathizing with them. The author used a lot of imagery in her writing, but it got old fast and the book seemed to drag. The entire story line made the book basically a real down-er. Plus the ending was somewhat abrupt, and not real believable. I was not alone in my opinion of the book; my bookclub friends didn't care for it much either."},{"rating":"2","title":"It definitely makes you think about split decisions","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. I was looking for something that was just an escape from reality, but not some romance novel or murder mystery. This book seemed to do just fine. It kept me interested, yet wanting me to flip to the end to see exactly how it turns out. There were parts where I felt like maybe it should just take a different direction, but nevertheless I was compelled to get to the end. I enjoyed reading how the main characters were tormented and forced to live with the split-second decision and following the mystery of how it all turned out to the end.

It is a simple story of mistakes and cover-ups that haunt a family for a lifetime. The quality of writing is stellar. The scenes and emotions are so vivid that I felt that I was almost there as this family's story unfolded. I felt like I was made to see the story of this family's pain through many different prisms and lenses (just like in real families) and each one of those views left an imprint inside me and moved me. It is a truly remarkable book, and I will remember it for a long time to come. I read the book over a brutal 40 hour journey (many delays and flight cancellations) but I remained largely oblivious to it all. The book had transported me to another world....

Anyway, most of the songs on this album is rather average or mediocre but that doesn't mean they're worthless - they're just not outstanding.

It might not be the absolute best there. It is passive, so you'll still get a pop when switching amps, though it isn't very bad. There are no lights, which since I've been using it for about 4 months now I don't really miss. What makes this thing great is, no matter what situation you are in, you can make it work with your amps quietly and without power. The combination of a ground lift and a ISO transformer makes this possible. This makes it very handy to have around the studio or at a gig, maybe as a backup. When you are fortunate to not need the ground lift of ISO, it is very transparent. If your situation demands that you need to engage some features, it is going to alter your sound slightly, but in a way that is still better than if you didn't have that option. Finally, the pedal appears indestructible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't hold a tune. Don't buy it.","review":"Bought this for my 8 year old daughter to take lessons with.

I do have some hesitation in recommending it wholeheartedly, however, to anyone not a Kuralt or Montana fan. Some of the details are rather sketchy, especially where the late 80s and early 90s are concerned.

It is also not easily adjustable. I ended up having to modify the pipes to make them shorter, which made the hoop much less stable. I had to use electrical tape, and rig up an extra hook to make it stable. Not to mention, you are required to modify the pipes using a hack saw. If you do not own a hack saw...This product is also only intended for showers with an existing virticle shower head pipe, which the hoop attaches to. If you do not have one, this is not the product for you.And finally... it's TINY. There is no room inside fo the shower curtains to actually SHOWER.

But Bush won the electoral college vote and won over 32 states to Gore. Al Gore couldn't even carry his own state.In 2004, Gore couldn't even win a place on the democrat ticket, turned his back on his friend Joe Lieberman and endorsed that nutcase Howard Dean only because Dean was at that time the front runner and Gore no doubt expected Dean to reciprocate by asking him to be his running mate.As I see it, in every event, Gore is a loser. In fact I even dedicated a song on my local radio station to Gore in 2000 and did the same for Kerry in 2004.

Every American familiar with the Florida debacle knows the key players were Jeb Bush and Katherine Harris and the U.S. Supreme Court. History will not be kind to these individuals but for some reason Sammon is. If you are into hate, blind loyalty, big Bush family fan, and mean spiritedattacks, then this is your book. If you are for unbias reporting and opinions and you purchased this book, then you wasted your hard earned money unless you want a laugh or a conversation piece.

Tapper's book already reported that. That Gore was craftily micromanaging the recount effort with an eye toward just recounting counties that were pro-Democrat--Tapper already got all that. And on and on. Sammon makes a big deal about the fact that Gore staffers were happy when they got 1,000 overseas ballots tossed out. But is it news--or surprising--that they were happy? I'm sure Jim Baker and his guys were happy when the US Supreme Court voted the way it did, but I don't need a reporter to tell me that fact as if it were a big, important, revealing secret.If you want the full story, this is not the book.

But the fuss about pregnant chads pales when compared with roadblocks stopping people getting to polling stations and whole boxes of voting forms going missing. Don't mock Gore for little things when Bush was just as bad (and more dim along with it). Also, who decided that a mechanical stamping machine was more efficient than paper and pencil?

His contention that there was a concerted effort by the media to assure a Gore victory was evidenced by the incredible and unprofessional faux pas by Tom Brokaw \\"but the critical states we still need to win\\" was a welcome addition to this book as the comment was universally ignored.

Perhaps the best chapter in the book is the one that most people of the left have the hardest time defending; that is the US Supreme Court decisions that the media has labeled 5-4. The author, rightly (no pun intended) shows that the decision was in reality 7-2 and very unbiased. This is probably the most important point in the book and seems to be overlooked by many reviewers.As far as the legal shenanigans that went on, either side, right or left, would have done those.

He also chronicles the farce of hand recounts in selected Florida counties including Palm Beach who changed their standard so many times that even they didn't know what it was when they were asked.

I wholeheartedly recommend this book; you will not be able to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Win at any cost?","review":"Interesting how Gore says that every vote must count, but cheers when military votes were thrown out?Win at any cost---but it failed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent analysis, short on inside information","review":"This book was an excellent chronicle of the events in Florida following the 2000 Presidential Election. I was, however, a bit dissappointed that the author failed to get in depth inside information from all sides vis-a-vis Peter Baker's book \\"The Breach: Inside The Impeachment and Trial of William Jefferson Clinton\\".Unfortunately, what in depth information did exist in this book seemed to come from only one side causing the book to lose its non-partisan appearance.One of the most insightful and telling accounts in the book coming from the \\"other side\\" (Team Gore) was the account of Al Gore's four concentric rings.I, however, would reccomend this book for no other reason then the book does give an accurate picture of a lot of the events in Florida as well as some revealing inside information. The book should stand as the first and (as far as I can tell) only book on the historical election for President of the United States in the year 2000."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rehash of the Nov-Dec 2001 News","review":"I bought this book hoping to gain some additional information about what happened during the prolonged dispute over the election. Other than a couple of interesting anecdotes from two people who believe their votes were stolen by the early announcement for Gore, and Gore's pursuit of throwing out military ballots, there is nothing new here. If you paid attention to the news during the entire sorry episode, you pretty much know what's inside Sammon's book--and more. That was disappointing to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced At Any Cost","review":"What this volume adds to the great debate of our time are a few dry ounces of pulp. In all other respects, I found it to be fair, balanced and unafraid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Republican lies, anyone suprised?","review":"The greatest lie ever propagated by the right wing is that the media is liberal. Why didn't Sammon question the fact that Bush's own brother was in control of, and therefore responsible for, and election so sketchy even the Cubans mocked us?Being from the Florida Panhandle, I actually know most folks to be liberal in Tallahassee, for the simple reason that they are educated. Leon County was also the only precinct that did *not* report a change in numbers after investigation, and Gore held the 60% margin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Jigger","review":"Most jiggers are of poor quality....not this one. Predictable German quality.Beautiful design and quite heavy.Measures 20ml( 3/4 ounce )up to the flair, 40ml( 1.5 ounces ) up to the top.It is NOT an American jigger so the measurements are European so keep that in mind. In Europe the standard measurement is 20 ml ( 3/4 Ounce ), not 30 ml which would be our U.S.Ounce.I use the jigger as a 1.5 ounce measurer...fill up to the top!One small complaint: I wish the inside of the flair wasn't smooth/polished. It would drain better if it had a brushed surface the same as the rest of the jigger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Toaster","review":"We received this toaster as a gift this Christmas and it might be one of the worst toasters ever. None of the slots toast evenly and even though the slots are plenty wide, they aren't very deep so some bigger bagels and slices of bread go untoasted at the top. The controls are limited and any setting higher then halfway is pretty much just a different degree of burn. As it claims, it's good for doing different items at one time and the extra wide slots are good but that's about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A personal financial guide that's like talking to friend","review":"I happen to be a Certified Financial Planner licensee, and one component of my business is educating employees of corporations across the country on a variety of personal finance subjects. During, or at the conclusion of workshops, I am often asked by employees to recommend a good book that will assist them with taking control, or learning more about personal finance. Until now I never felt there was one particular book that actually approached and explained the subjects in a way most people can relate and would motivate them to learn more. Most other personal finance books, though they may be comprehensive, are dry and aren't written in a style people who are not in the profession can relate to. This is not the case with Let's Talk Money! Its nice to have a book that I can strongly recommend. Kudos to the authors!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Valuable tool for employees","review":"As a human resources director, I am constantly searching for inventive ways to add value to the relationships I maintain with personnel.

I am an inexperienced owner-builder and after reading this book I feel that each step of the process was described so clearly that I can use it as a guide for building my own house. None of the other books I've read on the subject have provided this level of clarity or detail - all in an upbeat, easy to read and sometimes humourous style.The first part of the book does a good survey of the differnet types of materials used in green building and the considerations of siting and design as well. The second part covers actually building the house and what to do or to avoid in the process."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical and insightful","review":"If you are a builder or \\"newbee\\" to building and considering a book that shares good to great \\"how-to\\" perspectives on green technology, this is for you.

However, I do not recommend it be used as textbook in a course. Solutions are in the back on the text. I really love this book though."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolutely useless","review":"It starts out okay, good overview of measurable sets and the like. However, it does not even have the essential core theorem to the discipline stating when it is possible to integrate a function! one of the great thing about Lebesgue integration is that a function is integrebale in this sense IF AND ONLY IF the function is measurable. thats the whole point of having measurable functions. there is no if and only if theorem for RS integration. Plus other things, like it talks vaguely about 'randomly choosing a point' but with no precise definition. Things like that.You are better off buying a classic by Halsey Royden or Walter Rudin, or something like that. This book is useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"An incredible story that will put you to sleep.","review":"I know a little about Hugh Glass. He was an American mountain man of they early 1800s with an incredible life story that took him from pirating in New Orleans to battling grizzly bears in the wild west and everything in between. So why did this short little 230 page book take me 2 months to read? The way it is written, of course. It is an extremely tedious read. The author can turn a clever phrase but he overdoes it so much that you end up having to decipher every sentence to get through it. Reading this book is like watching the remake of True Grit. Yeah it's English but you have to pay attention to every word to understand what the heck they are saying. It's not the light quick read I expected. A great story but this is not the best place to hear it."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your $$ and time","review":"This author belongs in the obits in your local news paper, pe-u. This book about Hugh Glass starts with a 40 page \\"saga\\" of pirate Lafitte (who cares).The book reads like a couple of women gossiping over the back fence, a-lot of fluff to cover-up a lack of real history.Are you looking for some meaty reading? Try \\"liver eater Johnston\\" or \\"Give your heart to the hawks\\" and find out the real Saga of the mountain men."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a novel","review":"When I bought this book, for some reason I thought it was a novel about Hugh Glass. Instead it is a history book. Dull and boring as far as I was concerned. I did not finish reading it. Gave it away.To me it was a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry Reading At Best!","review":"Some books grab you on the first page and just won't let go. Others take time to warm up, but then really go for broke.This book does neither.Although the author did his research, and can back up every fact presented in the book, it is written in a style that makes for ponderously dry reading - at best!If you are doing research, then buy this book.If you are looking for a thrilling story full of old-west charm and wilderness adventure, the look elsewhere - this ain't it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hidden Hope","review":"Matters & Dunaway are making music that soothes and envigorates simultaneously. Midtech is easily one of the best IDM/postrock albums I've ever heard. The opener \\"Movement\\" is danceable with a rythm like jets weaving through the sky. \\"Spidercheck\\" follows with a deep bass line and ferocious odd time live drumming. \\"Orange Code\\" pulls the carpet out from underneath you and suddenly you're floating mate! Soft ambient guitar embellishments provide beautiful melodic lines. \\"Stars in the Lake\\" displays the duo's exceptional drum programming and fluid synthesizer layering. You begin to wonder if you are on some tropical island enjoying a warm breeze with a martini. The album closer \\"Honduras\\" brings out intense emotions with its crashing metallic beat and gut wrenching melody played through MIDI warm pad with a slow release rate. Sublime!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Version 3 is Crap","review":"Simply a waste of money. It uses Codec iv50 video driver which is not installed in MS XP after Service pack 2, vista or W7. You can get it to run with a lot of messing around but you will still be disappointed. The computer players can Trade and Build houses out of turn which is just irritating and makes to play slow. Poor graphics, it is hard to tell where your token is on the board. It has some animation and voices assigned to the tokens; I played it on mute because it was so annoying. While Version2 has the same codec issue, it plays much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Remake of the Original","review":"This game does not even attempt to bring back the atmosphere of the original Monopoly game. It has several design flaws; the computer plays out of turn, the animations are not synchronized, and, worst of all, the \\"voices\\" in the game quickly become annoying.Another quirk is that the game fails to offer any method of changing the level of difficulty (e.g., there is no difference in \\"easy\\" or \\"hard\\").Also, please note that this game was not written by the true Atari company; instead, Infogrames have changed their name in order to establish a different reputation... I think, however, that they are ruining Atari's reputation!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Remake of The Original Monopoly","review":"This game has several design flaws. For one, the computer constantly plays out of turn. This can be annoying when trying to make buying decisions. Secondly, the \\"voices\\" in the game quickly become old. You have the option of turning both this and the music off, which you may as well do, because both are of low quality. The music is that of redundant piano music; in other words, annoying. Additionally, the difficulty options that allow for easy to hard playing do not differ; I found no difference in difficulty when I chose easy or hard.Also, please be aware that this game was not written by the true \\"Atari\\". Infogrames have changed their name to Atari to sound better, but it is still the same old French company that make bad games like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheating Ruins the Game","review":"All in all, there is actually very little to praise in Monopoly 3. The music is dull and after a few minutes begins to grate. The voices are annoying from the very start. The game, as noted in other reviews, cheats incessantly; making it a game not worth having.The only reason to actually own this game is to play online with others. If you won't be doing that, and will only be playing against the computer, don't bother. The game cheats to the point of absolute frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"you get what you pay for","review":"The 3-D effects and music quickly become annoying. The overall layout doesn't work very well either. With the older version from Westwood, all the players and their property titles are easy to see and assess, and any trades allow you plenty of time to decide on whether you want to approve it or counter offer. When a trade is proposed by a computer player, there's barely enough time to gauge what's going on before the program moves on.If you enjoy Monopoly for the strategic aspects and don't need all the special effects, get one of the older versions. Even the AI players aren't much different in the way they play, and if you're not going online to play, you need AI players that are less predictable and more creative."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BUY THE VOLUMES WHERE THEY DUEL!","review":"This is a ripoff, you should buy Shonen Jump!

From what the manufacturer says, this fan would provide a nearly unprecedented noise to airflow in this price range. Well, unfortunately, the ratings are quite misleading. The 21 db this fan is rated at aren't in the standard \\"x db/meter\\" form, so they probably measured 21db from like 2 or 3 meters away. This fan is easily twice as loud as its rating would lead you to believe. I can't recommend this fan at all, and I will in fact say the following: shame on you, thermaltake, for misleading consumers for a penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fan","review":"Wow, sometimes you can break down the noise levels of a fan a tad too much. The fan is fine. Pushes tons of air through, just as the first priority should be with a fan. The noise isn't as bad as some may lead you to believe, especially if your system is set up correctly. Anyway, most of the time I am playing a game or listening to music while working, so a fan would have to be awfully loud to be annoying in those situations."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cover says it all.","review":"For one thing the book makes women or young women out to benothing more than something which is looked at.What about young men facing a sense of vunerability?Nope,not here.As I said the cover says it all.I have read the whole seriesof books and find the same message 'women are objects' men areobjectifiers'so how can it help teens with real life issues?I think not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect holiday present for others and yourself!","review":"Teddy Irwin's guitar work is superb and the music choices ideal.

She also shares her personal insights and opinions on the youth and political issues of that time. Some may argue that she only wrote about nature so much for profit, but, if read, this book puts a stop to that argument.

Not enough film comes with the camera (only 6 photos). Because of initial set-up problems, we only were able to get 5 to develop.2. The film is small, expensive, and difficult to find. The developed photos measure just less than 1 inch high by 1 inches wide. If more than one person is in the photo, you need a magnifying glass to appreciate the images.3. The images are very poor. Most images are streaked and unnaturally colored with an orange tint.4.

Actually, there were a lot of movies that were wonderful that were not even included in this list."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really did not like this book","review":"With so many true scholars on film out there, or at least people who really know cinema, and can discuss it in a way that is insightful and intriguing, this book felt like a high school effort.

The author is trying for science fiction instead of just action but ends up with a horrible mess. The total insanity includes1. A giant mutant mountain lion who can communicate telopathicely with a member of the party, tortures his victims so that he can prove he is alive, and has either lived through everthing that is happening or a precog.2. A prenuclear war experiment that involves hallucinagenic snow, mind controlling fish(or a lake it is never really explained) and a symbiotic fungi.3.

Just a little slower going then most others."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's OK to skip this one....","review":"This book can be documented as a lazy effort. True Deathlands content, connective flow was replaced by the use (or mention) of past characters. Trader? Come on. WHen /if he is brought back, do it in style, the real JA style. The Carny theme was OK but end it there. Why start a completely whole new and possibly exciting encounter like the fungus, just to have one member of the team turn a valve and save everyone. Had I not finished the book it would have been better. Time is limited at my household so I try to choose wisely what I read. This time I choose poorly. Will I read the next one? Of course, doubt it can get any worse.But this one deserves a 1.0.

Foreplay is a really big part in everybodys lovemaking sessions and this book does everything right to teach you new, fun and exciting ways to have foreplay. This book helps couples explore each others bodies with hands, mouth, touch and smell. It shows couples how to add pleasure, intimacy, excitement and fun into your lovemaking routine. The dancing tips are very erotic and adding mouthwatering fruits, whipcreams and other delicious sweet treats to your foreplay session adds spice, makes it fun and arouses couples beyond belief. The book has many explicit pictures that are fun to look at.

Instead of building suspense, delving into the characters' psyches and telling this riveting story, he merely wrote a few set-up chapters and then gave a blow-by-blow account of Capano's 13-week trial. Pathetic. Seemed like he took the newspaper accounts of the case and rewrote them, albeit poorly. If you want to read a compelling accont of this sick tragedy, try either Fatal Embrace or Summer Wind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally got to read it. And it's an excellent book!","review":"I must've read a different book than the previous reviewer. I really found it fascinating. It built well, developed the characters and truely surprised me with its ending -- even though I knew the story. I never heard of one of the books that the previous reviewer talked about...\\"A Bad Embrace,\\" but it sounds like a bad title. I really think \\"Above the Law\\" is a really good book. I read about it on the NY Times list and was very impressed with the depth of the reporting. I did read Ann Rule's book, and boy was that bad. But this one wasn't. It's a quick reading book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trying to make sense of these reviews is difficult","review":"I guess in reading this book, at least according to the reviews posted here, you either loved it or didn't. I Loved it. I LOVED IT. I read through the other two books on the crime and while hardbacks, they didn't bring the immediacy to this case that I remembered in following from afar. This book was entertaining, enlightening and at the same time didn't beat me over the head with insignificant and arcane facts. It was a great weekend read and I found it to be much more bright than other true-crime books which are so depressing. It was a horrible crime, make no mistake, but the writing at least made the crime readable."},{"rating":"1","title":"uneven and choppy","review":"As a fan of true crime books, I was very disappointed in this one. It bounced from one time period to another, rarely providing indepth coverage of any event or person. There were several typos, and the whole thing felt as if it were thrown together quickly. Save your money and buy the more popular books by Ann Rule and G. Anastasia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cutesie and true crime don't mix!","review":"This book was like reading a long newspaper article on the murder. The facts are given, and given in the correct chronological order. There are numerous typos, but I suppose this is to be expected with a quickie book. I didn't appreciate the cutesie chapter titles. They aren't appropriate for this sad story. I can't believe that with all of the schmoozing I saw Karem doing with the Fahey family, as well as the Capano family at the court house, that by naming the chapters so, he could be so insensitive to the murder of the Fahey's sister and the pain the Capano girls must be feeling about their father's actions. Easy reading, no thinking involved. For some, that's enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jumbled, badly written. How can it be so highly rated?","review":"All I can figure is that the readers who've praised this book did not read the other two available accounts, by Ann Rule and George Anastasia.\\"Above the Law\\" is poorly organized. The writing is mediocre at best and atrocious in parts. Karem badly needs an editor!If you'll read only one book about this sensational case, by all means choose either Rule's or Anastasia's book. They're well worth the higher price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left me Breathless! Exciting Book!","review":"This book really was like a thrill ride and I enjoyed every moment of it.My favorite part was reading how Tom Capano self-destructed on the witness stand. Such a smug man brought himself down. There's a moral there, but Tom Capano won't ever get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's get organized, Brian!","review":"I made the gross error of reading an Anne Rule book just prior to this one. I only served to point out what a disorganized writer Brian Karem is. He could also use some pointers in grammar, as well. The book jumps all around in time, rather than focusing on a \\"start to finish\\" approach in recounting the crime. It was the most irritating read I've had in quite some time. You want great true crime? Anne Rules!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Insight","review":"Although \\"Above The Law\\" is a cut above the average rushed to press account of a notorious murder and trial, it really wasn't much more than an organized summary of press accounts. Now these do have their place, but for background, insight, depth of character, and a wider perspective, I look forward to the other books coming out on this subject, especially Ann Rule's. I hope I'm not disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Above the Law\\" Below Par","review":"While Brian J. Karem's account of the Anne Marie Fahey disappearance serves as a good introduction to the case that shook tiny Delaware, his writing lacks flair and imagination.For instance, the reader will have to wade through such unoriginal passages as, \\"After Annie disappeared, Kevin Freel, brother to Ed and Bud, held a vigil at his pub. He had signs made up and posted them on the fence outside his pub. They said 'Friends of Anne Marie.' They hang outside his pub to this day.\\"Also, in referring to a detective's work, Karem writes, \\"He said it didn't take him long to figure out that when Annie showed up missing, Tom Capano had something to do with it.\\"Either Karem was in a hurry to get this book out or his editor needs a refresher course.Although Karem is the first of four authors to get to print with a Fahey/Capano book, and he does score a few points by way of interviews with Capano's ex-wife and daughters, don't let his account spoil your interest in the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I agree with the reader from New Jersey \\"No Insight.\\" I also can't wait for Ann Rule's book on the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"give me my pillow","review":"this book is a sleeper! i pushed myself to read til the 12th chapter and then i pulled my bookmark out-i couldn't even finish iti'll look for ann rules!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets kinda old.","review":"The problem with Rod Laver is that they get really old really fast. I think the main problem is that the singer TRIES to be a rapper, and it seems as if he is competing against the hardcore music that is playing.Instead of trying to sing hip-hop along with the hard core. Another low point is that there are like 6 songs on here that are just pure rap....and those are horrible. The only reason why I gave it 2 stars is because there are some songs that are pretty hard core. However as I said....the singer kinda messes it up.

The music contained within this disc is moody and cinematic, but its also fractured. With most the tracks less than two minutes long, ideas often do not get the chance to develop to their fullness (\\"Aragon\\", \\"Alternative 3\\").Having stated that, there is some fanastic material on here (\\"From the Same Hill\\" with some great guitar/synth interplay, the Frippertronics piece \\"Slow Water\\", edgy and bizarre \\"Quartz\\") that makes it worth seeking out for fans of Eno. For the more curious, try \\"Discreet Music\\", \\"Music for Airports\\", or \\"No Pussyfooting\\" (Fripp & Eno) for a better introduction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy This Book and read it to Your RV!","review":"At last, practical advice for both before and after you have bought that dream RV.

Peggi delivers an organized and extremely helpful book divided into logical sections so you can read the whole thing ( I recommend this approach so you don't miss anything) or just what you need to know when you need it. I have owned an RV for 6 years and I wish I'd had this book when I bought my first one. This is the best book I have seen for novices - strong on how to and practical tips culled from years of experience and chats with RVers all over.

Where is that evidence? Did the Big Guy sign their behinds? My point is that he tries to prove it was God becuase it was not evolution. He seems to assume those are the only possibilities; if it wasn't evolution, it must have been God. He doesn't actually provide evidence that God did it, he just tries to show that some animals could not have evolved. He doesn't actually do a good job of shooting down evolution, but the premise that \\"God did it\\" is not supported at all. BTW, this guy is a DENTIST, not a reputable scientist.

There isn't 1 feature on the DVD that is worth a cuss. The main feature is a nauseatingly boring history of cannabis' use across the planet. It looks like it was made with the hope of getting it on PBS but the poor quality and the boredom factor likely kept it from ever seeing a second of air. The worst and most insulting inclusion by far is what is supposed to be an up-close look at the annual Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam. It's a guy ambling around with his camcorder on- utterly insulting to ask a consumer to shell out any money for this half-baked schlock. The most intriguing thing about this DVD is the title.

So far, I am pleased. Very comfortable. Seems reasonably well made, though is NOT made of stainless steel, as one reviewer indicated.Three reasons I rated only 4 stars. First, The unit does not open or close easily. It sometimes requires 3 hands. Second, moving the chair did not seem to have been considered. Is awkward, even with two hands.

In fairness, the reviewer is far more familiar with the Marine's program, but this overall story simply did not seem to ring true to a real sniper's techniques and mental processes from that long-ago time.Possibly as much as a third of the book deals with Mitchell's domestic problems with his wives and for filler, outlined a primer on PTSD. All this was \\"part of his journey\\" I suppose, but of marginal interest to outsiders.We should thank Mr. Mitchell for his 24-year service to our country, but in respect for the fine Army snipers, the great Carlos Hathcock and other 'Corps \\"One Shot-One Kill\\" shooters from the past, I cannot recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, Just Terrible...","review":"This has got to be the worst excuse for a \\"war story\\" that I have ever read.

Never being told you're actually in sniper school? Getting orders to take out two people with similar identifying facial scars? Conveniently having absolutely no records to support your story? Being sent to execute Buddhist monks by . . . a Buddhist monk? Come on.Even when viewed as a work of fiction, the writing comes off as cliched and repetitive.

The clock ticking throughout examples, cheezy music, use of various voice-overs split through left right and channels, and other unneccessary audio gimics are really distracting, and actually make it more difficult to follow the dialog. While this type of format has long been the norm in business and non fiction audio productions in the 70's and 80's, I would expect a less annoying and updated format for an item produced in 1999.

However, since a product's organic status is generally a selling point that is highly advertised on its packaging, I did feel the need to do some independent research to confirm that these are organic.

The writing was above average. Got a little 'draggy' at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent series debut...I immediately bought the others.","review":"Mr. Ford has a gift for creating colorful, wry, and therefore very funny dialog. He does this without straining credulity and without turning his protagonist, Leo Waterman, into a smartass, which is no mean feat. Leo is a private investigator who has enough flaws to make him believable and so very likeable, and I'm looking forward to getting to know him better. In addition to the (many) colorful characters in this book, the plot was unique and engaging, with enough twists to keep me surprised to the very last page. This is definitely a gem, one of the best reads I've had in months."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"GM Ford is right up there with Parker. When I ran out of Parker books I picked up Ford and was not disappointed. I have read all his Leo Waterman mysteries. His hero is NO Spencer but he is a different type character.

What I enjoyed mostly was Ford's verbiage.Leo's relationship with the boys was lighthearted and amusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"decent book, decently well written","review":"If you like this character set, then the book will work fine for you. It is well paced and somewhat humorous in points, believable to a point and absurd in its basic premise that the detective uses street people and drunks as his operatives. The politics are tricky with any book dealing with ecology and the author's navigation did not upset me like some other authors have- he keeps his political point of view fairly neutral- which for me was a relief."},{"rating":"2","title":"I need more Leo books....","review":"Got this as a kindle-type, and it is entertaining.

Anyone from the Seattle area will love this series since he mentions many local establishments and landmarks. I appreciate this since many authors totally fabricate the places in their books. I loved the street crew and Leo's attitude of living life to the fullest while waiting for his inheritance to kick in. Leo is loyal to his people and the books have great plots. So he sort of plays at being a private detective but at the same time is a really great one. He lives under his late father's shadow but is definitely his own man. This whole series by Ford is fantastic and I am glad to see this first one available since it is out of print and hard to find otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Colorful Characters, Variation On Typical Mystery Themes","review":"Leo Waterman is a middle aged detective whose support team is a group of winos a derelicts teetering on the edge of dementia.

It starts out recounting the dismal chances any screenwriter has of ever selling a script and then goes downhill from there. The doc follows three aspiring screenwriters on their quest to sell their scripts. Interspersed are \\"interviews\\" with professional screenwriters where they mostly whine about how terrible the job is. The video and sound quality are also pretty bad. This movie is a complete downer. Unless you want to quit writing screenplays, do not watch this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Reflection on Writing","review":"Dreams on Spec shows the many contradictory aspects of the writing life; discouragement vs. determination, art vs. business, ambition vs. obsession.Although the focus of the documentary is on screenwriting, it poses the same questions that writers face everyday: How far are you willing to go to try and make your dream come true? Are you prepared to spend the next five months or five years working on a project, knowing there is no guarantee of success? Dreams on Spec is a sobering look at the price screenwriters are willing to pay in pursuit of a career writing for Hollywood, and it's a potent reminder of the work that goes into every successful movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Inspiring","review":"Dreams on Spec is an uplifting and entertaining documentary! It is full of encouragement for all writers wherever they are on their writing journey. At times the writing path can seem like a long arduous hike towards your destination. We prepare for the journey by getting advice from those at the pinnacle of their careers such as the writers of Seabiscuit and Liar Liar as well as the prolific Nora Ephron and Carrie Fisher. They are like the beacons of light guiding you along the writing path. We also encounter three aspiring scriptwriters who have set out on the adventure of their lives.

I had a retired script analyst help me learn the basics of screenwriting and with my experience, I think the analysist in this movie is just milking the screenwriter for his money. Without actually reading their screenplays, these people seemed doomed to fail. Even though this is real and the people and events are real, I could easily imagine Christopher Guest and those people who made those movies like Waiting For Guffman, making this as a movie. Christopher Guest would be the guy who morgages his house to produce his screenplay into a movie. There was one scene where the one screenwriter was eating with his wife and daughter at a restaurant and all he could talk about was hold he was trying to get Teri Hatcher to read his script. The wife looked miserable. One guy in the film actually succeeds and gets his screenplay made into a movie called Behind The Mask but he pays a price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding?","review":"I bought this game for my geriatric patients with mild cognitive deficits, thinking it would be fairly user friendly (Jingo games are supposed to be for younger people) and was appalled as to how intricately specific it is.

Save your money unless your players are meterology majors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preferred something better","review":"Amazon claimed this would fit my Chevy S-10 pickup but it is too wide even after trimming the outside sections. Since one-piece mats are hard to find and I wanted to cover the center hump, I decided to modify this one. I had to cut it into 3 pieces and trim them down to fit. They fit OK but are now three pieces, not one. Also, when you open the box, the rubber smell will knock you over. After scrubbing these relentlessly, they still smell like rubber. I have had these in my car for about a month and if I leave my windows shut overnight, it wreaks of rubber smell. I would suggest looking elsewhere for a better solution."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good Introduction to Modern Power Electronics","review":"This book introduces the often esoteric subject of power electronic conversion via a sensible and simple generic switching converter and goes on to include a very comprehensive coverage of modern conversion circuit topologies and modern devices. This book does not 'tangent' off into extraneous detail which is the quagmire which bogs students down in this subject, but maintains a very equitable intellectual level throughout. Inclusion of numerous SPICE files of typical power conversion circuits is also particularly valuable. Most students nowadays accept SPICE for modelling low power electronic circuitry so why not power electronic circuitry also.This book will be valuable to all with an interest in power electronics but especially to undergraduates, as it is one of the least intimidating texts I have ever encountered in the interesting but 'oft' shied clear of' subject of power electronics."},{"rating":"2","title":"fresh experiment","review":"for lack of other (and probably better formulated) reviews re Mr. Steiner's latest piece let it be known that this album is a true delight even if limited to at least midly experienced ears. dynamic, light and breezy experiments with variety of sounds and instruments on top of a solid and smooth base of new jazz make for an interesting and joyous trip through a variety of music genres. requires some time to listen in but then there is nothing to hold you down; soar to the heights of your imagination, dream, dance, nod your head, grin, tap your feet, feel good. generally i like my jazzy-thingies rainy, nocturnal and moody. this upbeat title makes a welcome break"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and Informative.","review":"I bought this when my daughter got a job as a historical interpreter at Jamestown. It is a very well-done documentary of the construction and sailing of a replica of the \\"Godspeed\\", one of three British ships that brought the original settlers to Jamestown in 1607. All of the original sailing vessels have been reproduced using such original sources as are available and employing a mixture of old and new technology; the ships do have engines, though they are only utilized when necessary.The presentation is excellent, with plenty of both technical and historical background. It is not, and does not claim to be, a full history of Colonial America, or even of the Jamestown Settlement. If you're contemplating a trip to our Historic Triangle, this video might well enhance your understanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eno Fan on Thursday Afternoon","review":"I purchased this CD based upon the other Amazon reviews. I listen to Eno's ambient music often and I do not compare this CD to The Pearl or Neroli which both are excellent. Thursday Afternoon has a background tone that lasts throughout the CD. I find it very distracting and must be in a different room so I do not hear it. Really too bad because without the tone the CD would be great."},{"rating":"2","title":"As close to perfection as Eno comes","review":"If I had to choose only one piece of music to hear for the rest of my life, it would be this one. No matter how many times I listen to it, I can still appreciate its subtle mix of chords and textures, and I always regret that it is not even longer. Its simplicity and beauty are unmatched by any song I have ever heard before. Thursday Afternoon is sonic nirvana."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rare beauty","review":"It is hard to believe what an enormous effect could be achieveed with so little. This is minimal music. Like a Mondrian painting, like a buddhist temple, like Satie. Or maybe, like listening to the rain, watching the ocean or hearing your beloved one breathing lightly next to you. It is so simple one might be tempted to think \\"oh, i might do this too\\", but no you can't, not unless you're Brian Eno, a genius able to get as close to the truth as one can, able to move you as very few can, with one chord only. Open your heart and float in. You could listen to it with your focus on it or just have it at your side while you do the dishes, eat your weekend late breakfast or cuddle in bed and make love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet another \\"best ambient album I've ever heard\\" from Eno","review":"It's embarrassing. It seems like every time I get a Brian Eno ambient CD and listen to it for a while, I become absolutely convinced that it's the single best ambient album I've ever heard. This has happened four times so far: with Ambient 2, Ambient 4, Neroli and now Thursday Afternoon. But I have to say that now I really, _really_ believe that Thursday Afternoon is the best ambient album I've ever heard. It's so soft and ethereal it's like it isn't even there, and yet as it plays you find yourself unwinding and relaxing into a better state of consciousness. I don't know where Eno gets his ambient mojo, but it's powerful stuff. So again: this is definitely the _best_ ambient album I've ever heard... until the next Eno album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music for Synesthetes","review":"Along with \\"Ambient 4: On Land\\" and \\"The Pearl\\", this aural sculpture is the greatest expression of Eno's ambient ethic. There must be at least 20 separate looped tracks going on--but you wouldn't know it initially, so calm is the surface. Over 61 minutes, certain aspects of the \\"landscape\\" gradually get emphasized as others fade, only to return in altered form. The wide space allows you to \\"listen vertically,\\" as Eno says--listen to the timbre (harmonic profiles) of the sounds, their sequential progression not necessarily being the content of the piece. It's interesting how one has to revert to visual metaphors to attempt to describe this music--it truly warrants it. Speaking of that, the video version (which was the original format) is actually about a half-hour longer, and is an even more stripped-down re-mix; for instance, the shimmering C major chord heard throughout begins the video at a louder volume, alone for several minutes, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best ambient music release ever","review":"I have Ambient 1, 2, 3 & 4. Apollo, Discreet Music, No Pussyfooting, Bell Studies for the Clock of The Long Now, Small Craft on a Milk Sea, Panic of Looking, Lux, etc (I'm a big Eno fan). always go back to this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"For die hard fans only","review":"I read on Wikipedia that \\"Thursday Afternoon\\" was the soundtrack to a video production of the same title back in 1984. Haven't seen the video, maybe it was innovative, but the soundtrack by itself is, in my opinion, not very interesting: a single track consisting 60 minutes of more of the same. Musically, \\"Thursday Afternoon\\" brings nothing new in Eno's discography.I usually enjoy Eno's work, but this one was a big deception for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahead of its time","review":"I have always loved this album but this remaster from 2005 brings forth so many nuances that I didn't know existed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for quiet time","review":"I was looking for a music-only CD to play while learning to sit still for a half hour daily to reduce stress. I like this CD because it is not as light and fluffy as a lot of meditation-type music. It's interesting and thought-provoking. It seems serious yet hopeful, if that makes any sense at all. Leaves me with a good feeling."},{"rating":"2","title":"sublime masterpiece","review":"Arguably Eno's most perfectly realized piece of ambience (\\"Neroli\\" certainly can qualify, as well), \\"Thursday Afternoon\\" perfectly blends his piano riffs (very similar to what Robert Wyatt did on \\"1/1\\" on \\"Music for Airports\\") with just the right amount on synthesizer for texture and base to create a very surreal landscape.If played as Eno intended, the effect is ever greater, with wifts of it reaching your ears like a distant smell of fresh baking done next door and a breeze gently lofting some of it through the open window to your unsuspecting nose- you can subconsciously detect it, you know its there, but it doesn't permeate your senses fully. To play this cd any other way is fine, but alters the total effect too much for it to be fully realized or enjoyed.A gem on an lp, and among my favorite Eno cds."},{"rating":"2","title":"The last great and definitive Ambient album","review":"This album, a 61 minute piece of shifting piano and landscape sounds formed by multiple 'samples' looped at different durations, and later edited by Eno, serves quite possibly as the pinnacle of this great man's work. It is the closest I think he has come to creating a truely ambient piece, as he had himself defined it in the early 70's: music which...'should be as ignorable as it is interesting.' In this sense, the Thursday Afternoon 'rewards listener attention, but doesn't demand it.' You can either put it on as background to a conversation, or do as a friend of mine and have often done and put it on, sip cognac, and listen intently without speaking for the entire hour it plays, and then enjoy the silence for a time after it is done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Noteworthy Composition","review":"I believe this ranks as one of the greatest minimalist/ambient compositions yet penned by anyone. Have you ever had the experience of trying to focus on something considerably out of eyeshot and can only gain a general approximation of what it might be you are looking at, until you slowly move closer to it and gradually come to realize that there is a logical form and structure to the object that was previously fuzzy and indistinct--and eventually when it is right in front of you, you finally come to realize just what you have been looking at the entire time? This composition is like that. After an hour of listening you realize you have been in the presence of a superbly crafted and slowly evolving piece that makes as much sense as the most traditional 4-part harmony. I think Eno was onto something truly Great here. This, and \\"On Land\\" are pinnacles in his catalog of creative output."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eno's best","review":"When this CD came out twenty years ago it completely blew me away. It is one long minimal piece extending over the whole CD. Even if I was quite familiar with the rest of his work, this was actually what one would expect from an ambient music classic. To the difference of his other works this has not aged at all. Timeless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD","review":"This is a really good CD. I enjoyed listening to it in my car. That's unusual, because I don't do many choir CD's. You know I do the usual suspects, LFCC, Ricky Dillard and New G, etc. I usually don't do artists who are mostly or solely traditional, but I found this CD to be excellent quality. I wouldn't put it up there with New G, LFCC, or Tri-City as it relates to vocals, but the material is top notch. I bought this CD doubting whether I would like it or not, but I ended up enjoying it. Joe Pace does a marvelous job capturing some of the essence of Sunday morning service on CD. He gives us something for all parts of the Sunday morning experience. This was nicely done and is an excellent edition to my collection of music, which does not include much choir stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"WMF Profi Turner","review":"I searched high and low for a stainless steel turner that was flexible enough for eggs and pancakes and found what I was looking for in this WMF Profi Plus turner.

Lots of local town refeences throughout the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lost Porn of Suzanne Fields","review":"I've never seen any of Suzanne's other movies, so for all i know she was a porn star, or an actress who didn't mind doing a little extra performance.This collection comes with three movies and previews. One of the movies was pretty tame, and by tame I mean it might could be shown on Cinemax. The other two, Gunilla and the Kinky Casting Couch, were pretty hardcore. If you're shopping for porn and you don't mind 70's porn with the hairy bushes and what not then this one is good. Only problem is the other movies besides Gunilla haven't aged well. They were taken from film that has damaged over time. Still watchable, but not in flawless condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now That We've Found Them, Can We Make Them 'Lost' Again?","review":"I suppose if you're a fan , tho I don't know why you would be, these might be watchable. If you're not, they're stinkers of the highest order, and I don't mean 'fromage exquite' - this is your Daddy's porn, maybe your Granddad's porn, so no one under the age of 40 will find it remotely interesting. Age hasn't been kind to most of these flix, though there IS a bunch of 70's porn that still brings a fond tear to my jaded eyes, but these stinkers don't dwell in that catagory. The video transfers of the two films after 'Gunilla' are wretched to watch, and should've stayed 'lost'.

My eleven-year-old son and two-year-old neice enjoy it too.Hearing it in my car just 20 minutes a day really does help with remembering declensions.

Maybe \\"Teach Me Russian Three\\" could incorporate them?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected higher quality and more engaging conent","review":"I expected more out of the books and the CDs. The books are nice but short on content. The recordings are low quality. The children are not native speakers, they speak with accents and simply read the phrases in a monotone voice. The English singer is great, but the Russian singer is trying way too hard and it is impossible to make the words she is singing (which is the whole point of the CD). The idea behind the books and CDs is brilliant, translations of the songs are great, but the rest of the package needs more work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Documentary","review":"I feel that this documentary was informative.

It's also aimed at boat owners (primarily those coming from Great Britain)as opposed to vacation boat renters. The detail is more on the navigation end of things.

Year one, the charger worked great. I used it to charge both AGM and regular lead-acid (car-type) batteries that I use in boats and a tractor. Year two, the cooling fan began to make noise. Now, at the start of year three--the internal cooling fan has seized up and the unit shuts itself off before a charge can be delivered. After three phone calls--the first to Black & Decker, the second to Black & Decker automotive division, and the third to an entirely different company, Baccus Global--I learn that without the receipt of purchase that they can not help me in any way. I will go online and buy a replacement fan for under 5$ and repair it myself, but I would not recommend this unit as the company that manufactures it has been bought and sold three times in the past 7 years.

I know what a piano sounds like (I have a Steinway in my living room), and the harsh clickety sound of the instrument in these recordings is impossible to circumvent for more than brief periods of listening--I find a complete listening through the \\"Hammerklavier\\" unbearable for fear of the potential for long term damage to my ear drums.For those starting off with a cycle, I'd suggest the almost-complete Gilels set, filling in what gaps you can with Pollini and Richter (the latter even if it doesn't fill any gaps--his Appassionata is breathtaking).

Jam Session was not recorded live but was, supposedly, the Capitol Tower's first big band recording session in 1956.Jam Session is much more jazz orientated and features Ray Sims, Georgie Auld, Med Flory, and Anthony. The trumpet section is anchored by the great Conrad Gozzo. This one is powerful and there is a fine array of musicians who know what big band swing is all about.The rest of the CD comes from an album called Sound Spectacular which features a reed section and two brass sections trading back and forth. Again, Anthony gathered some great studio musicians for this album. These are basically new arrangments of old songs. Overall, it's good listening.

In Praise of Slow, however, doesn't live up to the hype.Honore tries to hype of a movement that really doesn't exist. He gives several examples of the \\"new movement\\" of Slow, but he gives many, many more of how the world is living too fast paced.The author borrows so much from the writing style of Naomi Klein that one begins to realise he has no original style of his own.Finally, and most importantly, I had hoped the book would talk about the emotional and spiritual effects of slowness. However, Honore flatly rejects \\"spiritualism\\" in the first chapter as touchy feely nonsense.

Carrie Smith and Don Blum add propulsive beats on bass and drums, respectively.

I'm running across a lot of other bands in this same vein, I guess, where their songs are cool, but stale. The Von Bondies are exciting. I know this is a really bad review, but it's a cool CD.Hey, and if you want to see them on DVD, get Later . . . Louder, it's a DVD compilatoin of musical guest who have appeared on Later with Jools Holland. It's got the VBs, the white stripes, QOTSA, Sonic Youth, PJ Harvey, Jesus and Mary chain, BRMC, cardigans, mercury rev, afgan whigs, vines, new order, soundtrack of our lives, black crowes, primal scream, others--it's pretty cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"they're no WHITE STRIPES!","review":"this band has received a lot of praise mostly on the strength of the fact that they have toured with the very-hyped White Stripes and one of the members of the band is the girlfriend of Jack White of White Stripes. I'll admit that these factors are exactly why I bought this album myself. unfortunately, this is very by-the-numbers garage/blues type stuff. It's not bad, but not great. It reminds me of the Chrome Cranks or the Gimmicks - two ther bands with good taste but were mediocre.buy records from the jon spencer blues explosion, cramps, gories or flat duo jets before turning your attention to this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cooking utensils","review":"We replaced 40-year old cooking utensils with the WMF Profi line - two nonstick spatulas, one stainless spatula, two stainless serving spoons, and a soup ladle. We have a small kitchen and found Caphalon and Oxo products too big and bulky. The WMF Profi products are small while still being substantial and well-made. We have been using them for about a month. They are balanced, easy to hold and work well. The nonstick slotted spatula is strong, yet still flexible. I was concerned about the relatively small size of the turner, but it has been fine for vegetables and burgers. We're impressed with this line and are likely to buy more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocked at the quality","review":"Beautifully made, almost scientific looking spatula.

Her back ups use the different equipment while they all do the same exercise. The workout is split into standing where it seems like you're doing cardio because of the fast pace, but Mindy stresses, \\"It's strength!\\" You'll do classic exercises with lots of options and modifications. Standing exercises include: lunges, military presses, push-ups, plies with paper plates! The floor exercises will work the chest, the legs, more push-ups!, sit-ups, tricep dips, and core work with paper plates.

I now have some very large piles of grindings that will make a great mulch...if I can efficiently get it schlepped to where it needs to go. This heavy-duty \\"Scoop Shovel\\" seems to be the easiest way to get the fluffy mulch loaded into a cart, then uniformly cast on the ground.

Using the much ignored Pyramid Texts found at the 5th Century pyramids of Unas, Bauval and Gilbert have used common sense and the Egyptian's religion to explain what in fact are the world's greatest religious monuments.

Check it out"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazingly boring","review":"Granted, the author got some interesting ideas. But why does he hide them for the most part of the book? About 80% of the book is a repetitive description of different facts, theories and opinions, with the author arguing about \\"what is not correct\\", and no clue at what is he getting at. Well, not fare, he gives some clues, but not more. Sometimes it looks like he's got carried away with a need to talk (or write) without any point to deliver.Again, that's not to say that he does not have any interesting things inside, he certainly has.

Robert Bauval introduces new revolutionary theories that the Egyptians were not a heliocentric (solar-based) culture but an astral (star-based) one. Also included in his book are interesting details of the Upuaut 2 robotic exploration of the shafts in the Great Pyramid of Khufu.

For those who support the underdogs, the story of the obstacles the author faced to bring us this alternative insight is also worth reading about. After first reading this book in 1994, my interest in the pyramids was rekindled and my suspicion of their purpose lifted slightly. My sixth sense have always told me that the pyramids are not just tombs, even for pharaohs. To view them as a stellar temples are more \\"acceptable conventionally\\". Are we a step closer to finding out the truth about the pyramids? I remember a time what someone suggest that the earth is round when the catholic church believe that it is flat.

Set aside the high volume of critisicm the archaelogists and scientists have thrown out and UP on the public about this topic. It is up to the voluntary and open minded individual to decide what they choose to feel is right. I loved this book, I dont have the necessary resources to analyze and investigate all that is spoken in this book yet.

This book would have been a good course book since it teaches and illustrates the basics and goes further into actionscripting. You end up with a very nice, professional looking opening page for a web site by doing the progressive exercise at the end of each chapter. It will also be a good reference book when I am done with it. I found this book easy to understand and follow along.

I was starting to think there weren't any good books on Flash until I found this one. I think the high ratings on all the other books I've found to be so awful must be written by the friends, cousins and grandmothers of the authors.

Having visited Amada Farr's excellent website, and having used the many tutorials there, I was expecting a blockbuster book. When it came I read it cover to cover. Wow, I was impressed. It sounded great. The explanations seemed really straightforward and surely gave me the feeling that this was the only Flash book I would need. The trouble started when I went back and tried to do the exercises, particularly the case study. I found whole sections missing an explanation. I read and reread sections to see if it was just me. I tried again, and still was not able to get the case study up and running as explained in the book. In desperation, I invited a friend, someone with no flash experience, over to try and see if he could succeed where I had failed. He did not. I am now looking for another Flash 5 book, one that has examples that work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very shallow introduction","review":"Actionscript may surprise many a programmers; it is not a shallow programming language and with foundations in ECMAScript and a deep arsenal of tools, it poses a very steep learning curve.

Hand holding is nice, but effectiveness is important too. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair","review":"There is no way this is the only Flash book you need -- it's more a good intro.

Metal of Night can easily be read as a stand-alone as there is very little overlap with the proceedings in the first book.Space battle? Check. Ground-based conflicts? Check. Political intrigue? Check. 'splosions? Check. Some gore? Check. Aliens? Double and triple-check. And yet, this story is not really about any of those things. They are just the back-drop.The writing style is sparse and rich at the same time. Almost every sentence in this tightly constructed novel serves to move the story forward. Tiedemann does a great job of shifting the viewpoint through the cast of characters leaving you the reader to figure out what is happening by listening to their dialogue and hearing about their memories and experiences.I give this a solid 4 stars as I look forward to the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing!","review":"The unusual approach to organizing is refreshing.

Also, the author's sense of humor shines through and makes what can be a rather dull subject more interesting. There were a couple of places where I disagreed with her, but that's to be expected with this subject because everyone is different.

The Mysteries are a pure guitar pop rockers unfortunately laboring in a era dominated by grunge, boy bands and shock rappers. Nevertheless, few artists are able to produce songwriting hooks so effectively.The albums high point is \\"Kiss Me Goodnight,\\" which is a dead ringer for The Vulgar Boatmen. Other standouts include \\"Let it Slip,\\" \\"Year Ago Today,\\" and \\"Tell Me.\\" Though there are not as many standouts as on the debut album, there are no outright clunkers either.Overall, a strong sophomore effert from an overlooked band that deserves a much wider audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why on Earth arn't they famous?","review":"Actually I know why.

Expecting something along the line of the Kline/Ronstadt/Smith/Rose/Routledge stage performance of Penzance, I found myself instead watching repetitious affectations (Pooh-Bah , Katisha and the Mikado were the worst for this) that gave the impression that what I was really watching was a Shogun parody with singing. Comedic, yes. Funny, yes. Energetic and acrobatic? Mostly the tumblers changing the sets around. The singing was \\"stage\\" good, though I found it difficult to listen to the voices of Nanki-Poo and Yum-Yum - very pretty but little depth.

Gilbert's great libretto and lyrics are all but lost in the auctioneer-style delivery of all but a few songs. The second main criticism is that every member of the cast is, well, unattractive and unpersonable, and in some cases a bit elderly. The pacing, direction and over-the-top characterizations are annoying to the point of ruining the material, for this viewer at any rate.The snippets of scenes in Mike Leigh's _Topsy Turvy_ are worlds above the level of this somewhat amateurish, slapstick, local dinner theatre quality version. If only he had produced a companion version of the entire operetta with the actors and sets he had at his disposal.I suggest this DVD would make an excellent skeet shooting target.

The works of these progressive men seem increasingly to be repeated in the same forms over and over again. The odd sets in this production enhance it somehow. The singing and acting are lively. The costumes are rather minimal (probably the worst flaw in the thing). The only downside is the ridiculous Poo-Bah (overdone) and Mikado (also overdone). Otherwise, everything is great: Yum-Yum is shy and beautiful, Ko-Ko is an interesting victim of fate, Nanki-Poo is a fine young hero, Katisha is U-G-L-Y.

The only major disappointment was Gidon Saks's Mikado (the character), who was played far too far over the top for my liking.Those familiar with the opera will notice a few updates/changes: \\"See how the fates...\\" is cut, and the Little List song is updated for a modern (Canadian) audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stratford Presents G&S Mikado:","review":"This DVD of Gilbert & Sullivan's operetta \\"The Mikado\\" was recorded in 1993 at a live performance at Canada's Stratford Festival.

The staging is imaginative.To this reviewer though, the spoofs of 20th-century Canadian officials, inserted into the dialog, seem as dated as those of their 19th century English counterparts that were in the G&S; original book.Audio quality is OK, but is not up to the best DVD standards.

As with other Profi Plus items, the handle is heavier than the \\"flipper\\" part, so that most of the time it will see-saw out of the pan & make a terrific mess.

Why would someone go out of their way to mark a thorough, factual review unhelpful? Hatas! (This applies to the 12% unhelpful votes I have achieved thus far in my Amazon reviewing career.

Unfortunately, and this is the case for many authors, extended series tend to diminish in quality with each new book. That has also been the case with the Cross books. But with Mary Mary, Patterson stepped it up a notch again. What made this book better? It wasn't so far over the top like many of the previous novels. No super serial killers here; just a decent story with enough plot twists. Nothing particularly great about this one, but again, just good old fun Cross action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clunky clunky","review":"This is my first Patterson novel, and can say it will be my last. Detective work is practically non-existent in this book, except for the last couple of chapters, wherein the reader is socked between the eyes with all the details of solving the crime. Even the patches of investigative work we see on Alex Cross' part are ridiculously unbelievable. I mean, here we have an FBI agent who resorts to newspaper clippings to figure out if the woman who has been arrested has committed another crime elsewhere in the country, only to figure out that she murdered her 3 children for which she was prosecuted and convicted in Vermont in 1983. I guess fingerprint files weren't on record waaaaay back in the 80's. How insulting Mr. Patterson is to his readers. And that is but example."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mary Mary","review":"Totally disappointing. From the beginning the novel read well, but like a Sherlock Holmes mystery at the end the person who committed the crimes came out of the blue . I, personally, do not like reading this type of mystery....I want clues. Alas, there were none. Also, the characters did not make sense.....most were too undeveloped.....Mr. Patterson needs to go back to the drawing board & try to forget the $$$ he is being paid up front by the publisher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Red Herrings and a unique storytelling environment","review":"It is not too often that you read a book with the suspense and misguided leads that James Patterson has incorporated in this book, along with a unique way of communications between the predator and the authorities.Although this is not what I consider James Patterson's best works, nor the top of the Alex Cross series, I found myself being pulled along by the plot, and surprised by several of the situations that popped-up along the journey to the conclusion. The ending though was almost predictable, so it was more anti-climatic then most of the series is.If you are a Patterson fan, as I am, you will not want to miss this book. It may be not his best works, but it is one that will be around to be read by more then one generation of fiction fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow Moving","review":"I thought it was slow getting into it..It was intriging but I think some of his other books are better....Definitely worth the read though......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where has James Patterson gone?","review":"I've loved James Patterson's books from the beginning, but I think he's spreading himself too thin and it clearly shows in this latest novel. It took me over a week to finish this book because it just didn't hold my attention. I usually can't put his books down and finish them in a day or two. It felt very rushed and without much thought. I hope his next book is better. Seems like he's writing for quantity, not quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary stuff!","review":"I found this to be a thoroughly enjoyable, quick read by a master writer. A serial killer is murdering and mutilating women in Hollywood, women who present as perfect wives and mothers and who seem to have it all. The clues point to a deranged woman who was previously incarcerated in a mental institution for the criminally insane after being found guilty of murdering her three children, but FBI Agent Alex Cross is not convinced of her guilt. Alex's former partner, John Sampson, makes a brief appearance in the course of the story and a few of Alex's romantic partners appear, only to fade out of the picture, permanently. The way that Mr.Patterson writes in short, staccato chapters, suits this crime story perfectly and makes for very easy reading. I'd recommend this book to any lover of murder mysteries, especially as he doesn't fall into the mistake of describing the murder and forensic scenes in too graphic detail...I'm literally sick of all that urky stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ENTERTAINING THILLER!","review":"Just when Alex Cross thought he could have a vacation with his family, he gets a call to work on a murder case. Cross studies e-mails sent by Mary Smith claiming to be the one responsible. The fast paced thrilling story captivates the reader with a very exciting climax. \\"Mary, Mary\\" is better than the \\"London Bridges\\" because it stays focused so fans of this author should be happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patterson does it again!","review":"Another great Alex Cross novel. Fans of Dr. Cross will enjoy his crime solving skills while getting more involved in his personal life."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star is Too Much","review":"This is drivel, plain and simple. While I long for the killer to kill Nana Mama and every other personal friend of Alex Cross I might be happier if the killer would just make me see that Patterson can no longer write a compelling novel. He used to be good but he simply sucks at this point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weaker and Weaker","review":"Maybe I am a little harsh as I may be a little tired of Patterson's books but I didnt think this one was very good. I am not seeing any good details of how the killer is caught nor is the killer very interesting. The letters written to the gossip columnist were't very intriguing and they gave me the sense Patterson was just \\"slapping\\" this book together. The purpose of the letters should have been something more intriguing or played a better part but they didn't. I also saw what I thought to be a large flaw with the crime detection. There's mention of the same, unique gun and crime done in NY much earlier but no cross check was ever done. It seemed to me that a good detective, would have checked out the rare gun, similar crimes on 2 coasts, cross referenced with times and plane tickets to narrow down suspects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"The only reason I finished reading this book was because I had paid for it with hard earned money. For me, way too little suspense and way too much Alex Cross personal problems. The plot seemed contrived and the murderer came out of left field, at least in my opinion. I'm getting tired of Alex Cross's whining about the future of his illegitimate son, little Alex. What did he expect when he got his ex-girlfriend pregnant? Should have known there would be problems in the future. I think I'm finished with Alex Cross. He's starting to annoy me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"What happened with this author! Plot lacked 'suspense' or depth. Motives of killer and alibi not very plausible and adequately explained. Entertaining but i expected more for $25 audio book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A decent mystery but unnecessarily gory","review":"The characters were fairly well defined but I didn't much care what happened to them. It seemed the author was constantly trying to shock with violence, blood, and gore but those descriptions didn't enhance or support the plot or the story. If you can overlook the ridiculous amount of painstakingly detailed carnage, I think you'll find it a decent read but I wouldn't pay full boat for it if I had it to do over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mary, Mary (Alex Cross)","review":"James Patterson is one of my favorite authors, and he has again produced a book that I couldn't put down. Action, suspense, wonderful characters that I have gotten to know over the years. Once you've read one of Mr. Patterson's books, you will be searching for more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting story, but very poorly written","review":"The story was intriguing enough that I finished the book in one day. However, the book was very poorly written. It reads like an 11th grade high school student wrote it for a creative writing assignment. This author had a great idea for a story, but executed it very poorly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Return of An Old Favorite","review":"Mary, Mary marks a much needed return for popular hero Alex Cross. While Patterson's name has popped up on other book, none in my opinion, match the page turning excellence he provides in the Alex Cross novels. Here all the elements are present, a disturbing killer, Cross' conflict between family and work, and his troublesome love life. Its the interplay between these elements that make Alex Cross Patterson's best creation. Patterson's short chapters and complex, but no too complex plot make this the perfect reading for those us trying to unwind from real world concerns. If your a fan of crime, action, and satisfying conclusion this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit different","review":"Alex Cross is a bit of a different man in this book....I think he dates three different women in a very short span of time. Not what I'm used to seeing. And with all the things this character knows, there is one word he doesn't: boundaries! I feel bad for his family - he cannot say \\"no\\" to work! Although with the ending, this may change in the future. The plot was good - I wasn't able to guess who the bad guy was, and that makes this a success for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast, Easy Read","review":"Well-known people in LA are being murdered and Dr. Alex Cross, in his role as FBI agent, is called in to help solve the case. This is a fast, easy read. The characters are well rounded and interesting. There was one rather graphic sex scene early on that seemed unnecessary and out of place. Alex Cross' family played a prominent role in this one and I found that very enjoyable. True to Patterson's pattern, there was a surprising twist toward the end and it led to a very satisfying conclusion. We are left with the question, what is next for Alex Cross?"},{"rating":"2","title":"just another review","review":"liked it! A good read. Kept you in the chase. Characters beside the obvious Alex Cross that were well developed"},{"rating":"1","title":"1 Star being the lowest - - then deduct TWO more stars!","review":"I really, REALLY mean it this time - - NO MORE PATTERSON BOOKS FOR ME!!! This was the sorriest excuse yet! His publishing company must have paid some of the critics well - I finally gave in and bought this after hearing one of them state -- \\"the scariest Alex Cross novel yet!!!\\" Yeah, right!!! The scariest part was the child-custody hearing - I'm sitting there reading chapter after chapter about his child-custody fight??? WTF???Speaking of Chapters - chapter breaks appeared every-other page!!! In the middle of a thought!!! Patterson must've gotten paid by the page rather than by the word!The ending was far-fetched and nowhere close to believable. So he got the idea from an inmate of a psychiatric hospital??? So what made him so DRIVEN to continue killing??? Please!My 8-year-old granddaughter could've done a better job!Shame on you, James Patterson!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Not Back in Form","review":"James Patterson's books are not what they once were. I have to agree with many of the earlier reviews that said the characters were not fully developed in this novel, & some bits were just thrown in for no reason. Why did Jamilla leave? Why did Christine come back? Motivations for various actions were sorely lacking. Although the concept was somewhat unique, it felt like a barely filled-in, still undeveloped plot outline. Not nearly the spell-binding Alex Cross mysteries I remember from Patterson's earlier days. Perhaps, when Hollywood gets a hold of it, a better writer will flesh out the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible....","review":"I have read Patterson from the beginning of his career, and he's rapidly losing steam, and this reader's attention.He's over-prolific, trying to be too hip.. his writing in this book got on my nerves, he's trying too hard, using too many current buzzwords in an attempt to be Cool and Cutting-edge.I will give his next book a go, and if that turns out to be anything like his last few, then it's Adios to Mr. Patterson for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this guy get a book contract?","review":"I believe I might have read a James Patterson novel years ago, but I must have blocked out how bad it was out of self-protection. Well, I just checked out Mary Mary from the library and am appalled by how sub-par the writing is. And don't even get me started on the short chapters. Does Patterson have any attention span at all? I am no longer surprised by how he manages to crank out so many novels. Just limit the length of your sentences to no more than ten words and use as many cliches as possible, and viola!I managed to get only 40 pages into the book. After two murders and one painfully bad love scene, I just cannot continue. To quote Cross himself (at Chapter 11, the point at which I threw the book across the room), \\"This sucked in a way that broke new territory.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Was there ever a doubt???","review":"OK, so the last Patterson's haven't been 5 star material - but I still always rated his books a 4 star - to me Patterson at his less thrilling is STILL MORE thrilling than many so called bestsellers out there.However, Mary, Mary has brought Patterson back with a vengeance. Amidst lots and lots of personal turmoil in his life, Alex still manages to find himself right in the middle of a classic murder whodunit that will keep you turning the pages over and over again.I really liked the fact that Sampson is back in force in this novel. He is a great character and Patterson has managed to get him back into the storyline effortlessly.ENJOY THIS ONE!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Alex Cross rules!","review":"Thank goodness! After reading several books that didn't live up to expectations from other authors, reading Mary Mary was like putting on your favorite outfit and feeling like a million dollars!Throughout the years, Patterson has never let us down with Alex Cross and his family - Mary Mary is classic Patterson/Alex Cross - Even though you can figure out whodunit early on - This series has progressed as Alex Cross gets more recognition - Reading the opening pages of Mary Mary, you get hooked in the spider web of the book (an homage to Along Came a Spider)- To me, this is very much worth the hardback price."},{"rating":"1","title":"weird enough","review":"i never understood why i could never finish any book written by this patterson guy, and could never comprehend why he could survive so long as a popular novelist. all of his stuff looked so formulaic and stereotyped, absolutely lack of enthusiasm and sincerity as a thriller writer should be. again, i've tried to reread and restart this one several times, but could never finish it. it read so phony, so insincere with cardboard one dimensional characters and dialogs. as to plot and scenario, well, everything just like a bad b movie and should go directly to dvd release and bury itself in walmart's cheap dvd piles."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you ever wanted to be a G Man","review":"Ever day dream that you are a G Man out there trying to save the world? Wanta feel like it? Get this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mary Mary a Winner in my Book!","review":"I never lost faith in James Patterson. I knew after the last two attempts he made with the Big Bad Wolf and London Bridges, that there still had to be some life left in Patterson to bring back the quality of the older Alex Cross books again! I thoroughly enjoyed Mary Mary. The story kept me captivated and it was extremely hard to put down. Alex, Nana, Damon, Jannie, Little Alex (now Ali), Sampson and all the other Bureau guys are back as Alex takes on one of his most psychotic killers yet. This book takes you north, then back south, then east and back west as Alex and his Team chase this killer all over North America. When the book hits its climax it has you hanging on and the end is something I honestly say I never guessed. The book was awesome, and I would recommend it to any Alex Cross fan to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"I haven't read too many James Patterson mystery novels, but I love his love story-type novels. This was very entertaining and I stayed awake way too long each night because I wanted to know \\"what happens next.\\" It's not the deepest novel I've ever read and doesn't require all that much thinking, but that's what I'm looking for at this stage in my life.

I have read the entire Alex Cross series and Mary Mary is the best one of the series, In my opinion at least."},{"rating":"1","title":"1/3 blank paper","review":"Regardless of the story(s) this will be the last book of his I will purchase. Every 2nd or 3rd page is a new chapter resulting in 1/3 of the book being blank paper. I find this a cheesy ploy to add physical bulk to what is in reality a small novel. Since he continues to want to publish books like this I will spend my money on other novels that don't try to make their book into more than it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"My goodness what a rip off - the entire novel could have been printed on the back of a cereal box!It is very hard to stay interested with all of the starts and stops caused by Mr. Patterson's one page chapters. Hack!I couldn't even unload it at a garage sale!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally Alex Cross is Back","review":"Finally Alex Cross is back. After Four Blind Mice things just went down hill and London Bridges was just horrible! But now Paterson takes Alex Cross back to his old ways. This is the best Alex Cross book while he has been in the FBI.The plot is good which was what Four Blind Mice, Big Bad Wolf, and London Bridges missed. And it has Alex Cross's personal life which was what London Bridges was missing; his family and friends are part of the reason why I love this series so much. Damien is now a teenager; Nana Mama is getting older, and every time the baby Alex debate comes up I feel so sad. Things are getting really mucky for Alex Cross alright.I had thought I guessed who the murderer was, but of course James Patterson pulled the rug out under my feet again. While this not one of the best in the series it is still very good. Alex Cross is back in top form and I cannot wait until the next installment comes around in November."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been there, done that","review":"Some of the scenes are quite predictable, and some of it is a typical Hollywood movie. Also, it puts too much emphasis on the character\`s personal life, which to me was quite boring.

The women in this guy's life either take care of him, throw themselves at him or are mentally ill.The chapters were too short. Mr. Patterson's portrayal of women is one-dimensinal. It did keep me interested enough to read it in almost one sitting, just to see if it would get any better. Being a top seller, I thought I must be missing something. I have to admit the premise of the Storyteller was interesting, but how about actually developing the villian's character without just throwing him at us at the end?Try again, Mr. Patterson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mary, Mary","review":"He's done it again.

This has absolutely nothing to do with the story.Over the entire book was pretty dry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enjoyable but not worthy of an Alex Cross story","review":"I read the first four Alex Cross books in 2 weeks, shared with my father who also loved them, not only were you on the edge of your seat unable to put the book down, reading well into the night to the annoyance of my husband, but you could also smell the coffee in Nana Mama's kitchen. I hate to be disloyal to someome who has given me so much pleasure in his books but they are becoming far to brief and whilst the story is still there the story telling no longer is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cut","review":"This book was an improvement over the last few book by Patterson. He is again however using too much filler to make the pages worth the price.I am sick of Nana Mamma and her great cooking. His perfect children who never seem to grow up. And his love affairs. Find a woman and get married for heaven sake.What is with John being invited to join the FBI and he, in turn, inviting Alex to return to Washington PD. Was there a point to this? Unless it was the preview of coming events in yet another lame book.OK. \\"CUT\\". Why were the faces cut? No explaination??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Patterson keeps readers turnging the pages","review":"With Mary Mary, Patterson presents another intriguing tale featuring Alex Cross. The storyline itself is not bad at all - Cross is called in to solve a growing string of murders in Hollywood in which the murderer sends emails under the pseudonym of Mary following each murder. The story starts strong and keeps pace throughout. My only complaint is that the story seems a bit jumpy, in part because Cross is bouncing around back and forth across the country. All-in-all, although not spectacular, this work will keep fans of Patterson's Alex Cross series happy. For those who have not ready the previous Alex Cross novels, my recommendation would be to cover some of the earlier material before tackling this work. Although the antagonist is all new, the substantial amount of material in this book that deals with Cross' family and home situation is clearly better enjoyed with the background of the earlier novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alex Cross","review":"Get the nursery rhyme series.

They were Smyth-sewn/whipstitched, and would last for years. Unfortunately,except for their \\"Signature Series\\" Bibles, which are priced at $99 and more, Nelson (and Crossway) Bibles, in my opinion, are the most inferior on todays market. They are all glue-bound, and have a limited life-expectancy. This is a prime example of it. The New King James translation is an excellent translation. Unfortunately, it is Nelson's house translation, and they charge unreal royalties to any other publishing house who wishes to use it.If you wish to have a decently made, quality NKJV, seek out the offerings from Broadman/Holman. They will last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Cinematic Genius","review":"This Buster Keaton classic has never looked better than than on this newly released Blu Ray disc......Sherlock Jr is 44 minutes of perpetual motion............not a half second of down time in his baby.

The acting, for most of the cast, was very good. The suspense quotient was decent. There were some incongruities with Santi's character, and this troubling inconsistency was maddening and really broke the suspense of disbelief.Had the director stuck with one vision, preferably the closer-to-reality, non-supernatural story, this would have been a decent flick. Instead it seemed to bounce back and forth, and with that ending, he seemed to just throw in the towel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dynamic/Interesting Story","review":"This film was not what I was expecting. I like foreign horror films, especially Spanish (likeThe Orphanage,The Nameless,Pan's Labyrinth(not horror, I know)), and it's probably because they have innovative storylines that do not lead to predictable endings. Always visually stunning, with great moody scores, they just seem to have a great grasp on capturing an eerie mood and dragging the audience in.Shiver is no exception to mastering the sensory magic of foreign horror films. But Shiver is a departure in its storyline. Santi is allergic to light, so his mother moves out to rustic valley to help his health. Once Santi appears, strange things begin to happen in the woods with fatal results. What is happening, and how will Santi prove he is not the cause? Great twists and turns keep you interested and breaths new life into the horror genre.Well done film with an innovative story that deserves a look. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A World of Wonder","review":"This is a wonderful collection of short stories, interweaving in subtlety and setting, but never redundant or dependent on each other. I read them out of order, on and off whenever I felt like it, taking time to appreciate the stories.The stories range in immediate setting from cities to country towns to castles to gardens, but all are set in the fictional country of Orsinia. The characters range from kings to doctors to blinded soldiers to twice-divorced women returning to their original love, but all are richly drawn in a surprisingly minimalist fashion. Ursula K. Le Guin writes with superb mastery of human nature, sucking her readers into the stories in a remarkably short amount of time--extremely necessary in such a short story.Probably my favorite stories in the collection are \\"The Lady of Moge\\" \\"Conversations by Night\\" or \\"The Barrow.\\" Definitely worth buying and reading. These stories will never get boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brian Eno Ambient","review":"I have a number of Eno's ambient works, and while there are several outstanding tracks on this, I don't think it's his best ambient. However, if you like Eno's ambient works, you'll want to get this one. It's the soundtrack for the movie \\"For All Mankind\\" - visual feast of the moonlanding. In addition, one of the tracks has been used in a couple of recent movies so you may recognize it.For a reference, I think Eno's best ambient includes \\"The Shutov Assembly\\" and, with Harold Budd, \\"Plateau of Mirror.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't pass this one up","review":"I bought this on cassette back in 1985 and it is still one of my most played Ambient/Space pieces.

Simple: for 'An ending (ascent)' (track no.5, 4'18'') is worth all the disk. And many others still to come. A masterwork that has the only flaw to be too (too!!) short! Play it looped at least twelve times and it will make you forget your weight!(why did I say one of the least enchanting?

If one listens carefully to this album one gets a very eerie feeling of actually beeing on the moon mission oneself.The melodic athmosferes created are both very haunting and ethereal at one time. As you gently fly through space with your eyes closed you get the ethical idea of what space- flight is all about.This itself is worth this journey that Brian Eno takes us on here. Whatever typs of music you are into from before is of no importance at all,this one really ought to be in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book and series, more please!!!!","review":"I loved the story, actually I am caught up in the lives of all the characters in the series.

By all means, it is a very excellent DVD without a doubt, for any Jackie Gleason fan. And it does contain many hilarious excerpts of the Honeymooners. However, this also contains wonderful excerpts taken from Mr. Gleason's variety shows too. Yet what I cherish most are the bloopers showing all the many amazing instances where Mr. Gleason alone,or Mr. Gleason and Mr. Carney and other cast members, managed to sail right through them all! There is even the clip from when Mr. Gleason broke his leg in a 1954 skit during live television, yet he somehow still finished it! Now talk about how \\"the show must go on!\\"That is incredible!

All of the black rubber material was destroyed within 10 minutes. Then, he worked his way through the rest and pretty much made it look like a chewed-up Bic pen.I do feel inclined to mention that his teeth [literally] look like werewolf teeth and that he is part American Staffordshire Terrier.Here's my experience with this product:For puppies -- its a pretty good teething toy that lets you play with your puppy too.

We have a 60 lb lab who loves tug of war. He immediately went to work chewing this toy and was able to chew thru not only the flimsy red plastic but also the rubber, so much so that after 3 days when he played TOW with me, the toy broke in half and snapped back and hit him in the eye with such force that his eye swelled shut. The vet said he suffered ocular trauma and it cost us over $500 in vet bills and we weren't sure his eye would ever recover. Contacted Kong, they said they had never heard any complaints about this toy and were completely apathetic to my situation. Normally a huge fan of Kong products but this one is substandard and caused my normally very happy lab huge amounts of pain and suffering. AVOID THIS TOY FOR YOUR DOGS SAFETY!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"I bought this toy and spent $14 on it. Took it home to my medium size dog, who destroyed it in less than 15 minutes. The reason I bought this toy is because I have another Kong which my dog hasn't been able to break at all.

Otherwise you'll waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This toy lasted 5-6 play sessions with my yellow lab before the black rubber grips on the ends started splitting which results in the sharp red plastic core underneath digging into your hand.

Except the expiration dates .... all 48 packages are due to expire within 6-8 months. So if you're buying this for long term storage, you're better off getting at the store - where I've seen expiration dates 2+ years out.

It is just as easy to make your own. Read the ingredients list on this--what is some of that stuff?The home made version tastes so much better. You just take a cup of long grain rice, add two and a quarter cups of water, a quarter teaspoon of salt, 1 tablespoon of cayenne pepper, stir until combined, bring all this to a boil over medium heat stirring once then turn heat down to low and simmer for 20 minutes.While it is simmering, cut up a polish kielbasa sausage and heat it in a pan with a couple of tablespoons of sizzling hot saved bacon grease or olive oil or peanut oil or whatever you like.

Because of the heaviness of the watch the band would break often and hit the asphalt/concrete. After a few years of repeated bonking on the hard surfaces it finally quit. (I wish i had put a good fabric band on it). Anyway, i bought one of these watches last year (2010) and it was a creampuff. Any jar to my arm and it would stop running. Very disappointing. This is the only watch i really desire to own, but because of the unreliability i had to leave it in the fond memories of yesteryear. ( I actually bought a sport model Seiko automatic before i made this purchase in 2010---same problem. I sent both watches back and opted for the SKA413.)

I put up with it because I really liked the style and the fact that I could dive with it without ever opening up the case to replace a battery. Unfortunately, over time, after resetting the time virtually every day, I needed to replace the o-ring in the crown.

When I first got it, it kept extremely accurate time (less than +5 secs per week, according to my atomic clock app), but as time went on (ha!), it got progressively worse, until I was losing 8 minutes a week. And 9 mos later, it stopped for good, and no amount of shaking would start it back up. Extremely disappointed, I wish I had read the reviews and seen that this particular seller/watch has had QC issues.

The first movement's opening doesn't give me chills like some versions do, but the orchestra begins to shine once the major key melody begins--the sound is incredibly rich and warm. The second-movement scherzo is the most lively and exciting I've heard; it alone makes this recording worth owning. At the end of the piece, where most orchestra's brass sections are hammering away at a no-holds barred fff, Minnesota's reads the dynamics and forte-pianos more literally and lets other instruments come through the texture. This is musically interesting but makes the glorious finale sound a bit sparse.If you are only going to buy one Mahler 1 recording, make it a classic like the Chicago Symphony with Boulez, which is both engaging and flawless.

These were hard-drinking Irishmen who add a grittier edge to their music.The 42 tracks on this collection are all taken from the handful of albums and EP's they recorded for Transatlantic in the mid-Sixties, beginning with their debut from 1964: THE DUBLINERS AND LUKE KELLY. Many of the selections are live, including all of the tracks from 1965's THE DUBLINER'S LIVE IN CONCERT.If you love Irish music and your collection doesn't include anything by this influential band, this a great place to start.

To me, those were the richest and most eloquent part of the novel, and I could easily have spent another 200 pages with those three characters.

Every song is different, not based on previous chords that have been already used like some other artist. This was done very easily, as many of these songs (if not all) have used samples from others; these are mashed up nicely and used as the beat. Samples from artists such as Erma Franklin, Malcolm McLaren, Kool and the Gang...how could you go wrong?The songs are catchy, they make you want to move.

If you decide to get this cd, the best songs on there is: 'Make me over', 'That's what UR', and 'Somebody up there must love me'.....everything else sounds like she hopped in a time chamber and just said \\"80s!

These are apparently faux jade for the price, and that's more to why I hoped for a more consistent color as pictured. Also, the ear nuts (back fasteners) are very, very small, smaller than the posts need, making it difficult to secure earring without losing the ear nut. And, once one drops the ear nut backing, heaven must help in finding it--they are that small. I lost both the first and second time of wearing and taking off, never could find either, and had to replace with extras I always keep on hand that are more appropriate for the posts' size and adult ears.They are still very pretty earrings--comfortable, lightweight, not too large or small, and are at a good price.

Most of the film tells us things that most historians already know. And when we finally get to the actual words of Hitler, revealed by lipreading, they are mundane.

There are far more revealing films about the fuhrer, e.g., Leni Riefenstahl's \\"Triumph of the Will\\" and a dozen or so other productions.I did have some interest in the technique respecting the revelation of how lips are read.

Since it is reversible, it is a very practical cape. The concept of reversible cape reminds me of buy one and get the second FREE. since both the sides have a very useful and practical color.

In general, the author succeeds in showing continuity as well as factors in development. Students of history and philology will probably find it interesting and useful.One major complaint I have with the book, however, is that few of the lapidary sections are provided in translation. Consequently, although most of the work is in English, it slightly hard to follow unless you also can read various forms of Latin, Old French, Medieval Spanish, and so forth. I believe the Old English sections are provided in translation, but they are the exception.Nevertheless, this work has become something of a classic in its field. I would certainly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"Who are you people trying to fool? This album is horrible! This is one of the worst rarities I've ever purchased aside from Eden's Children. Tahitian Melody is the only solid song on this record that conjures up a spacy atmosphere. The rest of the tunes are in the acid rock/garage rock vein. These songs lack the hooks and lyrics to compete with the better garage bands of the time. At times, the faceless garage rock has solid, tight playing but that is not saying much. This album is to be avoided at all costs unless one is a completist."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE Book","review":"Lots of information and pictures.

I love the interactions between the cats, and that Joe Grey has a delightful sense of humor. Shirley Murphy answers the question many of us ponder - \\"If our pets could talk, what would they say?\\" Her plots are interesting and never recycled. I highly recommend this series to any one who loves cat mysteries, or is looking for a good book to curl up with on a rainy day.

Whether or not you fly fish, people in ministry will relate to what is there and find food for thought and heart each day. I bought five for Christmas presents for my church staff.

I think the violence is necessary to really paint the picture of Bateman, but don't forget that the violence is not the point of the book. The point - in my opinion - is the isolation of Bateman,his life through material things and television and his inadequacy.Whatever one might think of the book, it has made people think and react, which is a good thing. On Amazon alone some 500 people have reviewed the book and this years after it was first published. Ellis has caused debate, which very few books do these days. The book really does matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't make it through","review":"I'm posting this as a warning The point the author makes is a valid and interesting point- selfishness, materialism etc. are the morally numbing enemies of civilization, however it's just not worth being confonted with this truly sick, disgustingly violent and disturbingly haunting imagery. This book actually made me physically ill, a first for me and the little I did read sticks in my head- a most unwelcome presence, I assure you!. Lest anyone think that it's from a weak stomach, I read the sicker sections of \\"Hannibal\\" without a problem, but this? It crossed way over the line for me. Avoid the inevitable nightmares-don't read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Post-modern Frankenstein","review":"Vulgarity may dominate your senses but focus more on the characters surrounding Bateman and the 'psycho''s thoughts at the end chapters. The narrow-minded, self-centered weltanshaaung of the 'extras' surrounding Bateman gives us at least one of the answers to the constant question: 'Why so much violence in our world?' We are all so eager to complain about it (if we notice it at all), but few take the effort to do anything about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"On the most basic possible level . . .","review":"The problem isn't that this book is depraved.

I am still mourning the money I spent on purchasing it. I was willing to endure the blood and gore for a good read, this book did not deliver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why?","review":"I have never read such drivel and pretense masquerating as sophistication. The book? No, the reviewers.This is a mirror on the reality of the 1980s? Yes, all young men are one martini away from serial murder, at least if they live in New York and have lots of money. I mean, it's too absurd to really give any credibility to. I saddens me that there are people so hateful.It's good that we live in a free country -- and a capitalist one -- so that you can afford computers to \\"express\\" yourselves with.The book is an interesting journey into the mind of a physcho (it's in the title, for chrissakes!), but it is interesting because he is an aberration; a phantom; someone none of us know or will (I hope) ever know (even in New York!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"How does my hair look.\\"","review":"This book is only \\"poorly edited\\" if you look at it from the conventional viewpoint. It's apparent lack of focus only serves to reinforce the reader's sense of Bateman's gradual descent into complete neurosis. Remember, the book is written in first person. If dramatic monologues have any chance of being realistic, they've got to portray a character dynamically, through a host of changes. Read <Psycho> and see if it doesn't take on a much more \\"conventional,\\" and satisfying narrative structure when taken this way. It's <Huck Finn> with too much money and rotting corpses strewn around his raft"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book should come with a barf bag","review":"This book is undoubtedly the most disgusting thing I have ever read. I literally had to psych myself into reading through certain parts, and even then I was dry-heaving. I will never look at Habitrails the same way again. Although I found this book revolting, Mr. Ellis did make me rethink the whole don't-judge-a-book-by-it's-cover adage. The protagonist is one slick, sick puppy. I must admit that I was amused by the chocolate-covered urinal cake episode and the descriptions of Patrick's shallow friends and lifestyle. That was definitely creative writing. Although the descriptions of the cool clothes our psycho-boy wore got boring after a while, I viewed it as another interesting aspect of his warped mindset. All in all, this is NOT a book I would recommend to anyone! I would not want anyone I cared about to be as disturbed as I was by the story, and I would be afraid to give sicko ideas to those who would be perverse enough to actually enjoy this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"One scary book","review":"I don't like this book because I'm some kind of twisted freak who enjoys reading about violent people and their crimes. No, this book really scared me. No other book has ever done that. But besides that, this book is really well written. The main character goes into such descriptive detail about his stereo, his food, his clothing, etc., that you really think: This guy is a psycho"},{"rating":"1","title":"rambling details","review":"Maybe the symbolism of this book is totally lost on me. Ellis takes up way too much book space describing in irritating detail what each person is wearing. Ok, the bums don't get a fashion summary but all the other well to do characters (whether we are given their names of not) has their wardrobe described in detail. I think we get the point right from the beginning that these people are wealthy yuppies. I have just begun to read the book and find myself skipping over sections where Ellis describes people and their outfits. Don't waste your money, people. I haven't seen the movie but if you feel you must find out about all the hype that went with this book and movie, do yourself a favor and go see the film. Save yourself the irritation of this man's ramblings."},{"rating":"2","title":"engrossing,hypnotic and disturbing.","review":"American psycho draws you into the mind of a serial killer. One that your intellect make you pray, does'nt exist. Yet, makes you feel, could possibly be out there killing, undetected. This is a deeply disturbing novel about a wealthy young stock broker who recognizes that he is sick and out of control, yet manages to slip past the system because of his status in society."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lighten up, it is FICTION!","review":"Hidden behind all of the blood and gore, is one of the most humorous accounts of 80's greed and self absorption. How can one not laugh at the chapter entitled: \\"Killing Child At Zoo\\" Put yourself in Patrick's shoes and how you, too, examine your circle of friends and co-workers to no end.... subconsciously wishing harm to some. The only difference is that Patrick acts out these hidden fantasies. Ignore the gore and enjoy the insightful relief that Ellis is providing. A must for any reader not afraid to explore one's self."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most necessary book since \\"If this is a man\\"","review":"Working in a library in London, I come across all sorts of books. This book had a \\"bad\\" reputation and intrigued, I read the first few pages. I found an immense amount of humour and a nihilistic approach as keen as anything by Celine. The first page, when he's reading all the horror stories from the newspaper and says he can't believe all this happens in just one city, justifies Mr. Ellis' excessiveness. I am immenseley looking forward to the film and if anyone in England taped the SouthBank documentary recently on him, I would be interested to hear from you as my video broke down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing and Fascinating","review":"I began this book around Christmas last year, and stopped because I found it boring and overly violent. Later, though, I picked it up again one afternoon, and found that it was riveting. I read it one sitting. I agree that it is not for all tastes and, in terms of plot work and character development, I've read better. But it is truly an original piece of contemperary literature and it deserves to go down as a cult classic; in the same league as A CLOCKWORK ORANGE and ALIAS GRACE. I'm not sure it's true, but I read that this book is going to be made into a movie with Leonardo DiCaprio in the title role. I guess we'll wait and see how that turns out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than Zagat","review":"In short, the whole thing is way too over-the-top to be taken as anything but silly and cute. However, if you're considering a night of fine dining in NYC, this is the book to consult. I haven't even touched my Zagat Guide since I bought this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total waste of time","review":"Reading this book was a total waste of time. We learn that Mr. Ellis knows all about clothing brands but after the first three pages, hearing what everyone is wearing and how much everything costs was tiresome. The killings are indeed graphic but can't stop the book from being boring over all."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty shocking....yawn","review":"Bret Easton Ellis' first novel (Less than Zero) reads like the first draft of a ninth graders book report. This novel isn't much better. Full of one-dimensional characters, empty dialog that leads nowhere and exposes nothing but the obvious, and completely unbelievable situations. Not to mention lazy writing; it's painfully obvious Ellis has absolutely no idea what goes on on a day-to-day basis on Wall Street. Or at least he didn't bother to show us -- to actually flesh out the main character so we could understand a method to his madness. Oh well. I guess if he did, he might not have room for the Genesis album reviews or to re-hash the scenes from his first novel, Less than Zero. Conclusion: Ellis just isn't ambititious or talented enough to pull something like this off with any success."},{"rating":"1","title":"American Psycho -- Baaaaad Fiction!","review":"This is one of the worst books I've ever read! The use of adverbs is beyond belief, and to use it with dialogue attribution, ugh! And, the descriptions of people's clothing: man, I can get a catalog, I don't need that information. The dialogue is stilted and poorly crafted. I read the book precisely to understand what it is I would never do as a writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Fantasy","review":"Nice book to spend time on brand names. I found the characters very unreal.1- I didn't see bateman going shopping. To have that extensive knowledge he needs to spend his life in shopping malls (like my girlfriend). This is real fiction. 2- Life should not be that easy esp. when working in New-york. I am not from NY but have you ever seen someone working for a financial company and doing nothing (e.g. @ morgan stanley?). Unreal.The psycho problem looks like a cover to increase the book sales. Yes it could be more difficult for the writer to describe the ugly routine itself . I would like the book more if it could describe the weirdness of the characters without the psycho pepper.I recommend the book if you liked the fastasy world in \\"less than zero\\". And I really wonder how the real people who are supposed to be the real Batemans, think about the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"American Psycho","review":"I found the the 1st 2/3 of the book an interesting look at the culture of the 80's and didn't mind the violence content. But the last 1/3 of the book can only be described at vile and disgusting with no connection to the other parts of the book. I am not sure what the author is trying to state with the very graphic and violent last 100 pages. Author never gets into why this person is so violent and why his behavior was so. After reading the book I don't have much interest in seeing the film version."},{"rating":"1","title":"no excuse for misogyny","review":"I know this book is a piece of fiction, and you can call it satire if you like, but think about all the horrible things done to women in this book. Rape, kidnapping, torture and dismemberment of women are not subjects for satire. I am very ashamed of the female readers who have given this book a favorable rating. On the other hand, Ellis' technical prowess and skill with dialog warrant an extra star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, but at times quite boring book","review":"American Psycho is really like some kind of experimental music, it is original and has a brilliant and powerfull concept, but becouse of its \\"non-traditional\\" nature it sometimes becomes really boring, repetative and just hard to read.I highly recommend that book and I love Ellis' uniqe style very much, but I this book is not my favourite of him. It has no plot AND at the same time all the chapters are very alike. And it could've been much shorter without losing anything valuable (and belive me, I like long books as long as they manage to be interesting throughout).\\"The Informers\\" by Ellis', for example, is a superior book in my opinion, becouse it lacks the above mentioned flaws of \\"Ameerican Psycho\\": lack of composition, plot and differences between chapters.Although, \\"Am Psycho\\" is a must read and YOU, unlike me, can find it a perfect book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ug! Painful!","review":"Worst book I have ever read!! If you are a male clothes horse of the '80's you might enjoy the VERY DETAILED descriptions of every outfit that every character in every scene is wearing right down to socks and sunglasses. I found it distracting and not relevent to the story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book I felt ashamed to have read","review":"I did something to this book that I've never done before in my life. I tore it up after reading it so that it wouldn't get passed on. There was no reason for this book. It's not a sharp satire of the '80s. It's not cogent, incisive or insightful. I think it might be bad. And I didn't want to see the movie because I didn't want to support this particular story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strangely compelling, like transexuals and traffic accidents","review":"Bateman has moments that reveal what many peoples reactions would be, if not restrained (thankfullly) by sociol conditioning. When he pulls the knife on Carruthers to escape, for example. As well as this he has occansional moments of vunerablilty that almost make you disregard his earlier actions and forgive him, such as when he admits to working at P&P, just to fit in. His fustration with his associates shallow lives also strikes a nerve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Read","review":"This is read bad.

I understand the whole point of the book was that the consumerism of the yuppie lifestyle can drive you to kill, but really?

Those descriptions were WAY worse than the actual killing scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Book, too bad mine wass missing 50 pages","review":"This book certainly is not for everybody.

I had a really hard time getting into the book because half of it was about what clothes he wore and stupid stuff like that and the ending didn't even make sense; I could see the social commentary of the \\"me\\" and metrosexual 80s, but that's not enough for me to say it was a good book. I definitely wouldn't recommend it --I only gave it two stars because it helped me kill some time waiting for my car at the shop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely 5 stars","review":"I can't understand why this book has only three and a half stars.

Set in the early ninties, American Psycho has the ability to make you read this book in one sitting. I started reading the book at 10:00 a.m one day and looked up at the clock as I got to the midway point and it was 2:30!!! The book definately starts up slow but when it picks up pace it is a very detail oriented and extremely explicity ride. Read this book!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolute masterpiece","review":"This is the first Ellis novel that I have had the opportunity to read and I was quite impressed. It is obviously a social commentary from the beginning and the reader gets a real sense of Bateman's state of mind. As the novel continues, it becomes a disturbing tour-de-force that is as unforgettable as it is shocking and gruesome. I cannot convey the greatness of this book in a small review. Read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I heard that this was a good book, so I read it this past summer. I was blown away. Not only was the satire in it intelligent, the humor in it made me laugh out loud. This book has been labeled as anti-women, but I don't think it is. True, it's very violent, but it's all to prove a point. After reading several of the most violent passages, I had to put the book down for the rest of the day, and it's quite a disturbing book, but everyone should check this one out."},{"rating":"1","title":"American garbage","review":"Okay, I read it and boy did I have to force myself to do so. In short, a pointless book full of nothing with gore and blood to make it seem something. After all, without the gore this poor excuse for a book would have never seen publication. I can't believe wall street types act this way and if they do, I'm sure its a small minority. As for the poor depicted in this book, they were so wooden and stale that no shock could truly be derived from their deaths. My only regret after finishing the book besides wasting my time was that Evelyn never got killed; I was sure Bateman would have snuffed her out. Not recommended; move on to something better like Patterson James or Richard North or even try the latest Star Wars book, now that's true suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I've ever read","review":"Need I say more?

It's filled with boring, empty moronic people. And documents a troubled, racist, sexist, homophobic young man who hates his job so much he has to try to either turn his life into a real-life snuff film or keep all of these sick and degrading images in his head. What is the point of such a book? It totally makes me glad that I slept through the '80s if people were really this shallow, this foolish and ignorant."},{"rating":"1","title":"PIECE OF JUNK........","review":"This is the worst book i have ever read in my whole life. The thing that gave me a head ache was the length of first three/four chapters. They are very very long.

Other reviewers celebrate the wry humor, commentary on modern life, etc; etc. The book is so incredibly sickening that some will be drawn to it because it is, but for me it was like seeing a gruesome traffic accident you REALLY wish you hadn't. If you decide you want to read it, and thought it was the greatest thing since sliced bread, OK. Me, it's something that wounded and branded my sensibilities with a particularly offensive brutality, and attached itself inside me like a parasite. I got about halfway through and couldn't go any further. This is the first and only book I have ever thrown away. Even the little bit I did read infected me with a sort of aching horror that took a long, long time to finally go away."},{"rating":"1","title":"another overhyped critique on consumerism in the 80s","review":"well, this book is definitely less smug than anything by don delillo, though still not worth reading unless you're a big intellectual lit freak or into porn and graphic violence. but if, like me, you're of average intelligence and read primarily to be entertained and not lectured, i would not recommend this book.first off, while i can see how forcing us to read 499 pages filled mostly with brand names and pointless conversations could be part of the satire or whatever, this is way too long for a plotless story. as someone said, like half the murders could have been taken out and we would have gotten the point. i also don't see why social commentary has to be so hard to swallow. why are ridiculous situations and completely unbelievable characters, listings, etc., such a trend in 80s lit?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give it 0 stars if I could","review":"Run, run far away from this book, and don't look back. This book can turn a normal person into an insane serial killer. All this book does is talk about \\"pop\\" culture of the 80's, fashion, and NYC in between bloody gruesome murders of innocent people. It's kinda like Sex and the City meets... I don't know, Friday the 13th? No, that makes it seem like he has some kind of motive. Sex and the City meets Scream? No, that would imply some kind of comedy. Oh, I know, Sex and the City meets the Hitcher, not the old one, the new one where all the good people die bloody, gruesome deaths, but the killer still keeps going. Please, don't read this book, its too late for me, save yourself!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Not An Exit","review":"Bret Easton Ellis has got to be the most talented author in modern America. Using Patrick Bateman's stream of conscious you experience the ultimate downward spiral of a young successful man. But not only is it the downward spiral of this man, but the downward spiral of America. Patrick Bateman loses his humanity and takes it out by torturing the young women and prostitutes who fall for his glamour and status. The fact that Bateman and several others are confused for other characters by their own supposed social circle further proves the \\"carbon copy, I just want to fit in\\" mentality that seemed to overcome America in the 1980's. This book is more of a social commentary than a work of prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Distressing Satire","review":"Several readers have commented on the gore and depravity of this novel, and it is upon this basis that I simply cannot recommend it. Satirizing the materialism of the 80s yupsters, their sexual habits, and their unceasing search for physical perfection, could have been done without some of the extremely disturbing sequences. Ellis was reputedly depressed and physically ill while writing the harsher set pieces, which is exactly how most readers should expect to feel after reading the novel. While most intelligent readers will definitely pick up on the sociocultural criticisms and sarcastic tone, I simply believe that the exposition of such startling violence leaves a mental impression upon the reader that can - and should - be avoided. Cultural critique need not degrade the reader; Mr. Ellis has a fine talent with the written word, and a sharp eye for detail, but the application of that talent to such depraved subject matter is unfortunate."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most disturbing, nightmare-inducing books ever.","review":"American Psycho, once I got past the seemingly endless namedropping narrative, held me in its thrall for three dark evenings. Unfortunately, headline-makers Jeffrey Dahmer and Ted Bundy (whom Ellis' protagonist Bateman seems to lionize) pale in comparison with Bateman's excesses (not only at yuppie-haven Manhattan in the 80's but his penchant for chopping up women). While Ellis' prose goes nonstop, I can't recall a more superficial yet morbidly fascinating book. I'm a big fan of the First Amendment, but when the story careened from disfiguring a street bum to killing a child on a zoo outing, I put the book down. Hoping that Bateman would meet his match, I returned to the novel the next night. I'm glad I only paid thirty nine cents for the paperback at Goodwill. I'll go see the movie, but the filmmakers surely have their work cut out for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"like something from my high-school lit magazine + violence","review":"Yeah, yeah, yeah ... in high school we used to think like this. People are so conformist -- what if they were ACTUALLY INTERCHANGEABLE? Wow, that guy has cheesy taste in music -- THEREFORE HE'S A MORAL DEGENERATE! That guy is materialistic -- HE'S JUST AS BAD AS A MASS MURDERER! Bret Easton Ellis brings these callow ideas to ... well, not exactly \\"life.\\" Eighty percent of this book is like reading the Beverly Hills Yellow Pages word for word. The rest is like reading a play-by-play description of snuff film. There! I've saved you eleven bucks. You don't have to read the book.And by the way, Leonardo DiCaprio is going to star in the movie. \\"I'm King of the World!\\" indeed...."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want poorly written, senseless torture and misogyny..","review":"The only reason Ellis has received so much press for this waste of a tree is that he was willing to go further than anyone else, quite poorly I might add.It's one thing to use graphic violence to illuminate a point. It's another novel entirely when there doesn't seem to be any particular point. Perhaps what he was trying to communicate was how superficial and senseless yuppies and America of the '80s in general was, but really, wasn't this subject tired enough already?No, Ellis doesn't seem to be that bright. (And if he is, his writing certainly doesn't reflect that.) I think he is simply a shrewd capitalist who realized that if he wrote a \\"novel\\" that was more violent and cruel than anything else available, the hype alone would send him laughing to the bank. We've easily added our own 'deeper meaning' to his poorly written text, and made him a best-seller in the process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Controversial, yet all but forgotten.","review":"Go rent Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I can't believe I read the whole thing; it's not as if there was anything enjoyable or resourceful about it. In fact, I'll say if your idea of a good time is masturbation and murder, this is your new manual. This guy is the literary equivalent of John Hinkley, Jr. That bit about Jamie Gertz? Whatever. It's as though Ellis tried to compress an INXS video into the space of 400 pages. All that self-righteous bum torture and the horribly monotonous insights into what everyone was wearing? It drove me up the wall! How'd he get away with publishing this?! I thought the days of William S. Burroughs and purposless polemics were gone forever, but I guess I was wrong. Seal the vault on this steaming pile and read something else. So vain and meritricious! I'm going to go sedate myself, watch Bambi, and wash my brain out with soap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even finish it--disgusting","review":"This book was extremely difficult to read without even including the gore. Endless references to things that nobody cares about. So hard to follow, seeing that he uses the maniacs point of view. Also, the gore was unbelievable. I couldn't even finish it after one particular scene. I will definitely keep this book away from my child. I don't think anyone is ever old enough to read that."},{"rating":"1","title":"There should be a law...","review":"...against novels this bad. The only method that the main character, insane yuppie killer Patrick Bateman (re: BBE role-playing), did NOT use to kill someone was boredom. Ellis would be able to give him lessons though as this book goes on...and on...and on with absolutely no points of any kind. Wallowing in details about everything from Genesis(!) to shaving materials, American Psycho is a book that doesn't deserve a fraction of the hoopla around it. It's not shocking, it's not good. It's just a real hack job by the mega-hack of our times, Bret Easton Ellis. WHO is the person who helped bring this man to fame? Ellis must be stopped from polluting book shelves further."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money!!!","review":"This book was the biggest waste of time and money I ever spent! The \\"chapter\\" on the band Genesis made me think Ellis himself went totally insane during the writing. What on earth was this chapter doing in this book? It made no sense at all! Then again, neither did the rest of the book! I won't be reading Ellis ever again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling, gruesome, intelligent","review":"Easton Ellis is an extremely talented writer with a strong sense of detail that covers both the page upon page of self obsession and brand dropping as well as the (at least) interesting descriptions of his killings. I did find the murders brutal and often disturbing and I could have put the book away on many occasions and not returned to it BUT I WAS moved and affected and that IS important with a book. Too many novels flash through your consciousness. This has left a spike in my memory and ironically I will likely remember the five pages near the beginning devoted to Bateman's description of his hygiene routine than any of the sensationalised killings. Hyped YES but worth reading.Please e:mail me if you disagree or otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even for the open minded.....","review":"I first read the reviews of American Psycho several months ago and was intrigued by the mixed reactions. I was curious as to which side I would find myself on and began it with a very open mind. The first third of the book seemed to be building up an interesting character study with Patrick's obsession with designer clothing, restaurants and possessions and an occasional flash of his perversities. But when Ellis begins with the gratuitous sex and violence, he lost every bit of my support in his endeavor. I am not surprised that publishers backed out in putting this book on the market. There is nothing redeeming about this book and while I respect an author's delving into their imagination for a unique storyline, this truly crosses the line. Anyone who has these kinds of scenerios in their imagination to begin with borders on the psychotic themselves. If you are debating about reading this book you should definately pass on it. I wish I had."},{"rating":"1","title":"just skip to the sex and violence","review":"I read this book the way Patrick Bateman would--I skipped immediately to the detailed porno scenes and the murders. Those were at least entertaning. The rest of the book is tedious descriptions of suits, skirts, toothpaste, muscles, etc.The problem here is that Ellis has no subtlety. His message--COMPLETE MATERIALISM OVER ALL--is banged into your skull ad nauseam. I can't be reading 4 pages of description on how expensive someone's suit is. Who has time for that? Pat Bateman wouldn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much, Much Less Than Zero","review":"I hope Simon and Schuster turned it down not because of the explicit scenes but because this novel would not even merit reading in an undergraduate creative writing workshop. Hey Brett, read Gardner's The Art of Fiction; maybe you will finally learn something. What a piece of garbage. If this is the future of American fiction, then we are all in for one gigantic aesthetic collapse."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Narcissistic Tale","review":"I ordered this book, excited to read it. I had heard many good things about this novel, and began reading as soon as I received it.I was incredibly disappointed. This book was filled with narcissistic ramblings and obsessive details which matter little to the story itself. The gore, though extensive, ends up being boring. There is gratuitious sex, which is also boring in its detail and violence. Every time Patrick bateman feels dread, it is \\"nameless.\\" The story did not progress, and in the end, there was no resolution. In fact, i felt the book fell apart at its end.This book is not an American classic, nor was it worth reading.

Ever since I read it, I knew I had to own it.Finally, I have gotten around to purchasing it from Amazon.The story is 399 pages itself.Filled with all sorts of different snide remarks and vulgarity, American Psycho has very few limits. Sexual desires and carnal urges are satisfied fully!The package I got was perfectly wrapped, delivered a day earlier than expected, and very easy to open.Inside the package, sitting very snug, was my PERFECT condition novel. There was not a scratch, a tear, or a mark. It looked as if it had just come off the press.If you are a fan of the movie, or the author of the novel, I suggest getting this as soon as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Daunting and Drawn Out","review":"I found the book to be extremely tedious. Honestly, I haven't finished and probably won't because more than half of the book is descriptions of clothing and other status symbols.

I love the movie, I love the other Easton Ellis books I have read, and this received great reviews. But for me it just doesn't do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A disgusting, vile piece of garbage....It is quite possibly one of the best books ive read","review":"This novel is like hostel, mixed with a little bit of wall street. At its cire, its a gruesome novel describing in great detail the murders of many men, women, a child, and animals. Who could kill a child you may ask? Why no one else other than our anti-hero Patrick Bateman. A young investment banker with a very peculiar taste for murder and rape. And if that wasnt enough he enjoys it all (with the exeption of the child). A true american classic that is a must read for anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"missing the intrigue","review":"This is normally a book I would love but I found it more gruesome and less intriguing than I had hoped.

It goes into detail and explores the underlying instanitly/sanitly of Patrick Bateman"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross outs from a flat dimension","review":"I would be willing to accept the defense that Ellis's quickie squib is in fact a satire of consumerism, a literary bit of photo realism if there was compelling art here. There isn't, however, and the defense falls apart. Ellis writes as if he had to submit this against a deadline, and he'd wasted his considerable lead time by living off his hefty advance. Ellis does a good job of diagnosing the narcissism of the eighties, but that by itself does nothing for either our understanding or empathy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect preface to the upcoming film","review":"the film comes out on april 14th, but you should first read the book.

All that will happen is you wind up writing a book review telling everyone else that you obviously missed the point of this book.The book is about existential depression born out of the 80s material excess lifestyle. This sends the main character on a detail-specific, goriffic killing spree. The literary treatment of all the details of the main character's like is as much the story as the acts.Truly this is on par with \\"No Exit.\\" Be warned. It is graphic in its violence, but far boring.

Even though I am a fan of the movies \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" and \\"Seven\\". This book is just too much--it just goes too far. Let me put it this way, after reading it you feel you need to take a shower, seek spiritual direction. Please keep it out of the hands of children, actually adults too. YUCK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"well written but not a woman's book","review":"I agree it is a well written book. I agree it has a great plot, I even agree it makes a statement about America. What I feel I must underscore is that this book is UTTERLY GRAPHIC in its representation of what this man does to his female victims. It is not simply gore, it is not simply horror, it is not simply rape or murder or mutilation...I can handle all of those. It is some of the most disturbing deconstruction of the female anatomy I have ever read. Women who read it should only do so with the warning to read it in small doses and in broad daylight with only trustworthy people around. I read it at night and had horrid nightmares because the descriptions are just that graphic. I am a book lover to a GREAT degree, so I cannot in good conscience throw my copy away, but I will never sell it to a used bookstore because I want to keep my copy from falling into someone's hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Reading this book was such a collossal waste of my time that I am tempted to plant a dozen trees just to make up for the ones which were used to print this nonsense.Not only is the violence gratuitous, but the author appears to have nothing but contempt for the reader because the only significant point he was trying to make is repeated over and over and over and over.....it was as if Ellis thought we had to be beaten over the head to \\"get it.\\" I mean, really...how many times can one discuss horn-rimmed glasses and Armani suits?Memo to Ellis: OK already...nobody actually LISTENED to Bateman. He kept telling everyone that he was a psycho, but they were such self-satisfied, egotistical, greedy jerks they just didn't LISTEN. They didn't HEAR. We get it. Thanks for the newsflash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Entertainment","review":"This is the most enjoyable contempory novel I've read in a long time. But even after 400 pages of American Psycho, I still have no idea who Pat Bateman really is. The story effortlessly shifts between grisly rapes and murders to dinner dates and power lunches. The dialogue is very sharp and witty. There are some funny, yet discusting moments which I will never forget, such as when Bateman disguises a urinal cake as Godiva chocolate for his girlfriend, or when he cleverly traps a rat in a woman's body. Think of him as a mass murdering Tom Green.I watched the movie many times before I read the book, and now after having read it, I realize just how much better the movie could have been. Had Oliver Stone gone on to direct it with Leonardo Dicaprio playing the lead, as was originally planned, you get the sense the movie could have been something big.If you have a strong stomach and a strong bladder (since you may pee your pants laughing), this book is well worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disturbing...","review":"This book is the most disturbing thing I have ever read. If I could give it negative stars I would.

I am a fairly open minded person, and suppose that it is my own fault for reading the book, but it wasn't very good in my oppinion.I found it had been vastly over rated, because it was read by people who wanted something 'different'.If you want a good book, with a capturing story, I would have to suggest you buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible book","review":"This is a terrible book, not worth reading one page. Nothing but sloppily written shock fiction. Do not get it"},{"rating":"1","title":"TerribleAwfulHorrendus","review":"As one recent reviewer pointed out, this is a book for folks who hate to read. Devoid of nuance, imagination or orignality, American Psycho simply attempts the \\"blunt object to the back of the head\\" approach to try to provide shock, while deeply and repetitively underscoring a misanthropic idee fixe, in part by showing as much disrespect to the reader as Pat Bateman shows his victims. I stayed up all night in the Milan train station surrounded by some truly creepy characters, basically amused at the pretentious (stuff) I was reading to stay awake. This isn't satire, unless you count the fact that it has been so highly praised as sort of a satire on modern pop culture.

It perpetuates the stigma that causes unnecessary fear, opression, and poor treatment of those with mental illnesses. Of X numbers of persons at one time with an illness, a tiny percetance of those are having an acute episode. Of that tiny percentage, a tiny percentage may become violent; more prone if under the influence of alcohol.

The repetition in the narrative is mind-numbing and after the first 20 pages or so I was skipping paragraphs. Towards the end of the book I was skipping chapters and 50 pages from the end I gave up.In the blurb on the back, this awful book was compared to \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\".

SICK, SICK, SICK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"POLLUTION","review":"The most obvious criticism is that this novel is a poor piece of writing. It lacks both plot and structure and is much too long - 400 pages of rambling, repetitive, juvenille shlock. How BEE can write so many pages with absolutely nothing to say is astounding.The more important criticism, however, is that this novel is a manifestation of the wickedness that is destroying our society. This author has taken the time to create something ugly and harmful - labouring to find the most vicious way of expressing violence against women. He is not merely commenting on society, he is actively contributing to it's pollution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vanity Press or Vintage Press?","review":"I am amazed that anyone other than the author,would spend the money to publish this book. The violence is not what is offensive, it is the utter lack of plot, and the silly use of meticulous detail in describing (plugging?) fashions worn by the characters. Delete the fashion references, restaurant reviews, and the completely unrelated whole chapters of music reviews and you have about 60 pages of novel, none of which lead to a climax or any resemblance of a story line.

The focus on the materialism of the 1980's in contrast to (or the cause of?) graphicly violent and pyschotic tendencies is poignant. However, this point can be determined by reading about 5 pages randomly - and then setting the book back down. Otherwise, you will just be reading the same thing over and over, very repetitive scenes without coming to any deeper understanding. As reviewer Paul Bryant states (in the \\"Frisk\\" review) we get the point!So save your money and time, and either read a bit in the store or just rent the movie which is just as potentially traumatizing, but less repetitive and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Filth!","review":"I must say I TOTALLY agree with the previous reviewer who only gave this book 1 star.

The violent descriptions in this book are just plain horrible. I mean, what does this book teach our children? That greed and killing are ok??? [....]Of course, I'm sure this book will soon be hailed as a \\"classic\\" just like all the other smutty books out there such as Catcher in the Rye and Brave New World and the just plain inexcusable A Clockwork Orange.

How we measure ourselves in a capitalistic, materialistic society is madness in and of itself. The ruthless nature of a Patrick Bateman is grotesque, of course. But I have imagined and thought that I have actually seen his hate and contempt in the eyes of rich white guys that I have had to deal with.Reading this book was like a catharsis. It made me feel less guilty about imagining my fellow man as the hideous creatures they are. That this author is obviously expressing himself as a Patrick Bateman legitimizes my feeling that there are people out there that are dangerous, ruthless, and just don't care about anyone else.Great book, great subject. I'm glad Mr. Ellis felt comfortable enough to write this general self-portrait of the wealthy class."},{"rating":"1","title":"The lifestyle is what makes me sick, not the violence...","review":"This book is probably not worth your time.

It is very hard to put this book down."},{"rating":"1","title":"A blight","review":"There is a line of thought that if a book is well written it is worth reading, no matter how vile the content.

In the stampede to find a profound analysis, everyone seems to have forgotten that the jaw-dropping vulgarity of this novel is itself a demerit. Not every book that offends people has profundity or literary worth: some books simply offend. And books that are sick simply sicken."},{"rating":"1","title":"not too controversial, just a poorly written book","review":"I am usually pretty accepting of controversial books, so I thought i'd enjoy this book a lot. Instead, I found this book to be extremely boring. First, its fun of unimportant information and monotonious events in Patrick's life. Sure, its supposed to show how materialistic the 80's were but after a few chapters the author just uses the same techniques to portray the matrerialism of the 80's. Second, it doesn't take very much skill to write about a psycho going around torturing women. There was really no plot in this novel, the characters were not very interesting, it wasn't very funny. The author did a terrible job with this novel so he probably added a lot of violent parts in this book that are not even scary, to create controversy, and provide more publicity for this book. Bottom line its a baaddd baaddd book, thats very very boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"American Psycho leaves me depressed....","review":"I read American Psycho unaware of the bruhaha surrounding its release. Nor did I see the movie, so I was completely unbiased. I found this book appalling. Horrific in its descriptions of unspeakable cruelties upon humans and animals alike with a general attitude of misogyny. The descriptions of animal cruelty haunt me to this day though I know it is fiction. Plus it was just plain boring in its descriptions of what the character was wearing and his obssession with appearance and aging. I did not find this to be anywhere as compelling as Less Than Zero and furthermore thought it a disgrace that such a monstrosity be written, let alone published; just because the first ammendment says we can does not mean we should. This is simply a cookbook for the psychopath without imagination, not an analtyical probing of the flaws inherent in our society, as touted in reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way way way way over the top","review":"Let me say first that I'm not someone that usually says something is too over the top. I'm a huge 1st amendment supporter and think that everyone has the right to express any opinion they wish. That being said, this book was horrible. I got the point, trust me I did. Rich man, empty soul, worried about designer clothes and fancy resturants and all that. blah, blah, blah. However, this simple message can't fill 400 pages, and it shows. Do I need ten pages about him torturing and murdering an innocent girl? NOT AT ALL. Not that I am saying it shouldn't be printed, but this stuff is just so repetitive I often wondered why I just didn't stop reading the book. I was really wanting to see karma get this guy I guess. One more thing, this book should have some kind or warning on it, because while I support free speech more than anyone I know, this book should not be in the hands of children. I'm 23 and not sure if I should've read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This will be the last book of his I read......","review":"And not because of the violence....simply because it, like Glamorama, was silly, insipid, and boring. I tossed aside Glamorama half way through, unable to find a reason to keep reading. This time, I picked up Amr Psycho because of the movie coming out...but one quarter of the way through, I've started skimming. I read Less than Zero years ago and enjoyed it, it captured the times well. Sadly, it seems that the author hasn't matured as a person or as a writer since that debut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived","review":"Too repetitious, too contrived, too ridiculous. Want an easy summary? torture, the foulest and bloodiest of misogynistic murders, Armani, Dorsia, Les Miserables. Repeat this 399 times and you have the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deep Sixed","review":"For the first time in my reading career (and I have done a lot of reading) I not only didn't finish the book but deposited it in the wastebasket. I am not a prude but the sex really turned me off. Having been in the Marine Corps, I have seen my share of mayhem and carnage but enough was enough. I know we live in a violent era but when haven't we. I also became bored with the countless description of clothes and their manufacturers. I might just as well as have read a Sears catalog, men's section.However, I did admire the author's writing style and his depiction of the Yuppie way of life even though it did seem over blown at times.Can I recommend this book? I don't really know because I did not complete the book. But if you want to see the inside of cultural depravity give it a try. I'll even send you my copy free of charge. (U.S. only< please).I do have one question. What was the symbolism of Les Miserables?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I want these hours of my life back.","review":"This \\"novel\\" is utterly dull and poorly written. I could write this garbage. There is no finesse, just the same, boring ideas regurgitated over and over. If you seriously think this is satire, you clearly don't know what that means. This is a sexual violence thriller. But if you hate women and hate original writers, you'll probably love this."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the few exceptions to the book vs. movie argument","review":"I read this thinking it was an interesting idea. It was, but after about 30 pages, it seemed to just start over. Sure it got more graphic and gory but it seemed to be gore for the sake of gore. The point of it all seems to get lost in the effort to be shocking.It's like a cheap horror film that tries harder to show you buckets of blood rather than scare you.The movie actually seemed to do a much better job of the whole idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"American Psycho","review":"I bought this book on implulse while browsing for something interesting to read. I will be less implusive in the future. I will sum it up in one word: disappointing. The author has an obvious amazing talent for writing, but he does a marginal job in exploring his characters. Norman Mailer called his writing Dostoyevskian, which gives the author far more credit than he deserves. The murder scenes are brutal but lack any kind of impact. It becomes boring to read.I fail to see what all the controversy is about. This could have been a magnificent book but never makes it past the superficial, despite all the detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Needless Examination","review":"As I read this, what, nine years ago now, I remember just shaking my head. I was 18 and the book seemed interesting, well, I was wrong. I keep each of the books that I read and when the movie was released I glanced back at my copy and still I wondered what the point of its writing was. Was Ellis just beating the hell of of his typewriter/computer keyboard to get out his aggression, kill the computer instead of a person (from his fine descriptions in the book you could figure that he would choose to kill a female, but more than likely he isn't capable of such acts, so he spews them forth into hack novels.) It is interesting to see the almost straight divide between people who liked/loved the book and those who hated it. This book has no redeeming value, it is trash. I consider reading it one of my mistakes of youth."},{"rating":"1","title":"hated it","review":"This book is a total waste of time and money. I found it to be a horrible account of a sick life. I certainly would hate for a young person to read it. Disgusted and will not read any other books by this author in the future. I hope the publisher reconsiders printing this type of novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Travis, Rhinehart rolled into one cute son","review":"Forget 'the book that examines the power of money and wealth', but read it as a serious work of literature about pure evil hate. The centre of humanity is cruelty. At least this book is honest about it. Who needs morality?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely revolting.","review":"The chapter about the rat, must be the most appauling thing I have ever read. I barley managed to eat after that. Where does the author come up whith theese hiddious stories? I strongley recommend this book to people with a liking for horror and blood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for the open minded reader","review":"Ellis holds back nothing in a chilling character sketch of a serial killer's thoughts. This book needs not to be reviewed on account of gore but rather from a perspective of how someone really dimented thinks and acts."},{"rating":"1","title":"a guidebook for would-be serial killers...no thank-you!","review":"One very good reason not to read this book. A mass-murderer named Paul Bernardo kept this book on his bedstand and alledgedly thought the actions of the books \\"hero\\" were so cool and glamorous that he thought he'd like to do the same...and he did. I'm not saying that this book is the reason why these brutal murders occured, I'm just saying that they gave an already sick individual more ideas. If you do read this book, please remember that torture, rape and murder are not glamorous, or interesting, or entertaining...these things really happen and they are just plain wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly Awful","review":"Even though I am an avid fan of books about serial killers, I felt this was the worst book I've ever read. I mean, I rarely, if ever, get disgusted by violence, be it in movies or books, but I wasn't only disgusted by this book, I was repulsed. And even if the book didn't have such graphic violence, it still would just plane suck. It has no plot whatsoever. It's just basicaly page after page of some yuppie brutaly butchering people to death. This book was merely written for one purpose: To shock , because the author knew that that would help sell the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible.","review":"If Ellis is commenting on the lowliness of our society, he couldn't have done a better job at contributing to it. I wanted to throw-up reading this book. Shock is cheap. Reject violence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forced myself to finish.","review":"This is perhaps the most blatantly irresponsible book I have ever read. Horrific details of rape and murder are nothing more than a conceited (and unsuccesful) attempt to pass as something profound. My sole reason for having completed it was over a strange sort of pride at not letting myself be 'defeated'by it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Brutal","review":"I could barely read the first few chapters without being bored to tears. All a welter of designer names, Wall Street yuppie \\"culture\\", and what the discriminating psycho wears, hangs on his walls, decorates his apartment with... boring enough. And then! details of appalling rape, murder, and brutality (all, however done tastefully with the correct designer accesories). The crimes committed have no suspense, no element of tension. The reader just knows what is coming... horrific violience. I gave this book 1 star because I wasn't given the option of zero stars, or even \\"negative\\" stars. I guess I would truly rate it at \\"minus\\" five stars, and \\"minus\\" the 13 bucks I forked over to read this."},{"rating":"1","title":"...and they're making a movie out of this?","review":"Must have originally been titled 'American Psycho Babble' but I guess they ran out of room on the cover. Instead of an excursion through terror, the reader gets a window shopping tour of Rodeo Drive boutiques. What a bore this book was. Ellis must be laughing all the way to the bank. No structure or plot, the reader is left with sporadic gruesome scenes inserted strictly for shock value. If the book closed with '....and the world ended.' no one would miss any of the characters. This book should have been released directly to the 'free' shelf of a used bookstore. Frankly, it heads my list of 50 worst books of the century."},{"rating":"1","title":"self-centred, indulgent drivel","review":"This book is merely a headline book, Get a couple of gory scenes and people will want to read it. I must say i have respect for his targeting of the market, the author has obviously made a name for himself.This book is very hollow, if i wanted to read about how a man grooms himself i would have bought a magazine. And if i wanted to read about the entire works of Genesis I would have bought a discography. The viewpoints of the character were childlike, and the fashion tips a monotony. The killing scenes were chaotic and mindless, just an effort to get to the lowest possible level to create the largest possible shock. Show less pal, its more scary !!I do see what the author was trying to represent in terms of the 2 sides of human nature, but to show little reason and no subtlety was an insult to the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting!","review":"This has got to be one of the most horrible books ever written. It's supposed to be a book about a psychopath, and I have to admit that the murder scenes are chillingly real. The only thing that Ellis proved to me with this is that he knows his designers and that there is something seriously wrong with the way his mind works."},{"rating":"1","title":"a tragic waste of money","review":"What starts off as a very clever and vivid story quickly turns into a gut-wrenching and blood-soaked mess. If there was a point to the last 3/4 of the story...I missed it. I was so disgusted and mortified at Ellis' character (Bateman) that I couldn't even finish this book. I can appreciate Ellis' vivid imagination, however, this book still wound up in my garbage can. I was very dissapointed with this piece of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Satire Ever","review":"Its simple. This is the best satire ever. Don't take it seriously, or you might get offended (actually, its guaranteed)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read for yourself","review":"Turn your computer off. Stop reading customer reviews. They are every bit as vacuous as the passing fashions enumerated in American Psycho."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack the Ripper has met his match","review":"An absolute gem of a book, I could not put it down. Its the type of book that says F**k off to what literature 'should' be about. It goes its own way and is gathering fans by the truckload. A true classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive, Don't read this over lunch!!!","review":"The ease at which one reads through this hugely gritty book is alarming, on several occasions my stomach couldn't handle the gruesome details. A great piece of work and an indept look into the truly unbalanced mind of a psychopath."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant depiction of a decade","review":"I believe the book is a brilliant depiction of the 80s and its materialism. The violence was not out of the contest: the more violent Patrick began, the more indifferent the society seems. Through it the writter wants to hit at the heart of a society and a system of value that reward greed and ambition, money and social status over any other value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superbly written. A true masterpiece.","review":"Never before have I read a book that is written so well. Ellis forces us to enter a world of Patrick Bateman. I was able to understand Patrick. His emotions and feelings although cruel and cold, are obvious to the reader. The language is so sophisticated, it is hard to fathom what Patrick actually enjoys doing.I just finished reading the book and have seen the movie several times. The book makes the movie (even the unrated version), seem to be G rated.I cannot give enough praise to this book. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book ever","review":"I have never ever read a book that fascinated me the way \\" American Psycho\\" did, maybe because there simply is no other book like AP. I am probably one of the younger readers, I'm 17, but I always had the urge to read this book because there was so much controversy about it. I have to admitt there were moments when I was disgusted by what I read and thought I couldn't go on but I could, those digusting scenes are necessary to gain a deeper view of the inside of Patrick Bateman. I have just finished reading AP and I don't know what to read now because there won't ever be a book that good, so I might just read it again. American Psycho shows us a world that we wish to ignore, it is a masterpiece, it is ironically funny, it is full of black humor and label poetry. You just have to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"ooooohhhhhh...........","review":"Wow what a read.....Its a bit slow to start off with but once you have the jist of the story, and he starts off his gruesome killings then its a fab read...not to be read if you are on your own!!!! I think the film probably is one for the real horror lovers!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"intensity level 190%, sheer genius !","review":"Patrick Bateman is without a shadow of doubt THE embodiment of Homo Futuris, Brett E Ellis has again outdone himself and presented us with the real life image of a world spinning madly out of control and the creatures that inhabit it's concrete jungles... all and everyone of them ! If you thought Less than Zero meant something, be prepared to have your world ROCKED and shaken on it's foundations by this throathgrabbing - high impulse read that will leave you panting and craving for more !

MY ALL TIME FAVORITE!!!!!","review":"I would defy any intelligent quasi eccentric,competitive, egotistical, paranoid, hyper, passionate,humourous urban dwelling big city professional to not be able to relate to Bateman's mind and thoughts. He exists in everyone on of us fitting the above description. The only difference being we don't execute our vile fantasies hidden in the subconcious into actions......and if you did understand the book...neither did Bateman. If anyone has any similar books for me, I WOULD LOVE TO READ EM... Sam Ahmed (sahmed@lehman.com)"},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the time or effort","review":"I read this book because of a discussion in a media class about the uproar it caused when it was published. I was extremely disappointed. The violence and sex did not bother me in the least (I'm a Jack Ketchum devotee - I've read worse) but the poor writing style, vapid characters and rambling plot made this a torturous read at best. If you want shock, find a copy of Jack Ketchum's \\"Ladies Night\\" from Silver Salamander press - \\"American Psycho\\" isn't worth the energy it requires to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, atrocious, and no point","review":"I bought this book to see what all the hype was about. I should have saved my money. This was the most disgusting, vile book I have ever read. People often wonder where children get there ideas to blow up schools and murder their peers. Material like this that falls into the wrong hands can do damage. I am a firm beliver in free speech, but when something like this is out to the general public I can't help but wonder who is reading this book and who will want to be just like the subject of the book. People don't like to blame the media, in reality media has alot to do with the acceptance of violence. Read this with caution, and parents be aware what your children view and read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalling and grotesque","review":"This book attracted me beacuse of some of the snippets of reviews printed on the back cover. Boy, did I get a shock. It is the only book I've ever read that I don't want to keep, or ever open again. To my mind there is no story, few characters are drawn convincingly and it is full of unmitigated horror which seeps out after pages of boring descriptions of the fashion statements of yuppies. I think this is a sick book and it should have a serious warning on it that it is unsuitable for younger readers and only fit for those with a penchant for brutal horror. I shouldn't have bought it and I am sad to say I am going to bin it, something I never thought I would do to a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly written","review":"This is the most horribly written book I have ever read. Most of the story is filled with tedious descriptions of yuppie accouterments. Two entire chapters are devoted to the narrator's critique of music. I don't care! The author does not seem to have given this work a re-read. For instance, in one episode he describes a hot summer day in New York City. The narrator is running around with a woman, trying the keep cool in the miserable heat before he kills her in an apartment. Later the same evening, he is in a cab with his friends and everyone is dressed for winter weather. The season changes in one day. In another episode, he describes the tie he is wearing, but removes a completely different tie, described in exasperating detail, on the same page. Apparently this writer does not read his own detailed descriptions. Doesn't anyone edit books anymore?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and juvenile","review":"The none-too-subtle 'point' is made by about page two. Stop there and save yourself the bother. As with so much modern art, the trite message cannot disguise the lack of craft or passion. Interesting to note that the people who give this book '1' are generally literate and can spell, whereas those who give it '10' are clearly not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tests the limits of bad","review":"You know what the real tragedy is?

This story has no real plot, no character development, no point. A very shallow book with pointless interludes. It justifies what the Nazis' burning of books. The one high point in the book is a scene in which the protagonist goes to a U2 concert. This book is just really bad"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm burning it.","review":"this book is a f***ing joke. i'm kind of sick, but this is just really .... i almost threw up.i liked rules of attraction (before i knew he wrote this) and i think i'll shred it now.

If something is excessively gory & violent, it is making some sort of statement about life. Utter rubbish. This book was horrible from start to beginning. To \\"shock\\" the audience, he stabs a child. This book is utterly pointless. Read at your own peril."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Load of Sh..","review":"Brett Easton Ellis reminds me of that kid who would torture animals and set fires in the schoolyard. Indeed, the quality of his prose in this novel reminds one of the writings of a disturbed 10 year old child. The less-than-pulp depictions of violence leave one with either an upset stomach or in my case an egregious insult to my intelligence. The graphic sexual violence makes Penthouse Forum look like Anais Nin. Add in the narrator's irrelevent and annoying music criticism and you have one of the worst novels of the past decade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliantly wicked attack on our material society","review":"In \\"American Psycho\\", Bret Easton Ellis makes a no-holds-barred attack on the opinions and attitudes which are the very basis of this commercial society we live in. The main character, Patrick Bateman, is indeed a \\"psycho\\", and we can do nothing but loathe this evil creature - for the banal detail of his narrative, if nothing else... but as we come to hate this character, we come to despise everything he stands for - and what he stands for, in essence, is materialism and the quest for money. One of the best works of social commentary it has ever been my joy to read, and the best you will find too - if you can stomach it.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just got it...","review":"I just got this book that everyone is talking about. I heard a lot about it, and as soon as I heard the ban was lifted in Canada on it, I rushed out and picked it up. I except this book to be very good. Ive read the first two settings, and I admit, its a bit slow and is very detailed (ie. What people are wearing and who their colthes were made by.) But still, I have more good reviews of this book then bad reviews, so I think I will like it. I just cant wait until the movie comes out. If anyone would like to discuss this further, please email me."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE MOST FOCUSED, RAW, AND HARDCORE VISION OF THE FUTURE.","review":"Although this book is not intended for everyone, the depth of the character developement, and the authors focused concentration into the depths of demensia is as raw, and untamed as they come. The book is a detailed description of the 80's, as well as the future. Congrats to Ellis for his beautiful depiction of the modern existencialist. UNCOMPRIMISING, NAKED, TRUTH OF VISION."},{"rating":"1","title":"After the initial shock it basically sucks.","review":"The title of the book pretty much says it all, but after you get past the morbidly fascinating gore this really isn't a great novel. It's very repetitive, and doesn't really provide much insight into why the title character does the things he does. And, every time you think you've arrived at a plot twist you end up disappointed. I credit the author with being able to transport the reader into a psychopath's mind, but what are we supposed to do once we're in there? You might as well quit reading after you get to the first murder, because everything after that is just more of the same. Murder, murder, murder, okay we get the point. Now I know why the author made it so bloody - because it's so damn boring! I kept waiting for some kind of startling revelation about the nature of man, or at least an interesting conclusion. But, as the author states in the last line of his book, \\"this is not an exit.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Like an updated version of Norman Mailer American Dream","review":"Like an updated version of Norman Mailer American Dream in a modern style, this book delivers like a AK-47.

It bored me to tears. Especially, the fact that the author was incessantly dropping names, whether it be, fashion designers, trendy restaurants, expensive health clubs, etc... OK, so we know that is what yuppies do but do you have to beat the dead horse? I have to say, the author style of writing is also not very easy to read, or it could be that it is not to my liking.

I was incredibly disappointed. The book contains nothing of substance (especially philosophical substance) but filth and carnage. If you want to have an accurate depiction of psychopathy, forget fiction - go pick up Robert Hare's Without Conscience or Hervey Cleckley's classic, Mask of Sanity. And as for a reviewer's earlier association between Fight Club and American Psycho - you can't compare the two. Fight Club isn't about regaining manhood and neither is American Psycho. Fight Club is about the postmodern generation unable to be emotionally satiated by today's overwhelming dosage of feigned and simulated sentiments.

I plan to throw this book in the garbage and never again read a book by bret easton ellis(he doesn't deserve capital letters for his name.) Some have called this book satirical and hilarious. All I can say to them is I hope nothing like this ever happens to a woman you love. If it does, you can remember this book you loved so much and laugh at the funeral (if they find the body).

It took me sometime to adapt myself to the story, people, location but once you start to use your imagination and visualize the places, then there is no way to close the book and continue your routine life. Some scenes were disgusting, some were funny, some ironic... but at the end it took me a day to finish the book and as one of the reviewers say \\"I do not know what to read after reading such a good fiction\\".... I must admit that I wanted Bateman to be arrested at the end but ...... I would suggest this book to lovers of adventure, horror, murder and pyschological stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my.....","review":"Bret Easton Ellis truly wants us to believe that all the decadence of the 80's is horrible. So horrible that a crazed psychopath can hide behind it and get away with grotesque murder after grotesque murder? I really don't think so. I'm not a jaded reader or anything, its just that when someone tries so hard to tell us how bad all this consumerism is. But I think if someone looked into the life of Bret Easton Ellis they would see that the monetary success he has gained from his books probably allowed him to buy many of the possessions listed in the book. I just don't think that people should condemn with one hand and practice with the other. Bad analogy.

I can not believe there are actually people that can read or write this terrible material.

I first learned about \\"AP\\" by reading a True Crime classic, \\"Lethal Marriage\\" by Nick Pron. Paul Bernardo, the killer of that book, loved \\"AP\\". What a recommendation! Perhaps I was turned off by a work of fiction. As a native New Yorker, I was definitely turned off by the completely unbelieveable scenes and description of the City. We do NOT live this way! With so many superior works of true to life, cold blooded sickos available with the click of one's mouse, why waste time reading about sickos who never existed? Those who have read this far and are unfamiliar with \\"Lethal Marriage\\" should [check it out]. There is a reason why authors like Ann Rule are popular and \\"AP\\" is a perfect demonstration. Truth is indeed stanger than fiction-and it makes better reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad plot, bad prose, just all around bad","review":"I hate the fact that I've had to read this book twice for various classes, yet other truely talented contemporary authors are ignored.

The violence wasn't clever only gratuitous. The satire whilst trying to show a materialistic society succeeded in nothing but making me very bored. Clothes, violence, grooming, and butchering women. Need i say more My advice ..DONT BOTHER"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Cares?","review":"I'm about 1/3 of the way through this thing. I'd be done by now if it weren't for the incessant fashion descriptions favored by Ellis. These really get old after the first few pages. WHO CARES about Bateman's A. Testoni loafers? Get to the point! I suppose that I'll finish the book just to see what happens, but I can't recommend that anyone else waste time with it. In contrast to the reviews on the back cover, this book is neither important nor seminal.OK -- I finally finished it -- after which I threw it in the trash. (I couldn't even consider using the recycle bin.) This had nothing to do with the subject material -- it's just SO poorly written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Stuff","review":"This is not a good book. There are some things you don't want inside your head, and most of them are in American Psycho. There are scenes in this book that are gauranteed to have an emetic effect on the reader. Don't misunderstand me; freedom of speech is a principal I have built my life on, I value the First Amendment as much as the next wishy-washy liberal. But when \\"art\\" sinks to the levels of depravity found in this book, well, priorities have to be reevaluated. Mr. Ellis is an extremely limited writer; all his books are identical in style, mood and tone. He has no imagination except for horrific violence. Don't read this book. It may be a satire, but then so is Catch-22. Heller knew what he was doing. Ellis hasn't a clue."},{"rating":"1","title":"stupid, stupid, stupid","review":"If I could rate this book a negative, I would do so. Ellis is highly over-rated, this book is worse than his first attempt at writing (Less Than Zero, a phrophetic attempt to rate this book?). If this is his view of the 80's and the \\"me\\" generation, he is way off the mark. I suggest he open his eyes to reality, or else try his hand at writing comic books, which are supposed to be unbelievable"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book does not contain a single original idea","review":"This book is almost completely worthless. It's a completely transparent publicity ploy, and the protagonist, a psychosexual serial killer (I am getting REALLY sick of reading about, hearing about, and being repeatedly required to be interested in) these people. I have heard the whole bit about the shallow, materialistic '80s urbanites so many times, and having lived through it, the truth is way more complex, way more human. This book is just stupid. It's like reading what the Jenny Jones show would contain if there were no censors whatsoever. I just can't get behind the \\"meaning\\" of repetitive depictions of the rape and dismemberment of women, followed by shopping sprees. Give me a break. It's about as interesting as watching paint dry, and about as \\"meaningful.&quot"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who told this man he could write?","review":"...I felt dirty after I read this book, not (only) because of the graphic violence ..., but because I had to wade through stream-of-conciousness tripe to get to the interesting bits (the character's loss of self and general anonymity). It could have been a good book. But Bret Easton Ellis wrote it. If I had remembered that he is also the one who wrote \\"Less Than Zero\\", I never would have purchased or read it.This is one of the few times I have thought a movie to be better than the book it was based on. I was engrossed by the movie ... and its theme. I was angry at Ellis the whole time I read the book.

The book started off well and good, it actually had me for more than half of it. But it seems that Ellis gets bored and decides the best way to juice this puppy up is to dive into absolute...forget it. To give this any more consideration just feeds the fire. Its just plain awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"The twisted creation of a no-talent hack.","review":"This \\"book\\" was recommended to me by an apparently misguided friend. Through the first several pages, it held my interest, as the reader gets shadows of the evil behind the main character; it's a little bit suspenseful. However, after about 100 pages, I was bored out of my mind. It is monotonous to an amazing degree, and it is obvious that Ellis could not find a good way to express himself. The main character darts back and forth between night clubs, his apartment, and Wall Street, meeting seedy friends the whole time, and checking out women. It goes on and on for pages until the main character actually starts torturing people. If this book is a critique of the pursuit of money and 80's night life, then why the torture scenes? The author is trying to appeal to those of us who enjoy reading that sort of thing. Overall, the book is a lousy way of conveying an interesting message. I don't care if you are as rich as Patrick Bateman, AVOID THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"This is the worst book I have ever read.

I came to it with a lot of prejudices and I had to accept that it really shocked me. Those deeply disturbing descriptions of rape and murders were hard to forget. Looking back I think that it made a landmark in contemporary literature, changing in many ways our thoughts about what was modern writing. The YUPPIE side is, I think, perfectly exposed and matched with teh PSYCHO side. In the other hand I was bothered by the insistence of Breaton Ellis in showing the \\"emptyness\\" of Patrick (and the Yuppies) putting words like \\"I'm empty, I has nothing inside\\" in his own mouth. That was too explicit. A big mistake caused, perhaps, in the lack of confidence of the author in his readers' inteligence to get the point.

Whereas Ellis's Psycho goes one step further than Jarvis's E-Male - he actually KILLS PEOPLE he doesn't like! - both young men seem obsessed by the exact same fascinations: pornography, sex, clothes, designer drugs, hip clubs and their status with respect to their peers. What is it with young men today, hey? Would like to recommend some Irvine Welsh to anyone who's read both these books and Don DeLillo's \\"Americana\\" to anyone who loved Psycho. Just my thoughts!

In the ensuing years, I've asked myself why I stayed. This is the same question I'll be asking myself about this book. Parts of the book were intriguing--if incredibly annoying--(e.g., Bateman's obsession with detail) but much was unbelievable (even in NYC one would be hard pressed to continually torture and murder in one's own apt without the slightest raised eyebrow from neighbors), thus reducing the story's credibility. In the end, I can't figure out why I \\"stayed\\". I suppose this will remain a mystery much as the \\"The Cook\\" has. I wouldn't recommend it.

A book that disgusted me to the point of not recomending it because of its violence. I'm a 23 year old kid who grew up around all this media violence and consider myself pretty desensitized to all of it, especially in terms of books. I'm a believer that violence can have a point(fight club) but it just doesn't have a point here. This is sex and gore for the sake of controversy alone. Free publicity was the motivation, it had to be, because nowhere in the 400 page novel does a plot ever get started it just goes on and on about what his friends are wearing, the girls he has sex with, and why and how he kills them. murder, violence, sex, all can add up to an intriguing story, but Ellis is more concerned with giving us graphic details of sex positions and killing sprees then he is with giving us a reason to keep reading. There's better books out there, (Basic Eight, Virgin Suicides) don't waste your time here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very demented read","review":"This is the first book review I've ever written, and I've read hundreds of books.

That is why I read it; I'm not making that up. Not a fan of censorship, but let's just say that I understand. What would otherwise be a provocative social commentary is really just a gore/rage/mysogyny fest that left me: (1) nauseated, (2) freaked out, (3) wondering what all the fuss was about. I mean, Ellis is quite obviously a decent writer, and had some purpose for writing this book. I think the same theme/purpose could have been achieved without being so cavalierly mysogynist, violent, and just plain yucky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Litmus Test","review":"Very simply, this book is a litmus test for would-be reviewers. If you give it a good review, you should be fired. Period. This book was published to universally negative acclaim in 1991, and the reviewers had it right the first time. If one truly wanted to create the ultimate weapon in the war or terror, simply translate \\"American Psycho\\" into whatever language is spoken by your terrorist suspect, and pump it into their room at full volume. In less than a week, they'll crack. The parts that are not stomach-churningly violent are mind-numbingly boring, and it takes nearly a third of the book to get to the horrible bits.If you really want to punish an ex of yours, buy them a copy of this book. They'll never stop cursing your name."},{"rating":"1","title":"American Psycho","review":"I knew the premise of the book before reading, so the gore didn't exactly come as a surprise. I was prepared to be disgusted by the violence but no one prepared me for the mind-numbing, pages-long descriptions of what everyone in the room was wearing - the color, brand, quality of fabric, blah blah blah. I get that this obsessiveness serves as insight into the unhinged mind of Patrick Bateman, but my god, is it endlessly boring.I will grant the business card scene is fantastic, although it is not enough to make up for the crapfest this book is."},{"rating":"1","title":"A shorter novel would have sufficed","review":"I find it hard to join the group of people who consider this Ellis' best novel; not that I am an Ellis expert but this would not be anybody's best effort. At first I found the book to be expert satire about the go-go 80's, but as the book went on, I grew weary of the endless clothing descriptions, the graphic sex and the just as graphic violence. I got the point early on in the novel, and frankly as the book goes on and the clothing descriptions do not end, it starts to show a lack of imagination. I never thought it would be possible to be so bored by a book with such a premise, but I did. Strictly for hardcore (no pun intended) fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"did you miss the point?","review":"I have to wonder about those who gave this book a poor review. Bret Easton Ellis is a very good writer and I think American Psycho is a perfect example of his talent. Ellis has almost perfect attention to detail in almost every scene. He writes the feelings of his characters and even their personalities so well that you almost feel like you know the person when he mentions them. He not only captures the mood of the characters, but of a specific decade in a specific city that we all know very well.American Psycho may be violent at times but each scene is written and only exists for the specific purpose of defining the mentality of the wall street culture and maybe not what they did, but what they were capable of getting away with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Struggled to finish it.","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book. I was expecting a thought provoking commentary about society. What I got was a painful, repetitious description of the characters' wardrobes, a cast of characters so unremarkable I had a hard time telling them apart (maybe that was the point?) and entire chapters dedicated to music reviews. I forced myself to finish it waiting for the epiphany that never came. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good, creepy read!","review":"Let's just say, awesome (if you like the horror genre). A few times I had to re-read and ask myself, \\"Seriously?

In this case I found the book to be a little tedius and quite explicit, at times. I like to consider myself just as decensitized to violence as any North American in the 21st century, but the amount of gruesome detail Mr. Ellis goes into, is too much for my tastes.2.5 STARS"},{"rating":"2","title":"Irresponsible to Ignore","review":"American Psycho is surely one of the single most vile reading experiences available. The descriptions of Patrick Bateman's atrocities to both the human body and the human soul are unrelenting and impossible to turn away from. This is not due soley to the shockingly graphic violence, but also to the methodical indifference in which it is all related to the reader. How completely appauling it is when the realization one's life is about to end in the most horrific fashion imaginable can be related matter-of-factly by a character who simply cannot bring himself to care. Like Last Year's Fight Club, American Psycho shows its readers a sad world who's central character discovers that even the most extreme experience cannot allow him to feel through the numbness he's helped to cultivate in and around himself. Ellis' novel is as impossible to enjoy as it is to condemn as mere exploitation. It is a bold and important work."},{"rating":"2","title":"You know this world; you're almost living in it.","review":"This novel is nothing short of a masterpiece. It starts off with a strong, powerful voice and a twisted point of view that hooks the reader in, and it doesn't disappoint after that. The story follows a man's journey (not descent, not even a journey.... more of a stroll) with complete and utter madness. The book is quite unsettling at times (I was almost sick at one point, so the squeamish should stay away), but this just shows its power. If something you know to be only a story has that kind of control over you, it is something to be respected. Elis creates a character you could never sympathize with but still want to read about, and places him in a world that is so like and unlike our world that it's scary. Read this book. You will not regret or forget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Psycho is an American classic","review":"I rarely read stories involving serial killers anymore. The idea of having to stomach pages of carnage without a shred of illumination only sends me into a downward spiral of human hopelessness.Contrary-wise, this book, as dark as it is, completely engrossed me from page one to finish.American Psycho captures the soul of a serial killer as he tries to understand himself. And that soul is clearly bared in these pages in simple straightforward sentences, too clearly maybe for a society that craves deception so badly that it -we- elect officials to do the lying for us.No way can this book be represented in a movie. No way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book should come with tranquilizers (in an Hermes pill box)","review":"This book, though disturbing, was an incredible roller coaster ride. I finished it one sitting - unbelievable. However, clearly not for everyone. If you do not know the difference between Lithium and Valium or Ferragamo and Fendi, you may find this incredibly tedious. (Every other commentator has mentioned the violence so I will not beat a dead horse here - please excuse the pun!)I hate to say that I found it riveting. However, I agree with an earlier commentator - did the murder of Paul Owens really happen? There really should be groups gathering for discussion (naturally there would be a dress code!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO MUCH","review":"This book utterly disgusted me, i read it several years ago but the memory of it has stuck with me. The reason i read it was because it is a well known book and i wanted to see what the fuss was about I actually only managed to read 3/4 of it before i had enough, i was so disgusted by it i actually ripped it up. Whenever i see the book now i have to hold myself back from doing the same thing. A totally materially obssessed person, sickenly sexually perversive/abusive and uncontrollably violent. A book of lists of expensive items (yawn)- who cares?

I have a real problem when people try and blame things like this book, video games, TV, and anything else they can think of for the real world problems with violence. Some of these people should realize that any normal person would be able to tell the differance between fiction and reality. With that said, the book is great. It tells a sad tale of fictional reality that is absoulutly enticing. True it is extremely violent in some places, but I have seen worse on the 5 oclock news. Many times i found myself becoming part of the book. Part of the appeal of this book is the fact that it has caused so much contreversy. In my humble opinion, if you want to stop the violence in reality, stop making a big deal about fictional violence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poorly Written","review":"This is without a doubt the worse novel I have ever read. The storyline is comical at best. The characters are not developed at all. There is no plot what-so-ever. To top it all off, the distinction between illusion and reality is never addressed. This unfortunantly could have been the saving grace of the novel. After viewing the movie, which is identical to the book, I've concluded that both are nothing more than a waste of space and time. The plot of the movie, similiar to that of the novel, is comical. The characters are not developed. The distinction between Patrick Bateman's illusions and his reality are non-existant. After watching the movie, I've concluded that the movie is far worse than the book. I gave the book 1 star, only because this was the lowest rating available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"Sure it's skillfully written and fairly witty, but like the film \\"Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer\\", you find yourself asking, \\"Why would anyone want to involve themselves with a project so concerned with debasement and inflicting pain?\\" No narrative arc to speak of, so this psycho never learns anything, and neither does the reader. A mere wallowing in scenes where the narrator takes extreme joy in knifing a toddler at the zoo, or torturing girls with coat hangers.

But after a few back and forths from Bateman, yuppie stockbroker to Bateman, hero-psycho-killer and I was not only ready to lose my lunch but I was monumentally bored at the flat one-dimensional feel of this story.It takes more than an ability to blithely describe murderous scenes of rape, decapitation, and gore to make a novel compelling.

He hasn't!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive and boring","review":"This is one of the most disappointing reads I have come accross for a long time. The author presents fashion, food, sex and death or injury as the interests of his main characters and repeats himself time and again.

There are entire sections that are lifted word-for-word from some of Ellis' other works. The \\"gross\\" parts are disgusting for disgusting's sake, and nothing more. The book is a farce of literature, and anyone that actually enjoys this book needs to go back to high school and re-learn what seperates a good book from toilet paper.

I really like the way Ellis evokes the banality of the central character's life. His brain is like a sharks's. It exists to home in on certain targets (haute couture, victims), and has no other function. A great book.

Ellis gives us a microcosm where human nature is placed under an intensely demolishing critical light. The stream-of-consciousness writing is original and refreshing. Even though some sections may seem offensive and pointlessly grotesque, the theme and purpose of the piece is presented clearly and effectively. I loved it, best book I've read this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the Faint Hearted","review":"The book was at times extremley gorry. Several scenes went from one extreme to the other - from hardcore porn to some of the most horrifying violence I have ever encountered.

It is well written and did keep my interest peaked - I finished it in one day, however, this is definitley not one for younger readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book to Suffer Through","review":"This is not an easy book to read. Not only in terms of the gore and depravity, but reading through the pages upon pages of descriptions of clothing brand names and product lines from the time make this tedious in places. But, it is as important to the story as it is tedious. It is important to the story, to show how shallow all these character's lives are that they worry about things like this so much, that they can ramble for pages about inconsequential bands, that they drop names left and right and not always correctly, and that the restaurant reservation is the most important status symbol. I think this needs to be viewed as a complete work, that it should not be disected too far, as I feel its elements rely on each other for life, that if you strip them from each other they will die.Definitely not for the faint of heart or weak of constitution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Book","review":"I picked this book after i read an article on Ellis in Rolling Stone. It peaked my interest, and I have to say I honestly had no idea what I was in for. It was the first book that I ever thought about giving up on merely because of its content, I am sure glad I didnt. Make no mistake, if you dont handle gore very well dont even bother, but if you can appreciate a well written intelligent book, buy it. Patrick Bateman is one of the most interesting characters I have come across. He's shallow, materialistic, as vain as they come, and at the same time he can be quite humorous. This is the first book I have actually felt guilty for enjoying, but I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"American Psycho equates to American Trash","review":"The review title says it all. This book blows. The only thing worse than this book is it's movie adaptation. Save your money and buy something worth while like ear wax, a pocket lint collection, or maybe even navel fuzz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impactante,fr��o,muy duro,.....EXCELENTE.","review":"Cruel definici��n de la sociedad clasista norteamericana.Donde el dinero,las \\"marcas\\",y el poder es lo ��nico que importa. Adem��s el sadismo descrito en los cr��menes de Bateman es inigualable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I was mocked when I told a couple of my coworkers that I hadn't seen the movie American Psycho. I found out there was a book so I decided to endure that first. Keyword, endure. Violence is naturally expected due to the title. In my opinion, 85% of the book is comedy. The other 15% is the meaningless violence. When the main character isn't eating his rape victims he's raving about music. In my honest opinion I think if I expected to read a comedy and not a so-called thriller then this review would have turned out a lot differently. Oh and by the way, I am not a fan of the movie either. For what it's worth, Christian Bale did play the hell out of the character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review on American Psycho","review":"Honestly, I was very disappointed in this book. I read it when it first came out years ago and it has now been revised to nothing more than porn. Very disappointing - Im sorry I wasted my money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"ridiculous","review":"Bret is just trying to shock people with American Psycho, IMO. His descriptions of the killings are extremely exagerrated and ovedone, but yeah, they're really sick and twisted and hard to read without getting a bad feeling in your stomach. The entire book consists of that, and the mentions of music and designer labels is way too redundant. This is not even worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes me think twice about the death penalty","review":"I give author Ellis 1 star for fashion tips, and another star for his ability to use language skillfully. However, when I read a novel I try to appreciate the intent, skill, dialog, and PLOT. I finished this book and took a shower to clean the misogny from my memory. The main character spends his time spiraling into the disintegration of a personality that mirrors the crash and burn of American society. Ellis' lengthy descriptions of sex, gore and body parts fills me with loathing that I am actually reading this, especially the brutality against women and their fascinating and disposable sexual organs. I find myself skipping over redundant gore. It finally occurs to me that by drawing this reader to the end, Ellis makes me a partner in his literary degradation. At least I only wasted my money; Ellis has plundered his own talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled by hype","review":"A juvenial attempt at grossing the audience out. Here's a tip for the author, readers enjoy a good STORY! Do we really need a description of the sound a brain makes as it separates from the skull? Aparently we do when the actual story itself is so weak. This reads as if it was written by a teenage boy raised on Beavis and Butthead. I can imagine Ellis at his typewritter as he finishes yet another drawn out description of sex and murder: \\"heh, heh, that was cool!\\" Grow up Bret and keep your demented fantasies to yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat out, the worst book I have ever read","review":"I am not sure if it is the writing style or the content that places this book at the bottom of my reading experiences. It is a rare book that makes you feel cheated for having spent the time to suffer through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing, Disgusting, Disgraceful","review":"If the author's intent was to tell a revolting tale about a character with absolutely no redeeming qualities, then this book is a triumphant achievement. It's sad that someone with Ellis's talent would resort to cheap and vile gimmicks to create a work that is more controversial than it is significant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pornography for psychotics.","review":"O.K., social commentary, blah-blah-blah. We know all of this already. Truth is, the experience of this book is exactly like having a warm handful of blood and hair thrown in your face. American Psycho seems to represent a new modality that is becoming evident in all forms of media--shock fiction, porno for psycho's. This book has some sick cathartic value, but hey, so does Jerry Springer. For my money, this work has all the art of a car accident--but I bet it still sells like crazy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most shocking novel I've ever read","review":"To anyone who is contemplating reading this novel don't wait, read it right away. This was engrossing, disgusting, hilarious and almost a little too relatable, scary. I loved it, Ellis should write another novel soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't dismiss the musical references","review":"A great book, but dismissal of the music references, as in other reviews here, seems odd to me. I found Bateman's love of Huey Lewis, Genesis etc, almost as shocking as his violence - an excellent illustration of total ignorance of popular culture and an important element of his psychosis."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for those interested in the human (and inhuman)","review":"A totally graphic depiction of a yuppie by day, psychotic serial-killer by night. An insight into the dualistic world in which we live and the masks that hide our true selves. Once again, VERY graphic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Again","review":"This book.....this horrible abortion of a book. American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis will give my nightmares but not in a good way. I've read some pretty horrible material over the past few years but nothing compares to this. I'm not talking about the murders, the horrible way he treats people and the homeless or even the blatant fascination with the material possessions around him. It's the sexual depravity that is shown throughout the murders of women. I want to scrub my brain clean.I grew to hate Patrick, really really hate him. I wanted so much for this book to end. Just to get through it was a chore. I understand his obsession with how people look and their status symbols. But to be constantly reminded over and over was just redundant. His description of clothes became mind numbing. At the beginning I understood it was mostly character development but it...kept....going. And the entire chapters on 80s music? I believe the spacing and editing could be a whole lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"An outrage","review":"Apparently some people have no idea what 'helpful' means.The only response that an intelligent person can have to this piece of crap is revulsion and dismay. I read a little of it near the end and found it entirely disgusting and worthless. It is despicable, and the author of such trash can only be looked upon as depraved. It is of no value whatsoever, and I can barely contain my rage in writing this review, that some readers found it 'hilarious'. The author is sick and needs to be put away."},{"rating":"1","title":"horror at its worst","review":"I was unable to finish this book. Although I can be a fan of murder and madness novels, this was unbearable. the violence was extreme and the continous name- dropping of material wealth (ie. Gucci, Tumi, Expensive resturaunts) became boring. I am ashamed that I bought it. If you can finish it without throwing up, I would be surprised."},{"rating":"1","title":"No sense, no purpose.","review":"It is not often that I will not finish a book particularily a book that was selected for our reading group. This book however,took only 120 pages to make me feel deeply repulsed and anxious. The references to designer fashions and home appliances were boring at best. After much hand wringing and soul searching I sent this book out with the recyclables. Perhaps it can be recreated into something with more substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"More yuppie tripe","review":"Sorry to disagree with the concensus here, but this was a tiring novel. Tiring in the descriptions of everything from what the yuppie du'jour was wearing to gutting a sharpei. The entire time I read it I found myself asking, \\"What else could I be reading right now?\\" Sorry folks, this was sex and violence for the over(under?) stimulated. Just didn't care about Bateman and I really tried."},{"rating":"2","title":"A reflection of what we as a society have become...","review":"This novel may have contained portions of which almost inspired me to tears, but it nevertheless contained many of the stories we read about time and time again in the daily newspaper. American Psycho does not inspire violence towards groups such as women, but in my opinion the author wrote only about what time and time again happens when people perpetuate the legacy of hate towards those they do not understand. Our charismatic young killer is so immersed in his ideology and self that he possesses no sympathy for others. The only way for him to feel anything at all is for him to inflict pain upon others, yet it is never enough. In my humble opinion, this book is possibly an instant cultural classic, with which future generations can look back upon to get a small glimpse into our contrived and complex present."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ FOR THE END OF THE MILLENIUM!","review":"This novel is nothing short of amazing. Admittedly it is not a novel for every one.. (beware ye of squeamish dispositions.) The fact that this explores levels of the human psyche never written about in fiction previously would be an understatement. American Psycho is one long trip down one truly horrifying yet darkly hilarious road. Easton-Ellis, as an author pens a sarcatic, scathing attack on everything from the \\"Material Girl\\" to making resturant reservations. A word to the wise: this is not a novel to be read in one sitting. It is quite overwhelming."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's all fun and games 'til someone loses an eye!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It gave me many ideas regarding fashion and health & beauty products that I may want to try myself. It also provided me with many ideas for ways to spend my idle time. I hope to put some of these ideas into action very soon. A great read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Somebody owes me my time back!","review":"This was possible the first book I have ever wanted to stop reading. Not due to the content, but rather the lack of it! Ellis has to be one of the laziest authors of his time, this books reads like a copy of GQ with some reviews from Rolling Stone and a few pages from Penthouse thrown in to add some pages. I finished it only hoping at one point it would become a story with some sense of flow, but the book continued to be choppy and totally out of touch with anything that would make it seem realistic. If it weren't for the publisher giving up on it, I would have thought all the hype was created by the publisher just to sell an otherwise doomed book."},{"rating":"1","title":"More a bad short story than a great novel","review":"American Psycho is one of those rare books that manages to be boring and repellent at the same time. Despite the gory detail, nothing happens. Admittedly, that may be the point of the book. If so, it hardly needed to be 400 pages long. Yes, it is rich in detail. It may even be an interesting commentary on the jaded, desensitized eighties. But the bottom line is that nothing changes thoughout the lifespan of the book. This may be all right for reality, but for fiction, it's just dull. I admit, however, the book has desensitized me to the extent that if Bret Easton Ellis is murdered by some twisted freak I will not care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try E! instead","review":"I find it amusing when people gush about Mr. Ellis \\"humorous\\" portraits of fin de millenium Manhattan (or America, or whatever). They seem to take for granted that Ellis is criticizing or making a caricature of this vapid, shallow and ridiculously silly world. Think twice, pal. The guy is not criticizing it. The guy is totally, completely, head over heels in love with it! Take the glam away from him and he will certainly pine to death: now that wouldn't be a bad thing, as this would certainly rid us from any more dubious opuses. Because you see, he keeps on churning them out, and certain breed of critics keeps on telling us how \\"humorous\\" this guy is..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catalog or novel?","review":"I must admit - I bought this book because, like many others, I wanted to see if the descriptions of the main character's actions were really as stomach-turning as I had been hearing. They were. I only got about halfway through the second (or third) chapter before I couldn't take it anymore. I never even got to any violence. The chapter I gave up on was about him shaving. SHAVING!! No glimpse into his thoughts of any kind while shaving, just shaving. The most repulsive part was the yuppie toiletry catalog that it turned out to be. It made me wonder if he didn't kill his victims with the pungence of scented soaps, creams and mousses emanating from his face. This review is 1-star because I couldn't choose negative numbers."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"I read it, and wondered what I'd done with those three hours of my life. There was nothing \\"shocking\\" or \\"spectacular\\" about it. More than the story of a serial killer, it's the story of the hollow lives of the \\"yuppies\\" of the late 1980s -- the drug abuse, compulsive consumerism and mindnumbing sameness of their lives (half of his \\"friends\\" can't even remember his name)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughably Stupid","review":"It is not shocking, it is not exciting, it has no plot, it has no message of consequence, it has no memorable characters, it is not compelling in any way, it was not enjoyable to read, it is not rhythmic or poetic, the author displays no talent, it is pretentious and over-hyped, and fundamentally less than worthless. Other than that, it is a great book I can recommend to anyone with a single digit IQ. It does have one grand attribute: it is hugely symbolic... symbolic of America's utter breakdown of intellectual and artistic abilities. I agree with another reviewer's comment that it should come with a vomit bag - not because of the (ridiculous) gore but because a book of such horrible quality can be hyped to sell so well. Ellis' next book should be an autobiography called American Retard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip It","review":"It's boring, artificial, has poor dialogue and lacks character development. I felt like I was reading the same chapter for 300 pages, because NOTHING happens except Patrick works out, goes to dinner, rents videos and kills prostitutes. Night after dreary night. He finally shakes things up by stabbing a five-year-old, because only then does Bateman try to explain himself at all. If you truly want a story of the '80s, Manhattan style, choose \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\" by Tom Wolfe."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want 3 wasted nights of my life back!","review":"I read this book when it first came out. Don't get me wrong, I love violence just as much as the next guy. That is, when it is presented by a writer with talent. I was not shocked by the violence in this book, just by how bad it was. I could have done a better time feeding my mind those three nights by watching television and drinking beer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmm.......","review":"I LOVE YOU BRETT EASTIN-ELLIS!! YOU ARE GOD!!!! HOW COULD YOU COME UP WITH SUCH SICK CHARACTERS? OH MY GOD!! YOUR TRULY AMAZING!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE American Novel of this century!","review":"Its scary. Very scary. Not beacause of the killings and torture and all that, but because of the carelessness. It's not Patrick Bateman that is the scariest person in this novel; it's the world that c r e a t e d him.This truly is a great work of fiction (?) about a world devoid of feeling. Where looks and fashion rules. Do you think Bateman & Co live meaningless lives? Then consider your own life. Do y o u think about other things than work/school, working out and hanging out? Hardly. If you belong to this generation (especially if you're a guy) do think about other thing than getting laid and getting that pump?? I don't. Perhaps I should???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shocking yet perversely clever.","review":"The first time I read this book I found it shockingly appealing. I loved the way he dropped the names of designers and objects. I found it a very clever commentary on the lives of young, wealthy, beautiful people. However, I then tried to reread it and could not stand it. Not only that, the horror of it made me sick. I ended up throwing it away, where I thought no one could ever find it, as I would never want anyone else to read it. I cannot explain why I could read it the first time and had such a powerful reaction the second, but the second reaction stands the firmest. It is a horrifying, repugnant story. And I find no redeeming value in it. As one reviewer wrote, how has this story enriched anyone's life?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, please...","review":"This book was a nearly impossible read. The violence was not at all interesting or clever or smart--it was just bloody. There was no exploration of the psychology behind violence, or the linking of violence and sex and money and power. Now that might have been interesting. As it stands, my dropout junior high school boyfriend could have written this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Reaction","review":"I have never reacted to a book in the manner that American Psycho caused me to. When I read that a book is being made into a movie, I usually try to read it. With Leo DeCaprio slated as the star and feminists stating their annoyance, I must admit that I was somewhat intrigued. Unfortunately, the joke was on me. I found the book to have a certain flair and difference, even though I was disgusted most of the way. I hated the non-ending, but with so many real crimes being unsolved I guess it was realistic. There were no characters to root for, but I finished it anyway. It became a faster read as I began to skim over the clothing descriptions. It was, however, a tedious read. I usually recommend books to my friends, but I cannot do that this time. I tore the book apart and shredded it. For some reason that gave me the closure that I missed at the end of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Empty...","review":"Patrick Bateman's droning recitation of his chi-chi brand name possessions was amusing, as was his collection of tics and twitches and his hyper-shallow music reviews. But Ellis, as a writer, is about as subtle as his protagonist. It's one thing to suggest alienation, and another thing entirely to cram it down one's throat, like a chocolate-covered urinal cake"},{"rating":"1","title":"American Puke","review":"This book popped up in my \\"Recommendations\\" list when I was ordering a Chuck Barris autobiography, a funny book by a funny man. I've read \\"American Psycho\\" (what parts didn't bore me), and it is neither funny or recommended for anybody with an IQ over 50. It's not a \\"comment on society\\" as some may suggest, and anyone who thinks that has potential to become a serial killer themselves. Society may be cruel, but not as cruel as the publishers of this crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST WASTE OF TIME AND PAPER","review":"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. If you took out the descriptions of what everyone was wearing and the two chapters on contemporary singers i.e. Whitney Houston + 1, then the book would be two-thirds its size, being left only with gouging out eye balls and making reservations at night clubs. What a waste of time...I'm embarassed I read the whole thing. Hopefully I can spare you my mistake!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Worthless Garbage","review":"After 42 years of reading in all genres, I've finally found a book that is total worthless garbage, never to re-read again, and will find no place on my shelves. While I have nothing against violence and gore, and reading about serial killers is in my top five list of books to read, this book simply stinks. Besides the characters, whom you cannot get into at all, the book jumps around and even includes reviews of various musicians! Several chapters are totally devoted to this. The book doesn't tell a good in-depth story, has no discernible plot, lousy characters, and ridiculous reviews which add nothing to the book. I'm sorry I wasted money and time on it. Save yours and read something much better and worth your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst","review":"Probably one of the worst books I have ever read. The author goes into agonizing details about every characters' wardrobe every time a character is introduced! The book is so dated that I struggled with remembering the details of the early eighties. I actually threw this book out in an airport because I did not want anyone to have to go through the pain I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow.","review":"I have never rated a book before on Amazon, but I felt compelled to write one on this book because it bothered me so much. I gave the book one star because of the graphic violence. I understand this book is making a statement on the times, people, Ect. But it was really just too much for me.I am an avid reader who enjoys all sorts of genres of literature, and I understand that the author needed to paint a picture of a psychopath by showing us some of the killings. After awhile though the book becomes monotonous. If I have to read about what he is wearing and what other people are wearing, Music, and how he is torturing someone again, I think I will go Psychotic."},{"rating":"2","title":"review by a 14 year old girl.","review":"I loved this book so much...I dont want to make this a long detailed review (im doing HW right now lol) but let me just say that this book was great! I love the movie as well. It wasn't very violent or gory like some people were saying... I mean, there IS some violence but its not too graphic or anything. I wasn't disturbed by what went on in the book. If anything i thought this book was hilarious, i laughed out loud so many times. :)I aslo love how its from his point of view. and OMG! they totally break the 4th wall in this book on numerous occasions! haha.so overall, GREAT BOOK!!! :D"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mad world","review":"This book drove me crazy.

Boring is a little more accurate. The name brand clothing descriptions get real old real fast. The best parts are the critical theories on Genesis and Phil Collins. The movie is a little better. I like the part in the special 80's documentary on the DVD when the editor of Film Comment is interviewed and says about the book, \\"It's just not that good\\". Hah!.If you're into this \\"genre\\", whatever it is, check out Hubert Selby's \\"The Demon\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"makes me think censorship might be a good idea","review":"Brett Easton Ellis would probably make snuff films if he thought he could get away with it. It's creepy that this is the second book of his that mentions snuff films. It makes me think that maybe he is aroused and excited by the material in this book and is indulging his warped fantasies, but pretending that his book is extreme satire. Therefore I have no respect for him as a writer or as a member of my species."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brutally graphic","review":"There is much in this book that is worth discussing--the vapidness of the Eighties, the ruthless greed and unnatural desire for material goods. But, and I'm not typically squeamish, the graphic depictions of Bateman's violent outbursts, particularly those against women, are unbearable and unnecessary. Ellis' point could have been well made without resorting to such horrendously vivid descriptions of Bateman's horrifying behaviour."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!","review":"I started reading this a few years ago, and promptly returned it after just 50 pages. This book stands out in my memory as one of the worst books I've ever experienced. Want to read a page of ramblings about the thread count of a designer shirt? Or tolerate the unbearably repetitive use of the word \\"hardbodies\\"?I was put-off not only by the writing style, but the violent scenes. I expected violence, but the scenes just made no sense! They just hung in mid-air, waiting for better context. This is a useless,immature, overhyped embarrassment, and I can't believe someone has written a literary guide for this book. It's like providing Cliffs Notes for a high school student's creative writing project. The praise for this book astounds me. Couldn't put it down? I think I threw my copy across my desk in disgust!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Depraved and wonderful","review":"You'll need a dark sense of humor to enjoy this book, but it is very funny and entirely over the top.

It's shock-value scenes are deployed for mere fascination, nothing else. The man character, Patrick Bateman, is wholly unidentifiable as anything close to a member of the animal kingdom, pathologic or not. Mr. Ellis refuses to give any substance or insight into his character, but instead exploits our perceptions of evil and godlessness to spin a useless tale of depravity. No insight, resolution or explanations, only bewildering implausabilities which make us wonder \\"why bother?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Psycho?","review":"Well-I couldn't wait to finish this book -so I could read something better! Read this book if you like long reviews on the music of Whitney Houston and Huey Lewis. Or if you are interested in reading pages and pages of descriptions of men's clothing and who makes the best suits and is it OK to wear argyle socks. Or maybe read it to discover all sorts of weird recipe descriptions served in trendy bistros. It's all about the clothes and food. Throw in some depraved sex and lots of blood and gore and you have an uninteresting mish-mash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"One of the best fiction books ive ever read,i normally read True Crime but this is touching on possible reality of serial killing...definately a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read after seeing the movie","review":"I saw the movie first.

Now that it has been some months and I have gone thru other books, I have to admit that this book was a very good overview touching on all the main points a beginner needs to get started in a slim enough volume not to be overwhelmed.That said, I just did not love it for subjective reasons. A couple of the main reasons that come to mind is that I prefer photographs to drawn pictures and was really annoyed that they did not just show how to use a typical tuner as a simple tuning option for a beginner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Guitar Book","review":"This is a great guitar book for everybody except for guitar players who know how to do everything that you can do on a guitar like Slash can. It tells you the basics, how to fingerpick, how to hammer-on and pull-off and many other things. It also gives you tips, many tunes to practice and master. It is a really good guitar book for virtually everyone. The only con is that the book is from 1970 something, so if you want a book for a young child, get something else.

I am so glad I bought Dinotopia."},{"rating":"2","title":"better","review":"Personaly I thought the dinotopia movie was good... that was until I bought the series. Though its only a few episodes it actually much better. It does follow the boys and their father, but goes into more detail.

Not a huge change but enough to say that if I were to buy both again I would opt for the series instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dinotopia","review":"My boyfriend and I, both in our 30s, caught a few minutes of the series this past summer while we were at our friends' house. It was playing in their family room to entertain their children and we both thought it looked really good so we asked about it. After finding out what it was I looked it up on Amazon but forgot to buy it. I didn't think about it again until just before Christmas and bought it for my boyfriend. We both really enjoy it. The storyline is really cute. The only thing that I found wrong with it is that the TV series does not start from the beginning of the adventure so I'll be ordering the Dinotopia mini-series in hopes of getting the background information. I know that the actors are not the same.

All four tracks by the two Toms (Waits and Verlaine) are keepers, and might never have existed without this film. As a previous reviewer demonstrated, all the songs are worthy of mention, and are awesomely assembled here. Plus, the liner notes are both sweet and hilarious. Just buy it. You'll see. Better yet, buy two and give one to a friend. Share the \\"Big Bad Love.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"This DVD is not what it claims.

I have to agree with other reviewers - the lack of references to more current SW PM practices is deporable. The scope of Project Manager for Software is much larger than this book and the example used does not measure up. The integration with the PMBOK and the integration of SEI SW-CMM into Project Management for software was not discussed.

Dr Wolf goes off a bit too much on an academic journey in attempt to lay a foundation that proves the human soul exists. I would suggest one does not need to trace back all theoretical philosophical treatise on the subject in order to prove that the human mind is separate and distinct from the human brain, and the soul of a person is yet again distinct from both of those entities. One only has to see the smile of a child when first discovering a puppy or remember back to the first time you kissed you first true love to prove the soul exits... This becomes too academic and technical for even the most advanced spiritual reader to get much value.

However, the book has more than one fatal flaw. Read this, but also read Frank Tipler'sThe Physics of Christianity.Now, I'm not implying Tipler's book is flawless. It isn't. But both books help the reader to grasp a clearer picture of what physics actually IS saying.My advice... whenever you read a claim that seems new to you, look for a reference in the endnotes. If the reference seems reputable, fine, if questionable, question the assertion. In either case, keep reading as new books are published. The definitive book hasn't yet been written on this subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid NEW AGE Science","review":"I am not hardened materialist but also not a uncritical spiritualist. I was impressed by Wolfs two books \\"Taking the Quantum Leap\\" and \\"Parallel Universes\\". But after reading this book (as well as authors recent books), I became very skeptical of spiritualism. This is misbegotten book than other NEW AGE books. Dr.Wolf give a twist to scientific fact and extort. He flawed proving his theory.Farewell Dr.Wolf."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Many Angels Dance on the Head of a Pin?","review":"The arrogance of many theoretical physicists is that experiments don't matter: The arrogance is that they know philosophy better than philosophers. Modern Philosophy knows God cannot be proven theoretically. And science requires experimental proof. Faith is debased by self-affirming delusions of proof, no matter how eloquent the author, and Dr. Wolf is very eloquent. And science is debased by being misconstrued and marginalized. (Why spoil a good idea with the empirical evidence!) Faith has NO logical proof and needs NO scientific evidence.

After reading most of Dr. Wolf's other works, I found this one wondering and burdensome.

I didn't need the copious amount of historical thought about the soul...I wanted to know more \\"straight forward\\" what Fred thought about the topic. Not being a phsicist or educated in deep theoretical thinking, I wasn't able to grasp a lot of the concepts presented (trouble I haven't had with Dr. Wolf's other works).I admire anyone who would tackle this task, but I didn't find the work one of his better efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lexmark A DOG","review":"Stay FAR FAR away from this printer.

Combat is resolved with opposed skill checks instead of the d20-standard attack roll vs. Armor Class. This isn't d20--this is somthing that's trying to look superfically like d20.We've never even played the original BESM, but my gaming group agreed unanimously to use it instead of this product.

Those experienced with the d20 system will be surprised to find mechanics that are completely different from those you are familiar with... most with no explination for the changes. The combat system causes the biggest \\"what the heck?\\" moment. It is wildly different from normal d20. What is worse is that it feels relatively obvious that it was written by someone with a poor understanding of the d20 dynamics. As such, this book can hardly be plugged straight into any d20 setting like it claims.Now, it does have some good parts, and those familiar with Tri-Stat might like its spin on the d20 mechanics.

They have dubbed it out quite a bit. It is an incredible song on its own. I would buy this record just for that track but that is me. The original is on a recent Studio One Compilation. I love that track. Well if you have seen Zero 7 live then you have probably heard the track. They do a great cover with Moses singing it from the bottom of his soul. I couldnt have asked them for a more incredible song to cover, but then again I have spent over a decade digging through piles of obscure reggae albums. Well there are some good tracks on this disc but I was turned off by the hip hop tracks. I guess I heard them and was like Yuck!! I am not into hip hop much, although there are exceptions, ie Lyrics Borne. Cinematic Orchestra, Da Lata are great but maybe a different \\"another late night\\" selection would be wiser. Hold out for more seven........."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Late Night","review":"As a major fan of Zero 7's Simple Things, I was ecstatic to see a new album released. But as some reviews have already indicated, this is a compilation CD with one Zero 7 song. First, what would possess either the label of the band to be so deceptive? Second, this is the very reason consumers don't lie buying CDs and feel the desire to either download or listen to samples on the Internet. I took one step into the RIAA-mandated form of distribution, and will take one step back out of it. Not only is this CD deceptive, legal action should be taken against the label for misleading Zero 7 fans. If you liked Simple Things, DO NOT BUY THIS CD. It sounds nothing like Simple Things, preceisiely because it is not by Zero 7."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Night","review":"This is another great cd amongst this new compilation series. I rarely rate anything, however i feel i must air my view to Simon L's comments who feels he has been duped. Dude if you check the back you would have known this was a compilation rather than another Zero 7 cd. The fact that there is only 1 Zero 7 track is a bonus, thus enabling us to actually track their inspiration, rather than some other compilations that are compiled to promote the compilers music. The lack of flow amongst the genres is another bonus, so we are exposed to different music and expand our horizons - and thats what miscic means to me.I highly recommend you go and purchase this cd as well as the rest of the other cd's in the series.I also recommend purchasing Marvin Gaye's 'Troubleman' - a cd to live by."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was TRICKED! ,,,,,THIS IS A COMPILATION!","review":"I am very confused about this realease.

This comes out on top for me due to the sharp visuals (witness them going out on patrol during a thunderstorm) a nigh on perfect musical score and Tom Berenger's unforgettable performance as the brutal Sgt. Barnes who really believes in what he's doing. The wise-talking John C. McGinley as Sgt. O'Neill and Kevin Dillon as the physco soldier 'Bunny' also give memorable performances. In fact most of the cast went on to do even greater things. Many you will recognize such as Willem Dafoe, Johnny Depp, Charlie Sheen and Forest Whitaker.

More guilt trips than truth. As a 2 year in-country vet, I believe it is deplorable that he fails to note that the mission itself was an honorable one and so was the performance of the American soldier. He managed to contribute to the stereotype of the Vietnam soldier as a baby killer and drug addict, which is not the truth.This film does not belong in the same catagory as \\"The Longest Day\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiction !","review":"This movie was based on not greater than 10% fact and no less than 90% fiction. One only needs to read Robert Hemphill's book Platoon: Bravo Company to fine the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"way too isolated and without emotions","review":"Oliver Stone's was a veteran of Vietnam himself and he appears late in this movie, which is unfortunate for his own sake, because if I were him, I'd want to be hiding from this movie, pretending to have nothing to do with it. The three main soldiers (Willem Dafoe, Charlie Sheen, Tom Berenger) hate each other from the very beginning and everyone knows before it begins that it is about the loss of innocence because war is hell, so the things that happen to the three of them are pretty predictable. In some of his better work, mainly The Doors and Natural Born Killers, Oliver Stone uses a lot of effort to show the effect that the plot is having on the rest of the world. In The Doors, we see footage of Vietnam because it was transpiring at the same time. Likewise for Nixon. However, in this movie, we just see the war itself without seeing the outside world reacting to it as it unfolds. Oliver Stone does better work in the 90's."},{"rating":"2","title":"A better version of The Thin Red Line","review":"This movie is like The Thin Red Line (talking about a soldier in a war) except a lot better with more action and better plot (the way things are in the movie). This movie is over 10 years old, but still good.This is not really quite like Saving Private Ryan, but still is a good war movie. This is my other favorite war movie besides SPR (1 of the 2 only war movies I like the best).I recommend this movie if u like war movies.

Despite endless comments to the contrary, there is nothing \\"realistic\\" about the film. The characters and plot are almost cartoonish. Its like a postmodernist John Wayne movie with different politics.In real life, things don't break down into \\"good\\" soldiers and \\"evil\\" soldiers. Real life and real people are about shades of grey. The war also changed over time. Oliver Stone served in 1967 but the movie is often showing situations that were more out of 1971 with which he had no personal experience.What a real film about vietnam would show is ordinary people doing a tough job day after day and doing the best they could.

There is no honor, glory, compassion in war. The John Wayne movies are a farce to real conditions in the field.This movie truly portrays Vietnam warefre as it was."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best ever made!!","review":"Platoon is one of my favorite movies dealing with war. I am a war buff and an actual portrayl of war is something that i like to see in a good war movie.

It is by far the best Stone movie. It will, no doubt, stand the test of time. Stone gives his message against War in Vietnam, but without forgetting one essential point: you must give a message, but the mesage must be included in a good script ! ( what was not done in \\"NATURAL BORN KILLERS\\", for example). Dafoe is fantastic, Berenger is in practically his only great part in his career."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Ax to Grind","review":"On one hand this movie it is a masterful, creative work of art--a beautifully filmed, superbly acted, and skillfully directed film. On the other hand, it is a historical piece of garbage and a slap in the face to every vet who ever served honorably in Vietnam, including me. But unfortunately, as has been noted in film before, particularly in \\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,\\" when the myth becomes larger than the truth, people tend to print the myth. Here Stone has succeeded in printing a myth that fits his warped sense of patriotism, or lack of patriotism, and he uses this myth to heap revenge on his country and his fellow veterans for some perceived harm done to him. I suspect it is harm done to him by someone else that he has projected onto his country and its veterans, but that may be my trained counselor side speaking. So for me, this movie is more about a disturbed man with an ax to grind than it is about an artist with a story to tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review: Oliver Stone's Platoon","review":"I like Tom Berringer but not the ridiculous character Stone had him portray in this movie. Charlie Sheen's acting was amateurish at best but, what more could you expect from him. All of the characters were ridiculous caricatures of infantrymen in Vietnam. As a Vietnam combat veteran I found Stone's portrayal of day-to-day life in a combat unit to be insulting and degrading to any veteran who saw combat in that war.The movie may portray Stone's hallucination of Vietnam but it was not the Vietnam I or most combat vets remember. The battle scenes were unrealistic and overdone. It fell WAY short of delivering even a slightly realistic portrayal of combat in the Vietnam War.Overall, I rate the movie as awful and pathetic. If there was a way to give it NO stars, that's where I would rate this turkey."},{"rating":"2","title":"courage is an enemy","review":"platoon shows the vietnam war as a mean war when the americans hate one another, when a young vietnam american boy goes to war and doesn't now anything but to go to war to make his granma pround, end's up takeing drugs and a big machine gun killing many vientnams he realises how many mistakes he made, when a lot of his friends died in the war, his courage starts to fade away and starts to get frighten and not care if his life is taken away or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.5 out of 5","review":"PLATOON is one of the greatest and most moving war films you will ever see. It made writer/director Oliver Stone a legend, and remains his greatest film, in my opinion. Charlie Sheen stars as Chris Taylor, a new war recruit assigned to Vietnam, who finds friendship in the form of Sgt. Elias Grodin (Willem Dafoe, just two years before his role in Stone's THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST), while dealing with the ruthless Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger, in one of his best roles). The film, which took in four Academy Awards including \\"Best Picture\\", is frighteningly realistic, partly due to the fact that it is based on Stone's first-hand experience in Vietnam. Stone's directing is awesome; his script will keep you hooked, if you can take the drama. Sheen is great, and the theme, \\"Adagio for Strings\\", is so perfect for the film you'll never forget it. There are few films which can make the horrors of war as depicted in Oliver Stone's masterpiece...PLATOON."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best war movie I've ever seen","review":"A great movie. The best vietnam movie I've ever seen. I love all the characters and I also love the soundtrack which was performed by georges delerue and I play it again and again.

Everytime I watch this movie I feel the instincts of the people who played in this movie. All the actors and director oliver stone is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good -- but doesn't hold up as well as I expected","review":"When Platoon was first released, I counted myself among its many admirers. As others here have noted, the depiction of the experience of \\"grunts\\" in Vietnam is very compelling. When I first saw the film, I felt like I was viscerally experiencing the terror, horror, boredom, fatigue, and discomfort that made up the lives of the infantry in Vietnam.However, the film does not bear up well to multiple viewings. I just watched the DVD last night, and found little new to build on my impressions from 15 years ago. My only new observation is that I have more admiration for Willem DaFoe's performance. He brings a special light to his role as the \\"good\\" sargent -- but he has gone on to play darker roles. Hindsight allows one to better appreciate the quality of his acting here.For a film based on Vietnam that does reward multiple viewings, I recommend the Deer Hunter. More than twenty years after its first release, its power remains undiminished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific!","review":"Once again I heard that this movie was good so I went and watched it. I have never looked at that war the same. Don't get me wrong. I have always appreciated all the American vets from all the wars we fought in with respect up to that time! And I still do! What a terrific example of how the war effected each person in a different way. I never thought that Oliver Stone had been a good director until I watched this. Charlie Sheen's best performance to date. William Dafoe's and Tom Berenger's best film as well. A down right effective film about a war we don't like to think or talk about but must never forget!

(Note: Stone's ridiculous movie 'Nixon' was roundly criticized as inaccurate. Stone responded with some comment that he was in the business of 'creating history'.) Stone is attempting a brainwashing operation here against the American public. Platoon depicts the oppressive atmosphere of Vietnam well, but his characterizations of the Troops and their interrelations are completely false. 'Platoon' relates to the Vietnam War as a sort of reverse propaganda effort. Kind of like an 'anti-GungHo' flick. The best sort of an anti-war flick is an accurate movie like 'Saving Private Ryan' or 'Hamburger Hill' not this sort of commie-prop that Stone has as his life's mission."},{"rating":"2","title":"great film","review":"Controversy.

As a young man, I saw this movie in the theater with my father and his friend, who was a vietnam vet. I can recall looking up at my father's friend on several occasions during the film, and seeing him weeping. at that point, I knew that Oliver Stone and his movie had nailed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most Accurate Retelling Of Vietnam","review":"Platoon brings Vietnam too life. Oliver Stone really knew what he was talking about. He was there!! Tom Berenger and Willam Dafoe have the most unforgettable roles of the carrer in this film. Platoon sends a powerful message about teamwork and the struggle in Vietnam, where inoccent civilians were murdered, young men's incconce were lost, and valor was lost. But, it is gets borring in some parts and picks up after that. The sound was excellent and brought Vietnam to life. Not for weak stomached though. Some scenes get extremlly grusome. I suggest anyone who was there, likes Vietnam movies, or just plain likes war movies sees this."},{"rating":"2","title":"OLIVER'S REGIMENT","review":"Oliver Stone has never been accused of being boring, at least to my recollection. In \\"Platoon\\" Stone has apparently crafted not only the definitive war movie of his generatiom, but also one of Hollywood's best films ever. I say \\"apparently\\" deliberately, knowing that non-combatants can never appreciate the full horror of warfare. Try telling the late Helen Keller how tough it must have been to be blind and deaf. You get the picture. Stone's movie literally explodes across the screen, with little time given to actor definition. Oh sure, Berenger and Dafoe stand out, but certainly not in the fashion of grabbing the limelight. War is a team effort, for better or worse, and one is drawn to the conclusion that the enemy is not always across the firing lines, one of Norman Mailer's themes in \\"The Naked and the Dead\\", circa 1950. In summary, one is definitely not entertained by this film. Perhaps, it's our animal instincts that keep drawing us back to it, sadly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great soundtrack Great actors Great plot","review":"I give this movie five stars just for my title review alone. This is a war movie that should be on every war movie fan's shelf, I enjoyed the scene which featured the song \\"Tracks of my tears(Somkey Robinson)\\",where they were just getting wasted. All the characters had a personality and interacted with each other in different ways, just like real life. The realtionship or animositybetween Tom beringer (Sgt. Barnes) and Willem Dafoe( Sgt. Elias) was surreal and I loved the sub-plot that went throughtout the movie between them two, which you know was eventually going to climax, sorry no spoilers. Check it out even if your not a war movie fan, its just a great action, drama flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT MOVIE.......POOR DVD","review":"This movie more than stands on its own. Charlie Sheehan is a rich kid who actually volunteered to go to Vietnam. His performance is admirable and makes you wonder what happened to his career. Tom Berringer and William Dafoe are oustanding as two seargants with two very different opinions on how the war should be fought. The movie centers around the atrocities of war. Good imagery, good score, and good supporting cast members make this a five star movie that was very deserving of the 86 academy award for best picture.So....why a four star rating? Well I rated the DVD and not just the film. To keep it simple, there are NO EXTRAS. No extra scenes, no interviews, no making of special, no commentary options. I love this film so I bought the DVD.

It's just that the CD consists of excerpts of the listed tracks - one (Ven A Mi) is a 45 second sample. The others are not much longer. Looking at the track list you would think it's a greatest hits CD but it's not. It must have been released out of spite after she switched record labels. Shame on EMI for pulling a stunt like this.

The one thing that could be improved on, however, and that could've pushed this to be one of my favourite films, would be the plot. Not the plot of the war, of course, that is a well-stated fact.No, I'm speaking specifically about the plot of the journalist-wife who goes into this psychiatric state, yet is allowed to travel into a war-zone instead of being prescribed psychiatric help.

The attachment arms are curved in the wrong way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decently written, but grey in nature","review":"The writing style and content are not particularly brilliant, but were captivating enough to keep me turning pages against my better judgment.The enormous difference between this and his previous works caused me to wonder if some great calamity had darkened the author's outlook on life.Unlike his previous works, this novel was permeated by a sort of emotional hollowness, or perhaps cynicism. It almost seemed that he went out of his way to prove that there's no such thing as wrong or right, and that life is ugly and short. I guess if his whole intention was to illustrate how much unlike heroes these three 'heroes' are, Joel Rosenberg succeeded stunningly, but it was a morally grey, depressing, passionless read. Even the 'happy' ending left a bitter taste in my mouth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dumas should have had it so good","review":"I'm not sure I buy the notion that Rosenberg's three heroes are intended to reprise Dumas' -- Durine and Pirojil could maybe both lay claim to being Porthos, while Kethol is much more D'Artagnan than Aramis, but none of them parallel terribly well -- but that's more than okay.What I absolutely love about this one is the interplay between the three characters, much moreso than in the Dumas books. Their three-way partnership, while rarely overtly discussed in the book, is the heart of the story.It sort of reminded me of a really, really good buddy movie, except that there isn't just one pair of buddies, but three, and half the fun is watching them not quite get along.A terrific book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smaller than expected but still cute","review":"I like this toy for my son.

The still photos were okay I never really used this function.I just went to use the camcorder and I found I had a black screen and all the footage that I had stored on it has vanished!!

The footage is jumpy. The camera is terrible in low light. Even indoors during the day, you have to blast light into the camera to get a readable image. I returned mine and I'm looking to getting the much better Sony HD cam which is almost double the price, but at least they were smart enough to put a video light on it. Being a professional filmmaker and knowing what Cameras shoot real HD, I quickly realized that I got ripped off. This may be good only if you're shooting mostly outdoors during the day, but don't expect to bring it to a party, club, or out on the town at night. It seems like they should have devoted effort to making the low light shooting excellent. The size of the camera is amazing and the fact that there are no tapes is great. I was really disappointed because I was expecting something better. Most digital cameras shoot better video, seriously!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy - Black Screen Gets You In The End","review":"In my opinion this is not a marketable product. The cameras features are irrelevant if it does not work. There is clearly a design fault and the product should be withdrawn from sale until there is a fix. When it did work it was a convenient pocketable unit. As for HD - possibly at high noon in the Sahara, but in anything but perfect light the results are dissappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Screen goes black - do not buy!!!","review":"I purchased the camera in mid June 2006. After 1 month/1 hr of recording the screen went black when in recording mode. It took the shop about 7 week to fix the problem. I used the camera to record another 20 minutes and now it does not want to focus to infinite. The recording now flickers a lot and a dot appears floating around the screen. This camera has been in the shop more time than in my hands. The store were I bought it said that It would give me a new camera if this happends for the thrid time. The only problem is that if this is a design problem, what do I get by getting a new camera?

I also thought perhaps a ROM upgrade might be available.In my search for Sanyo support I found out that Panasonic purchased Sanyo in 2009. By doing so, Panasonic basically eliminated Sanyo from its competition. I have been unable to find any support for a Sanyo Xacti beyond the HD-1000 and that's on an old Sanyo site. From what I can determine, Panasonic doesn't provide a support site for Sanyo products.I recommend that before you buy this camera you verify that there is going to be support for it.

Sanyo is doing everything they can to prevent me from getting money back or get new camera. They just want me to keep sending to customer. Care.

Amy Smart, Seth Green and the very handsome and sexy Stewart Townsend are capable of delivering great stuff. However there was not much they could do with such a boring and unispired script. Another cookie cutter romantic comedy with little substance. It seems Hollywood is churning these out a dime a dozen these days. I love romantic comedies. But so many of these kinds of movies now are just cliche and predictable stories. What a shame, as these actors could have done wonders with a little better material. Despite this, Seth Green manages to handle the comedic aspect of the film very well. And the male lead is excellent eye candy. That pretty much sums up my two stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Funny","review":"Both my husband and I enjoyed this movie. It was very, very funny. I am a fan of Stuart Townsend and Amy Smart.

Not so here. The simple, yet stirring approach taken on these performances is something that's been needed for a long time to validate the role of the classical singer in engaging themselves in spirituals. Hendricks is superb here - never sounding better. The participation of the Moses Hogan Singers is a stroke of genius as is the lack of any instrumental obtrusion. The range of material here is very generous - from the uptempo to the truly sorrowful. The heartbreaking, yet ultimately exhilerating performance of \\"Steal Away\\" is worth the price of the disc alone. This recording should not be passed up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Spritual composer","review":"Moses Hogans arrangements of many of his Spirituals are inspiring, fun to sing, and have a certain je ne sais quoi about them that I have yet to hear from another spiritual composer. His music is grand and powerful, and the Moses Hogan Chorale has a beautiful resonant sound with talented soulful singers. The moses hogan chorale will send shivers down your spine, and I recommend this CD, or any Cd with his chorale performing to people who enjoy acapella music"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Film","review":"I can't begin to understand why this film was ignored by audiences everywhere, but I am glad I had the opportunity to watch this film.

It turns out I didn't and we actually set it up in my mother's house since she would be watching our little girl while I would be at work.She really enjoyed this.

Is there something I've done wrong or should I take it back?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for Short Babies","review":"Believe the other reviewer who wrote that this walker is not for short babies. My son is pretty tall for his age and even his feet don't touch the ground. Poor thing dangles there. I have been putting a pillow under his feet. He's only 4 months old so I am hoping he will grown into this walker. I am a bit disappointed in the two rattle toys at the front corners of the walker. They are so far away and it makes reaching for them a bit difficult....and ultimately frustrating for my son. I have hardwood floors so it glides nicely but I can see how it wouldn't for carpet. It lays low to the ground. The upside of this product is that the music is pleasant and cheery. The lights are entertaining. My son encountered the same problem with the toy bar where the little stars slide. The toy bar is situated too far. Not only does your child need to be VERY tall, apparently, your child also needs long ape arms to reach the far toys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better products out there","review":"I chose this walker because the label stated \\"easy to fold\\". Seeing how we live in a small place, I thought this would be a great space-saving investment. The truth is, it was quite difficult to fold up. When I finally was able to, I pinched my thumb while doing it. I'm a massage therapist, so I have somewhat strong arms and hands, but this was a killer...I'm not about to break a sweat every time I need to store it away in the closet.Also, the other reviewers are correct when they say that it does not move on carpet...not at all! I think I will shop around for another product, but will read all the parent reviews first before purchasing another."},{"rating":"1","title":"SoSo","review":"This walker is just okay. Looks-wise, it is a little too colorful--a bit crazy. It doesn't move as freely on the floor as I would like--turning and swiveling. The height of the walker is not really \\"adjustable\\" either. The fabric seat can be cinched up a small distance, but the \\"lowest setting\\" is not terribly low. When I first purchased the walker, my twins were 6 months old and tall for their age; yet, they were still barely able to touch the floor in this walker. Now that they are 7 1/2 months, they can move better, but it is bulky and difficult.The only thing I am grateful for is the fact that it gives them the opportunity to be upright and relatively mobile for short spans of time. Other than that, I would have returned it on the spot!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"highly recomended","review":"I bought mine at a yard sale for $8, so it was a win win situation from the begining. I cant comment on assembly, as it was already assembled, but it is sturdy. My 5 month old is very entertained (and was also at 4 months). He can turn the steering wheel (which doesnt actually steer I dont think) and it makes noise, he also likes to push the Maestro buttons which make it light up and play one of a number of songs. He also loves to spin the two other toys attached to the walker.

There is a way to adjust the height, you have to read directions. My son is 7 months old is in the 50% percentile for height and has no problem touching the ground. He can also reach the toys in front of him. (someone wrote in earlier that her child could not)The only negative thing I can say about it is the walker is hard for a baby on carpet and can be hard for the baby to turn it around when walking in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"better options out there","review":"I'd agree with the other reviewers that it's not for short babies. My little one is about to crawl and can stand supported, but still can't touch the ground with this walker - she's got a good two inches to go and will likely be walking on her own by then. Even the \\"adjustable\\" strap doesn't make a difference. The music is much better than most toys, but the batteries wear out very quickly compared to other toys she has, like Leapfrog that shut off automatically. We left it on overnight (even though it wasn't playing) and the batteries were dead 24 hours later.My mom has the Baby Trend Walker with toy bar at her house and even though it's a pain to adjust the bottom, my baby can scoot in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Good Trust ME","review":"This product is excellent.

It is exciting to have many of her classic articles combined in one collection, along with some new articles addressing recent developments in Latin America, and academic critiques of her previous work. I am just now realizing that this collection is available in paperback which makes it perfect for courses on women in Latin America or for anyone who is interested in serious and very clearly written, non-jargonistic, analyses of gender politics in Latin America. And with the recent reelection of Daniel Ortega and the FSLN in Nicaragua, her two chapters on the FSLN's sometimes rocky relationship with Nicaraguan feminists make this collection very timely."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is great for everybody!","review":"I am not a beginner at Tarot, but I use this set all the time.

It's good for beginners, because it doesn't \\"abandoned you\\" with the cards and your intuition; it helps understanding each card, then their meanings according to their position in the spread(s).

Then they release two klunkers in the early eighties. I remember the local radio station announcing the new Renaissance album, Time Line. \\"And now for our opinion,\\" the announcer said, as we clearly heard the album being dropped in the trash can.After those albums, I was reluctant to try new Renaissance, but the reviews made me change my mind and give it a listen. What a pleasant surprise! The singer is very, very good. The songs, for the most part, are well-written, performed, and produced, with a combination of bright rock and some hint of earlier glories. And, as a bonus, _no_ Jon Camp singing! Yay! (His singing bores me.)Now I'm going to get the other album featuring this singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"She ain't no Annie Haslam!","review":"Imagine the Rolling Stones without Mick Jagger. Well, that's Renaissance without Annie Haslam. The only thing that makes this CD even marginally tolerable is that some of Michael Dunford's compositions are passable tunes. However, the quality of Dunford's works only makes me yearn even more to hear Annie's voice singing them. Try as I might, even by closing my eyes, I can NOT accept another voice singing his works. Without Haslam's miraculous voice giving life to his tunes, Dunford is at best treading water with this feeble effort. If you're truly a Renaissance fan, go buy Annie's solo works instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was painful to read!","review":"I have always loved Judith Krantz's work and have read just about everything she has written.

Before you can say, oh here we go again, Daisy's charmed life is turned upside down when she is forced to face a painful past... and an unsure future. Judith Krantz's fans can rest easy; the author's second outing after the megahit Scruples is a winner. PRINCESS DAISY is a compelling yarn of the rich and rotten, jam-packed with beautiful people, lavish settings, designer clothes and plenty of skin. Daisy and friends are an exciting bunch of characters; unidimensional, perhaps, but fun. Their world of champagne and caviar is a celebrated experience no matter what. Yes, Krantz spreads it thick on the over-the-top scale, but who cares. The novel works. It is as grand and as sinful as those secrets her heroine so desperately wants to hide. Go on, indulge, for PRINCESS DAISY is classy stuff in escapism fiction.-----Martin Boucher"},{"rating":"1","title":"only good if it doesn't rain","review":"This product requires a battery change every ten inches of rain.

It's like slipping into a warm bath with a cup of tea beside me. These books are cozies and I find them delightful because of that. In this book Qwill and his two cats are involved with the new bookstore opening in Pickaxe, but there's also a lot of other things going on in town. The town drama society is putting on a play, and they've found an accomplished actor that has just moved in to play a lead role. Why do Qwill and most especially Koko take a dislike to this man? This is a little different book than most in this series because we don't have any actual provable murders, but there is still a mystery nonetheless. I actually enjoyed the book (unlike some of the other reviewers). I think it should be read by Koko and Qwilleran fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Series is a shadow of its former self","review":"The Cat Who Series has been delighting readers for many years, but perhaps it has outlived its welcome at this point. In the latest installment, Quill's K Foundation is bankrolling a new bookstore which will be run by his lady love, Polly, the former librarian of Pickax. All of the usual characters are in the book, along with Alden Wade, a smooth operator who has just moved to town. He charms the locals and ends up marrying one of the wealthiest women in town under suspicious circumstances. His stepson appears briefly in the book, but makes a hasty exit before he does much to impact the story. Alden seems to be a lethal husband as two of his wives die, but there is no resolution in the book, just a lot of questions written in Quill's journal at the end. Braun is at her best when she writes of the gentle interactions of Quill and his friends, but the well-constructed mysteries of her early books have been absent for some time."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as bad as the previous one","review":"At least the newest Cat Who book is entertaining than the last one and has some semblance of a plot. Of course, it has all the hallmarks of a Cat Who book. The person that's new in town does a crime because they are the most suspicious, Qwill figures it out, unusual and pointless characters are introduced even if we have never heard of these oh-so-famous people before in the area, Qwill mentions at least once that his mother was a Mackintosh and has some strange new habit, and the plot is neatly wrapped up in the last chapter. (I should make a list of these and create a drinking game!)I like these books because I like the characters. They are not real mysteries at all and have not been for quite a while. I read each installment as a way to catch up with old friends and visit Moose County again. This series doesn't have much literary value, but it is entertaining for a short time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ending Drove Me Bananas","review":"I've enjoyed \\"The Cat Who . . . \\" books and enjoy seeing what the characters get into next.I got to the end of this book and turned the page thinking there would be another few pages to tie up loose ends.

We are given all these clues to a mystery and no solutions. We never find out why Violet married, what happened to \\"whiskers\\" and there are a lot of other unanswered questions. This book seemed to be more of a vehicle for Qwill's little stories and the history of Pickax. More like a longer version of her \\"Short & Long Tales\\". As an interesting read about life and the inhabitants of Pickax it was very good, but definitely not in the same class as the first 20 Cat Who books. This was not a good \\"who dun it\\" and Koko was hardly involved or listened to. It may be time for her to stop writing mysteries and go with folksy stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going from bad to worse","review":"I read most of the reviews concerning this book, and all of the ones I read voiced the same sentiments as I felt. I too think it is time to end the Cat Who series, before it hits rock bottom. Perhaps it already has. I have felt for some time that Mrs. Braun must have a ghost writer, and one who is not truly a \\"cat person.\\" There is not the \\"feeling\\" about the cats that came out in her earlier books.

Quill found himself committed to writing a book about an ugly old house, but intrigued by some of the ugly stories hiding in the history of its inhabitants. I picked the book up on a Monday night and read half of it in one sitting - so far, so good. By the second sitting, I was intrigued with the story of the Hibbard family and what had happened to the missing baby and the daughter who killed herself. Then last night - ZIPPO! The book ended without telling us really anything. I cannot remember when I have been so disappointed. It was as if Ms. Braun got tired of writing and just quit. Come on!

Ms. Braun should retire if this is all she has to offer. Disappointing is the only word to use to describe The Cat Who Went Bananas.Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just not the same...","review":"I have been a \\"Cat\\" fan for years, and will continue to buy the latest book. I do believe, that someone is ghost writing for Lilian Jackson Braun (and I suspect that this has been the case since \\"The Cat Who Robbed the Bank\\"). While I applaud their efforts, the books lack something...We don't hear about the cats as much, and Koko does not seem to be doing much in solving the crimes.

After \\"TCW Sang for the Birds\\" the stories began getting a bit wonky; and then after book 23 \\"TCW Smelled a Rat\\" things just went sour for me.

I thought this book was going to get really good but it never did. I thought it was kind of boring because it really didn't have a point. It just rambled on and on. This book was only a little interesting when Quill was interviewing people for things to put in the book he is writing. This book was mostly boring though again becase it had no point, it would go to one subject and then not carry on with that and go to something completely different. Overall this book was just okay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cats sleep a lot. They must have read this book.","review":"Obviously, Braun has struck gold with her cat series; this is her 27th cat book. It is the first of the 27 that I have read, and the last. Nothing every happens, which is too bad because it is peopled with very interesting characters and a fabulous setting. There are also teasers of impending malfeasance, but they come to naught. Thankfully, it only took a day to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cat slipped on a banana","review":"I have all of the Cat Who books and they have progressively gotten thinner and thinner on the story line. I always enjoyed the way the cats help solve the mystery, but now there is just a nice story with no help from the cats on solving anything. In fact, the last two books have not had a mystery at all - just a happening and a conclusion. What a disappointment!! I'm not sure I'll buy any more of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the one where I gave up collecting the series.","review":"I've followed \\"The Cat Who\\" series from the beginning, but this is where it stops. There is no mystery, and, in my opinion the book rambles here and there. Even Qwill, not to mention the cats, has ceased to be an interesting character. I guess Lillian Brun has simply gotten too old to do more than hack away. It hurts a bit -- I've loved the series. And it's still better than some of the other modern mysteries I've read -- but only because I know and loved the characters. Anyhow, I won't be buying any of the new ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"really bad book","review":"This is the first and last book I will read in this series.

Just a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bananas or nuts?","review":"Like other reviewers I found this story lacking it's usual charm. The characters are stuck in time and are not developing. Writing a series is tough for that reason. The stories need to be interesting and the characters need to grow and change as real people do.

I struggled to get get past the first few pages. The other books were engaging and perfect for an easy read during rainy or cold days when one wants just simply to be entertained. I suspect the author just 'spit out' the formula and added exclamation points after every other sentence. Nothing about the writing seemed like the author was even interested in writing this story, so I couldn't get engaged in it. Hopefully, she'll be more interested in writing the next one, or simply retire the poor fellow in Moose County."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as bad as the last few books, but still not very good","review":"Im giving this one 2 stars-- it is a step back in the right direction. It is better than the last few books that preceded it-- they were 1 star disappointments.I'm still hoping that someday the series will return to the 4 and 5 star examples from the beginning of the series.Liek many others, I'm a big fan, but a disappointed one. I'm not complaining about the story lines, per se, but the way the author's development and delivery of the story has gone downhill to such a degree. The elements are there to write a good book- enough characters and events are introduced at the start. What is so disappointing is that all this potential is wasted-- we get another \\"alnost nothing happens\\" plot instead. Writing about events like Qwill going out to dinner (again!) seems to be the point now-- as opposed to advancing a plot line."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed...","review":"I picked up this book expecting a mystery, and I was sorely disappointed.

Yes, they are sometimes a little corny, sometimes a wee bit predictable, but always thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable. We wait anxiously each year for each new publication and found The Cat Who Went Bananas to be pleasurable listening. That is, until the ending, which left us wondering if our attention had lapsed and we had missed something. I ran the last tape back and listened to it again, but was left with the same thought of \\"What happened?\\". My wife, who had listened to it earlier, confided that she had also re-listened to the end of the last tape for the same reason and had the same question. I do not recommend this book to first time readers of The Cat Who series.

Why wasn't more explored on \\"Kenneth/Wesley's? part in the novel, and as for the Wix brothers? what was the real purpose? Was the fire really an accident of nature or arson? hmm. so many questions.And as for the Polly/ Qwill question, it seemed to me the relationship, so vitual to all other novels, was overlooked and added as a mere passing note.There are some really good thoughts in this book, i wish more had been explored.One final note, Ko ko and Yum Yum were hardly featured through-out. a shame since the novels became famous for them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where Oh Where Has My Lillian Gone?","review":"I wish I had read the reviews of this book before I purchased it instead of after.

Gone is the magicical interaction between Qwill, Koko and Yumm Yumm. I feel duped. Does anyone know if LBJ is even around anymore? Has anyone seen word of her doing book signings?

Luckily, I found a more \\"definitive guide\\" (hint to the title) by Colin Moock that covered the language pretty fully and left me with more answers than questions!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Flash from a different perspective.","review":"Great book but you will need to read it all to get the maximum benefit. You get good depth on actionscript but you will also learn how to structure your thinking from an actionscript based perspective vs. an artwork one. Good insite into bandwidth issues and how code driven behavior can openup a whole new world for a flash user. I am a designer who has dabbled in coding on and off and I was able to finish an game for a client in maybe 20 hours while I was learning ActionScript. Great place to start once you have had some time with flash's art tools."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Designers, But Comes up Short for Coders","review":"Both myself and a co-worker bought this book. I happened to read it first and since I am a coder at work, I was looking for the aspects of the book that would be most helpful for me in created Flash swfs. Honestly, this book is a great introduction. For someone who is learning Flash for the first time and has no programming background, it would be great. For me though, I found it lacking. I am an experienced web programmer and I while I liked the introductions to Action Script, I was a little bothered by the fact that the book didn't get indepth, leaving me to seek info in other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank God for designer to designer!","review":"This book will help lay the groundwork to understanding a very fun and exciting language. It is the perfect bridge for the intermediate Flash user who wants to begin to get to the meat of the program.Remember Wrox books? Sham, the author-God Bless him, has written this book, one of five others in the series..., not only allows you to completely follow along, but you'll also no longer feel like an idiot halfway through the book before you give up.Sham gives you all the detail you can handle with all the organization that will allow you to really learn Actionscript. You will literally become fascinated with the possibilities.Have fun with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"If you want to see this film because you loved \\"Being John Malkovich\\" you will almost certainly be disappointed. The two films are not of the same quality, they are not even in the same range of quality.I think Charlie Kaufman is one of the most important writers writing screenplays today, and everything I've read of his (from \\"Being John Malkovich\\" to \\"Adaptation\\") had been superb, but \\"Human Nature\\" simply did not translate well from page to screen.And I can't say that it is necessarily all Michael Gondry's fault in his direction. While, I think part of the problem is that Gondry didn't \\"get\\" the screenplay, part of the problem is that this was Kaufman's first script and while entertaining on the page, when put on screen, without the humorous writing style and Kaufman's cynical voice ... well, the filmable elements simply don't hold together.Wait for \\"Adaptation\\" or \\"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,\\" both of which promise to be better. They could hardly be worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, weird satire","review":"This movie was weird... no way around that. You have a neurotic doctor, who is obsessed with table etiquette (his newest experiment is teaching mice table manners), a hairy woman, her electolysist, an ape man, and a fake French girl... what an ensemble!Lyla was my favorite character in the movie... it was just too funny to see her shaving her whole body in the bathroom. I was sad when she decided to change for the crazy doctor! I thought Puff was hilarious--he did a great job playing the ape man! The whole story line was laugh-out-loud funny, but from the very beginning you could sense the message about the ridiculousness of human nature.This movie was making a statement, through all of the weird antics of the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"djlibra??

High hopes, but highly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Movie","review":"If there was a 0 star for a reating this movie would get it would get it. This movie is stupider than Kung Pow. This stupid movie isn't worth your time. You could easily just like watch any other movie for less price for this one.You won't even want to get this one for your collection. The people run around naked and there is way to much sex for a so called VIRGIN that is 32 years old. Ain't that sad. The man is a table manners freak and the chick is nuts. She instist on thinking she is a beast or animal and the other beast animal thing is crazy and to interested in woman even though he seeing his teacher and assistant having sex all the time when his teacher already has a girlfriend.

The authors are clear and concise in their understanding of the related scriptures. It states clearly we have no part in our salvation, it is all of God or not of God. Their argument based on scripture is that Christ's righteousness is what we need for salvation and eternal life. Christ's righteousness is imputed to those God has chosen. The book clearly goes over the differences between biblical faith and the Catholic faith plus works system. A must read for Catholics whose faith is undermined by the teachings of their church. The book is also a quick journey through church history and the Catholic church history. There is truth and the truth is out there, the truth of the scriptures and that truth is reiterated in this book which looks to Christ and Christ alone for salvation, an excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Introduction To An Important Doctrine.","review":"J. Vernon McGee once commented that, after a sermon on prophesy, commented to a deacon that a lot of people would have not liked that sermon. The deacon responded that his sermon was nothing -- the subject that would make the audience mad was grace.This book is great at introducing the subject, and helping a person get a handle on the subject. The authors for the most part succeeded in being able to be understood.I found the project on Sola Scriptura to be better done than this one. I found the appendix (\\"Rome NOT Home\\") to be unnecessary and even more rambling than the other articles. Also, this book promoted Calvinism more so than the \\"Sola Scriptura\\" volume, implying that unless you are a 5 point Calvinist you have a wrong understanding of salvation by faith alone. Wrong. I do not consider myself Calvinist (or Arminian for that matter), and I feel I understand the subject properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of misunderstandings spoil this book.","review":"The book is spoiled because it does not understand the Catholic teaching on justification which it is trying to rebut.

And they're not really stellar compositions, IMHO. Big deal. Plus, the original included a fourth disk (3 live performances and a music video). Why couldn't they have included this on the reissue? Maybe someone needs to ask the fans what they would like to see, for a refreshing change.

Still some of these idiots stick to them like dogdroppings to the heel, but their music nowadays is heared by anarchic punks and \\" normal\\" people alike. This album is typical for them, it doesn\`t sound very new compared to their other works, still I think it\`s great, some knowledge of German is helpful to understand what I mean.

I don't like that the foam they provide to pad the lid (and keep the mixer in place during transport) screws up my channel settings. I don't like that I have to remove the mixer from the case in order to use it. I don't like that the glue holding the velcro from the cleats has already given out.It good for what it is...

I know that grape flavor is usually artificial and that I should not expect much, but really -- there is hardly any flavor but plain sweet in these. Not even the \\"bubblegum\\" flavor like Bazooka Joe or something. Just straight up sugar.These are also hollow. Each is an empty shell about 1\\" in diameter, but a hollow globe with about a 1/8\\" wall. Partially because of this, by the time the package got to me, many of the gum \\"balls\\" were shattered, leaving little shards of gum in the bag.Chewing both the little shards and biting down on each new hollow globe of gum risks cutting the inside your mouth.Just not very good. Unless you actually operate a gumball machine for money, I would recommend sticking with Bubblicious grape or something like that. I know I will from this point on."},{"rating":"1","title":"National lampoons the movie","review":"I thought that this movie was going to be so funny and a great watch but in fact all it was a bunch of naked parts and sexual behavior. I am a big big fan of the jackass crew and was so excited when I found this. I was very disappointed in what it was about. There were some funny parts that made me laugh but the whole movie is just basically a porn. This is way way more for guys then girls that's for sure. I also wanted to see more of Chris and he has such a small part, that made me sad. I would say rent this movie before you buy it because you may be unhappy with what you get.

There was a lot of potential there, parodies of \\"Fear Factor\\" and \\"Miami Vice\\". The entire thing was painfully unfunny, lots of drug use and pointless violence and homosexuality. The MTV Cribs parody PADS merely showed steve-O's \\"house\\" littered with booze and drugs and he stumbled about half-nude and cursing. I wouldnt wish this movie on my enemies.

It has most of the cast of Jackass minus arguably the two biggest stars-Bam and Johnny. The dvd came with a cool looking tv guide based on the movie as an insert and the menu to the movie was like the tv guide channel. I'd give them 5 stars for those two things alone. Sadly, the movie has a few funny scenes but alot of it is unfunny. If you're a big Jackass fan then you might enjoy it but if your a casual fan who likes Jackass on occassion, then this movie is not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star is WAYYYY TOO Many!!!","review":"I have seen bad movies in my time, but this is a top ten contender. Anyone could make a film like this. Buy a camcorder and you could. Sheer crap!!! It is like a 7th grader made a film in his spare time . There is no plot, nor is it funny. I guess this is why it is selling on Amazon now as I write this review, for a penny new which is way too much. National Lampoon used to make good films like Animal House. Now if it says National Lampoon I say avoid it like the plague. I am throwing my copy in the trash. I am ashamed anyone will see I own this.

Is this really necessary?","review":"What is the point of releasing an unrated version of a movie that wasn't good enough to be released in the first place? As a rabid Jackass fan I snatched this up the first time I saw it at the video store. My wife was the sensible one and refused to watch it with me. This isn't even remotely funny. What could be added to this that wasn't in the original release? More nudity? More cursing? More of Steve-O on a not only unfunny but truly frightening drug binge that when I first watched this I said to myself that he either needed to enter rehab or he was going to die very soon (Glad he went with rehab). Seriously I love the Jackass guys and I try to support them in whatever they do, but this is just bad. It is truly unwatchable. There are two things I remember about this movie they are Chris Pontius playing Jesus (funny considering his infamous skit on Jackass) and feeling just sad and scared for Steve-O."},{"rating":"1","title":"not funny and actually kind of sad","review":"Being a HUGE Jackass fan when I saw this at the video store I snatched it up and settled in for some hilarity. What I got was a confusing mish mash of unfunny sketches and a truly disturbing view of Steve-O spiraling towards rock bottom in his apartment (really proud of O for getting the help he needed since then) Over all wouldn't recommend. The only remotely entertaining bit is Pontius as Jesus. Definately don't buy and only rent if you are morbidly curious about how bad this movie truly is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite \\"The Best of...\\"","review":"In my opinion, it's not \\"the best of...\\"I like about half the songs.

The line-up of artists is stronger, and the quality of songs exceeds the first album. It is nice to see that these type projects continue to be successful.The best songs of the album include \\"Sing Alleluia\\", \\"Hide Me in Your Heart\\", \\"Hallowed\\" and \\"Communion\\". They alone make the album worth a listen. But, the other songs are also strong. In fact, there is no real weak song among the group.If you like the Christian artists who participated in the making of this album (Third Day, Caedmon's Call, FFH, Jars of Clay, Jennifer Knapp, etc.) buy it, you will not be disappointed. Or, if you are looking for a nice mix of different talents from the modern Christian music scene, this will fit your need. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't quite have the same formula","review":"One of the strong points of the first City on a Hill disc was it's true collaboration between disparate groups of artists. Although that tradtion continues into this disc, one of the points where it falls short, in my mind, is that the majority of the disc is done by one backing band made up of Nashville studio musicians. Instead of a community of sound, you end up getting one sound throughout the disc that is forgettable at best. Also, the music is not nearly as engaging as the first disc. Songs that are memorable, worshipful and inspiring are no where to be found short of track 2. A better follow up is \\"Enter the Worship Circle 2\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"CD purchase","review":"This CD was in great condition when I got it, but unfortunately the sender did not include enough postage to get it here.

But that's not the worst part. The so-called \\"doctor\\" whom the teenage daughter is seeing makes a joke about billing his schizophrenic patient twice, implying that people with schizophrenia have two personalitys. No real psychologist would ever think or say that. That is an urban myth that is wide-spread among people who don't know much about psychology but doctors have always known the difference between schizophrenia and multiple personality disorder. I was annoyed by that joke because I have schizoaffective disorder and know A LOT about mental illnesses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome new alternative rock band","review":"This is one of those CDs where you aren't sorry you bought \\"the whole thing\\". It has something for everyone. Some songs are heavy and/or fast, some are more up beat and/or slow, and there's everything in between. \\"Better Part of Me\\", \\"After the Fall\\", \\"Could I've Been\\", and \\"Caught in the Sun\\" are the ones that appeal to me. \\"Remain\\", \\"Gain\\", and \\"1000 Times\\" are a little to \\"dark\\" for my taste, but my taste tends to lean toward the lighter side. Other people say those are their favorite songs. :) You won't get bored listening for sure because the songs don't all sound the same. I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who likes rock music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great cd from a great band","review":"It's hard to find a band that sounds different from many other things out there. I really think that Course of Nature has a very unique sound: sometimes it's deep, but it can easily turn to ravious or terrifyingly dark at any point. The songs are a great mixture of plain, direct, easy-to-understand lyrics but with great meaning and a driving electric guitar and drums. A MUST for any rock fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Guys","review":"These boys started out about 10 miles from where I live. They have been kicking ass since day one. This CD rocks!

I heard of them when they played the single \\"Caught In The Sun\\" on my local radio station. I instantly thought the song was a strong song and maybe there would be more strong songs on the album. But the best songs on this are \\"Wall of Shame\\", \\"Caught In The Sun\\", \\"Someone Else To You\\" and \\"1000 Times\\". Maybe this band is the underdog band for right now but they write good songs and that's all that matters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't recommend the Kindle Edition","review":"If you're considering this title in the Kindle edition - think twice.

Familiar territory but well done. Then the book moves into a more detailed discussion of evolution, especially of mammals. This part can be a little dense at times (for the non-Biologist at least). Lastly, there's kind of a strange digression into linguistics, animal intelligence, and ethics.The author writes well and was amusing at times. TTBH started out really interesting but the author seemed to lose focus as he went along. By the end, I was just glad the book was out of pages.

Perhaps it was a bad apple.There was essentially only one problem with our unit, which is that it freezes while playing DVD's. I can't tell if it is due to scratches, because after ejecting the DVD and playing the same portion again, it sometimes works fine. At any rate, it won't play any movies without freezing, choking, skipping and generally making us miserable.I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend and was HIGHLY EMBARASSED when it refused to play properly with DVD after DVD after DVD!

We spent the majority of the film commenting on the typical horror film stupidity of the various characters--i.e., inability to run away from the monster without falling over, thereby making themselves easy prey;the monster is hiding just out of sight of the hero; someone gets the stupid idea to take the only means of transport for the group and the only (halfway)gun and go looking for the beast while everyone else is asleep, then LEAVES the gun in the truck (and gets killed, duh); the hero tries to get help but puts the remaining survivors in a worse situation than before...and on it goes.If you love bigfoot movies, by all means, go ahead and watch this film.The yeti-creature doesn't look half-bad, even if I didn't find it particularly scary, and the scenery is beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do snowboarders taste like chicken?","review":"Yep it is another formula \\"stay in the car\\" movie. Everyone sees the creature and does not believe what they see until they get dispatched; then they do not care. Most of the victoms are too clumsy to get away and become creature chow. I am surprised they did not try to make a pet out of it like a stray cat or maybe give it religion so it will change its carnivorous ways.The underlying themes are how people behave under pressure. A girl thinks her father is not listening. The father thinks the girl has a rotten attitude. The female scientist thinks everyone is a pansy and armed with a camera will force the beast to say cheese. The third wheel male scientist spouts wisdom and then falls prey to altruistic machoism.Will they ever learn their lessons or will the beast get fat and die from clogged arteries?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Revolting Special Effects","review":"This could have been a good movie.

Jeff Goldblum, as usual, plays a very boring scientist who invents a matter transformation device that gets his DNA mixed up with a fly's, that's pretty much all there is to it, nothing else happens except his girlfriend decides she wants an abortion. The SFX were fake and unbeliveable and unlike other people I never felt sick to my stomach once in this movie except twards the acting.

But, it is until Seth meets journalist Veronica Quaife who inspires Seth to correct the system, that Seth achieves successful teleportation. But something goes horribly wrong, when Seth uses himself as a guinea-pig in a matter transmission experiment, as he teleports himself, unaware his genes have been fused with a house fly that was trapped in the telepod with him. Seth, now finds himself slowly transforming into a terrifying mutant creature known as \\"Brundlefly\\" as he finds himself in a fierce battle as his mutated genes begins to take over. I can't express how much I love The Fly. It's more than just horror, and it's proof that you just may find a truly great movie where you least expect it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fly (1986)","review":"As disgusting and terrifying as this remake--it's a loose adaptation of the 1958 film of the same name--is, it's equally heartbreaking and ends in great tragedy. Gore-master David Cronenberg directed and co-wrote the screenplay for this sci-fi horror, and instilled grievous discomfort within moviegoers unlike he ever had (and probably ever will again). Oddball scientist Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) meets a journalist named Veronica (Geena Davis) at a business get-together and takes her back to his lab, where he's perfected his newest invention: a pair of telepods that can teleport matter from one to the other. However, when Seth tries to teleport himself, he and Veronica are dealt gruesome and unforgiving results. The Fly redefined the word \\"grotesque\\", and will certainly forever be associated with it; yet its understanding of sensitivity was a catalyst in creating its legacy, and it remains one of the film's most palpable traits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks GREAT on blu-ray!!","review":"I hadn't seen this movie pretty much since it first came out. A minor classic. For me, the blu-ray transfer was first class. The film looked crisp and sharp and I could see fine details in it so I was perfectly happy with it. I didn't own it on DVD before so it was a no-brainer to buy it on Blu-ray, especially for under $10. If you don't own it on DVD, get the blu-ray. If you already have the DVD, that's a tougher call."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fly","review":"The Fly is a disgusting grotesque film but cronenberg is known for this garbage not to mention ruining movies(The Brood,Scanners,the dead zone with the exception of Eastern Promises). Goldblum is good for the role,he is a good actor and geena davis is good in this but the movie as typical are remakes simply doesn't cut it even with disgusting special effects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't be Afraid...","review":"Fresh from the success of 'Videodrome' and 'The Dead Zone' Canadian Director David Cronenberg's update of the 1958 Vincent Price classic is now, as stated by most, a horror classic itself. Jeff Goldblum stars as Seth Brundle, a little known inventor of the first ever Telepod. At first turning anything living inside-out, Brundle finally cracks the genetic code and prepares to teleport himself with disastrous consequences. Spliced with a fly that accidentally flew in as the chamber door closed and locked, Brundle has a dramatic and painful transition into a human fly, Brundlefly. Quirky quotes and buckets of gore come in equal doses as Cronenberg's reworking of the classic tale quickly unfolds into a desperate race for survival. With horrific images that would make the toughest stomachs turn, Horror doesn't usually come any better than this. Geena Davis and John Getz costar."},{"rating":"2","title":"The movie arrived in very good condition and was received promptly.

All the immature fools that hit 30 and pine for those carefree college days, even Old Blue, the 80 year-old pledge, oh, to go back to those nubile young drunken girls and the total lack of any reality based responsibility or meaningful relationship, those were the days my friend. We thought they'd never end, etc.Look, the jokes are college prat, but there's some laugh-out-loud. The Will Ferrell go-nutso scenes especially, the tranquializer dart scene, the nude romp in front of the wife's friends, and the zany hazing scenes are very funny. My special comedy success meter, the wifey laughed out loud as if on happy gas again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY weak: not even worth renting","review":"Not even comedy man Will Ferrell's appearance or Luke Wilson's charm, save this movie from the same place where movies such as Joe Dirt come from. There are a few moments that are probably bound to becoming classics, but unfortunately, if you saw the trailer, you saw most of the good stuff that the movie has to offer. When I first thought of the concept (a fraternity put together by guys already graduated, married and/or already entrenched in their professional lives) I thought: \\"clever idea, must be funny.\\" How wrong I was! For a comedy it falls short by a lot. The storyline could have gone in a lot of brilliant directions but it didn't. We rented it. It's not even worth renting, even if you get it for free because it's a guaranteed title in Blockbuster and they are out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply awesome","review":"The gradual disappearance of quality non-PC comedies in the last few years has been a downer, but every so often something comes out of nowhere and makes me roll on the floor with laughter - this is Old School, the funniest movie since Road Trip (incidentally made by the same people, too). If Old School was shown to the Taliban, they would put down their weapons and toast to world peace over kegs and strippers. The extras on the DVD are worth it, especially the deleted scene with Vince Vaughn inside the store run by his character, as is the Inside The Actor's Studio Spoof.

And, to top it off (as I'm sure you've already read), the fact that it is \\"unrated\\" is a total joke.

He moves out and lives in a house near the University and when his best friend Bernard (Vince Vaughn) finds out he convinces him to start a fraternity so that they can party every night and meet girls.

Despite a few sporadically funny scenes, the story never comes together and the characters are never as developed as the Deltas and Omegas from ANIMAL HOUSE.I've just read an article about how today's comedy is reaching the high standards of the 70's/80's (BLAZING SADDLES, SNL, SCTV, Monty Python, ANIMAL HOUSE, CADDYSHACK)--but the only problem is that this current crop of comic filmmakers have yet to produce a bonafide classic.Recycling TV shows (STARSKY & HUTCH) and youth/college formulas are not the way to do it.But if they choose that route, they should at least make something funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"It's hard to make a really funny movie now-a-days this movie will make you wet you pants in only the way will ferell can.

Three adults, played by the capable cast of Will Ferrell, Vince Vaughan and Luke Wilson, have all hit a crossroads in life and circumstances force Luke Wilson's character to move into a house on a college campus. There is the obligatory wild party and crazy college antics, but Old School seems like a movie without a clue of what it wants to be about. Is this going to be a movie just about crazy adults who start a college fraternity, or is it going to be about some crazy adults who are trying to find their way in life, and along the way start a fraternity. Scenes seem spliced together, going from a frat party to a birthday party for Vince Vaughan's kids. Then the conclusion is incredibly ridiculous.

The movie is still pretty funny, hence the 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will Ferrell in all his glory.","review":"So this is what Will Ferrell has been doing since leaving NBC's Saturday Night Live.

I finally saw it last night and I've got to say this is a HUGE disappointment. There were a few laugh out loud scenes...like the rendition of \\"Total Eclipse\\" at the wedding, Will Ferrell being naked and then another scene when he almost drowns in a pool, but for the most part this movie was BORING. Like another reviewer said, L.Wilson does act the same way as he does in all of his movies. I really think he'd make a better dramatic actor. As for Will, I really expected Ferrell to make us laugh, but considering the \\"serious\\" personalities of the actors he had to work with, I think it affected his comedic ability. I say pass on this movie. You're not missing anything. Catch it if its on HBO or something..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost Worthless","review":"Why a couple of very talented people like Luke Wilson and Vince Vaughn would get involved in something like this is beyond me. This movie never gets up to speed, the situations are trite and cliche, and with the exception of Luke Wilson's character, who actually has some depth (and then he does something completely out of character and it ruins any sense of credibility that he has developed), there isn't a role in this movie that is at all believable, and more importantly, there is very little that is funny. It isn't Animal House, it isn't American Pie.....it's just a whole lot of one-liners and 15 second sophmoric humor stretched to 3-5 minutes per gag. It's a good thing Will Ferrel made \\"Elf\\", becuase if this was the best he could do, he should have stayed on SNL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old School is Vulgar","review":"i dont get these teen movies anymore theyre vulgar and naugty. Kids want to see them because they want to see some sex but thaats beond the point. The point is that these movies like Old School go overboard. The olny teen movie I enjoyed was American Pie. It was vulgar but not as vulgar as Old School. In Old School theres this Old man who's in a tub with naked woman and hes telling them to stroke his lobes how is that funny. I think its iommature and gross"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply stupid.","review":"I must say that I had an enormous expectation for this movie. It was sold out everywhere and I heard that it was fantastic. So I finally got it and went straight home to see it and in the beginnig I was excited and the minutes started to pass and nothing funny was happening. So after one hour I started to skip the scenes to see something good but actually never happened.This movie doesn't have a strong argument, it's supposed to be unrated but I never saw a scene with something \\"unrated\\", it's terrible it has some good ideas but the directores and producers didn't know how to develop them.I strongly DON'T recommend this \\"movie\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"MEDIOCRE AT BEST","review":"It starts off okay, but the laughs are too far and inbetween. Will Farell is okay, but he starts to get annoying about halfway through. Luke Wilson is really good in quirky roles, but he fails miserably as the straight man here. Vince Vaughn is great as always, but he can't save it. Rent this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"POINTLESS!","review":"Old School is one of the worst movies I have ever seen! Will Ferrel is one of the greatest American comedy actors ever. But if I was basing his career on this movie. I'd say he's one of the worst. This movie was a bland, boring movie with a predictable ending. I won't spoil it, but I'm sure you've seen this kind of ending numerous times. This comedy had some funny parts, but that's the only reson it gets 2 stars. The story line was terrible. DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you Kidding me!??!","review":"How dare some people compare this yawn to a classic like Animal House. This movie was terrible. I love a comedy as much as the next guy but come on, give me a break. This was a bad story (been done to many times before) bad acting, bad jokes, bad everything. For you people who compare this to Animal House you need a class on classic comedies. Go rent Airplane, Animal House, even Hot Shots but dont waste your time with this tragedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"You just have to see this movie. Will Ferrel, right that, that's a reason.When you watch this movie you will laugh, you will think it's silly and you will find yourself letting go to just have fun. Old School is a great comedy about some guys who like to have fun, to want to live a bit in the past and don't see the need to play by the rules. Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA...","review":"I know several persons in their early 30's that will tell you that this movie is closer to a true story than you think...A midlife traumatic break up mixed with lots of partying and little self-control.Once again a movie with one of my favorite people, Will Ferrell. He has a way of stealing every scene that he is in, and this movie is no different. Together with mr \\"i talk all the time\\" Vince Vaughn and \\"i look insecure no matter what\\" Luke Wilson they are a very good comedic gang. I watched the unrated edition on dvd and of course they have tried to put as many pairs of breasts they can get away with :) But this is a simple and funny movie. Will Ferrel goes streaking through the city, Sean William Scott does a small role as an abusive animal trainer and Snoop does a cameo. All in all i think people will enjoy this movie. Although it is not exceptionally good, it is good enough to have a few laughs and enjoy yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"I was hoping that I would enjoy watching Old School, since it had Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughn. It failed to make me laugh. I know lots of other people admire this film, but I didn't find it very funny. Sure, the plot worked and the characters were actually convincing, but I found the jokes to be very weak in many parts. Oh well, next time when I watch this comedy again, maybe then I'll find it extremely hilarious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny comedy","review":"Nothing special, just a funny movie that makes you laugh. Some people might not like it as much as others, but there's a few scenes, no matter who you are, you'll laugh out loud. Worth a watch for sure, and I personally think it's worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE CAST IS GREAT BUT THE ROMANCE PARTS ARE BORING","review":"I saw the movie at a special screening and it was really funny. Luke Wilson was really funny and Will Farrel was great too. There were a couple of really funny scenes and you will laugh a lot because the script is pretty good. The only thing I didn't like was that everyone was a loser in love and that made the movie a little less funny. The daughter from 24 and Leah Remini from the King Of Queens are in it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"All-time classic","review":"Old School will go down as an all-time classic comedy!

From beginning to end, you will experience a whole range of laughter.. From little giggles, to the laugh out loud, to the laughing-so-hard-you-cry-laugh. Will Ferrell rules the movie by playing a hilarious character that only he could pull off sucessfully.

They say that it's to save Luke Wilson's character from losing his house, but really it's just an excuse for them to party, get drunk, and have lots of fun again. I had very low expectations for this movie because I'm not a big fan of Will Ferrel - he's never really made me laugh that much before... But this movie shocked me at how funny it really is. Don't expect to be watching an Oscar contender; but it's not meant to be one. It's meant to be stupid and silly and funny - and it is. watch it! you'll laugh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"i see blue...and he looks glorious!\\"","review":"This movie had me laughing non stop throughout the whole thing.

With talent in this movie, I expected alot better. This movie, and Road Trip before it, are horribly directed and contain few laughs. Ferrel was by far the funniest part of this movie (fiery hoop, streaking, and tranq dart scenes.) The movie is pointless, but is a good popcorn movie. It really lacks on original jokes."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the Hype about this?","review":"I watched this on DVD yesterday and wasn't impressed. The plot is taken from movies such as Animal House and Revenge of the Nerds: Misfits overcome adversity to prevail. The comedy is funny, but not that funny. The most intriguing character is Vince Vaughn's: the party boy and instigator of all the craziness who is carrying around his son the whole time being a dad. Other than that, a lot of the movie is a let down. What's the point of that one fat guy doing the vault with the scrawny guy spotting him? He does the vault successfully with no squashing the little guy. Big whoop. That pretty much summarizes the movie. Lots of build up with no payoff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lowbrow humor at it's best","review":"If you're looking for laughs without being challenged, this is a great way to spend a couple of hours.

It's more like an egyptian kit to make customers spend money for nothing. It has a booklet (I can't call that a book), quite superficial although it's full color. The book only contains general information about some very few aspects of egiptian culture. The book itself doesn't correspond to the calendar cards and the oracle figure cards. You would have expected the little book to be some sort of \\"manual\\" to use the oracle. Well, there's no such a thing, except for the free page, out of the book, with a couple of paragraphs that are suposed to be the \\"oracle\\" instructions. As for the oracle itself, it's useless.

Because he punctures the myth of permanent economic expansion with such merciless glee. This work offers incredible insight into the social psychology that tempted so many Americans to bet their all on a quick fortune in the stock market during the 1920s -- and the blind panic that drove the market into a headlong freefall when thousands of suckers realized, too late, that they'd been had.You have one guy, posting under different names, who has gone through Galbraith's entries on this site, trying to trash the man's reputation through innuendo and outright lies. Read his works for yourself. I think you'll find that Galbraith outclasses the dead apologists for the Hapsburg empire (Von Mises and Hayek)and their modern-day apostles, whose fury rises higher and higher as more people reject their mindless, far right-wing propaganda."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great crash of 1929","review":"A Classic!

The scenarios depicted have not hitherto been presented elsewhere. It dealt with the cold financial figures as well as the snippets of emotional side of human dramas behind.It is also a tremendously valuable piece of work in terms of its contribution to history on the topic. It should serve as a valuable \\"BIble\\" for people working intimately with the financial circles, when they construct their policy - with the Great Crash as a background reminder.

My edition has a printing history going back to 1954. The stock market crash is a point in history that I've tried to understand. mmm...the bankers kept pumping money into the system...until they couldn't do it anymore. Who were these people and how did this happen? Well, today I picked it up again.According to Galbraith, the US economy was already in a Depression by October 1929 as the stock market reacts to the economy and never the reverse. It became fashionable for working people to get into the stock market. Before the crash, there were some signs of economic downturn, but no one expected the disaster it became. It was a bubble that had to be pricked. This sounds so familiar now.In John Kenneth Galbraith's able hands, the story is revealed.

Given the state-of-the-art sound engineering technology that is out there these days, I hope EMI decides to revisit the vaults and dig up the best preserved master tapes and remaster these in stereo and clean up as much of the sound as is possible for re-release. That would be the only way to do justice to the memory of this all-time guitar great.

I couldn't stand the feel of them on my fingers much less putting these next to my baby's skin. I like the idea of a one size diaper - but not the idea of nothing but man made fabric. Wouldn't recommend them for anyone. Am selling the ones I bought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend a little extra to get the BumGenius Organic with snaps.","review":"I am really disappointed in these diapers. I wish I would not have gone with the velcro, it is already showing signs of ware and the diapers are only a few weeks old. These diapers are also a pain to stuff. It takes forever!Also, the diapers are not absorbant enough for night use because my little one nurses all night long...and he goes A LOT. There is no way these diapers could ever come close to being enough so we're still using our Mother-ease one size (doubled up) with separate cover for night time.If I could purchase again I would go with the Bum Genius Organic, with snaps. The organic are a bit more pricey but don't require stuffing. They are plenty absorbant enough for day time use. As far as night goes, I do not believe that any all-in-one diaper could ever have enough absorbability."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Leak","review":"Not sure if we are doing something wrong, however, we have been using disposables for 18 months and decided to try the cloth ones to save money and the environment. Although they fit nicely on our kid, they leaked within the first hour of use. Judging from almost 100% positive reviews here, I feel very surprised and disappointed. They fell very comfortable thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great initially","review":"We bought the Bum Genius One Size diapers when my son was about 3 months old, after trying biodegradables, G-diapers and regular cloth. They were superb. So easy to use and no leaks EVER! That however was then. My son is now 19 months old and we had hoped to use these same diapers on our next baby, but over the last two or three months they have really started to fall apart. The elastic is gone or going on all (we have 22), and the velcro is starting to lose its stick too. It's been a great run - over a year, with multiple hot washes and no complaints, but sadly we are going to have to say goodbye. My overall impression is fantastic, but for those of you who think these will be the only diapers you ever buy, think again. I would certainly recommend them as a wonderful alternative to disposables, and probably the easiest and most effective cloth diapers on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"One size wonder","review":"Yup, this diaper fits my newborn and my 15 month old!

I figured a pocket diaper would be easier to get on him while he was all over the place. I have a good stash of Fuzzi Bunz and thought nothing could beat them until I tried these. Now, I wish I had found these sooner! The adjustible-size feature is a bonus, although I am skeptical they would fit a tiny baby very well. I think I would still prefer cotton Nicky covers plus infant prefolds (and flushable or fleece liners) for that purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy, long term cloth diaper","review":"This diaper has worked well for us since our daughter was born at 6 lbs in June. It can be stuffed, washed and dried easily, and the fabric stays dry for hours. The one size feature is a great money saver long-term. Very few moisture leaks when the waist tabs weren't closed tightly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Cloth!","review":"I could not believe how easy these cloth diapers are to use. While they are a little bulky, they are super cute and super absorbent. With my son's disposable diapers I was changing him once at night and he was still waking up wet. When I used the Bum Genius with a typical insert and doubler, he woke up dry! I couldn't believe how well the cloth contains messy poop diapers as well. We have yet to experience leaks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very soft diaper","review":"Bumgenius are probably the softest diaper I have used on my son. They don't seem to hold stains like some of the other diapers and fit very well (so no leaks). However, they are expensive and take a long time to dry. I prefer the pocket diapers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved them at first.","review":"Loved these at first. We had the 2.0 version and then bought the 3.0 version. I wanted to make sure we had a large enough stash size so I bought 36 in total. Well, within about 6 months of use the velcro on all of them was trashed. We have a front loader and I was using Country Save detergent and followed their directions exactly. I didn't think much about it, but then they started leaking...EVERY.SINGLE.TIME. I called and was given a list of things to try to strip them and they offered to send velcro tabs for me to replace myself, but as a busy mom of 3 I DO NOT have the time to sew. SO...I'm disappointed in their durability overall and after spending time on other diapering forums I see I'm not the only one. I wish I had read more reviews before purchasing.The positives: They are one size and have a good fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't hold up over the long term","review":"I have used the 3.0 with aplex closures for almost 3 yrs, and two babies. The diaper materials and inserts have held up well overall. However, the aplex is a disappointment. I have replaced it twice - once using the Bum Genius replacements and once using a stronger material from the fabric store. My own replacements worked much better. Additionally, replacing the tabs created holes in the stretch fabric to which they attach. So now that part of the diapers is beginning to fail. For the price I very much expected these diapers to be superior performers. I have added to my stash with much less expensive pocket diapers with snaps and they have performed much better. I would caution anyone who is considering investing in these diapers for use with multiple children."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"I bought these diapers for my daughter to use on her daughter. They didn't fit my granddaughter until she was nearly a month old and she was an average size baby at birth. They are easy to put on the baby and work well once on. They are a huge pain to reassemble after washing. After about one year of use, the velcro quit sticking very well and the diapers were looking very worn. When my granddaughter was a little over a year, she was too large for the diapers despite being well within the advertised size range. I replaced them with a much less expensive alternative-fitted diapers with separate covers, that were just as absorbent, did not require any reassembly prior to use after washing and large enough to fit her until she was potty trained. In summary, bum genius diapers are not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too expensive for the poor quality.","review":"I own 4 of these diapers which I've been using on my son since he weighed about 11 pounds. He weighs 25 now and they still fit him well. I will not be able to use them on future children until they fit into the largest size setting because the buttons that you use to snap the diaper into a smaller size have all come out of the PUL and retreated into the diaper. I will have to either spend some time fixing all four diapers or just use my FuzziBunz One Size diapers next time. I'm disappointed given the price per diaper. I will not buy or suggest this brand to anyone. FuzziBunz One Size are in perfect shape still which I've used as long as the BGs. Also, the velcro closure on the BG diapers are curling and don't hold very well anymore. Overall, a poorly made diaper that's priced way beyond what it's worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Velcro doesn't work","review":"This Bumgenius is quite good as there is no leakage except that the velcro stops working in couple of weeks making the diaper useless; go for Fuzzi bunz instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Earth & Budget friendly","review":"I was hesitant to use cloth & these bumGenius diapers make it as easy as possible. Cloth diapers have changed SO much in the past 15 years. They're snug but they give. They come apart for washing. And they work just as well as the disposable diapers. Our one year old does fine in them. I found it's best to run them through a pre-wash cycle & then a regular cycle. I save a lot of money & landfill space every month. I only wish I'd have switched sooner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok, I'll use them!","review":"These are so much better than the first cloth diapers we used that I don't mind using them. Easy to change and they don't leak easily. They take a long time to dry so turn around use time means you need several sets. I also like how they adjust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best cloth diaper we've tried so far.","review":"Our baby has never had a blow out with these and only very occasionally wets through one during the night. We do add an extra doubler at night.

A little costly, but I did the math and figured that in 3 months I would have broken even by buying disposable diapers, and would save over $1500 with my youngest by the time she is potty-trained.Although they are one-size-fits-all, my 29 pound 2 year old leaks through in less than 2 hours. They are also MUCH bulkier than disposables.However, my 8 month old (with very sensitive skin) has had virtually no diaper rash or irritation with these diapers, and they are so soft!I would not recommend buying these diapers for 2+ year old children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Save the planet","review":"I like the way they look in my baby plus they don't leak in night time, great color , high qualitymaterials, just follow the instruction sand you will love them forever.No more changing disposables diapers and pollutin the earth."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't recommend","review":"At first I liked the product even though it is a pain to wash and a somewhat gross task. I figured its for the environment. When my daughter was 15 months more than half of the diapers started coming apart with the velcro. I spend over 400 dollars in diapers and they are defective. The company gave me a hard time returning them to be fixed. I had to pay my own shipping and handling for their defective product. I would not recommend these as it has been a huge inconvenience."},{"rating":"2","title":"mmm... mac.","review":"I will never buy a PC again! Everything in a neat little package right out of the box! I've been using PC's for 15yrs and I was tired of fighting the good fight day in and day out. This is the first Mac I have every owned... it took me about 15 minutes to get used to it. The only thing I had trouble with was, everything was SOO easy that I kept thinking \\"is that it? that can't be all you have to do.\\" I made a book in iphoto for my sister for a gift, she said it was the best present she every got.

Bootcamp makes being mac os user way easier. Now you have the best of both worlds. The only thing I found dissappointing about this machine was the lack of 3d support. This machine will be a dissapointment for gamers. I wish apple would somehow make a portable 12, 13 inch laptop. Be it a macbook (customizable perhaps)or a macbook pro.

I did not think I would enjoy using it as much as other laptops I have owned. The chiclet keys looked kind of funny and the glossy screen would bother me--This keyboard is the easiest to type on; so soft on your fingers and the spacing between keys is good so I don't make too many typos. Also, I never notice the reflection in the screen and it is the brightest thing I have ever seen on a laptop! The wide screen and high resolution makes it easy to multi task with many windows. Not to mention this thing is smoking fast!It is handy that it is so light to take with me all the time when I travel. The battery lasts for hours and hours longer than any other laptop I've ever used. And the black color keeps it looking professional, clean and sleek. I have to admit that I did not think that this laptop would be able to compare for someone like me who considers himself a pro user... I can say it definitely does!"},{"rating":"2","title":"4 1/2 Starts, good hardware, but not perfect.","review":"I'm very happy purchasing my first Mac book after being a PC person ever since I started using computers. I only give this a 4 1/2 starts because its not perfect, but its a nice change from using a PC. After I saw Vista was pre-installed on every PC laptop out there, I thought that a mac that can run both OS and Windows XP was right up my ally. Overall this is a nice machine that is powerful, stable, and for the most part very easy to use. I have yet to tinker with what a mac has to offer, but I don't mind learning, since Mircosofts failure to provide was a blessing for Macs alike. There are only a few things l'd like to point out on the designs. The way you rest your hands, the edges feel sharp on your palms, so prolong periods of typing isn't going to be very confertable. Other then the minor adjustments, this hardware matches up nicely to any laptop even for the price, this is the better investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best laptop so far","review":"This is by far the best portable laptop out there. I've been a Mac user for some time now and always loved the uniqueness in Apple products. It is unfair to give them a poor feedback due retailers like Amazon not honoring rebates or as one of the reviewers complain \\" sharp edges on the note book\\". What planet does this guy lives in? I wonder if he ever read a hard cover book without cutting himself. My advice is to check this laptop in person and test drive it in the store. When you do, you will see how fast this laptop is comparing your windows based laptop. I agree with one of the reviewers regarding the fan and heat issue. But all laptops do. This is an area Apple came a long way. The macbooks heats not as much as its predecessors. In fact see the latest review on the Macworld regarding this issue. Other than that this laptop is flawless so far. Hopefully I will never have to return to a PC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black mac makes me the mack.","review":"I already used the Macbook Pro for over a year now and I picked this up for my wife to replace her older laptop. After testing it out for a month already, I do recommend this laptop.For close to half the price of the Macbook Pro, it includes a lot of the features: great build quality, simple and elegant looks, and blazingly fast performance. It also would be the choice mac for people on the go as it does have better battery life and a smaller form factor.Definitely, I would have liked a few things: 2GB of RAM would be on par with similar PC models and the monitor adaptor should have been included in the box rather than charging $20 as an accessory. I think for the extra money spent on the black finish, these extra's should have been included.Aside from that, my wife loves the lappy which is the most important thing for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Computer I've Ever Owned.","review":"This laptop is quick and has everything pre-installed.

The smell of the seasoning was good but when I used it and even tasted the seasoning straight from the jar there was nothing but a nasty bitter taste. I has someone else try it and they did not like it at all saying it make the pizza have a very bitter taste. So this product was a waste of money as was the no salt beef and chicken base.

If you want more, you should start with this and then \\"graduate\\" to more advanced systems.The 3 pack offers a multitude of varieties if you also purchase Unhopped Malt Extract (UME) from Mr. Beer. There are a lot of recipes on the Mr. Beer site that make the 3 packs you have purchased very versatile.I would give this 5 stars, except for the fact that you have to throw away the yeast that comes with it. It is not strong or consistent. You should go to a local brew store and purchase fresh ale or lager yeast. You won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST BREW SO FAR!","review":"We have been using Mr. Beer products for a couple of years now but my husband has not stopped raving about the flavoring of this variety pack.

The \\"recipes\\" are all the exact same, you follow the same steps to make each batch. Very easy to make.My favorite was the Vienna Lager. It has a rich golden brown color and a nice full flavor. It was the best out of all the beer that I've made so far.The next best was the Weizenbier. It was crisp, tasty and fresh. Not too heavy. It reminded me of Coors Light.I didn't like the Canadian Draft at all. I was expecting something along the lines of Molson or some other Canadian beer and this was just not good. It was tasteless and boring. I'd liken it to Near Beer, it had hardly any kick at all in addition to being flavorless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, great price.","review":"This is a fantastic price for the amount of beer mix that comes with the kit. These kits are usually $13 each. I don't necessarilly like to use the booster, so look up some of the recipes on the Mr. Beer website and I order an unhopped malt extract (UME) and anything else that could be needed to create some really cool beers. You can also go to your local homebrew supply store and by some dry extracts.Note for those that are unfamiliar with MR. Beer.

There is a fast-paced warm-up followed by 7 combinations. Seasun then proceeds with a cool-down, core work, and finally a stretch. As far as cueing goes, Seasun is OK. She is not perfect, but I found it fairly easy to follow along even on my first run-through. There is not an excessive amount of TIFTing (taking it from the top).I found this workout to be challenging but doable. I like workouts that engage my brain as well as my body and this definitely fits into that category. If you are at an intermediate/advanced fitness level and enjoy intricate step choreography, you will like this workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for amatures","review":"I have been doing step for a little over 3 years now. I have go to classes weekly and use my bench at home. I found this tape fun but hard to follow. Seasun moves fast and if you are not familiar with step you will get lost.

That being said, being comprehensive and being comprehendible are two very different things. While being the former it sacrifices the latter.

In addition, his end-of-chapter problems can be relatively uninformative and tedious i.e. you are left asking why did I just do this problem? Inevitably I find myself going back to Ashcroft & Mermin's wonderful but dated book.

The author uses a lot of jargon which you are not supposed to be aware I guess, and also there are a lot of typos or strange terminology which is really frustrating sometimes. He tries to cover everything in Condensed Matter and as a result he does not explain thoroughly the material or the derivations presented. I couldn't only use this book alone to study but instead I was using Marder's book along with Kittel or other books, because this book confuses you so much. The only nice thing about this book is that it covers pretty much everything both in Solid State Physics and in Soft Condensed Mattter but you can find better books I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good for Beginner","review":"I don't like this book, particularly the way it demonstrates mathematical proofs behind physical concepts.

Paul tells us that he cannot reveal all that was given to him in this revelation but that we will all be new spiritual embodied creations. We will be able to visit the three heavens continously for all eternity.The greatest of our enemies, death will be no more. Paul says that if there is no resurrection, there can be no hope for creation. God made us in His image and sent Jesus, His beloved son to save the world from evil and when Christ comes in the parousia (second coming) He will present the new creation to God,Our Father.Let us prepare ourselves inwardly, as St. Paul teaches, through and in Christ, for our great awakening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet 16 gift for cousin","review":"Apparently she likes the amp.

I bought it three months ago and read it cover to cover. I also have Iron Body NINJA by Mr. Hunter (ASHIDA KIM). He's just making donkysmells with a pen and paper. I practice the art of meditation, and the Kuji-Kiri Mr. Hunter, I implor you, stop writing ninja fairy tails. The Kata he shows in the book is crap in the exterem. He doesn't properly describ perfoming the Kuji-in or any typ of meditation. He's obviously a faild novilist who bought a black karate gi and put on a ski mask. if you want to learn yo meditate, there are lots of books to help you. meditation helps control your own mind. Mr.Hunter (Kim) just wants your money, don't buy his book. In fact dont buy any of his books. there all crap. Mr. Hunter (Kim) had best \\"RETIRE\\" from his art befor a REAL ninja catches him on the street. It would be in his best inrest.

Maybe he is a martial artist but he is in no way a Ninjutsu Master. First of many inconsistencies, he used Chinese names Ninjutsu was and is a Japanese art an art the Ninja use came from China CALLED Gyokko ryu Koshijutsu but thats it. Second he won't give his teacher's name or info on who he learned from, even Masaaki Hatsumi told of his teacher and his teachers lineage. Third he used basic Karate techniques nothing more, furthermore the only man who was known to teach kOGA RYU WAS fUJITA seiko who in no way has a connection with Kim.For real info use Hayes books or Hatsumi's books dont waste your time n money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a joke.","review":"I bought a copy of this book about two and a half years ago, when I first started studying budo and wanted to read everything I could get my hands on.

I used to be a big fan of Ashida Kim books until one day I realized that he basically ends each book trying to teach you a ninja-fied version of \\"magic.\\" There are many interesting techniques for training and expanding your awareness of others trying to influence you in this book. For a good price or at the library this is a decent read, but I've read better, such asMind Manipulation: Ancient and Modern Ninja Techniques. I'd give this guy's work a higher rating if not for the fact he tries to teach you the Kuji Kiri, details how to make contact with a familiar spirit (as in a spirit that will guide you and even protect you, like an imaginary friend but more). One may say its just nerdy drivel, and others will say its a demonic toybox.

Therefore everything he says you must take with a grain of salt.Mr. \\"Kim\\"'s credentials aside, like all of his other books, this book does contain some very good knowledge, if you look hard enough.

I took the 3 capsules for extreme stress as indicated and nothing. No calming, nothing. I tried it for a few days as directed and still nothing. I should have known because all the testimonals on their website are favorable and you are unable to leave your own feedback, which leads me to believe they are fabricated. Also, within 45-60 mins. of taking it I got severe headaches. I would advise to NOT buy this product based on the placebo effect it had on me and the headaches.

I felt a little calm, but that was it. Certainly not the boost we're all looking for. These natural pills just aren't strong enough, I'm afraid. We'll have to stick to the real drug, and just take on any side effects it brings. I know that's what I'm going to do.

His mother Dede is a cocktail waitress who cares passionately about her son. Fred comes to the attention of child psychologist Jane Grierson who runs a summer camp for child prodigies called Odyssey of the Mind.

If you are the only beer drinker in your home this should be adequate. The reason I gave this 4 rather then 5 stars is because of what is left out in terms of instructions, and equipment.

Even after it had been fixed I had to place the spout in upside-down.

Then, after you bottle your beer and add the priming sugar, let them condition for at least FOUR weeks. Then put them in the refrigerator for another 2 days and then enjoy them. The longer the conditioning, the better your beer will taste.

Even if you follow the instructions to the T and you sanitize your butt off it doesn't make much a difference with this sub par kit.

Munroe has a wonderful narrative voice that I found to be personal, infectious, and dead-on realistic to the voice of this generation. Obviously, this book contains a bit of the unreal, but the topics that are discused are serious issues, and Munroe does a wonderful job of using the fantastical parts of his work to highlight the reality he explores. That his characters, under the guise of superheroes, undertake tasks that many of us, at one time or another, would like to have done, makes Flyboy and Ms. Place true superheroes to be admired.The only complaint I have about this work is that it is Munroe's first, and so far, only, work.

Oppenheimer fails to see that anything was better than the Batista dictatorship which left most Cubans poor and illiterate while rich American tourists enjoyed the beautiful beaches and hotels in Havana. Castro was helping his people, not himself. And while it can be conceded that the withdrawel of Soviet funds was damaging to the Cuban economy, they are in no way decrepid, and have a good strong workforce. In fact, despite Castro's economic problems, he still has enough money and time to fund and work on the rehabilitation of poor economies in Africa, which America doesn't seem to be able to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is just lies.","review":"Well, lets think of what Fidel did, he took money from the rich, gave to the poor, set up free health care, free education, and brought electricity and literacy to Cuba.

Richardson was a can-do guy, adapting what was available to the task at hand, and not moralizing the right or wrong, just getting the job done and doing it well. He remained humble throughout, considering his bravery in the face of the enemy and the trials and travails he faced. He not only survived, but gave the Japanese a bloody nose in the process.

Disappointing, because the factual story of the documents would be intesting. Cohn makes no attempt to even summarise the 'Protocols'! Or of course the 'Holocaust'--the expression being then-recent. Cohn just about mentions Maurice Joly at the time of Napoleon III. Rosenberg's 'Myth of the Twentieth Century' has many mentions, but is dismissed as 'unreadable'. Houston Chamberlain gets a couple of references. The Russian Orthodox Church is skated over. There's nothing on the Khazars; this book predates Koestler, but even so Cohn doesn't seem aware of that issue. Pretty much every serious topic is ignored: Carthage? Middle Ages? Modern financial frauds? Chosen people? Soviet Union? Secret societies? This book is just part of the ridiculous apologetic stuff which marred the second half of the twentieth century."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a prize","review":"Deanna's Ashford Savage Surrender was erotic, intriguing, and kept you wanting more.

By the middle of this book, I was starting to daydream through the same repetitive passages that I had already read and by the end I was skimming to finish it. However, I found at the end that I had not been patient enough -the pivotal conclusion was finished in several \\"meaty\\" pages. I am left wondering if the author got a call from the publisher asking for a quick end, so Denise Mina finished it immediately. By then, I think we had all tired of the seemingly endless navel gazing and preening self-importance of the main character, so perhaps it's just as well that it ended when and how it did. In my opinion, this book is not a \\"keeper.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing suspense novel","review":"I was surprised that this novel received such positive acclaim as I found it to be frustrating and disappointing. I probably would not have finished reading it except that it came so highly rated that I wanted to find out if I was missing something. I found the narrator to be insipid, whiney and annoying, and could barely tolerate his level of denial and pathological dependency upon a woman who clearly had no attachment to him. I think the idea of allowing the reader to see things that the narrator is unable to perceive (e.g. that Susie is not the \\"innocent\\" that she claims) is a good technique, but it was overused, and I found myself feeling like I was watching a bad suspense flick where the audience cannot believe the stupidity of the characters.

I gave up at page 100. Mina's prior novels -- Garnethill, Exile & Resolution -- are splendid, fantastic and thoroughly enjoyable with characters you really love, that truly come to life off the page. Deception is two-dimensional, flat and thoroughly boring. It is evidently a manuscript of a man's diary thoroughout his wife's trial for murder. It was like reading my own diary -- boring.

But the good news is I did get all my Christmas shopping done, my house is clean and my bills are paid and I didn't owe a late fee to the Library.

However, I couldn't get through it. As anyone familiar with Stolen Valor by B. G. Burkett knows, there's an awful lot of lies out there which are represented as true Vietnam experiences. I got to the story from the lady who said it most disturbed her that \\"her general\\" and six other generals and aides were killed in her area. I think the history shows that only one general in total was killed in Vietnam. So, I don't believe the author/editor did any fact checking and I don't believe she had much of a knowledge base. In another story she referred to a \\"gunny\\" sergeant as a \\"gunship\\" sergeant (although she got it right in a later story).All in all I thought this was a pretty weak effort. The concept is still good, it just needs to be better handled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start, not enough material","review":"Having purchased a number of Study Bibles over the years, I looked forward to adding one more to my set. However, this Bible hardly qualifies as a Study Bible. It does provide a very good introduction to one method for personal Bible Study - it then uses Genesis as a way to apply that methodology. But that is all.I expect a Study Bible to offer helps throughout the scriptures - this Bible only focuses on one book. A look at this edition's home page, makes it clear that it was developed to support William Proctor's seminars. I expect that it does this well, but it falls short of being a general Study Bible. If additional resources were available on-line, it would add some value to this edition. If additional resources were available for purchase, it might be of addition value. Neither of these are available.If you are looking for a general Study Bible, I would recommend looking further."},{"rating":"1","title":"The magic indeed went away","review":"There's a short story by Niven called \\"Not Long Before the End\\", to which this book is a kind of a sequel and which, I think, won a Hugo.

A collection of short stories might have been preferable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close to being a classic","review":"The latest Niven book 'The Burning City' looked interesting, and having heard that 'Magic..' was a prequel-of-sorts, I decided to read it first.This was my first experience with Niven and if it's representative of his body-of-work as a whole, I can see why he regularly collaborates with others...he's not very talented with the written word.Most of this book was stilted throughout. Topping that off, it's just not horribly interesting. Perhaps we can give Niven a little credit for being one of the forerunners of the modern fantasy boom, but calling this book a classic isn't something I'll ever do.The fact that other reviewers have remarked on its similarities to a popular children's fantasy game speaks volumes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peugeot Saly & Pepper Mills - a classic pair","review":"This set is the perfect, classic set of salt and pepper mills. The matte chocolate finish has the richness of dark, stained wood without the glare of shiny glaze. The top of each one has a small \\"S\\" or \\"P\\" on the top screw so you know which is which.

They seem to be related to electrical noise on the line because one of them reliably goes off when we use our induction cooktop and both go off intermittently usually around mid-day when our PV system is at maximum output. No problems with the 6 Kidde PI2010 dual smoke alarms or the HD135F heat alarm on the same circuit (other than the fact that it's deafening throughout the house when all 9 detectors sound off at the same time!), so it isn't a Kidde power supply problem, just something specific to these units.Other than that, they look and work well, and the voice feature is a useful feature since it enables you to distinguish the type of alarm. They should make the red light on these things brighter, though: figuring out which alarm initiated requires running around the house and standing directly underneath each alarm to see if it's the one with the red light."},{"rating":"1","title":"After 3 months low battery alarm won't stop - even with brand new batteries","review":"I purchased this to replace an identical model that was beeping with a low battery alarm (and would not stop even after replacing with brand-new alkaline and expensive lithium batteries). The new unit worked for about three months until it started beeping as well. Changing the battery with multiple alternate batteries did not resolve - again lithium or alkaline. For both detectors I tested them hard wired and also without and it didn't make a difference. I'm giving the lowest rating because the first unit was purchased at a local store, and the second unit from Amazon so the chances they're from the same potentially bad \\"batch\\" is very low. No-one can tolerate the obnoxious and continuous low-battery alarm beep so the unit is effectively junk.I replaced it with a First Alert unit that's working fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy, beeps for new battery after just 1 month","review":"I should have heeded the warnings by other reviewers that some of these units constantly beep for new batteries after only a short time. I bought one and it worked fine so I bought several more. About 1 month ago the old unit started beeping for a new battery.Thinking the battery that came with the unit was drained to begin with, I used a battery tester to ensure a replacement battery contained a good charge and inserted it into the unit. Approximately one month later, the device is beeping again. I am sending the several I had received after the replacing the battery one month prior, back to Amazon with the reason being that Amazon should not sell these.I may contact Kidde, though I really do not want to risk installing another defective unit that possibly won't even detect CO or smoke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor product...don't waste your money","review":"After the 1st week, the alarm would constantly beep every 15 seconds.

I do like that in the event of a fire that you have a professional style system, like you would have in a school, that all alarms go off and flash at the same time. However, like another reviewer stated, it's a nightmare when it happens for no reason.About a year ago our carbon/smoke detector started to fail and alarmed randomly, especially at night. It was hard to find what unit was going off, which is the worst part of this design. In theory if something is wrong, the unit is supposed to beep frequently, like 2 times a minute. However, when these things malfunction, the beep goes off at random times (could be ten minutes, thirty minutes, five hours apart) and its very hard to locate where it came from since their are several units in the house. The only way to stop them from alarming is by disconnecting them and pulling the battery, which is really dangerous, as you now have no alarm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy installation and tested correctly.","review":"Great rating by Consumer Reports. Product delivered as advertised with free Amazon shipping. Mount the mounting plate to the ceiling with included screws. Connect two wires with included wire nuts.

Forget burning something in the kitchen, just cooking something is enough to set off the alarm. Contrary to what the packaging says, hush mode does NOT work. Stupid thing just goes into test mode and screams into your ear instead. Battery run low? It beeps every thirty seconds. Wake you up in the middle of the night? Too bad because it won't shut up unless you change the battery or take a sledge hammer to it. How about when your power goes out? Yep, beeps over and over repeatedly. Hush mode (again) doesn't hush so you have to disable the alarm to save your sanity.I have two of these installed and they both act identically. Wish I could get my money back.

This is a combined ionization smoke alarm with CO detector and supplemental voice alert.I replaced my old Firex G-8's with two KN-COSM-IB's and one P12040 (new PE120). The new documentation in the boxes indicates that these two model Kidde alarms are inter-connectible and compatible.Unit testing has confirmed that they all work properly when hardwired.I have also read that even smoke alarms are now required to be replaced after 10 years of service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent detector with culprits","review":"These are decent detectors, however not without problems. They do require to be hard wired to AC to operate and left running on battery alone will exhaust it within days and sound \\"low battery\\" alarm. Therefore leaving a house for vacation and shutting down all power is not an option.Secondly, as others mentioned, they do sound a false alarm once in a while due to power fluctuations. Indeed, this usually happens at night, the most unfortunate timing.And thirdly, although by design, the volume of the alarm is absolutely deafening, so much so that approaching the detector to turn it off in the middle of the night is a self-inflicted torture. Perhaps great for hearing impaired but not recommended for folks with good ears.But most importantly, like other ionizing smoke detectors, this devices will fail to alarm you during a slow burning smoldering fire (such as smoking upholstered furniture) until it is too late (see NBC Nightly News on 3 Oct 2012)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Designed to fail after five years","review":"I am on my third round of having to replace the Kidde KNCOSM-IB combo smoke/CO2 detector. I have eight of these detectors wired together, so it's not cheap. The failure mode is an annoying chirp every 30 seconds. This is the designed-in failure mode to force you to replace your detectors every five years. My store-front retailer told me they sell thousands of these as replacements on a regular basis.

Science and technology has convinced the Western mind that they can and will have an explanation for everything when this is not true...This book was a disappointment to me in that is was a 250 page brochure for the services and teachings of Villoldo's Four Winds Society, where \\"You too, can be a shaman for only $10,000- Call NOW!!\\" If not you can pay for a private consult...If you want a book of his that supports changes in your life try The Four Insights and actually put the info to use. If you really believe you need a soul retrieval, find a reputable practitioner and discuss it with them... An ethical shaman/medicine person will interview you before taking next steps...Good luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"recommended","review":"Many of the processes covered in the book are taught in Dr. Villoldo's Healing the Light Body School.

It is written at a level where someone with little or no experience with Windows can use it. Everything is presented in a small step-by-step manner with few assumptions concerning knowledge of how you interact with Windows. If you are someone just starting a relationship with Windows, then this is the book for you. However, if you have used it before, then you will have to read a lot to learn very little. I can't help wondering how big that market really is.All of the fundamentals such as creating, saving, moving and deleting files are covered, as well as e-mail and basic customization features. Networking features and the use of specialized hardware such as scanners are explained in great detail.Boring if you are experienced, an effective guidebook if you are a newbie, this is a book with little middle ground. Simply put you, either you need it or you don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best red-dot sight in the market IMO","review":"Not a lot of hype around this scope.

However, this book is beyond the comprehension of most adults, let alone the young child audience that picture books are intended for. The illustrations are nice, but any child will be frustrated by the vocabulary (and adults will be frustrated at having to explain a word in every single sentence). I had planned to read this book aloud to a classroom, but it might as well be in Russian because they won't understand it at all, which is a shame because they are inherently interested in bugs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gentle and profound memoir of an Appalachian family.","review":"Louise McNeill was the poet laureate of her home state of West Virginia, and this book is poetic in its evocation of the richness of rural life in that state.

I have to hold the microphone in front of my mouth for them to hear me...and...well...that defeats the purpose I bought it for!

So when I saw Spielberg was involved in this I was hoping for something with at least a little pizzazz. I was wrong. It's got nice CGI with the dinosaurs and all, but that's about it. Story line seems dumbed down for the kids, which is the last thing you want to do with a good children's show. Plotlines are utterly predictable.

Big name folks involved. $$ spent on effects and sets. You've begun with an interesting premise. But the story is garbage. Recycled garbage at that. Pushed along by hopelessly cliched dialogue. How sad. Who is the target market? Why is the leader doing an \\"Aw shucks ma'am\\"/Marshall Dillon impression? There is no chemistry between the husband and wife. The sullen misunderstood teenager plot line has been done to death. Let it rest in peace! I guess I answered my own question. The target market are kids who are too young to recognize the cliches. To them it's new stuff. Okay... Well, I'm going to watch a Firefly episode to cleanse my pallet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I love this show its amazing its the perfect blend of drama romance and action it is amazing i love it. it would be better with more dinosaurs but other than that is a amazing plot i love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart TV!","review":"Great show for the Sci-Fi fan as well as mystery fans.

This was the series to watch on Monday nights for the entire family. It is a shame that a few people with little entertainment value made some worthless reviews that lead the Fox progaming direction staff to cancel the series after just one year. This had all the making of a long time series with continued growing ratings with growing plots and a streaming story plot. It is to bad that excellant television is always cancelled and mediocre television is put in its place. Steven Steilberg should produce this series again and make a new entertainment revolution by committing this series to NetFlix or another media outlet so that the public can again watch a show of quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"We got this because it's a very interesting series; Never had problems viewing the chapters...takes a while to download, but it worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Men with guns, telling people what to do, policemen thinking they","review":"don't have to follow the same rules as eveyone else.

Stupid teenagers doing stupid things is no longer fresh or interesting. Mom and Dad getting to know each other and figure out how to work together again after a separation is as uninteresting as it gets. The bada$$ Man in Charge, is even more boring than the stupid teenagers doing stupid things.What I wouldn't give for a show where at least one character uses his or her brain on a regular basis. One show where teenaged angst isn't the rotten meal of the day. One show where someone with some spark of creativity was allowed free rein for at least 10 seconds. This isn't that show."},{"rating":"1","title":"No viewing rights?","review":"Not understanding why they are selling a season pass to a show that they do not have rights to show to you.

I go to the bathroom with a stomach ache and it starts hurting extremely bad when I have to \\"let it out\\". The pain hurts even more when I can't let it out which almost caused me to faint. It eventually worked, but the pain is not worth it from this product.I highly suggest Miralax. It helps you go the same day you take it and it doesn't hurt your stomach at all.

Whole thing is typical of the quality I should have expected from a cheap plastic chinese-made item, I suppose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Construction & Customer Service","review":"As soon as I opened the fan (not with undue force), the hinges broke.

I've played about 20 seasons and usually sim through them and then play the playoff games. The fun part for me is building the team through trades and free agents and drafts.But I've won my division about 10 years in a row. The game makes it too easy to trade high paid veterans in the last year of their contract for younger up and coming stars with years left on their contract. By doing this, you always have a fresh infusion of talent without increasing payroll.This game is fun and maybe the newer editions of Out of the Park Baseball (which you can buy only online) will have solved this problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Game!!!!!","review":"It would be a good game if it was licensed by the MLBPA so, you can have the real players names.

I received this as a Christmas gift because I asked for it. There may be some stupid things said here, but most of them (the month of January anyway) aren't really that funny. I've used lots of funny calendards over the years and enjoyed most of them. But this one just isn't funny. Although there are some exceptions (like Al Gore's inventing the Internet comments) most of the entries are really nothing more than inadvertent slips of the tongue. Given the utter stupidity of many public people in the things that they actually mean to say there is no dearth of material available. Instead, the editors of this calendar seem to be more interested in minor slips of the tongue. I suppose they might be funny if you were there. But reading them on a calendar page has barely made me smile let alone laugh.

This is very funny stuff here, but you need a certain intelligence to get it. All I know is that, unlike what is said to be funny these days, this calendar made me laugh a lot. There's so much scope here: inanities from celebrities (this is an easy one, no?), politicians doing their usual hot air act, and so on. Bottom line: I needed a laugh, and this calendar definitely delivered! I recommend this based on my flip through and am planning to buy some as gifts now. We all need a laugh these days, especially here in New York."},{"rating":"1","title":"A calender as dumb as its quotes","review":"I bought this calender for my brother and myself, hoping for a laugh, if not a chuckle, everyday. The reality turned out to be the opposite of this. Many times I fail to find any humor in the day's quote, and I cannot even muster up a smirk. It is hard to believe that a team of editors could only find this unfunny set of quotes after extensive searching of American public records. In addition, the format of the title of each day's quote attempts to be funny, but ends up appearing confused and unwitty. If you are looking for laughs, I highly recommend spending your money on other page-a-day calenders like the Onion or Simpsons. This one is a bust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of 365 days, MAYBE 3 are funny","review":"This is the STUPIDEST Calendar ever made....EVER.

The DVD is just about the cutest thing I have ever seen. My kids love it and we watch it often, sometimes on mute while we do other things in the room. The dozens of kittens are so adorable. The program is not a movie really, it's a series of chapters, each with a different sort of loose story.

Although she may help an absolute beginner get started, her own work is so amateurish that it's uninspiring. I don't expect fantastic writing, but the examples do not create confidence in the expertise of the instructor.Any Jim Faraone book has better eye candy and specific tips; many, MANY generous doll artists offer help online with tutorials and fabulous galleries of their work. A quick search of the Web (try \\"repaint tips\\" or \\"fashion doll repaint\\") will prove infinitely more rewarding than this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marginal product.","review":"Firstly, I am quite disgusted with the author's own glowing review of her work in the pretended guise of a user/reader. Perhaps she wrote this review before Amazon implemented their \\"real name\\" options and forgot that she had written this review anonymously. In any case - one might consider disregarding a pretend review by the book's own author.I purchased this book back when I began repainting, and it was a small help to me as a beginner. This book may serve as the most base of starts but beyond that I cannot recommend it. If you are anything but the most green of novices, you will likely get no information of value from the work presented. Unfortunately there is a lack of quality repaint books in the market, so it is true that this is one of the only options. i would recommend contacting a repainter for tips instead, and searching the internet, which contains many valuable resources for fledgling repainters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basic How To Book - disappointing","review":"This book is for the beginner who has less than no idea where to start. It does have basic how-to info but I found the examples and dolls in the book very disappointing. I feel like even though I have never done a fashion doll repaint I can do at least as good a job as the author did if not better. I was expecting a lot more and if I had paid full price for this book I would have returned it. (I bought a used one) I don't want to be mean but the nose holes on one doll looked like boogers and the Julia Roberts repaint doll's lips were disturbing.

The Irish lassie \\"Shannon\\" on the cover is beautiful. I've read some of the other reviews and am beginning to think that Amazon should find out where the venom is coming from. Could it be professional jealousy? These books have helped pave the way for my makeovers and I wouldn't trade them for anything.

For the rest of us, I found the pictures of artwork done by the author a joke. They look like a child painted ALL of them except the one on the front cover which must have taken her years to perfect.

I recommend it highly for Black history Month!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating and quite captivating","review":"This is indeed the best autobiography i have read in a long while.It actually chronicles the triumph of man's indomitable spirit.The captivating story transcends three continents Europe(Germany),Africa(Liberia and briefly Nigeria) and the U.S.It shows the overt and covert rasicm that existed in Germany during the time of Hitler and the travails of a German of African descent during the World War.It also moves to Africa and shows the differences to put it mildly between the Americo-Liberians and the Natives which exists till today and also fortells the destructive war of the 90's.He later goes to America in search of the golden fleece,before he is united with his beloved mother who undoubtedly is the heroine he joins the segregated army of the 50's.I strongly reccomend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This is one of the most interesting autobiographies I have ever read. I have read a lot about Nazi Germany but it was primarily from Jewish accounts. I never imagined that there were any black people particulary children who lived through such a horrific period in history. I agree with the other reviewer that this is worthy of being made into a film. I have encouraged everyone I know to read this fascinating book. Thank you Mr. Massaquoi for sharing your personal history with us!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very powerful book","review":"This book provides a fresh view of the German people during the Nazi era. I loved how Mr. Massaquoi despite being a victim of racisim pointed out that not all German people supported the Nazi government. Many of the movies and books on the era always give the impression that Hitler and the Nazi party ideals were supported 100% by all the German people. Mr. Massaquoi provides us his life story in a direct and straight forward manner. He gives a balanced view of the ill-treatment that all non-aryans suffered."},{"rating":"2","title":"phenomenal view of the Germans before and during Hitler","review":"I am so thankful to the author for sharing his story. There is information in this book not found anywhere, and it's so well-written that I can't put it down. This record really makes clear, too,the wide range of humanity (and lack-of) in Germany before and during the Nazi days. One very moving piece is the author's mother, who, without doubt, gave him the strength of character to endure so much pain and grow up to be a fine person. Also, the teacher during his first year of school--in all my days of school in THIS country, I never saw such fine character in a teacher! And...And...And...So many unbelievable people in a sea of horror.This account sheds light on civil rights issues, everywhere (and we learn a bit about Liberia, too!)This is an phenomenal book. Completely original and beautifully written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I found this book to be disappointing. The author spends too much time explaining and describing things which add nothing to the main point of the book; an extraordinary tale of survival in Nazi Germany. I found that the story could have been told in less than half of the pages that the author uses and not spend countless chapters on descriptions of relatives and acquaintances that have little to do with the overall story. The bottom line is that, fortunately for the author, nothing much happens. I am happy that the author was not actively persecuted and that he was able to survive that totalitarian regime. But, unfortunately for the reader, it doesn't make much of an attention-grabbing story.For a real captivating real-life account of living in a critical situation I recommend The Gate by Francois Bizot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something for Everyone","review":"This bio is another example of why it is important to share with others. Massaquoi by no means had a charmed start in life. There was every opportunity for him to fail at just about every turn in his young life. Clearly God had a plan for him, because Massaquoi made it out of war torn Germany to live a fruitful life. He did much for his family and by writing his story for us. Take the time to sit and read--learn or remember why life is precious and why we must remember the past to preserve our future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Destined To Witness","review":"I could not even finish this book.

I'm glad Massaquoi's friends talked him in to writing his story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Survival and Accommodation","review":"An excellent, insightful account of a most profound period in global history. The author is articulate, entertaining and intelligent is his writing of what must have been a life of constant uncertainty.

Tharpe's use of recurring visual motifs also helps evoke a sense of small-town life whose daily rhythms are thrown off when a covert government sound-wave experiment causes the residents to violently harm themselves and each other. The gritty 16mm lensing and marvelously moody lighting by IN THE COMPANY OF MEN's Tony Hettinger (replicated quite well in the full screen transfer) helps fuel the movie's slow-burning tension; more restless viewers may fins the pace too slow, but patience is rewarded with well-sustained suspense sequences and startling bursts of mayhem. And at 102 minutes, the release cut bears better pacing than the initially circulated 116-minute version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slooooooooooow movie","review":"I like indie movies since you can find some real gems but this movie was just way too s-l-o-w.Storyline worked given the initial premise of the movie. Acting was decent indie stuff. Cinematography and visuals was actually pretty good. It's just the movie is sooooooo damn s-l-o-w! Scenes just dragged on and while it worked in a few parts to ratchet up the tension, for most of the movie any sense of dread or horror was overwhelmed by my irritation to get the movie over and done with.

The third night there was about a 12 inch separation from the side and the bottom. Lasted one more night then to return it I had to clean it and package it. Putting it back up to clean caused the seam to separate all the way down one side and across the back. It's more airy now.

Lautner made use of cast concrete, steel and glass to create dynamic stuctures that few architects or clients dare conceive today. Think Lautner, think Jetsons.

I hate Susan in this novel, Oliver paid for her huge mistake of not even paying the closest attention to her own daughter, who I might add is not old enough to take care of herself. Susan is a terrible mother and wife to her hopelessly devoted family, why did she breed? She is a socialite, a snob and an inconsiderate human being and I dont understand why Oliver would subject himself to her foolishness for forty years after what she did.

Too often, lengthy description in a novel can cause the reader to skip over those sections, but through Stegner's deft hand one is transferred to the vivid starkness of the frontier from California to Idaho, including along the way, vibrant Mexico and charming Vancouver Island. It may be considered long and boring by some, but, for me, it was a wonderfully absorbing tale that I didn't want to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great transitional strengths by Stegner","review":"The tremendous setting of the table by the author to force the reader at the end to forecast what will happen, is overwhelming. Will Lyman be as unrelenting as Oliver seemed to be? During the writing of the history of his Grandparents, he clearly took the side of his Grandmother, for whatever the reasons. But when his own wife, who had some of the same characteristics as his Grandmother (helpless victim of love?), came to seek forgiveness, the reader is left to surmise if Lyman will welcome her back.

It has many flaws, and is the kind of book that can be easily put down...but it can just as easily be picked up again.Stegner showboats a bit with his (ubiquitous) descriptive passages, employing more adjectives than are perhaps necessary: \\"...the moonlight lay like pallid dust in the feathered and pebbly blibbety-blab...\\"--that type of thing. Very pedantic, very Creative Writing...but he was a professor, so understandable.The plot is also a bit repetitious, and you may find yourself thinking: \\"Again?!\\" when the dramatis personae suffer yet, yet, another reverse.However, these flaws do not scupper what is, overall, a special book, written by a talented, top-notch writer.

The novel's settings are both beautiful and realistic depictions of the American west: including the development of its frontier and the sweat, hardship, and love that went into creating it. Though taught at the Graduate level of many colleges and universities, \\"Angle of Repose\\" is accessable to readers at many levels and teaches by example how the past can indirectly influence the present, and in the case of our narrator, influence the future as well"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is America Between The Covers Of A Book","review":"\\"Angle of Repose\\" is Stegner's great American Novel.

The world around him is sliding downhill, morally and intellectually, so he is writing a book about Susan, to tell the world how to live. Good freakin' luck.Susan is a mildly interesting character, and her life is also mildly interesting. She was in love with some guy, and she and a girlfriend hung around with him, but he fell in love with the other woman. So she married another man.

I am now in the middle of 'Crossing to Safety', another Stegner classic, and am enjoying it similarly.

I purchased my Peugeot Reims Stainless-Steel Pepper Mill two years ago and am very pleased with its quality. The grinding mechanism is the most important aspect of any pepper mill: the hardened steel apparatus here is top-notch. The coarseness of the pepper can be adjusted by either tightening the top nut or by manually adjusting the top portion while grinding. Thus, the user has a great deal of control over the grinding. The only drawback is that it leaves a slight metallic odor on my hands after use.The mill is an eye-catching culinary curio. However, ultimately a customer's satisfaction with kitchen gadgets relies a great deal on ease of use and comfort. I find this mill quite functional and comfortable, but a few other reviewers obviously have not - perhaps because they are used to curvier wood mills. You might want to test this mill in a store before purchasing it here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptively attractive","review":"The one I received was either defective or its design does not allow a really coarse grind.

(I still have my VHS version). I've loved this movie since the first time I saw it as a child. The great thing about it is every time you watch it you catch new jokes. Cary Elwes gives his best performance to date as the charming, witty Robin Hood who, \\"unlike some other Robin Hoods\\", can speak with an English accent. From start to finish this movie will have you laughing. Mel Brooks even makes an appearance as the flippant Rabbi Tuckman. This is not a movie to miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this movie","review":"This is one of my favorite movies.

I can watch it over and over, plus Carry Elwes still looks good in this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick N Dirty Job","review":"Have read 40% of the book so far. There are many places where visual aspects are discussed, and there are no visual illustrations!!. The book is clearly aimed at people whose knowledge is elementary in the areas being discussed, and yet there is no attempt to make it easy for the reader to learn. Also, the examples are unimaginative.On the bright side, I like the casual conversational style."},{"rating":"2","title":"what more is there to say?","review":"I concur with A. Reid's review on every point. This book is linked with the DVD by Amazon for good reason, it compliments the movie wonderfully.

LOVED IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicately Slow and Sweet","review":"While I agree that some of Susan King's books can be boring and/or devoted to endless information on one's occupation, I found this one refreshing, due to the hero Sebastien. Although Alainna was petulant at times, she was fortunate to have found a man like Sebatien. Because he \\"clicked\\" with me from the beginning I found nothing boring about this story. I was completely captivated by him."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was good, but not stop my heart good.","review":"I kept waiting for the book to really get started and I feel it just never happened. This is my first book by this author and it will probably be my last. Save your money, if you need to try it, get it from the library or a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"May Susan King never run out of ideas for books, nor words to describe what her imagination creates. She is the best author I have ever found. My number 1 favorite. Where I did not think it measured up to Laird of the Wind or Angel Knight, it was very, very good and well worth taking a vacation day to read it. With Susan King, if I had only $25 to my name and her next book came out in hardback for $22 I would buy her hardback and worry later about food. In my mind, noone can top her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stone Maiden by Lloyd Devereaux Richards","review":"I read this new novel in a couple of days. Am an avid reader and prefer fiction. I loved the book and was a page turner, as the outcome was definately unpredictable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Sweet, Wonderful Historical","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I loved the characters, how they spoke and interacted seemed to ring true to the time period, yet the hero was kind and caring. I also loved the poetry involved in the handfasting - beautiful! As much as I liked it, this book was not perfect - seems like King is stuck on the same theme, played out in several of her books - gets a little redundant. All in all, though a great historical read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A stunner!","review":"No one writes Scottish historical romance better than Susan King. It's not just her superlative research, powerful stories, and strong, admirable characters, but her ability to create a compelling, utterly convincing sense of time and place. The Stone Maiden makes it clear that life in 12th century Scotland was not easy, but that there was beauty and magic in the hills and the way of life. I love Alainna's carving stone to preserve the history of her people, and the Stone Maiden herself was a compelling figure--and beautifully resolved at the end of the story! In fact, stone and beauty are the perfect metaphors for this book, and for the strength and integrity of Sebastien and Alainna. This is a story to linger in the heart and mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sweet, but Boring","review":"I thought that the romance between the two main characters was cute, but this book was so boring! The accuracy from this time was awesome, but all the talk of the stone carving almost made me fall asleep.

This was a snooze for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful........","review":"I have never really given a bad book review, so here goes, this is my first.THIS BOOK WAS SO BAD; I WAS IN \\"PAIN\\" FROM READING IT.I have run across some badly written books in my time.

Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be prepared to sharpen","review":"These knives are a nice light-weight stainless steel and great to look at but that's where the accolades end. I could not believe how dull the blades were. I had a hard time slicing through just about anything. I should have realized there was a good reason for the bargain price. It's amazing what these manufacturers can get away with. I also cannot believe all the good reviews I read here. Do these people realize that knives are usually used to cut something?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The only reason these knives get two stars is because they are beautiful looking knives. Unfortunatly, they are not very useful. Out of the box these knives are dull. VERY DULL. Dull knives are extreamly dangerous because there is a greater tendancy to slip off the food your trying to cut and so begins an accident. Try dicing an onion with a dull knife. The sharpening steel can not sharpen a blade this dull. They would require the services of a professional knife sharpener. I am going to exchange this set for a new one. Perhaps I just got a bad set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Knives for a Beginner chef.","review":"I have recently moved to my own appartment here at school and thus I had to start cooking for myself. With a student's budget, I did not want to spend too much money on my first set of knives, and so I chose this set. For a price of $ I expected knives that were not stable, poorly balanced, and dull. Amazon plesantly surprised me by delivering these sleek, sharp, and effective cutting tools. I have had them for two weeks now, and even with constant use they have not lost their edge. My friends believe I spent $200 on them because of the attractive styling and excelent quality. If you are looking for a new set of knives and don't want to spend too much money before you learn what to look for, this is a great set of knives for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharp and sharp","review":"I bought these knives for two reasons - they look great and the deal was unbelievable. They arrived yesterday and they look great on my kitchen counter. I tried several of them out while cooking dinner the past two nights and they work beautifully. The knives are extremely sharp and slide right through steaks, onions, peppers, and broccoli. Not majorly difficult to cut, but they sliced right though with very little effort. Overall a great purchase that will only encourage me to spend more time cooking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay for couples...\\"ify\\" for the general public","review":"After watching this DVD, I can safely say that with the exception of couples massage in the privacy of your own home, that most (if not all) regulated states would never allow the routine shown to be done for the public. The draping was horrible, one of the therapists had long hair that wasn't tied back (was touching the client's skin),and some of the longer strokes down the back and up the legs were extended underneath the towel/blanket. The Esalen Institute is based in California where there obviously aren't strict ethical boundries established...as say in..NY where I'm licensed. A few of the strokes might be adapted for massage to the public however. The only good thing I can really comment on is the scenery...if you're thinking about designing a garden or deck to do outdoor massage, you might get some decorating ideas. All in all, I'd rate it a 2 out of 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for couples","review":"It's tough to rate this one because I was specifically looking for intimate massage. The setting is breathtaking, but the presentation is more professional how-to or \\"travel destination\\". Nothing intimate or arousing for two people in the privacy of their own home, but they may consider actually going to Esalen for a getaway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad; would buy again","review":"What can I say? They're pretzels. Crunchy, tasty, lightly salted. I don't treat myself often, but football season is here and I'm already sick of trying to make an apple last an entire game. Just didn't cut it. I needed something crunchier and less healthy to really enjoy the games.Got a whole case of these babies so it is a good thing they are tasty and really fresh. Think I may have enough to feed the entire Super Bowl stadium and then some...Good value, good product, excellent packaging both for shipping and for the product itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"After a fruitless search for a nice basket style bassinet, I found this basket for my little one. I was surprised by the quality of the basket and how quickly it arrived after I ordered it! Not to mention the shipping was reasonable as opposed to the shipping charges that I have seen on other web sites. I got my basket four days after I ordered it and it only cost my around eight dollars to have it shipped. Also, the basket bumper and liner are removeable and washable, a real plus! I'm sure that I'll be getting a lot of use out of it in the future!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap price gets an extra star on this one...","review":"This CD is kind of a sampler for the famous a cappella singers, so it has a little jazz, gospel, folk and Christmas mixed in with the classical tracks. On some they sing the words, although the group became famous more than 40 years ago for singing only the notes. Either way, there is a lot of talent displayed. I was a fan early on, buying several of their Phillips LP's, but my favorite was always their Christmas record. For unknown reasons, that one, singing the notes to a couple of dozen carols in medleys, has never been fully and faithfully transferred to compact disc. Some of my friends find the Swingles style irritating, but I think more of their selections are just full-out lovely. Buy this as an introduction, because their work on CD usually is a bit pricey."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Hate Wasting Money","review":"...The book did not grasp on abuse like I thought it was and then it goes on to help you realize that the husband was nothing but a crackhead.

A random collection of ideas and concepts from Shaver, Lovecraft, Christianity, Fort and many more all presented badly and performed by some incredibly terrible actors. I think even Richard Shaver would be embarrassed by this. Yes, there are some scenes that hit that \\"so bad they're funny\\" level, but not nearly enough to counterbalance the endless exposition and scenes of people slowly wandering around. Did I mention the narrators creepy drawl? This is Youtube quality video presented as a real film. The Shaver Mystery deserves better than this.TERRIBLE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why must artists get political","review":"I liked Eilen Jewell when I first heard her about 6 months ago. But I purchased Boundary County yesterday and wasn't happy to find politics when I got to the song The Flood. I don't mind music from people that I disagree with politically, although I don't want to hear it in their music. However, saying I wasn't happy in this case was putting it mildly...it was totally ignorant and irresponsible to include accusations of racism in The Flood, especially when it was directed at a president.

The rest of the book reads like a calculus book and is obviously meant only for the most technically literate: you should know (and like) Chomsky grammars and want to learn about their (mathematical) relationship with DNA bases.Topics include: Sticker Systems, Watson-Crick Finite Automata, Splicing Systems, Universality by Finite H Systems, and Splicing Circular Strings"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gimme That Old-Time NFL!!!","review":"This collection of NFL Films programs from the 1960s and 1970s are fantastic!They take you back to an age when the NFL was humbler and the game was more fun.You actually get a chance to see what pro football looked like when men named Bart Starr, Johnny Unitas, and Jim Brown played.I have 2 very minor criticisms, though:1. If you have the DVDs of all the Super Bowls like I do, some of the films are included in those sets. However, these DVDs make accessing them easier.2. Steve Sabol's intros to the films are too reverential and gushing. Part of me wanted to cry tears of joy, and the other part wanted to laugh at their artificiality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, but...","review":"These DVDs are awesome, but whoever wrote the descriptions on the back must have never watched them.

Terrible marketing and product copy for such great films..."},{"rating":"1","title":"not enough football","review":"I am disappointed with this item. It seemed to me that less than half of the time was video highlights and instead we get a bunch of talking heads, interview out takes, etc. I won't waste any more of my money on NFL Films items unless I know for sure it's wall to wall football and not video of how Tim Rossovich lives on the beach or Dickie Post runs his clothing business, or endless minutes wasted on player interview out takes that are pointless. VERY BORING!! The best part of this DVD was the 1962 NFL Championship game. That was worth watching. Most of the rest is boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"What about the cameramen ???!!!!","review":"Okay, not a bad documentary about the history of the NFL Film crew, but not that great either. I mean, they talk about the music (which is excellent) and they talk to the editor (who is obviously talented) but what about the cameramen??!!! It's those talented group of cinematographers who framed all of this tight, dramatic action through a flickering viewfinder ! I mean how demanding of a job - shooting in adverse weather, making magazine changes, implementing camera techniques, knowing the game inside and out - anticipating plays and action - follow focusing ! I didn't see anything in the first volume in the documentary about these talented lensmen! What an oversight! Anyhow, it's a pretty decent package - but it's like leaving the engine out of a vehicle !"},{"rating":"1","title":"cw","review":"Customer service is one of the best out there but the watch looked a little out of date.

I might even toss my older studio-recorded CDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"PRE-FAB","review":"Caitlin has finally come undone. \\"While You Weren't Looking\\" is another pre-fab recording full of lifeless lyrics wrapped in uppity pop beats. So much so, the childish attempts to wrap some kind of deep meaning in her music lyrics seem irrelevant."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Let Down...full of cheesey songs","review":"I am truly disappointed by \\"While You Weren't Looking\\" as a whole. I had been waiting in anticipation for the release date and found that it wasn't truly worth the wait. At best the album seems like a collection of B-sides and goes downhill after the first track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame songs","review":"One word sums this CD up: BORING. Cary sounds as if she is ready to pack it up and move into a nursing home for old singers and songwriters. I can't see many people liking this CD, the lyrics are drole and the music is very repetitive and monotonous. Collectively, all of these songs begins to run together, and it is rather tedious to try and listen to this album from start to finish in one sitting.In this CD, Cary takes herself way too seriously. She needs to lighten up a bit. There is a curious kind of emotional detachment at work here in her songs. Her songs reflects her self-importance view - there is an air of pretense in her lyrics. The songs are unoriginal and uninspiring. It seems that Cary's ego was too big for this depressing CD and her talent can't cut it. Her unintelligible, melodramatic, twangy, whiny voice fails to gather much appeal from a listener."},{"rating":"1","title":"What else ya got?","review":"Better than the efforts of Ryan Adams/Whiskeytown? What was this professional reviewer on? This CD isn't quite a dud, but definitely close. Try to find it in the \\"used CD\\" bins. That's probably where mine will end up."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY VERY POOR","review":"Ms. Cary's performance here can only be summed up with two words- VERY POOR. From begining to end this endless stream of pop country simplicity defies any logical connection to decent music. Surely, \\"Please Don't Hurry Your Heart\\" ranks as one of the most pitiful attempts at music in a long long time. \\" Shallow Heart, Shallow Water\\" is not far ahead either. Ms. Cary's intense arrogance, immaturity, and lack of craft is prevelant here. One so full of herself has never made such bad songs. Warning- if Ms. Cary happens to knock on your door with a free copy of this mess- tell her to leave immediately..."},{"rating":"1","title":"depressing music","review":"It has all been downhill for Cary since Whiskytown. She started riding the fence between country and new-age pop, which certainly isn't a commercial triumph for her. Oh, please - what is she thinking! Did she think she could sell more cd's if she crossed over to depressing music? Cary has only average talent, and is not an excellent singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please take a look","review":"If you like country, folk, rock and pop music-you'll like this. If you like a sweet voice, smart lyrics, musical arrangements that are just right you'll like this. The songs deliver some serious messages about co-dependancy, not seeing reality, family troubles, resisting committment, and wallowing in self-pity delivered with such beautiful singing and musical arrangements that they seem upbeat, more like a little nudge instead of a kick in the head. It's obvious that a lot of work went into this cd to get it just right, but it never sounds over produced. Favorite songs include Thick Walls Down, Too Many Keys, Plese Don't Hurry Your Heart, and I Ain't Found Nobody Yet. Pretty good disc!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of The Year's Best","review":"I was surprised to read a couple of reviews that were less than glowing. This cd was a complete surprise to me, having almost no exposure to Whiskeytown. Cary's voice is wonderful, rocking-out on \\"Thick Walls Down\\" and not letting you down on the terrific ballads. (\\"Fireworks\\" is first-rate songwriting, folks!) Along with Springsteen's \\"The Rising\\", I think this is the best record I've heard in 2002...and I've heard a lot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Full-Length Debut","review":"Like many fans of Whiskeytown, I first listened to this record expecting to hear fiddle, soaring harmonies, some fiddle, torch-n-twang guitars, lotsa fiddle, heartwrenching lyrics, tear-jerking vocals, and a whole lotta fiddle. Well, you discover quickly that Ms. Cary is eager to explore a broader range of musical influences and expressions (from old country to celtic folk to Linda Thompson). Fine with me!! This is a well-conceived, finely polished, expertly executed collection of fine rock, folk, country, soul, songs and ballads. The opener, \\"Thick Walls Down,\\" \\"Too Many Keys,\\" and \\"Hold on to Me\\" are highlights, but it's all good."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR $$$$$$$","review":"You think your buying a great book about him, instead you don't.

Though the poetry by Dorothy Bridges is a touching tribute to her husband, Kaye's poetry is lacking in depth and creativity. It is obvious that Kaye is a novice at the written word, as is also evidenced by the sparse number of poems included in the book. At many times during the brief read, I got the impression that Kaye simply forced himself to hammer out poems to get the \\"book\\" finished. Perhaps a longer time spent studying the genre, or adding more substance to both the poems and the volume would improve the book. The presentation of the book itself is equally as mediocre. Clearly, minimum standards were met in cover art, binding, and paper selection. If Kaye puts forth another poetic effort, one would hope that a more professional eye will be given to the packaging details of the book. I looked forward to reading the book, and am very disappointed to have to write a less than complimentary review."},{"rating":"1","title":"customer Service","review":"Even though the brush does not work as well as I had hoped, the customer service from the sender 360Living, was outstanding!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A reasonable purchase","review":"My cell. phone battery died But Amazon came to my rescue @ a very reasonable price & a quick delivery & good quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Do Only Males Tell It Like It Was?","review":"I returned the book because of the twelve sermons, NOT ONE is from a female viewpoint.

The product directions packed with the product, but not mentioned online, list a lot of things including Pink salt that it should not be used with.The quality doesn't seem to me to be as advertised because there is very little selection possible on the fineness of the salt when grinding it - even with the salt that accompanied the unit. It will not grind as coarsely as common table sale, for example. Virtually no adjustment to the coarseness of the grind.For me, this item proved to be useless.

I felt as if Tharoor was travelling with me as I read in trains and planes, talking directly to me. He brought me to tears when Nehru died -- very hard to do using non-fiction. A delightful book -- warm, generous and globally aware, it's a wonderful reading experience. Tharoor gives us a better context for understanding a contradictory statesman, and made me wonder what Nehru and the freedom fighters would think of India and the world today. My only criticism: it's too short!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin.","review":"Hits all the high points. Tharoor's occasional protestations of objectivity about Nehru ring hollow; this book is objective only in tone. Nehru's contradictions are glossed over as if merely a source of amusement, but Jinna is treated as a pathological cynic, and the British are alternately inept and reactionary. Tharoor's treatment of Churchill is as harsh as it is shallow. This book reads very quickly, and is good for people who want a quick bio of Nehru.

Although the Butcher's Boy is a killer, the author somehow makes him the character you cheer for. And the plots are clever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure escapism and gritty","review":"This is my first book by Thomas Perry. I like the way he uses his vast knowledge of organized crime and big American cities to enable me to suspend disbelief and enjoy the story. The hit man, Michael Shaeffer, has enough worries in his life to earn some sympathy. He ends up killing a lot of bad guys. I lost track of the number along the way. The author crafted enough suspense to keep my attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the one...a genuine classic!","review":"This is the engrossing mystery novel that got me started on Thomas Perry, my favorite thriller author, and creator of the Jane Whitfield and Butcher's boy series which never fail to entertain. His tightly crafted prose wastes not a word ...no filler, not a word that isn't needed. You will love this story of a highly sought after hit man who makes an art form of killing. After a long career as a free lance hit man, someone stiffs him, and he hits back...hard. Now retired and living in England, he is discovered and pressed back into play. I loved this book and ran out to buy the prequel, The Butcher's Boy. Order theThe Butcher's Boyand read Sleeping Dogs while you wait for it to arrive...sink back into a soft chair and enjoy.For fans of Block's Keller, this one will not disappoint! The hit man sub-genre is a small universe, and this is one of it's stars.

It helps me wind down and get rid of all of the stress of the day. The images are so beautiful and clear, it reminds me the vacation I took in the Bahamas. What a wonderful way to enjoy an evening at home!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Multiple uses for this great DVD!","review":"The DVD is great. Beautiful beach scenery and minimal graphics. Perfect for setting the mood in your home when you need to relax.I actually bought the DVD because I'm in a Jimmy Buffett cover band. ( www.cedarreeferband.com ) One bar we play at has a huge screen TV on stage behind where I put my drums. We turn it off when we play but I figured there's gotta be something better than playing in front of a big blank screen. Much of Buffett's music is about the beach, the vacation mindset, and the distant locations that many of us long for. This DVD is the perfect backdrop for the music and vibe we put out during our performances. It's gorgeous, yet it's not busy so it isn't distracting. The creative uses for this beautiful DVD are only limited by your own imagination!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very relaxing","review":"A view of several beaches in the Bahamas, one with a rain storm. Very nice and very relaxing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take me away!","review":"Feeling depressed? Feeling overwhelmed at your job? Feeling those wintertime woes? Then this is THE DVD for you! Whenever you feel like getting away from it all, push play and you are instantly in the Bahamas! The scenery is amazing and the waves are realistic. There are no people, no traffic, no commercials, no cells phones, no music, no voices- just nature. It's you and the beach. The locations chosen are truly awe-inspiring. Very soothing & relaxing dvd. 60 minutes, then it loops (replays).

As other reviewers have noted, this recording is on a par with the FOLLIES in CONCERT recording, and comparable to the OBC recording in similar ways. Comparing casts may be primarily a matter of taste for some, though it is hard to deny the exceptional talent of ALL of these ladies, and the men on this recording DO outshine the originals. The real bonus for everyone however is the completeness of this recording. It is a masterpiece of 20th century B'way musical theatre. IT IS IRRESISTABLE and so much more satisfying to listen to REPEATEDLY than you might expect. Here you truly experience the arc of the story, not just performances of the songs from the show. Being recorded live brings the added bonus of spontaneity as well as the fire that makes these stars shine. BUY THIS and enjoy it over and over and over again...I am!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the real \\"DREAM\\" experience","review":"Forget about the film sountrack. Get this CD set. And it's far better than the original cast recording which goes lacking. More songs and more everything that makes a live performance just what it is. Live (compared to film where anything can be done to enhance a performance!) -- the energy, the excitement and the performances make this a rare treat for anyone wanting to share in the real DREAM experience.Isn't a full Broadway revival long over due. But wait: I've heard rumors that a rvial may be \\"in the works. I certainly hope so. Maybe this time it will receive the Tony award it deserved in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can I rated this higher than five!","review":"Finally...the full \\"Dreamgirls\\" score with dialogue. What a cast! Audra McDonald, Heather Hedley, Lillias White, Billy Porter, Darius de Haas, Norm Lewis, Adrian Bailey...with Alice Ripley, Emily Skinner, Malcolm Gets, Brad Oscar, and Brian Stokes Mitchell thrown in for good measure. Wish I had been there! Maybe we can pray for a DVD of the concert."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cast makes this a must-have","review":"What can you say...just take a look at the cast! If you haven't snapped it up just for that fact alone, think about the powerhouse voices that have been cast as the three leads. I've been fortunate enough to see Lillias White, Heather Headley, and Audra McDonald perform live in other roles and wouldn't pass up a chance to hear them tackle this score. And this is more complete than the OBC recording of the 80's. As a white boy from the suburbs of MN who grew up with Motown music, this was a perfect musical for me. Big belty numbers and quiet ones to go with them...some a mixture of both. This is going to be a huge CD for musical-lovers and Motown fans. Buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For the diehard dreamgirl only!","review":"This is not an easy listen at all. It's just too much noise and fanfare. Contrary to many opinions, I think the Original Cast Recording contained just the right highlights, plus you had the one and only Jennifer Holliday - the only one entitled to belt out those two infamous songs to perfection. This full recording is just too busy and crowded all the time, and everywhere which makes the storyline meticuloously laborious to follow. I, personally, wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Concert Recording","review":"I had a problem reading several of the reviews from previous \\"reviewees\\". Everyone keeps comparing this concert recording to the original. It's not the original, and knowing that,I listened to this as NEW recording. Of course this is not the original, and Jennifer Holliday is not in it, but I'll tell you what...Lillias White is GREAT. It's fresh to hear someone give a new interpritation of a classic performance.All of the cast shines on this recording, and it's great to have the whole show on the cd. I recommend that this be part of anyone's theater collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreamgirls 2001","review":"This was the worst reproduction of Dreamgirls that I ever heard. I was so disappointed the CD went into the garbage. This is one CD that I would not sell to the public because I expect so much and get so little."},{"rating":"2","title":"Billy Oh Billy Oh Billy.....","review":"...this Actor's Fund benefit was so ... good, they're reviving it on Broadway in 2004. Audra McDonald is her usual gorgeous self (physically and vocally) and once Lilias White gets through \\"And I Am Telling You....\\" (who can compete with the Holliday memories, anyway), she relaxes and takes off like a rocket. And Norm Lewis must be the most undervalued Broadway performer today. But, kids, the rocket in the pocket of this show is Mr. Billy Porter -- a transcendent, sexy, roof-blowing, star-making performance. Jimmy's got SOUL indeed. I show a video of this in a class I teach on musical theater and even my Western Michigan students (in an area where there are, like, 5 black people altogether) are blown away by this video and these performers. Highest recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite version","review":"Having seen the original Broadway production and being very familiar with that soundtrack, I was disappointed by this. While I'm glad to have a complete recording, I just felt like it lacked the spark of both the Broadway and movie recordings, especially Audra McDonald's performance (which surprised me). I'm not talking about the difference in quality because it's a live recording - I'm talking about the performances themselves. The feeling behind the words and music wasn't really there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good but.....","review":"I bought the Dreamgirls LP 20 years ago and fell in love with the whole cast. I still follow the careers of the original Dreams...Loretta Devine, Jennifer Holliday and Sheryl Lee Ralph. A couple of years later, my mother finally took me to see the Broadway show. Imagine my shock when I realized only a small fraction of the score was included on the OCR.I was happy to learn that they would be recording this concert. I enjoy all the performers involved especially Headley, White, McDonald, DeHaas and Norm Lewis.I'm happy to have the whole score but oh what a treat it would have been if the organizers has reassembled the original cast to record it. They're all still around and working. This CD is very good but nothing can compare to that magical first cast of performers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Im looking for something","review":"This cast is bland. The acting is Horrible. The songs/music are boring not like the OBC where you get chills. The actors act like they are bored also. Like they do this show everyday on Broadway.I thought this would have more of a motown sound,Sounds like pop.Seth R said he didn't want to make a reunion cast but I think it would have been better.If all of the leads are alive and well then Why Not?Also why does Lillias White do a \\"WHOA\\" in the middle of \\"And Im Telling You\\" she didn't sing that song like I thought she could.Everyone on here is giving this 5 stars but I dont know what they're listening to."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Ridiculous Book -- Don't Buy It","review":"The book is not reasoned well and poorly written by a fairly arrogant author who seems only interested in building up his own reputation.

So i got this amp a couple months ago and it works great! Very nice and clear sound and is no more than 11X11in. I would suggest this for beginers though for its not much of a performance amp though it works as one. Also, for certain effects, you would have to buy pedals along with the amp. I would have like something with built in effects but i was happy that it did have built in distortion.

One other one, the Bach had three noticeable defects on the recording that were not the result of a scratch, but actually encoded in two of the recordings that I had to return. Another one, the Mussorgsky was another recording that would not play at all on either Panasonic BR player. I suppose that I should keep my fingers crossed because I have never had a BR DVD film that did not play, so that is aggravating to run into problems that have to do with an all audio recording. e-mails to Surround Records have been unanswered.

However, the first couple of pages are about the evolution of the frog. It states that the frog has been around for millions of years, before monkeys or cats or people. The next page has pictures showing how the frog evolved from fish. These pages are totally unnecessary to the rest of the text, so it's unfortunate that the author included them. Use caution if you're from a creationist viewpoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been great","review":"Wonderful illustrations and lots of fun facts, but alas, another science book carrying the water bucket for evolution. The brief research I did after reading this book shows that no fossil has been found that shows any transition from fish to amphibian. The skeletal structure of a fish could not support an amphibian, nor are the internal organs the same. These are major changes that would have taken time and thus history would show a transition. The book begins with the evolution of the frog from fish. While it is an interesting theory, it is simply that, until proven otherwise, yet rarely is it ever stated to children that these are theories. I do believe in evolution, the evolution of science, as new things are being discovered every day, and what we believe changes accordingly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointed to have bought this book...","review":"This book is not worth the paper that it is printed on.

This recording of the/a band in 1986 is an emotional, orchestral, spiritual roller coaster. The band is excellent; the best songs are given long versions which in every case improve on the studio versions, a rare occurrence; Mark is in fantastic voice. It's all a perfect setup, except for one thing: would someone who either was there or knows please tell me what the other songs in this concert were? I know that they HAD to do more than 8 songs - what were they? But again - find this out-of-print (in 2005) CD some way, and BUY IT. Believe me, you will thank me.

Read John Tolland, an extraordinary historian who relies primarily on first person sources. Who did Japan use to survey Hiroshima the day after the bomb dropped? The scientist who headed the Japanese atomic bomb program, that's who. If they won the race would they have used it on us? You bet. They'd already proved their visciousness. And if Germany hadn't fallen, how far behind us were they in their atomic development? Just a few months. We only used it first because we got it first. It could have easily gone differently. Hindsight is useless in criticizing the decisions of the past since it always includes information not available to the decision makers (though we did know about the German and Japanese nuclear programs) and inventing conspiracies is a common tactic of the far left (aka, Communists) to try and get people to hate America.

But didn't try firmware flashing yet.In general, setup is good, works well.Some issues:1. DHCP won't work unless the WAN port is connected, i.e. it will act as an AP with no WAN connection.2. WL530G can do mac filtering, but unlike WRT53G you can't copy the mac address from the list that is connected to it. You need to enter it manually.3. If you modify the defaults, make sure you set the router IP and DHCP address range to be of the same subnet.

I've even been able to listen to music while mowing the lawn and not have the music drowned out by the mower engine. Wonderful!I've had some small difficulty getting used to them. They're described as \\"in-ear\\" headphones, which is quite accurate: instead of traditional headphones which sit outside of your ear, these are actually inserted into your ears.

These headphones are among the worst quality I've ever heard, especially for their price range. The bass is muddy and seems detached from the music, as at higher volumes, the bass comes out as almost background noise. The high end is shrill and overpowering, I actually got a mild headache from using these headphones.I used these for a day at work (office setting), listening to various genres of music including classical, hip hop, heavy metal, progressive rock, etc. The only genre that these did nicely in is techno, and even then I didn't get the bass response needed.

The other is the response. The only other earphones I have to compare it against are the Ultimate Ears Super.fi 3, (a.k.a. Altec Lansing UHP336). The Zen suffers very badly by comparison.

So far, I've been disappointed by their sound and overall quality- they sound no better than the EP-630's, but cost twice as much. Also, the cord is made out of the material Creative uses for its basic headphones, which is not as reliable as the other cord material.On the bright side, the headphones do offer better insulation than the EP-630's, and they don't sound bad, but certainly should sound better considering their price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap product and even worse customer service","review":"I purchased these at a airport, so returning them to the store is next to impossible, they worked for about 10 minutes, after contacting the store they pawned me off on the company and after contacting Creative they tried to pawn me off on the store, after finally contacting Creative by email the only way to contact them, they expect me to pay to return them to their service department and pay a fee to look at them.

Amazon sent me replacements by request. The new ones do not have static, but their overall sound quality is dubious, especially in the mid-range in high volumes that sometimes cracks - nothing I experienced while using the EP-630s.It seems that this is an unstable product.

The rest of the time there is a serious cropping issue in which your viewing screen becomes 1/3 smaller, maybe more, and the sound is nothing spectacular.

Hopefully they'll bring out a blu-ray and just leave the original movie alone. As some have mentioned, not the greatest of acting but a good story and great effects (remember it was done in 1983).What I can't understand is why they stripped out scenes for this \\"remastered\\" version.

The first DVD transfer of Brainstorm was quite disappointing, but this one is much, much better, especially on a 16 by 9 TV. There is a litte distortion in the soundtrack in several places, but this is far better than the original DVD. I do wish they would have filled the screen on the 1:85 sequences (instead of window-boxing them), which they did do on the last (4:3) laserdisc release of this movie. I also wish they would have including some extras on this version, but I still highly recommend it!And this is yet one more title that NEEDS TO BE ON BLURAY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Louise Fletcher's best performances.","review":"This is to be seen for Louise Fletcher. Her performance is superb, and what she does to advance the plot (not to mention what she does to get the special effects going)must be seen to be believed. A must for sci-fi fans, who not only get Fletcher and good FX, but they get Christopher Walken and a very early (this was made in 1983) Virtual reality storyline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the acting","review":"The concept about death was very interesting.

I deals with death and life that is not usually thought of and how people grow apart by not comunicating and listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brainstorm - Remastered","review":"I hoped to relive the original story in a comfortable format when I purchased this \\"remastered\\" version of Brainstorm. Sadly, this remastered version is not in a format fit for viewing. The original concept was to present scenes viewed from the aspect of the individual wearing the experimental headset in one format, while the balance of the shots were presented in another format. In this rendition, the scenes from the aspect of the experimenter are presented in great widescreen format with high quality Dolby sound. Unfortunately, most of the story is not presented from the aspect of the experimenter and is put forth in a small format with no appreciable sound quality at all. Be prepared to squint a lot and keep adjusting the volume. Maybe someday this interesting project will be produced in a fashion so that we may all enjoy it without working at it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie. Aspect ratio changes a bit distracting.","review":"I have been waiting for a remastered copy of Brainstorm to come out on BluRay. I had forgotten that this film was shot in multiple aspect ratios, and when viewing it I was a bit distracted from the message of the film by the constant switching.Other than that, this is still the great film I remember. It's not the greatest (so only 4 stars), but certainly worth the cost and time investment. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wanted this one for Awhile","review":"On this one I hade heard some things about the aspect of the wide screen not being quite right, But other reviews I read hade said this version got it right. So I thought I'd give it a try, One thing I noticed was that the Aspect had changed in several parts of the Film, The most interesting parts of it was pretty wide , Other parts were almost like 4.3 aspector full screen. I never hade the DVD copy this , So I can't tell how much it mite be, But I seemed pretty dame good to me. Over all an excellent Blue ray"},{"rating":"1","title":"There was only one good thing in this movie","review":"And that's Russell Crowe, apparently the only real actor in this movie. All the other performances were stilted and wooden. I never felt anything for the heroine except annoyance. Too much time was taken up with a secondary romance. The story was predictable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well developed Character Arc and Echo Relationships","review":"An enjoyable film for the viewer who is interested in character development. It's also a great film to study for its well defined echo relationships. The scenery adds to the beauty and charm of the gently-paced, yet thought provoking topic and era. Well done. Wish there were much more to view by this author/director."},{"rating":"1","title":"If It's Cheap Enough!","review":"\\"For The Moment\\" is a trip to nowhere. The script creates a main plot which could be worthy of film but then creates so many sub-plots and diversions which are given equal billing, that the main plot is totally sacrificed. The acting (with the exception of Crowe) is right off the high school stage. Zeke's love affair with the local \\"camp whore/bootlegger\\" is meant to be touching/romantic but I found it to be fodder for emotional cripples. Several moments make the film worth watching if you can borrow it or buy it cheaply; firstly, the scenery from the low flying plane sequences is superb; secondly, Crowe manages to hold the story together; thirdly, Zeke's incredible, mind bending request of Lachlan(Crowe);fourthly, the \\"Waltzing Matilda\\" scene is extemely well done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Two redeeming qualities- perhaps three","review":"OK, so I saw this moive when it came out in theaters and I decided to rent it a month ago and re-see it. It was still as bad as I remember it being. There are only three redeeming qualities and that is stretching it. They are the use of Pachelbel's canon, Russell Crowe just being on the screen, and Russell Crowe singing \\"Waltzing Mathilda\\". It worth seeing once, but it is a slow moving film, the supporting characters are boring and cliched, and the plot is really quite weak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why I bought this film","review":"I bought this film for one reason: Russell Crowe. Not only can he act, he's my age & he's gorgeous.

I liked this movie since my first viewing. But there is a new version on dvd that has ruined it.

Buy it on VHS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just For the Moment","review":"As a big fan of Russell Crowe I never cease to be amazed at this mans ability to get into his character. One can understand why he is the star he is. This isn't a movie for women only, my husband enjoyed it too.

They work very well and they are quick and easy to use. My favorite thing about these blankets is that the velcro keeps the baby tightly swaddled.

Even so I am satisfied with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Product Ever","review":"This is the best baby product yet. I am a very nervous person so swaddling my newborn with a blanket just didnt keep me sleeping @ night.

I would highly recommend this product to everyone who has a newborn. My daughter is 2 months old and still loves to be swaddled. I will use them for as long as I can. Only thing is make sure you get newborn ones if your baby is small. My daughter is now almost 10lbs and still using the newborn one.

Think twice before you buy this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Newborns","review":"I bought this blanket when my son was 2 weeks old. He weighed about 8 and a half pounds at the time. It was way too big, and there was no way to get it tight enough to provide a snug, swaddled effect. I ended up buying this cool thing from etsy.com called a Swaddle Sleeve. It worked like magic and kept him swaddled for as long as he needed to sleep.I just pulled this blanket back out to try it again (my son is 15 weeks old now). It is still way too loose, and he isn't a particularly small baby. He probably weighs about 13 pounds now. He wiggled out of it in less than a minute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for tiny babies, but not big ones...","review":"It's a very cute blanket (especially the teddy bear velcro tabs!), but as another reviewer has stated, it shrinks in the wash.

However, after washing it twice (and following the washing instructions), it is now an inch and a half smaller than the microfleece ones. My daughter is on the large side (she was 9 lbs at birth), and 1 1/2 inches doesn't seem like that much of a difference, but she can't wear the flannel one anymore. The velcro just barely doesn't reach.Love the fleece ones, very disappointed in this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"we're very glad we have it","review":"we first tried the swaddleme when we were still in the hospital and found our baby slept much better wrapped up. one issue was the velcro was annoying and woke him up whenever we had to change him and we stopped using it for a couple days. once we were home i tried again and found after a few washings the velcro was much quieter. now we use the swaddleme for night time and naps and LOVE it. it's really useful and fast. baby loves it too. he is just much more relaxed once he is swaddled. now that he's 2 months and 11 lbs he is starting to wiggle out and it's not fitting as well but we have a couple other bigger swaddles for him.it's very useful and i would recommend it to anybody. it would also make a great gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"This particular swaddler is made of a thinner sheet material.

Kinda reminds me of a baby straight-jacket, but it worked. My baby has particularly strong legs and was able to kick her legs free and occaisionally get a hand out. But she was always secure when I went to check on her. The fabric is flannel and she got a little hot. But a few wardrobe adjustments took care of that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must buy","review":"We are new parents. People told us to swaddle our baby using a blanket. Maybe a 85 year old bubbie would know how to successfully swaddle a baby using only a blanket, but we sure as heck couldn't figure it out. Our baby is very active and would just work his arms out. Not so with the Swaddleme. We ordered this out of exasperation and a need to pin our son's arms down so he could sleep. It's not as bad as it sounds! If his arms aren't swaddled next to his body, he waves them around and wakes himself up--usually crying.This product makes swaddling idiot proof, The velcro closures are very strong. The design is completely self explanatory. We use it every night at bedtime. He doesn't like the swaddling process, but quiets down immediately once he is secure.Buy at least 3 of them so you can rotate out the dirty ones.

It was hooked to the battery of a truck in long-term storage in a garage, in a benign environment. It's obviously of little use if one can't rely on it to keep a battery topped-off. Out of curiosity, I broke the seal and opened the unit. 120 VAC was still getting to the printed circuit and the on-board glass fuse was good, but the LEDs no longer lit up and there was no DC output. Something in the electronics simply failed.Based on other adverse reviews here, it's obvious that the design is deficient and these units are unreliable. I still need a trickle or float charger, but the replacement unit won't be one of these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good on AGM batteries, and causes some TV interference.","review":"This B&D; float charger seemed to work OK on standard 12V automotive-type lead-acid batteries, but not on AGM types (sealed Absorbent Glass Mat, similar to GELs), although the box says it is also good for maintaining AGM and GEL batteries. When I tried it on an AGM the initial charge cycle was OK but then the following float charge dropped to at least 1 to 1.5 V less than what an AGM needs, resulting in a long-term undercharge while in maintenance mode. This will result in damage to AGM batteries, and probably gel-cells also.TV interference: while charging a battery it causes some picture hash on the lower channels of nearby TV sets that use an antenna, unless it's re-located far away from the antenna (this might not happen with TV's that are connected to cable or satellite systems). Well designed equipment should not have these problems. It was made in China, not here, which seems to explain a lot about quality these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Otherworldly neopsychedelia","review":"Kid Silver is Ken Griffin from Rollerskate Skinny. It is hard to describe the exotic strains of this album. Symphonic, Middle Eastern, hey, it reminds me of Echo and the Bunnymen at times. Ken also mines the Bono vocal vein on a few songs, although his compositions sound nothing like U2. Ken even sounds like Donovan on occasion. It's clear that he's a bit of a chameleon, both with his vocals and ther mercurial nature of his music. Danceable beats underscore a great percentage of this album, but I wouldn't call this electronica. Dead City Sunbeams throws out rays from many different types of music and provides the listener with a unique auditory experience.

Domingo sounds wonderful, I have always admired his taste and restraint as a singer and his lovely tone. Stemme sounds youthful and bright, not honky and LOUD. In the studio, the voices can be properly balanced against the orchestral sound so the singers can sing beautifully. Everything is crystal clear and unforced. I have never been the greatest fan of Wagner but this is goosebump material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soon forgotten","review":"Like most of the studio opera recordings of the recent past, this will soon be forgotten. It's ok, but rather pointless, both musically and economically. The essence of Tristan und Isolde cannot be captured in a studio. It is one of the few, if not the only opera that can only be experienced live in the opera house, where it just envelopes you and mesmerizes you. I remember after act 1 of the Jan 30, 1974 Met Tristan with Vickers and Nilsson, people walking around almost in a daze. It has that type of effect on one in a theater. In the recording studio it sounds artificial, even hokey.Get the Bohm/Bayreuth. And if you have ever heard the live Flagstad recordings, you'll know what I mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Domingo sings Wagner...Oh, NO!","review":"Do not get me wrong. Domingo is a fine tenor. His timber is Italian and French through and through. At age 60, his Otello remains authentic. His venture into Wagner is a disaster.

I actually like the opening of the Ricardo better--I wanted one that DOESN\\"T open all the way like a suitcase--but the Delsey has a detachable shoulder strap. I don't think I'll use it very often, but this will double for travel on the rare occasions I do, and you just need to have both hands free sometimes, or on larger trips, on hand for pulling the bigger suitcase. Luckily, it's a nice lightweight bag.The only reason I don't give it a 5-star is because it doesn't have any organizer pockets. I know for that I should get a business case, but even as a travel case, I think a few smaller pockets in the front pouch would have been a good idea.

Great characters, defeating stereotypes at every turn.Still, all of Mike Murray's books are entertaining and some of my favorites, even though they're lamentably short.

Deafness, arthritis caused by repetitive hand motion, young children put to work because their families were desperate for money, fires in the mill, job-related injuries, long hours of work, poor ventiliation and light - you name it.I heard about this book while watching C-Span and today I'm ordering a copy for a friend in New England whose long-ago relatives came from Canada to work in the mills.It has strengthened my resolve to visit Lowell, Mass. and see what has been preserved.It's fascinating and enjoyable to read - I'm just glad I didn't have to live through the experience myself. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for serious teachers or scholars","review":"Unfortunately this book is filled with historical errors and myths. This journalist did not do his homework. Not only are there several inaccuracies, but the author appears not to be acquainted with the last thirty years of research in women's history. Don't be fooled by the fact that the author writes well, this book is not for use in a classroom or for research. Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"This is a very well written and interesting book about New England Textile industry and the role of women during that period of time. It also addresses the role of immigrants as they merge into our society. I really enjoyed this book for the history and the excellent writing skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"A battle won by the U. S. Navy in the Solomons.","review":"A nice little book about a battle between U.S. and Imperial Japanese Navy ships in Iron Bottom Sound. During this brief encounter the U.S. Navy sunk a Japanese cruiser and destroyer at a cost of a destroyer. Subsequent action by airplanes out of Henderson sunk an additional two Japanese destroyers.Cook was a participant in this battle and goes into great detail about what happened. The U.S. Navy which had been rather lackluster up to this point, showed they were brave and ready to confront equal or superior forces. The result was the Japanese were bested in this battle, with moderate losses. They withdrew after completing their mission.Since the book is short at only 150 pages, the reader can easily read this in a few hours and understand a little on the Guadalcanal campaign, especially the naval side."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad movie from a tour that resulted in a great CD","review":"Joe Cocker - Mad Dogs & Englishmen (DVD of the film): While I treasure the CD album of this tour, the film is a long way from being \`the greatest', in fact, it is a bad movie. The filmmakers obviously tried to use the same kind of techniques used in the Woodstock film but the result is barely tolerable. There is a feature on the DVD that allows you to skip the junk and watch just the concert performances but even there, the film is poor. I wish this were better. I certainly appreciate that there is any film of this tour, but that footage was mishandled here. I do like to pan another's work but my intention is to encourage you not to judge the Great audio CD based on your experience with this mainly irritating film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joe Cocker - Mad Dogs & Englishmen","review":"I have rented three or four Joe Cocker DVD's through Netflix. This is by far his best one, as he was young, and very much in his prime. Comparing his rendition of \\"The Letter\\" in this one vs. his later ones (especially the Italy one in 1981), this is by far the best. Also, his rendition of \\"Something\\" really comes through on this particular DVD. My impression was that he was quite shy during the off-stage episodes of this DVD, but that's only MY impression. He's older now (and so are Mick Jagger & Paul McCartney), but this guy can really belt them out! I just love his gravelly voice. I've visited his website, and am quite impressed with the charitable work that he is doing in Colorado. Go, Joe!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"This dvd is a major let down. I honestly think the previous reviewer rated this without seeing it! The remastering of the film is bad at best.

So many rock doco's of the past have been beautifully remastered (eg Concert for Bangladesh, Elvis - Thats the way it is, to name just two) and yet this opportunity to blast what was a spectacular musical journey right into the new millennium fails to deliver.The CD soundtrack gets it right (sort of) but the DVD is poor and there can surely be no excuses. I feel for Joe Cocker because this event whether he enjoyed the experience or not captured him at his peak and this re-issue should have been a modernised legacy of what a great showman he was in his prime.I put this on expecting my surround sound to fill the room with this great music but regrettably it simply doesnt have the spark.Buy it for novelty value but dont expect the Space Captain to fill your room with a wall of sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"back in the day","review":"Back in the day there were two theatrical-release rock concert films--Woodstock, and Joe Cocker's Mad Dogs. If ever there was a candidate for full screen DVD digitization, this is it. Don't waste you money on the VHS scan and pan Mad Dogs. You won't get half the effect of the original film, much less the multiple screen images of the fabulous band, put through their paces by Leon Russell and Chris Stainton. In the meantime, while you're waiting for them to rescue the original print, clean it up, and stamp out the DVDs, you can get a sense of the film's great soundtrack with the Mad Dogs CD, though with a slightly different selection of songs by Joe and a supporting cast of around forty."},{"rating":"2","title":"mad dogs and englishmen","review":"Great DVD,Have been looking for this movie for 3 years on dvd.Have the video, but the quatily is bad .The remastered DVD quality is a masterful work of art.Have seen joe 3 times live, just recent at casino rama.This DVD IS so good if you have never seen joe live you will think you have after you see this movie.P.S.

One of the plastic tabs broke during assembly. We also couldn't get the wheel apart to clean the feces out and when our hampster hung out in there his long hair was matted with poo. We took it off and threw it away. Now we have a wheel inside of the cage which leaves very little room for the hamsters (we have two).

I went to Wal Mart and this was one of 2 cages available so I bought it. Simply put: I hate it. It was difficult to assemble and the instructions were pitiful (simply illustrations with no text). A picture with the word \\"snap\\" gives no indication that the piece is practically going to have to be hammered into place before it will \\"snap\\" (if it even \\"snaps\\" at all). The gerbil has chewed away plastic on the inner part of the wheel so I don't plan to keep this as her home because I fear she will chew her way out and we'll have a loose gerbil. It will be downgraded to a play spot while we are changing the gerbils' bedding and that's it. I would not recommend this at all... total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not Expand as advertized.","review":"I bought this cage in hopes to buy the assecories to go with it. After weeks of searching online I find two tubes here on Amazon that will fit this cage. I contacted customer services and was informed that the additional pks for this cage had been discountiued. If you think your hamspter will be happy in this cage alone then it is a nice cage but if you need( or would like to expand so your hampster can be happy and have plenty of room) This is not the cage for you! I was very dissapointed and let customer service know. I would not have bought this if I knew it could not be added onto but the box clearly shows 3 small houses that can be bought seperatly and attached with tubes. Weigh your options here and know what you are getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cage!","review":"I like the design of the cage. It is pretty big for my hamster. It is sturdy and light weight. I have a few gripes about it, though.My hamster, and even my sister's (she has the same cage) for some reason have basically moved in the wheel. I think maybe because the wheel is dark, but that is where BOTH hamster's sleep.The wheel is confusing to put together.The wheel is the only thing that I don't like. I wish my hamster would come out and not eat or poop in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give it a 1/2 star or worse","review":"I own several cages for hamsters. All of them, with the exception of the Hartz cage are all Habitrail.This Hartz cage is the biggest piece of trash I have ever had. Difficult to put together and parts don't fit properly. It, absolutely, positively is not interchangeable with Habitrail.The running wheel doesn't fit properly and is so high up on the cage that a small Russian Dwarf hamster can not reach the wheel to use it.We bought this at Walmart for $23, hoping to get a cheaper alternative to the more expensive Habitrail cages. It was a very poor choice.If you hate your Hamster, don't mind poor fits, can do without an exercise wheel, this is the cage for you.On top of all of this, it didn't even come with a food bowl.

Now I know and maybe I won't ever bet again knowing what I've learned from Michael Konik's memoir. He is very honest, maybe too honest if that is possible because he shares things that many of us would probably keep secret. That's the thing about this amazing book. There are no more secrets left because Michael Konik has shared them. If you want the inside story, this is it. Very good writer. Impressive."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book will not teach you how to make wagers... This book book will teach you how to think about wagering.","review":"Another bang on winner! I think Smart Money in particular is a perfect follow up to a book I read a couple of yearsago called \\"The Odds: One Season, Three Gamblers and the Death of Their Las Vegas\\", by Chad Millman. Totally different style obviously Millman has, and obviously written from a mostly superficial, biographical point of view.Both books do a fine job in understanding the industry in a way no one else has ever done. The major differencein Konik's book though is taking the better/bookie relationship to such an entertainingly sophisticated level. It's almost like he writes with a direct probe to his characters minds, thoughts and consciousness.This book is an absolute must for fans of Sports Wagering."},{"rating":"2","title":"gambling epic","review":"Great read, and I should know, I wrote 602 Reasons to be Ticked Off, another epic work. Michael Konik's book is an unbelievable story of an undercover life he led for over three years, you will wish you were there with him as you turn the pages. It's a page turner, similar to House of Cards. This book should and probably will be a movie, I highly recommend it. Even if you know nothing about gambling, trust me you will love it. Incredible insight into the world of gambling, turns out the casinos aren't all they say they are.PS I think I read somewhere that if you don't read this book, there is a very good chance you could be bumped off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"I found this book to be boring and poorly written. Although it covers an interesting topic (betting syndicates), it offers no real insights or anything new. The author provides agonizing details on the football bets he placed and it soon begins to feel like you are reading the same chapter over and over. His frequent references to the proclivities of his girlfriend seem out of place and unrelated to the story - is he bragging? or trying to make her look bad? In any event, why should we care?After reading the book, and then seeing the author as an announcer on a TV-Poker show, it becomes clear that he is capitalizing on the new fads, but just isn't bringing enough to the party."},{"rating":"1","title":"LA BS","review":"The only thing bigger than the sports betting consortium that Michael Konik writes about is his ego. This book is an exercise in self-importance and self-aggrandizement. There really is no danger, it exists only in the mind of the writer. If you enjoy books about people who act like jerks to other people while borrowing someone else's thunder, this book is for you. This book has hardly anything of interest about sports gambling. For an interesting book about sports betting, read The Odds, by Chad Millan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there an echo?","review":"Very very very repetitive, probably could have cut the book in half if not more. If you like to read over nearly every bet this guy made they go ahead and buy this book, otherwise save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"While Konik's book does not give a complete breakdown of the system used to completely beat the Vegas sports books (the bettors would never have allowed that) he does present an interesting story about the lengths some bettors will go to in order to beat the lines. The book describes an interesting cat and mouse game between the top sports gambler who are trying to place as much money on games as possible, and the casinos and online sports books who refuse to take action from a winning player. Konik provides great insight into a world in which $10,000 bets are commonplace. Very quick and enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great War Stories with some Tips","review":"A very interesting read. The book reviews the author's experience working with a sports betting syndicate. There are some good war stories, mixed together with some tips and ideas that are useful for sports betting. This book can psyche you up to be a \\"sharp bettor\\" in the sports betting world.This reminds me of the \\"Market Wizard\\" books for investors and traders. Those books can get traders \\"psyched up\\" for trading/investing. This book is a surprisingly motivating book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would Make a Good Movie","review":"I read Smart Money a while back and was telling a friend about it to check out.

How on earth someone can take Las Vegas and a subject like sports betting and make it boring is beyond me. If the author ever had an ounce of insight, he probably should've shared it. He should stick to journalism and avoid narrative writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super insights into betting syndicates? Not really.","review":"Konik must have had a bunch of his betting buddies vote 5 stars for this book 'cause there's about as much chance of this being a 5 as he claims the 'squares' do of beating the bookies. Zip. Short version: mostly boring, 100 pages too long wasting paper and ink on stuff we couldn't care less about (his problems with his girlfriend and forever restating lines and bets) and really DOESN'T tell a lot about syndicate gambling. Just a lot of reliving wins and losses and moving money with all the credit going to computer programs. Duh. Thought it was going to be a great book but I got suckered on a crafty title. Wish I'd bet the money it cost me on the Superbowl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Michael Konik is the bookie!","review":"After being robbed of $10 I feel like Michael Konik is my bookie and I just hit a 12 game teaser and he won't give me my money back.

The real con here is that Michael Konik passes him self off as a writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give less stars, I would","review":"Probably the worst book I have ever read in my life.

Conversions is a great record that remains the unsung hero of mid-nineties electronic creativity. All tracks are coherent, original and beautifully melodic. Very boppy and up-tempo, and with one foot firmly planted in Drum & Bass, Conversions will always make heads turn and feet tap. K&D Live up to their reputation as seamless mixers, creators and producers on this release. Although Amazon have the original release date for this as 1999, it is in fact a much older record that precedes everything K&D have done bar G-stoned (I think!). This further underlines their reputations as cutting edge downbeat peddlers."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed","review":"I absolutely love the K+D SESSIONS, so I bought this album hoping to have the same urban, ultra-cool listening experience.

This is one of the poorest games I have ever played. Cautions are complete and utter chaos, with cars running over each other and stopping for no reason. The patch to fix it causes sever graphics problems with the pace car and does nothing to fix the cautions, and if you go over 70% race distance in season mode, your car no longer uses fuel or tires. The races are also one lap shorter than the real races.

There is a wide range of opinions, but most authors clearly support the Pope."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Black and White Cookie....","review":"Here is a clear presentation of a black and white world for the rigid-minded person with great fear of ambiguity and human being. It is a beautiful system of thought, indeed. No holes. No nooks or crannies. Just an iron cage of moralizing, dressed up as scholarship, this book will provide any needy person with significant psychological boosts to her levels of cognitive rigidity, dogmatism, intolerance of any shades of gray in the world (or God's working in the world for that matter), and dependance on authority. Might appear to be sweet, like a cookie, like a black and white cookie that makes the world such a nice and orderly place....for children...or adults with arrested development.

This is a setting in which Paul Simon honestly speaks about the details of the album and it's a very good look into his creative process. You get to see his lyric writing method and how he worked with South African musicians. The dvd addresses the controversy caused by people who accused Paul of stealing music from Africa, and the African musicians dispell that by pointing out that they collaborated with Simon the get their music heard by a wider audience, which it did.Paul ain't the most charismatic dude, but he's honest and it's a lot of fun to watch this album come together."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Graceland Interviews","review":"Paul Simon is the musical genius of my generation.

Unlike so many films that supposedly depict people of my age interacting, this one was real. The dialogue had all the awkward pauses and weird chuckles that real conversation does. It felt very natural. I identified with these character. It also spoke to me as a 20-something fresh out of school and dealing with the real world and things not being as simple as they once were.

It was described as a review of the Million Man March. There was not one speech or actual footage of the Million Man March, coincidentally, which was what I was seeking and the main reason why I ordered this DVD. Bill Bennett got his rocks off talking in a condescending tone about what African Americans should think or not think about Louis Farrakhann and what the Million Man March stood for, the audacity. However, it is typical of many WASP, in thier warped minds, they feel that they have a right and a moral compass to tell everyone what they should think or what they should feel. Very disappointing!!! Don't purchase this DVD if you want to see footage of the Million Man March. If you want to see the Charlie Rose show, featuring Bill Bennett ranting and raving about what Black people should think and who they should support,throw your money away and purchase it."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong product shipped","review":"when clicking on the product at you site the image kept changing from a shoe string to velcro.

But these particular shoes have virtually no tread at all, and what little they have will wear down quickly & become slick & unsafe. I've seen this lack of tread on other New Balance shoes as well & I can't understand why they do this. These shoes are a nasty fall waiting to happen.

Anyone who defines this generous writer as a Feminist based on \\"The Longings of Women\\" has given it a most superficial reading. Three women's stories, each spotlighting a male cad who defines the arc of the women's lives, yet the book is so thoroughly the stories of those women that the men function to move the plot but not to provide easy scapegoats. Piercy doesn't stack the deck for either Leila or Becky as they maneuver their lives' choices around their loutish husbands, so as the book neared its conclusion I found it very exciting. The way Piercy reveals the character of Becky in particular is masterful. Of course, the story of Mary Burke is quite a singular exploration of the homeless, very specific and hard to shake."},{"rating":"1","title":"obviously written by a feminist!","review":"And I am a feminist (so, I can be critical!) Marge Piercy's books are too pat. The women are all serious and dedicated, the men are all bad, and no one has a sense of humor. She makes her point, albiet in a very preachy manner. Her best books consist of her vision of the future. Read the book, He, She and It for her best."},{"rating":"1","title":"A thoroughly disappointing novel.","review":"This book was a disappointment from start to finish.

God put these leaders in place for a reason and according to the Bible was should be obedient to the leaders placed above us.

He hits the nail on the head when he observes, \\"When the church becomes a place of brokerage rather than an organic community, she ceases to be alive. The church becomes a distribution center, a place where the poor go to get stuff and the rich come to dump stuff. Both go away satisfied (the rich feel good, the poor get clothed and fed) but no one is transformed. And Jesus did not set up a program but modeled a way of living that incarnated the reign of God.\\"This is not an easy read - I was reminded time and time again of those areas in my life when I have not followed Christ but my own desires. The questions he asks are difficult but necessary if we want to explore what it truly means to be a Christian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shane Claiborne's Manifesto","review":"Love him or hate him, you can't say that Shane Claiborne doesn't make you think. In \\"The Irresistible Revolution,\\" Claiborne challenges the Church to think differently about poverty, materialism, and love. Part memoir, part manifesto, the book follows Claiborne from his Tennessee childhood to working with Mother Teresa to starting the Simple Way in Philadelphia. While I don't agree with all of his statements (a few times he considers \\"military intelligence\\" to be an oxymoron), Claiborne has definitely inspired me to think differently about how I can help make the world a better place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This book was an amazing honest perpective about how to take life, God, and other people seriously.

While I agreed with many of the things stated in this book I had a problem with Shane's viewpoints on violence (lack of understanding for the necessity of violence sometimes in order to protect), and the responsibility of Americans (ie., not voting). Definetly a great read but one that requires discernment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Irresistible","review":"This book knocked me on my but.

He was idealistic and preachy at best. Having worked at a retreat center for ten years of my life, when I was young and hopeful, I experienced first hand the hyprocracy of those who wrote books telling people what to do/how to live/what \\"Jesus meant\\" and yet couldn't come near to living what they preached. It is nice to think that Shane is living what he is preaching, but he does come across as a bit too much of a know it all and a stone thrower."},{"rating":"2","title":"You need to read this book","review":"You simply must read this book - thoughts that I have had for a long time are written down and expressed succinctly.

I would definitely recommend this book to everyone. There were some minor things that I disagreed with, and many things that I'm still mulling over. But the issues he brought up need to be thought and prayed over. Too many people don't consider them deeply enough. Even if you don't agree with some of his conclusions, if it makes you truly and deeply think about the issues, it's worth it.It's also a very easy read.

I hope he walks his talk, and perhaps it's just his advisors who are sending the inconsistent message."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the Bible instead","review":"From the first pages I knew what this book was. Pop cultural American neo-socialism. This arrogant diatribe bashes everyone who calls themselves a Christian or lives in America. Claiborne distorts scripture to support radical social agendas. He brags about breaking the law and being arrested! He rationalizes the actions of terrorists like Timothy McVeigh! I actually had to stop reading this book in the middle because it made me physically sick. I had to read it for a class or I would never have finished it. If you want to know TRUTH and be RADICAL don't read this book until you read the BIBLE. When Claiborne's arguments don't line up with scripture DO NOT take his word that it is because he knows the Greek (he doesn't! his grasp of original languages is awful; who fact-checked this book?). This book is dangerous because it is aimed at young people and people who will not study the Word for themselves to see that Claiborne's claims about \\"truth\\" are lies."},{"rating":"1","title":"some good points but...","review":"it comes across at times very arrogant and very judgmental. I am in no way a rich and even less so a powerful person but I do have a very huge problem with those who condemn and judge those who are en masse. Jesus himself had his share of well to do friends. He just didn't come for the poor, he came for all. That UNIVERSAL message seems to be really missing from so many of these like minded books.Also I realize the author is very young, hopefully in time, he'll learn the importance of humility."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"First of all, I bought this book only because it was required reading for one of my classes. Second of all, if I had known what I know now after reading it, I would have just dropped the course. Claiborne really just has this diction that is not appealing in the slightest.
