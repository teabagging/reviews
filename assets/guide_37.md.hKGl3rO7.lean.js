It has foul language, risque outfits and some discrimination (referring to the scene where in the background it refers to a Cuban in a vulgar manner).The story is not developed and poorly written.

I received a replacement very promptly (which is why Grendel's Cave is a great seller), and I started having issues with that one too almost immediately with the bullet chamber opening not staying in place (which took a judicious amount of double-sided tape to fix so that it would remain closed!).

I bought it so my son could hear real German (takes German in HS). I found the clarity of speech was exceptional - we could clearly hear everything spoken during most of the movie, and having the English subtitles was great. I thought the acting was \\"just OK\\" and I also felt the film lacked continuity in places. But, having said that, our whole family really enjoyed the film and I would recommend watching it for the great story, beautiful scenes, and pretty good action. Also, I feel this movie is very appropriate for young adults (e.g. teenagers) - there wasn't a lot of gratuitous swearing and killing. The biggest weird thing about the movie is the camp commander trying to hunt down the escapee for years - that just wasn't credible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed Opportunity","review":"Well, just finished watching this, I am a big fan of WWII movies, i.e. \\"Downfall\\" & \\"Stalingrad\\" are some of the best. This on the other hand had me laughing out loud at a few of the formulaic story-lines they threw in, the completely ridiculous love scene with the pin-up Inuit girl was right out of \\"Dances With Wolves\\" (look close and you will see a Hello Kitty poster in the tepee) but perhaps most laughable was the showdown with the NKVD captain at the Iranian border crossing at the end, I almost fell outta my seat. The musical score was right out of a Godzilla movie, and the ending was shot like a Hallmark Hall of Fame made for TV Xmas film.

Macedonia had never been a \\"spirit of hellenism\\". The ancient Macedonians conquered the ancient Greeks, but the Modern Greek had conquered 50% of Macedonia in 1913 which is still in the borders of Greece. Books like this one serve to justify the Greek occupation of Macedonia, while the ethnic Macedonians are daily oppressed, forbidden to use their Macedonian language and have a Macedonian personal names."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Truth","review":"A fallacious account of Macedonian history, most likely fueled by greek propaganda.

The weapon feels very sturdy, composed mostly of ABS plastic with some metal parts (safety and trigger).Despite the low FPS (190), the weapon is fairly accurate at relatively short distances. After 10-15 feet, the BB curves upwards. I recommend using .2g BBs to offset the curve and increase the accuracy, although it will lower the overall range.The sights are very small and requires a good eye to sight with. Otherwise, this compact weapon would make an ideal emergency backup in any skirmish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for all ages!","review":"Having received this video as a gift, we watched it as a family, accompanied by a lot of laughter and \\"I didn't know that\\".

I can't imagine how fans felt when this was coming out but it was such a strange path to get Bruce back in the Batman costume. A strange tangent involving random ninjas was the biggest offense but if add that to terrible dialogue by Robin and Nightwing you have a dreadful book. Also there is a change in attitude towards Azrael by Bruce that doesn't fit with his character at all. The art was good in places terrible in others. Overall, this is book that is better left to the recesses of our memories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story","review":"I had read the book written by Dennis O'Neil and that lead me to the comics.

Unfortunately, Part III picks up at issue Batman #506, which creates a sizable hole between parts II and III, especially since in the interim J.V.P. lets two men die, driving Bruce, Time, and Dick (Batman, Robin, and Nightwing) to wage their quest against him. The story does a great job of creating a distinction between Valley's armor and weapons and Wayne's belief in Ninjisu, Gymnastics, and Martial Arts. For a comic fan, the progess of Bruce back to top form is truly enjoyable in the vein of Batman Begins. With an exceptional final battle between Bruce and J.P.V., this is a good conclusion to the story Knightsend; the only drawback is the frustration over the missing parts of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"I do not think this filter works well.","review":"I have this filter.

Then there is a long, long, narrative explaining what a facinating and extraordinary life she has led. Then, her life story.

But the worse offense- several packages were rancid! It seemed to be the plain salted peanuts mostly. The honey nuts had a slightly off taste, but not as bad as the salted peanuts. The cashews were OK, but not as good as cashews I've had from regular cans of Planters.

While there are many other string nut materials on the market, graphite is one of my least favorite to work with because it tends to not be very durable. While its self-lubrication and sustaining properties are very good, the material itself often chips and fractures very easily. It's very common to see a broken graphite nut at the low E on shredder guitars.NOTE; GRAPHITE IS NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE GRAPHTECH COMPANY. Graphtech is a wonderful string nut manufacturer.

The Carver is a great part of the series and it is brilliantly used only sparingly so that the viewer doesn't get sick of it. The Carver does have a presence throughout the season though and it's great when you find out who it is. There are other great story lines though, all that Matt goes through, Christian's past comes up again and he goes through hell this season, Julia's business ventures. This season has it all and I am just confused why it got bad reviews. It is very engrossing and pervoactive televison."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Season!","review":"I am very happy that I purchased this season. Surreal, haunting, sexy, provocative, and unique are only a few adjectives I can think of to describe this fantastic series.Now that The Carver has been revealed, I wonder what villan is in store for us for the upcoming season.....I heard Brooke Shields is to play a villan psychiatrist, but perhaps that is not true.At any rate, the third season is a must-own just to see Matt turn in to a raging A**H**E.I only wish the Ava character would come back -- she does a bit part in the first of this series, but it just is not enough! I love the characters of Ava and Kimber!"},{"rating":"1","title":"On the tracks....","review":"This is just a horrible season for a show that was so innovative in seasons one and two. Sure, there are some good episodes here; even a few turns mid-season that could keep you guessing. Basically, though, if you can't see the ending coming, you are lying on the tracks with six 40-ounce Old English in ya. What a shame. I won't \\"spoil\\" it by revealing just how obvious the whole thing is, but....IT IS! If you think you know -- you know. The show was so damn good in the first two seasons that I hate not to support it, but please save yourself the money and go buy Weeds, Season 1, to find the newest revolution in cable."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't receive my package.","review":"Amazon is saying that my package has been delivered, but, i still haven't got anything.

It is now Sept. 25 and I don't have it or a response to my first e-mail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really not good","review":"Season 3 of Nip/Tuck's claim to fame is that the writers apparently made the adventurous decision to turn over the plot development and writing to Harvard's sophomore \\"creative writing\\" class, or to Saturday Night Live's writers. (Who can tell the difference anyway?)The Carver plot line is just too stupid for words, the writing ham-fisted, the acting posed and cliche. The goodwill earned in the first season -- already stretched to the limits by the ludicrous time distortions inherent in the depicted healing processes -- evaporates by the third overlong limey monolog by the chick from Boston Legal. By the end, the characters are so pompous and wooden, the plotlines so hoakey and patheticc that you'll be saying \\"never again\\" as you chuck the boxed DVD set into your Amvets donation box."},{"rating":"2","title":"NIP/TUCK the Third Season","review":"These season's are hot I mean 'HOTT' can't wait until I get the last three season's.

The recipient tells me she enjoyed watching it very much. Will buy from this seller again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Writing!","review":"Nip Tuck was an excellent show. It was like a roller coasters ride, never a dull moment. The show would evoke a wide variety of emotions from anger to heart break.I highly recommend the show to viewers who do not have a weak stomach, for the medical procedures are realistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was going well until..","review":"I got to the third disc and there was a scratch on it so the first episode of the disc wont play, hard to watch a series when you miss an episode very dissapointing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My baby loved it!","review":"My 14 month old son loves this in the bath tub! He loves throwing balls so this was perfect for him!! Now to keep him out of the bathroom LOL"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't stick to wall","review":"I bought this for my two-year-old son because I thought he would enjoy putting the balls in the hoop. Unfortunately, it is totally impossible to stick the hoop to the wall. I have regular tile on the shower wall and both my husband and I failed to get the suction cups attached to the hoop to stick. Very disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to stop using...","review":"My 18-24 month old got fairly annoyed with this bath toy. The hoop is just a net, so the balls don't come out of the bottom. You have to reach back into the hoop to get the balls out. When my son or I did this, the hoop came off the bathtub wall. I specifically had a problem with the left suction cup not staying attached. The right suction cup worked fine, so the hoop was always falling sideways. Also, the balls have small holes in them and take in water. I had a serious issue with mold collecting in the balls...and at bathtime, if you squeezed the balls, a ton of mold flakes come out. Unless I cleaned them out before bath time, I really didn't want them in the tub. I'd suggest going with another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap product","review":"It arrived broken and seems very flimsy and poorly made. The idea for the toy is great as my kids would love playing ball in the tub. Wouldn't buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyers beware","review":"I am not sure if we got a defective item but it does not stick to the shower tile. The suction cups do not work. The hoop is extremely small."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, cheap toy","review":"I got this toy for my son who is 2. For something so inexpensive, it seems well constructed. I'm impressed the suction cups stick so well to the tile of my bath enclosure; you really have to pull to remove them. I also like that the balls can double as squirters.So, all in all, a good little value toy for the bored bather."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for my son","review":"I bought this for my son at 18 months. he will occasionally throw the balls in the hoop, but most of the time, just enjoys having 3 balls to play with in the tub! I recommend it though, as it seems like it will last a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"MMM","review":"The idea of this toy is super cute, but the suction cups don't work very well and as with all squirt toys it gets moldy on the inside. The kids play with it I would say about 30% of the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"doesn't hold well","review":"doesn't stay stuck on the tub but cute and hasn't broken yet (after 2 years) would recommend for little kids"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly a good time!","review":"I bought these for two very bath resistant boys. They took them out of the package and started playing with them before we even got into the tub! They look forward to the bath now so they can play with their \\"special\\" bath toys.I have a little problem getting the suction cups to stick to the tile walls. We pretty much just re-stick them every night as we're drawing the bath.The hoop is a little small for my kiddos to get the ball into, but that's helping them learn to aim better, so it's not a big deal.The balls are soft enough that it doesn't hurt if (when) they throw them at each other. They bounce pretty easily off the walls too so be prepared to chase them around the bathroom!This was one of three bath toy sets I recently bought to replace old toys and this is the one they want to play with the most."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift","review":"I got this for my nephew and son and they absolutely love this. I highly recommend this for small toddlers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought it was okay until mounting it to my tripod","review":"At first I noticed that the build quality is a bit cheap, but I didn't mind because the plastic materials keep the weight down. The problem is that it doesn't connect well to the camera. There is too much play between the two parts (camera and battery pack). I also have an arca swiss style L bracket mounted to the camera and battery pack. When I mount the rig in my tripod's quick release plate and secure everything down you really see how flimsy this thing is. Handheld it's fine, but on a tripod there's just too much movement. I've decided I'll just keep an extra battery or two in my pocket and shoot verticals with the camera's shutter release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed after a few months of use","review":"I am an adventure photographer, and I liked the feel of the battery pack, but after just a few months of use in Europe, Vietnam and Cambodia, it failed. It now will only power the camera from the battery in the slot closest to the tall part that goes into the battery compartment of the D200. I've tried everything I can think of to make it work like it originally did, but nothing seems to help. I'm looking on eBay for one to replace it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best way to go if your going....","review":"This took my D-200 to the final level...great investment...went 2to 3 days while on vacation while shooting 4 gigs a day of stuff...love this little guy...plus it allows for AA usage in a pinch..gotta love that..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best accessory for Nikon D200","review":"If you own a Nikon D200 spend the money and get one of these and another battery. Don't even think about it. Just get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"D200 Battery Grip","review":"Extends my battery life greatly. It allows me to use 2 batteries at once. It also helps my FPS go up by an additional frame a second. The grip is comfortable, firm, and attaches easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"once you go batgrip you never go back","review":"Although I've never quantifiable measured number of exposures or time difference between a single battery and using the bat/grip. It feels like 3 to 4 times as much power before I need to change out the batteries. The extra weight also feels good on the camera. As far as the vertical controls, it would be nice if there was a menu/selector button on the grip so you could cycle through things. Also when I'm in vertical mode i tend to push the menu/selector button with my forehead and focal point runs all over the view finder. a little weird."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plasticky but nice","review":"In comparisment to the D200 body this grip feels very cheap and plasticky. Also the doors to the battery compartment look like they won't last long.But those are the only bad things about this grip. It works as it should while adding an extra weight and better balance to the camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little pricey, but worth it","review":"An awesome extension for the D200. It doubles the operating time, and adds extra grip options for the camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes the camera last a lot longer","review":"This is a cool implementation of a much needed device for those with D200s. The camera loves batteries. Having two is good! Having the ability to watch one drain and knowing there's another on standby is a fine feeling. Knowing that there are two more batteries in the case waiting is even better! For a full day of shooting, you need this and some serious memory. Highly recommended. Also handles AAs... always good in field conditions.Used this combination with an attached 300mm telephoto on a field tripod for a solar eclipse in very windy conditions. The results were wonderful: no shake, no issues, and still had plenty of battery to use afterwords."},{"rating":"2","title":"solution for hungry camera","review":"This device is great, it doubles the life of my d200, and it also rounds out the feel of the camera. the vertical shutter button is oddly placed, but i have never felt one that felt right.this is good for some one looking to even out the weight on their camera when using long lenses, or if you need more battery power"},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential for vertical shooting.","review":"Pros:1. Makes vertical shooting much easier.2. Spare battery is right there.3. Easy to take on and off.4. InexpensiveCons:1. Made of plastic. D200 is made of metal.2. White plastic battery clips break easily.3. Hard to reach back multi selector control dial with thumb when in vertical position.Bottom Line:If you shoot verticals or run through the batteries quickly, you get it.BTW:If you are going to shoot from a tripod take the grip off, its fast and easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has it been that long ago?","review":"I lived in the Cincinnati area from '69 thru '71 and I frequented several clubs located around the University of Cincinnati. I was familiar with several bands at the time, but I'd never had the chance to see Whalefeathers. My knowledge of them comes strictly from hearing them on WEBN-FM. They played their self titled album which included \\"I Don't Need No Dr.\\" and an old St. Stephen tune \\"Bastich\\". There were other songs, but I don't remember the titles. I do remember that I liked them and bought the album which I proceeded to wear out.I'm glad to know the band is so well remembered, and their stuff is available again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good.","review":"I think the people raving about this being such a great circle cutter must work in the PR dept. for OLFA, because cutting nice, clean circles is hit or miss with this. I bought this because cutting circles with scissors never results in clean edges. Cutting paper or fabric with this does not result in clean edges."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless for paper","review":"I bought this cutter to create perfect circles in 80lb cover weight paper. After spending over an hour with it and going through at least 10 sheets of paper, I can only say that it does indeed cut circles, but they are far from perfect. I am using a self healing cutting mat and the paper is taped down as well, but I can never get a clean edge. Never. I then tried a glass mat and the edges were better but never perfect. I would not recommend this for paper where you are looking for precise circles. It might be better for fabric like a few videos around show it doing, although I haven't tried it.

So I already had a growing interest in Townsend's work. But listening to this CD makes you wonder if Devin Townsend was an ADHD kid. This album is all over the place, but still cool enough for you to get into. Casual listeners however my be scared off initially, don't let the ambience spook you. Townsend goes out of his way to include some catchy hooks and choruses in among all the chaos. I still have the line \\"Don't eat your beets...recycle\\" blaring though my head. Devin Townsend is someone to keep and eye out for in the future.If your are feeling adventurous, I suggest you pick this up and give it a shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"screaming is not singing","review":"i dont know this one didnt do it for me, a lot of screaming and pitchy notes just wasnt good enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why are reviewers calling this metal!??!!?","review":"Calling this metal in any form is just wrong.

My first introduction to Devin Townsend was with Strapping Young Lad, but Terria is a cut above the rest. This albulm is perfectly produced and the atmospheric quality to the sound drenches the listener. My personal favorites on the CD are No ones here, earth day and stagnate but all of the songs are worth listening to over and over again. buy this alblum and make your friends listen to it. they'll thank you. SPREAD THE GOSPEL OF DEVIN TOWNSEND."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Piece Of Work","review":"Devin Townsend has been my inspiration since I found out about him appearing in Vai - Sex and Religion album long time ago.. Terria definitely takes you to a different world only our mind can imagine where this world is.... Every single time I listen to this album, it really touches me very much insideout and I have been playing drums to his songs.. It feels so great to be behind my Roland V Drum kit. I was imagining myself playing for Devin in his concert..Oh How I wish I was in his band permanently...Every songs are entirely amazing and all songs stand out on its own. My personal favourites are from Earth day to Canada to Stagnant to Nobody's Here to Universal and .......You figure it out... I am having a blast with this album... Devin you have changed my life...

The album is atmospheric, original, angry and beautiful all wrapped into one. I personally love this album and \\"Accelerated Evolution\\" the most out of all of Townsend's work. Where as \\"Evolution\\" may be considered a little more quote-unquote mainstream both these albums just flat out rock from beginning to end. Amazing, do yourself a favor and pick both up and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Umm, no, this doesn't work for me","review":"Look folks, this was NOT intoxicating or even mountainous. Really sorry that I have to be sour about this, but it's pretty obvious that this not what has gotten Devin to his pinnacle at this point....WAKE UP!! IT'S HIS METAL, INDUSTRIAL-METAL! That is what Mr. Townsend is good at and what he should have stuck to. I'm sorry that I'm not a fan of this 'progressive' style, or whatever you like to call it... it just sounds like he was trying to mix folk with some type of glam or passion-rock. IT DOESN'T WORK!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is just bad noise","review":"Not only is it bad noise, but it's an insult of the highest order to call it \\"Progressive\\". Progressive what? Noise? Devin made a fool of himself on Steve Vai's Sex and Religion (although he, by far, was not the only thing wrong there), and he continues to sound awful on these solo efforts...except now, he's the only one to blame.We're choosing to put him in the same category with the likes of Pain of Salvation, Symphony X, Threshold, and Vanden Plas? Why? Because his albums are distributed by the same record label as those other artists? Sorry...that doesn't count. It never ceases to amaze how some people manage to gain respect, even though they've done nothing to deserve it.C'mon people...this isn't good. Buy something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the more amazing albums you will ever hear","review":"Enough can not be said about Devin Townsend's approach to writing music.

Janette Oke is fast becoming one of my favorite authors. The many different character's she brings to life are each memorable and touching as they go in and out of the boarding house.

I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think the book was very nice and detailed.","review":"From what i remember it was detailed which gave me the feeling to feel sympathy for those in the book.

I have enjoyed them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was quite a letdown","review":"I have come accustomed to reading Janette Oke's thought-provoking books, but this one did none of the sort. This has little romance, which also surprises me, and the plot drags on and on; it never really seems to get anywhere to me.

I would not recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Oke's best.","review":"\\"Julia's Last Hope\\" is a typical Janette Oke book, but I felt that it fell short of her other books. I always turn to Oke's books when I need a book to read quickly, and this is the case with this one. While it's light and easy to read, I didn't feel it provoke any emotions within me, like her stories usually do. I thought the plot to be rather redundant, and I was waiting for something to happen - and nothing ever did. I do not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misinformation-Buyer Beware!","review":"Well, I love both of these movies (the only good ones out of all five) but this set is terrible.

Eric has thoroughly researched and written about this particular aspect of American pop culture and its relevance to historical events that has been sorely neglected since Planet of the Apes hit the big screen in 1968.

She and the band, 3 microphones, and 2 hours later I still wasn't ready for it to end.All American Bluegrass Girl is a rock solid album, with excellent production values. There's a good mix of ballad, uptempo, religous, and patriotic songs, perfomed by the best band in the world.Why then, did I feel let down? After listening to her live album for most of the last year, my expectations werre pretty high. Rhonda & the band feed off each other and the audience during her live shows, and that excitement is nearly impossible to replicate in the studio. I put the cd in expecting that rush, and it wasn't there.If you like Rhonda, or if you like bluegrass, you won't be disappointed. but if you get the chance to see Rhonda live, do it. It may be the best show on earth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good music, not good recording","review":"Rhonda has a good band and some great material, but she is being let down by her own Adventures studio, her husband, producer -Darrin Vincent was giving a talk about production and he did not mention analog, a lot of bluegrass musicians still use 2 inch tape to record on because it iso warm. Also, there are great digital recordings that I have heard that have been mastered in the analog domain. If you know music, compare Rhonda's \\"One Step Ahead\\" and this.

I'm an \\"old school console rpg'er\\". I was really into the Final Fantasy series and Dragon Warrior series on old Nintendo console systems so I was excited when I heard Dragon Quest VIII was released for the PS2 and decided to buy it. I wasn't disappointed at all. It has amazing graphics, but still has that 8-bit console feel to it still. And if you've played any of the Dragon Warrior games on the old 8-bit Nintendo console, you'll immediately recognize some of the monsters, sounds, and music when you play the game. It brought a smile to my face since it was nostalgic for me. The storyline is pretty good too and the dialog between the characters in the game can be humorous at times. Overall I give this game 6 stars out of 5. It's really that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old School + New School = Perfection.","review":"Prominently featuring the retro gameplay and storytelling styles of the 8-bit era and the fantastic graphics and sound of the current generation of game systems, Dragon Quest VIII might sound like an idea that is just too simple to be effective. However, that assumption on a casual glance would be wrong. This game gets everything right, making it the obvious choice for \\"RPG of the Year\\".I highly recommend this game. Dragon Quest VIII is more than worth the money, clocking in at 60 or more hours of challenging play, with even more things to do after \\"The End\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny","review":"A great game.

It feels like you're playing a terrible MMORPG, hour upon hour upon hour of level grinding and no story to boot. Except, this isn't even as fun as an MMORPG (which I can't stand by the way) because character customization is almost totally absent and what little their is (the skill system) is pretty much useless!I played this game for 20 hours before finally sitting back, sighing and saying \\"this game totally bites.\\" Don't waste your time and your money on this game.There's a reason why this series never got popular outside of Japan.

You are able to explore a vast 3D world in a middle ages setting. Unlike past Dragon Quest games you are able to explore a large portion of the environment and meet special wild monsters while you explore it. Another unique feature which no other Dragon Quest game has had is seeing your character in combat, also shields and weapons change appearance on your characters depending on what you equip. And combat is easy to pickup and challenging to master. I highly recommend this game to everyone looking for a good role playing game.By dargondarkfire"},{"rating":"2","title":"No more \\"Cut Scenes\\"","review":"So far I am 15 hours into the game. In more ways then one this game reminds me of the original Dragon Warrior for NES. The gameplay is great and the game is fun. Which leads me to the reason I am writing this review..... the cut scenes. This game would be a five star game if not for the cut scenes. Out of my 15 hours, I have 10 hours in cut scenes. I play games for battles, dungeons, and tough bosses, not to read storylines. If I wanted that I would read a book. It makes me want to throw the controller through the TV.

But then there are a million things to do, if that's what you want.To be more specific - level ups are slow in higher levels, and you get to the point where you have to beat bosses to advance because the regular monsters aren't worth enough. There's no fast track to the end of the story line and the side quests are a neccessary part of building up.Then there's the alchemy pot. Nice idea. Nice way to get new items. But, you end up stopping constantly to reload the pot. Or to figure out what you can make.Also, when exploring, you do get attacked a little too often.I played this 70 hours and got what looks like about half to 2/3rds through and couldn't sit through it any more.

The storyline and many side quests give the game great re-play value.Anyone familiar with Dragon Quest (Dragon Warrior in the U.S.) will recognize many aspects of the game such as confessing your sins (saving), collecting mini medals, and much more. You will also recognize a lot of the monsters from other Dragon Quest titles.New to this title is the stunning 3d world brought to life by an amazing cel-shading graphics engine. The characters were designed by Akira Toiyama, the creator of Dragon Ball.I have spent well over 50 hours playing and I have yet to get bored.

I finished this one just to see how much worse it could get. Everyone has different taste in reading, and I know \\"Romance Novels\\" are probably the most popular. I just don't get it unless the women readers want their sexual fantasies fulfilled. Yuk. I actually think the plot would have made a good book in the right hands. This one kept me sayiing, \\"Are they serious?\\" Wacko characters, and the near immediate turn around of the troubled daughter.

It is a nice, heavy weight, with beautiful color variations and the end grain pattern. BUT...I've only had it for three weeks, and it is already splitting! I replaced a straight grain board with this one because end grain isn't supposed to split. Well, it does.I guess if you wanted to leave it on a shelf or otherwise use it as decoration, this board would be fine. If, however, you actually CUT on your cutting board, avoid this one.

Susan's voice can be anything she wants it to be and in the time of her work with Steven, it became anything Stephin wanted it to be. Stephin knew that Susan's range is incredible and that she has amazing adaptability, to be pouty, loud, soft, boyish, melencholy, or any of a wide and varied genre that was needed for the particualr track and he used her voice as an instrument. When Susan sounds a particular way, it is because Stephin wanted her to sound that way, period. Susan's voice was purposefully muted in some of the tracks, by Stephin to accomplish the sound he was looking for. Tar Heel Boy is one of Susan's favorite tracks, because she was allowed to belt it out. When Susan is allowed creative freedom, the results are amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely voice doing a great songwriters songs justice.","review":"Magnetic Fields is essentially Stephin Merritt and whoever he chooses to play with him. This cd is a combination of two cd's from 89 and 91. Both feature the gifted vocalist Susan Anway. These songs are short and bittersweet, combining cello, piano, oboe, and other effects yielding a beautiful noise. Most of the songs are sad and somewhat sparse, but very beautiful. I prefer the first half of this cd (The Wayward Bus). My favorite cuts are \\"The Saddest Story Ever Told\\", \\"Jeremy\\", \\"Dancing in your Eyes\\", \\"You Love To Fail\\", and \\"100,000 Fireflies\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peanut Butter and Chocolate","review":"I absolutely love this album. Stephin Merrit's music and lyrics are to Susan Anways vocals what peanut butter is to chocolate. The first half of this album is flawless, and while the second half verges on the more experimental side there are still some standouts like \\"Love to Fail\\", and the since covered by Superchunk, \\"100,000 Fireflies\\". While others might recommend starting with a more traditional album by the Magnetic Fields (one on which Stephin sings) I think this one if particular makes a great addition to any music collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"The original band","review":"The first two Magnetic Fields albums featured singer Susan Anway, who possesses a beautiful, haunting voice that gives Stephin Merritt's very pointed lyrics a softer touch. There are many outstanding tracks, and they're very fresh. If you're a fan of Merritt's singing, you may not like these albums, but if you're like me and appreciate Merritt's songwriting brilliance but find his assumption of lead vocal duties a mistake, this is the best of both worlds: excellent songs performed by a talented singer.I know many people love Merritt's vocals and I don't mean to offend those people. It's all a matter of taste, and while I love his songwriting I don't care for his voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"a joy","review":"I had watched Hearts Adrift when I was a teenager and have been looking for the movie ever since.

I had just finished a postgraduate degree in English and found myself drawn into the story at a rapid rate. Three academics become convinced that they have discovered a once-every-120-years meeting of seemingly every secret society, occult sect, and cabal. As they combine a thousand threads of evidence, their efforts begin to mimic the goal of the occultists they are following: to become aware of the unknown, to be a member of the inner circle, to know the great secret. As I was about to enter a life in academia myself, I found this idea more than a little disturbing. While this is not a book for those who like straightforward mysteries with clear solutions, the book is stronger because it does not placate its readers with easy answers. Although it toys with the idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"reader from Israel","review":"I wish I could give this book a stronger review then 2 stars but that is already being generous. Mr. Eco really drew me in with the ' Name of the Rose' and I expected more of the same with this title . Such was not the case. Being a Hebrew speaker and novice cabalist I thought I had a better chance of grasping this work then most others.... perhaps slightly but the overall read was laborious and painful. To say I did not get would be accurate.

However, if you are willing to not understand every last historical and occult reference, this book is absolutely fascinating. I fell completely into Eco's trap. I tried to follow his descriptions of the occult, puzzling out what it could all mean. I was intrigued by hints at \\"the Plan\\" and attempted to figure out just what this plan could be. Upon reaching the end of the novel, I felt like I had been duped, but brilliantly so. There is no plan, it is all fiction, yet I, just like characters such as Aglie and Bramanti, had fallen into the trap of believing. Eco truly got the last laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"thought-provoking read","review":"Foucault's Pendulum, by the author of The Rame of the Rose, is a wonderul read.

A great read, even better than The Name of the Rose, let's just hope if they make this one a movie, they don't turn it into a real stinker with Sean Connery running after Aristotle's lost works in big dark libraries, because I do not know if I could live through that again.Also recommended: Toilet: The Novel by Michael Szymczyk (A book for any fan of Existentialism, Post-Modernism, Kafka and American Literature)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A magnificent, inclusive journey","review":"I won't pretend this book wasn't a hard slog. It was. It's long, dense and uses words I didn't know existed (and frequently, words that aren't English). But all this is necessary to create the thick, rich tapestry Eco weaves for us. With consummate style, we are taken on a journey of knowledge, culture, religion and philosophy that I, for one, experienced right alongside the book's characters. This book might not change your life, but it certainly changed the way I look at it. It's all what you make of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomprehensible","review":"I thought I was dumb when I read over three fourths of this gobbledygook and didn't understand more than a line.

What a relief - the author of the booker of bookers said not a sentence...So here I am pride salvaged - and writing this review.Piece of advice for anyone considering picking this up - unless you have a Ph.D in theology AND a masters degree in occult faiths, you may not appreciate this book.Sandeep"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely unbearable.","review":"Absolutely unbearable.

(Though by the time you get to the end you're just glad to be there).One of my (too many) hobbies is esoterica. So a book like this should have been a treat. I can follow more of the arcane references than the average reader, I reckon.But the book is all intellect and no imagination or soul. The plot is not interesting or believable. Nor are the characters. The characters don't even care about each other. (At the end, the narrator's best friend is hung by a group of theosophists and the narrator doesn't intervene or get upset but simly engages in abstract speculation.)Read it for the few chapters on the history of the templars, and for the overview of esoterica. But not for the plot, or the theme, or the characters, or for any other reason you normally read a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Foucault's P","review":"This book holds much promise to the reader: a good mystery, lots of arcane knowledge, recognizable real-life cults. Unfortunately,it's the sort of book only professional critics love. I found it interesting in idea, but cumbersome to read. It has moments of brilliance,but all too often resorts to long lists of names which the reader, presumedly, is supposed to recognize. To my mind, a novel shouldnot be this much work to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain boring; author's cleverness kills the story . .","review":"The book is filled with irrelevant information.

Reading it became more like a chore than an enjoyment so I gave up.The book is full of obscure historical references, people, events and places. And to understand the significance of these events one would have to be an expert on the last one thousand years of European history. The language was too complicated and academic, and the book was about 200 pages too long. Just when I thought an ineteresting scene was developing, the main character goes off to Brazil, and wastes a couple of dozen pages undergoing some cultural experience, whose meaning was lost to me.I'm not saying this is a bad book, because I could see that for someone who can follow it and understand it they could get a lot out of it, but be warned potential readers THIS IS ONE TOUGH READ, if you feel up to it get the book, if you have your doubts don't waste the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just re-iterating comments made below...","review":"...that the book, regardless of how satisfying you might find the effort to read it or the diversity of information it contains, is dragged down by the pomposity of authorial tone and the sheer cultter of intellectual tidbits and arcane facts. Eco seems to be simply puffing out what could have been a tighter and more absorbing story in order to impress us with his intellectualism. Kind of like how Ayn Rand let her stories bend under the weight of her proselytising. OK, you're a smart guy, Mr. Eco; now write a *good* book.

Every aspect of this book is horrible. Eco drones on way too long in minute details that seem to be there only because they were in his research notes. There are pages of unreadable material, paragraphs they consist of lists of useless items. The characters are 1 dimensional at best and the plot, as it finally unfolds it unremarkable and ridiculous.Imagine a very brainy history or philosophy professor pouring out whatever popped into his head for hundreds of pages and then a publisher putting it out verbatim without bothering to have an editor take a look at it. If they had done that to this book it would have been a semi-interesting, but unentralling short story.Run away from this book.If it's a status symbol to be reading this book, or more impossibly to complete it, then I want nothing to do with the peer group that finds such a tortuous endeavor admirable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with Foucault's Pendulum","review":"Foucault's Pendulum had an exciting beginning but then piffled out as it became repetitious and seemed to have lost the thread."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the journey","review":"I will admit that it took me 2 years, an Oxford Dictionary, and an internet connection to read this book. I picked it up the first time and put it down after the first chapter. The second time, I made it halfway through. It was on the third try that it captured me and I couldn't put it down (except to grab my dictionary and highlighter).I can attest that the theme is worth the read, although the theme is almost ironic in lieu of what it takes to read the novel. After finishing the novel, I bought the intellectual must-read The Name of the Rose. In two short years, I will write a review of that book as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"an observation about these reviewers","review":"I tried to read this book several times once it came out in paperpack. I could never seem to get past 25 or so pages.After reading a wide selection of reviews in here I find it encouraging that there are still people around who will admit that, even after struggling though an excruciating book of this size and style, they still have enough humanity to admit that it wasn't worth it for them and might not be for many others either."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think the Pendulum needs another push.","review":"Sadly, this is a book that fails to live up to its enormous potential. I picked it up thinking I would get pleasure out this book billed as the \\"thinking man's Da Vinci Code.\\" However, the extremely dense prose makes it largely unaccessible to anyone who doesn't have Eco's academic credentials. Obviously, Eco intended the conspiracy \\"Plan\\" to be confusing to most people, but my God, 400 pages of confusion is a bit much. The ending had the potential to reconcile everything, but sadly the climax left me wanting. I won't reveal anything, but he used one of the worst story-telling techniques out there. <Sigh>In a great twist of irony, Eco's central thesis--that intellectual superiority makes one a fool--backfires as his overly dense novel makes a fool of him, and me for reading 640 pages of confusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Italian James Fennemore Cooper","review":"This book was a total waste of time. It reads like something that would have been written by James Fennemore Cooper. That is to say it takes a bulldozer to plow through it. Like another reviewer, the best part was finishing it. I thought it would get better as I went along, but I was wrong. It was difficult to absorb anything from it. The only reason I completed it was to say I finished it. Even at page 500 or 642 I thought of giving up. Possibly the worst book I've ever read. I will never read anything by Eco again, even though I enjoyed The Name of the Rose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the reviews before you buy....","review":"I read The Name of the Rose many years ago and when I was looking for something to read and saw Foucault's Pendulum I thought why not. After slogging through it for several days and not really enjoying it I decided to check the reviews. It seems people either love or hate this book. It's wordy, tedious and if there is a plot in there somewhere it's hiding really well. It is rare for me to start a book and not finish it, even if I don't like it. However, as read primarily for pleasure and as I get older I see that's a rather foolish approach to reading. So, I'm putting Foucault's Pendulum away, even though I've read 66% of it. If you're thinking about this book read the reviews and the samples before making a purchase. Or better yet, get it at the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skip The Da Vinci Code, please.","review":"Dan Brown should be bludgeoned about the head and neck area for writing The Da Vinci Code without acknowledging that he essentially stole and dumbed down the plot of Eco's earlier, brainier mystery. FC is a world-spanning thriller packed with all of the elements that made Brown's book alluring (secret societies, cryptic religious symbolism, grand conspiracies, etc.). The twisting, turning thread of the plot is enough reason to keep reading, but what makes the book shine are all of Eco's philosophical, historical, and mythological/religious asides, crammed with detail. The kind of book where you sense the author checking and rechecking every line to make sure it's ... just the way he wants it."},{"rating":"1","title":"the literary equivalent of \\"the emperor's new clothes\\"","review":"This is a dreadfully pretentious book with utterly flat and lifeless characters and puerile plot devices and coincidences. It's trumped up with a lot of ridiculous philosophy but, in the end, it completely collapses on its own pretentiousness. Anyone who says this is a \\"great book\\" is a fool and doesn't realize Eco has played a joke on him or her. It's just a shame you have to drag through this tedious 120-chapter tome to find out the mystery is that there is no mystery and the trick is that you've been tricked into reading hundreds of pages filled with thousands of ridiculous red herrings. To top it off, the English translation is weak and frequently downright awkward."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Soporific","review":"After reading a mass of raves about Humberto Eco's \\"Foucalt's Pendulum,\\" I bought the book, and now am more convinced than ever that many tomes are purchased because leaving them on one's coffee table for visitors to see indicates the host is a with-it intellectual.I found the book nearly illegible, and a hard read, which I forged through, only to find no real pay off. Perhaps it''s the translation, but in spite of the sporadic kitschy references and smart... humor, I found the result unfunny, uninteresting, and a total waste of time.David Kramer"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgettable","review":"Let me start by saying that the first 7 or so pages are difficult to get through. After that it is pure magic! I, too, was challenged to read this book by a co-worker who said he'd found very few people who had finished it. Well, of course, I couldn't turn down that sort of challenge. What I couldnt' have predicted was how much I would enjoy it. Yes, Eco is full of himself at times, and yes, I did have my dictionary next to me (which by the way I have about 20 words that I've never been able to find in ANY dictionary) but, you have to admire the genius at work, here. Plus, it was just an enthralling subject matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perceptual Reconstruction","review":"I read Foucault's Pendulum in 1991 and have never looked at the world in the same way since. Eco weaves a tale in and around the possibility of a Templar/Masonic Plot while exploring the nature of man, religion, computers, pinball, the Universe. As you read on you are introduced to the idea that things not usually related may have connections of grand significance. Whether you buy into the Plot or not, forever more you will find yourself searching for connections between everything you encounter. You try to link your dog to your phone, your toothbrush with your mom's geraniums, on into infinity. You will see the Mason's everywhere ruling everything, or so will suddenly be your perception. Try it; it's fun. Enjoy the first slightly slow 100 pages for their exquisite imagery and eloquence, then prepare yourself for the mental, verbal and perceptual rollercoaster which is the rest of this marvelous tome"},{"rating":"1","title":"Foucault's Pendulum: Swallowing the whole Christmas pudding","review":"The thing about this book is in the beginning it does attract the reader to the subject but then Eco treats the same thing over and over again. We know Signor Eco is a brilliant and academic homme but he fails to realise that the verbosity in his novel by showing off all the occults he knows renders his book to be rather plotless. In that sense the book loses life. It is eating the whole Christmas cake. Signor Eco overdosed, as if drugged by his brilliance. Academic readers will find this rather disappointing in that sense. Interesting but disappointing in the ultimate sense. This will be intriguing for younger readers as they can look up the net and search for the place names and histories he mentions but little in plot enhancement. Eco forced us to eat the whole Christmas pudding rather than living room for other desserts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pompous Trash","review":"Eco obviously did some research for this book.

From the beginning I have been impressed with the translator. He or she has an incredible grasp of the English language, and I hope the grasp of Italian is just as incredible. He/she has an amazing skill for taking a word or idea in Italian and translating it into an obscure English word that will be understood by few English speakers. Thus a book that is slow paced and unintriguing is given yet another obstacle.It is possible that the book does have an incredible ending. I'll never know.

I found quite a bit about Umberto Eco and decided to look into what has written. I found many reviews on how hard a read his work is and decided I needed a mind bender. So.....without delay, I started into Foucault's Pendulum. Every chapter is different than the previous, I know, duh, but it is so different I found myself paging back through previous chapters to try to find where we were going. I finally hit Chapter seven and had no idea what the book was about and quit. It was going nowhere. One out of the first seven chapters even referenced the Pendulum, one chapter only referenced the writing of a book. And the rest bounced back and forth about the life of someone and a word processor. If you want a HARD read, this is it! So hard, there is no plot, no joining story lines, nothing. I am aware I only read to seven but I could not drag through a supposed story when I could not find one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizarre","review":"This is one of extremely few books (less than 10 in my life, and I am an avid reader) I have EVER stopped reading and did not finish. I purchased because it was a bestseller and appeared to have an interesting topic. I read over 1/3 of this book. There was very little conversation, which I could have lived with, but the author was extremely focused on applying sexual attributes to pretty much every single item he mentioned. I found that not only annoying but disgusted that the editor didn't have him change at least 90% of the totally unnecessary sexual references. They added NOTHING to the story. As a puzzler it was merely ok. Perhaps the unnecessary sexual references raised it to bestseller level, but I wouldn't give it shelf space."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I purchased this book based on the large number of positive reviews. Several reviewers even compared it to The Da Vinci Code, which I loved. This book made me feel like I was in a graduate Greek philosophy class again, reading Aristotle or Plato.

If you want to read this book to challenge yourself (or any other reason for that matter), save yourself and bash your head against a brick wall for an hour or two. Doing so will save yourself a few hours and probably save you significant anguish over the long run.Eco's writing style is not terribly bad, but he needs to put away his dictionary. Using obscure verbiage just to wow the reader or make the book more \\"intellectual\\".... not necessary. The story is awful. The story really can be told in 100 pages, the remainder is absolutely worthless filler.

Umberto Eco deliberately weaves a tangled web because that is just how those things are. Read a few occult books and you will understand just how those people think. It is about what can happen when you involve yourself with the right (wrong?) set of easily suggestable people.The references within this book are very difficult to understand--but if you can handle \\"reading it for the plot and meaning,\\" I think it is still worth the read.Now, if you just have to understand every reference, you will need to get more versed in the occult. That may not be in your best interests.M"},{"rating":"2","title":"Complications in language are the basis of mystery","review":"Beyond being an enthralling mystery, Foucault's Pendulum also explores the variations in language and meaning. We have three editors who create a dazzling tale; a tale that stretches though thousands of years of history, full of mystery magic and intrigue. But in reality, the whole thing was based on an random interpretation of events, picked to be clever and by computer, not based necessarily on truth. I think that Eco is seeking to shed light on the notion that we find mysteries all over this world, because mystery satisfies our sense of wonder. Language is mysterious because it is intricate. A single cryptic page can be a shopping list or review of a world wide masterplan.Eco's book is fabulous for its intricacy and its ability to drag the reader down the same path as the editors, a path where the lines between fact and fiction blur."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pompous and inflated masturbatory exercise","review":"After reading and enjoying the Name of the Rose, I figured Eco's follow-up would be comparable. However, I found this book a big waste of my time. It is easily the most self-indulging book I've read. To those who would insinuate you need a vast education to appreciate the work, I would beg to differ. I am myself not exactly a stranger to issues of epistemology and pseudoscientific diatribes, and still I found this book PAINFUL to read! And I did read it all, BTW.It's egregiously abysmal!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Turgid","review":"I was disappointed in reading this highly touted work. I expected more than the rambling plotless work I encountered. I may have melodramatic tastes, but I found this novel to have too little forward momentum, and too many eddies and backwaters of trivial arcanae.And these backwaters are not exactly limpid pools, but often just stagnant water. There is an interesting premise-a group of people at a publishers act as \\"agents provocateurs\\" in order to bring occult groups out of the woodwork. They succeed to some extent, but what they uncover was hardly worth the trouble. A more interesting idea might have been to have them bring to light something truly diabolical (we're talking fiction, right?).I would rank this on a par with \\"The Da Vinci Code\\"-but for quite other reasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This book worked like a time bomb for me. First couple of pages it was challenging to keep the focused, but the Kabbalistic titles were too alluring to give it up.

Once I reached the end, I realized that I did not really get it all.

Thank you Umberto! the book is genius. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I can add little to the other wonderful reviews","review":"Okay, this WAS a hard book to read. So much going on and so many references to cults and phenomina. Reading this book is more of an education than an entertainment. But what fun! Eco is a true literary genius, in the same class as his italian brethren of musical fame.Baudolino is perhaps his most engaging, with rushdie-esque fableture, but the pendulum is penultimate. Facing a pendulum, nose to mass, may seem a silly simulacrum of the story, yet it engages you to the characters' experiences. And the seeding of an idea directed from any random seed idea as from Albulafia, well it works better than one could ever expect.The pendulum, make no mistake, seeded many a templar festooned modern tale.Ecco Eco!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been far better","review":"The plot of this book is quite compelling, and looking back it really is a book that leaves you with the impression of being intellectually substantial.The problem is that it is cripled by the authors preference for including all sorts of irrelevant details, and to be honest, at times it reads like he is just rambling on.But if that doesn't bother you, then go ahead an read it. Otherwise, read some authors who understand the beauty and power of simplicity (e.g. Hemmingway, Kawabata, Blixen), because Eco, if he does, is not displaying it in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantasy and technology together","review":"I must admit that this novel is not so fascinating and capturing as _The name of the rose_. But maybe it is even more original.Prof. Eco goes on in his research about nystery, lore and magic....but in this case a new event has happened. Eco entered the Multimedia world. This book includes at least four different themes: the detective story, the love affair, the gossip about the Academic complicated world and the sarcastic description of the publishing industry. And besides, a great protagonist...the computer.This is a great discovery, but maybe it's a limit as well.In this book, Eco's narrative style often sonds desultory, abrupt. But Eco likes risk, and _The Pendulum_ is a challenge.No wonder if so many Italian writers have imitated his example in teh latest twenty years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucker Punch of a Book","review":"I read this ages ago but just came across it again and was deluged by negative memories of the the book. I found part of the history and the story to be truly engaging. That engagement helps the reader get through much of the filler, which is a slog to read through.

Not so here.... if you decide to read this ridiculous tome, do so without expectations that the resolution at the end will lead to any significant insight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"I understand the history of this novel, and trudged through all gazillion pages hoping that at some point the Eco would pull me in; unfortunately, he didn't. Yes, you can perceive his spewing of words as a challenge to what you normally think about his world, or you may read it as just ramblings to get paid by the page. I can't come close to recommending this, even though I know many of my friends enjoyed it. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one is a head Trip and a Half","review":"This book blow the hinges off the door. Any fan of the X-flies, Twilight Zone, will greatly appreciate this book. As a matter of fact Casubon has the narrative styling of a Fox Mulder, actually it should be vice versa since this was written in 1988. It's really interesting to see how three very intelligent men got caught up in an search for truth that ultimately became a deadly game of cat and mouse. The quotes from the various mysteries are poignant and insightful in relation to the unfolding story. I would have given this work five stars, but I felt the ending was a bit of a cop out; considering the many allusions to the the realness of metaphysical forces throughout the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Verbosity to the Nth Degree","review":"Umberto Eco has obviously never met a word he didn't like. If an idea could be expressed in 20 words, he used 200. Unfortunately, I wasted the time to read it through twice and was no more impressed the second time. I'm not stupid, I understood the plot, I didn't need a dictionary or thesaurus, and I was absolutely bored out of my mind. He probably wrote this book in the same manner in which Jacopo Belbo wrote his Plan, by entering it into the word processor without ever looking back. If you enjoy having a thousand ridiculous conspiracy theories thrown against a wall in a hopeless mishmash, then this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's be Honest!","review":"Just because a book is interlaced with a vast bank of intellectual data does NOT necessarily qualify it as a great read. To compare this book with Ulysses and War & Peace is a crime; those books were exceptionally well written. I personally believe that many readers praise this book simply to qualify themselves as \`advanced' intellectuals. Big deal! I have read the book and found it endowed with much knowledge but that did not make it a good read. Look at the other reviews and you'll find one reoccurring theme, \\"Patchy\\", \\"Choppy\\" etc..; I could not agree more. Let's face it people the Oxford English Dictionary is a complex, intellectually challenging publication, that does not mean I want to read it from cover to cover. If it's bragging rights you're looking for then read \\"Foucault's Pendulum.\\" If its fine, eloquent writing you seek, save yourself the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ending is the Point","review":"To all the reviews that say Eco's novel runs out of gas, etc., I say, that is where the real power of the novel hits you: the ending IS the point. After moving through all the multi-layered, referential, hermeneutic labyrinths searching for meaning, it turns out that the real truth is found in the taste of a peach and the lovliness of the hillside. The fact that They are on their way to kill the peach-eater as he sits calmly taking in beauty outside his window makes it all the more powerful."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, Mr Eco, you stumped me","review":"I bought this book because it sounded like an interesting challenge and a great story. I love historical fiction and the mixture of history, religion and computers sounded great. The problem is that Eco got lost in arcane inuendo and analogies that I'm certain he knew the great majority of his readers would have no clue how to interpret. Whole sentences in multiple languages and names made me laugh out loud at how impossible this book can be. I found myself skimming through sections of minutiae just to get back to the story.I gave it 2 stars for the storyline and Eco's impressive writing ability. But, unfortunately, the story gets lost in Eco's attempt to show his readers either how smart he is or that he has the Encyclopedia Brittanica open in front of him while he writes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eco is very pleased with himself!","review":"This is a fine 100-page novel. Unfortunately, it's trapped within the pages of a 500-page tome."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Trying Read","review":"Eco's obvious genius wore thin on this reader. I finished the book--but only because I refused to be beaten by its heavy-handed approach to miscellany. Hard to believe it's an international best seller!"},{"rating":"1","title":"huh???","review":"I think you have to be either an historian or a self absorbed pseudo-intellectual to fully enjoy this novel. I almost never fail to complete a novel once I start, but this was so painful to read and absorb that I just had to put it down. That being said, I have to admit that now I feel challenged, and will probably give this book a second chance someday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I originally bought this book because I so thoroughly enjoyed The Name Of The Rose. I was expecting this book to be as good. As I began to read it, I became concerned about the connection the author was making between the Sefirot and the black arts/demon worship. However, the further I got into the book, the more bored I became until I could no longer concentrate. This book is not at all comparable to The Name Of The Rose, either in content or skill."},{"rating":"1","title":"A chapter, or twenty, too far","review":"I'm sorry but I cant agree with the majority of your reviewers. I found this book too long and without direction. Like his other \\"grand opus\\" \\"The Name of the Rose\\" it suffers from an over proliferation of detail and in the final analysis is just downright boring. The conclusion seems to have been plucked from thin air and cannot possibly be taken seriously. After the middle 300 pages of waffle I suppose the author was desperate for a climactic ending. (It didn't work!). Don't give up the day job Umberto."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why all the hype?","review":"I can't for the life of me, see why people get so starry-eyed about this book. It started out interesting but then degenerated into a meandering morass of pretentious prose. After 240 pages, I completely lost interest. I gave it two stars because the guy clearly can write; it just doesn't seem like he has much to actually say. I realize that I'm supposed to think this is brilliant but this seems like little more than pseudo-intellectual masturbation...Yawn.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frequent errors in Kindle edition","review":"This review is for the Kindle edition.I loved reading this book the first time and when I got a kindle I thought it would be a great book to inaugurate my new e-reader. Unfortunately, it seems that whoever scanned in the book never proof-read the result. While it is readable, I'm sure any publisher (even Manutius, hah!) would be scandalized publishing a book with so many typos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't good 15 years ago, and hasn't aged gracefully","review":"Eco would surely make a poor poker player--the poor guy can't hide his emotions and feelings, especially as it relates to alternative interpretations of Religion. As this book plods along, the reader gets a really good sense that Eco has some unbridled disgust for anti-establishment. Well, it shows, as by the end of the book, he is literally mocking these anti-establishment folks.I was hoping to not have to sift through Eco's pretentious word choices and sentence structure. Thankfully I did not. Instead, I was visited with \\"name drop blitzkreig\\". In other words, Eco just threw one name, group, ancient location, etc. after another. Was it to impress? I have no idea, but most of it didn't move the plot forward.Eco at least had a good subject matter for his plot, I can give him that much. The way to get to the conclusion, however, was muddled with a lot of nonesense and unnecessary verbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cure for insomnia","review":"This boring, over-long waste of paper is either Eco having a big joke, or he was drunk. I was unable to finish it. I only reached page 55, but by then there should have been the beginnings of an interesting plot, and the development of some interesting characters. This mish-mash has neither, and nothing in those first few dozen pages indicates that it ever will. This is the written equivalent of modern art--ugly, pretentious, meaningless, over-hyped, fawned-over by shallow sophisticates."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a hotchpotch of obscure texts","review":"Umberto Ecco presents a mystery thriller which his publishing house describes as \\"endlessly diverting\\".Well, it is - and even more.Agreeing with the statement of one of the protagonist on page 433:>Stop, enough is enough, I'm sick<Mr. Ecco does his best in dragging along all kind of stories about Templars, Rosicrusians, Jesuits, Cathars, Renaissance philosophers, the Grail, the Nazis and all kind of Diabolicals.The story itself would be an interesting plot: Three editors invent a story to disguise the well kept secret of a mystery society. And tough luck: there are people out there who not only believe the plot but are moreover convinced that they have been part of it for ages and are ready to murder for it.Unfortunately Mr. Ecco gets caught in the swirl of his own ideas and delusions and makes it for the reader very difficult to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"'the book to read' not long ago","review":"This is an intellectual 'davinci code' type book, historical religious fiction, very pretentious, not as readable.Some suggest Eco intentionally made his books boring at the start, to discourage thosee not intellectually ardent enough to plow forward. Ok maybe, but what about the middle and end of this one?Read The Name of the Rose before even thinking about this.Foucault is less accessible and less interesting than Name of the Rose- a classic, but 10 times the complication if that doesnt seal the deal for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh, please let it end","review":"I felt like I was reading this book for a class test rather than for pleasure. I found myself lost in the details, and wondering...what is the point?!? The concept of the book was fascinating, which drew me to pick it up, but the execution was oh, so boring. I can't give this book a completely negative rating. When Umberto Eco wrote somewhat normally -- with a plot and characters, for instance, rather than page after page of mind numbing, pointless details -- I actually enjoyed the book and storyline. Although I found his references to \\"the Thing\\" revolting. I'm offended when people refer to a baby as \\"it\\"...but the Thing is revolting. It turned me against the protagonist...was that Eco's purpose? Can anyone recommend another of his books? I enjoyed the Name of the Rose but was put off by this endeavor (or is that not obvious?)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suggested Pairing - Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds","review":"This book is a miracle; I loved it. Most of my thoughts about it are stated in other reviews - you can see how many different meanings readers have taken from it; I believe that this is intentional based on author's comments.Anyway, I had the happy accident of reading Charles MacKay's \\"Extraodinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds\\" right after this book, totally at random (I had owned it for years w/o opening it). I wish I had read it before Foucault's Pendulum. It has about 200 pages on \\"Alchymists\\" (I thought that it was only about financial panics), where he describes the stories and backgrounds of the many figures referenced in this book (Rosicrucians, Count Saint Germain, Cagliostro, etc.). It's written in 19th century English, but if you get absorbed in the subject matter, and don't want to read dozens of books on obscure medieval topics, then this is a great pairing. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I give up","review":"I made it through about 450 pages of this thing until I realized that having only one life to live, and having a limited amount of reading time available in that alloted life span, I didn't want to waste anymore of it on this book which, as far as I can tell, never goes anywhere. It consists of incessant litanies of apparent connections between historical events, people, secret societies, etc. which, after hundreds of pages, left me (a) not caring, and (b) finally deciding that this pathological list-making was going nowhere and taking forever to get there. This book is an immense waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cacophony of Ideas","review":"I was very dissastisfied after reading this book. With so much conjecture, tension, and intrigue, I expected a more interesting conclusion. As a matter of fact, I knew exactly how it was going to end, and prayed throughout the last third of the book that I would be wrong. Only recommened if you are a serious history nut and would enjoy readng endless speculation about the movements and trials of an unverifiable, if not imaginary, group of people who control some vague tool powerful enough to .... what, exactly?Perhaps UE meant to elicit the frustration of his homeland's bureaucracy. A country which I am infinitely fond of, for the record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Detail","review":"There is too much packed into this book for my taste. I worked to keep track of the thread of this mystery through esoteric detail of physics, religion, history and legend but in the end, I found that it took too long for me to discover what pertinence all this information was going to have to the tale. In fact, too many facts. Sad, because I love all of this type of background to a good mystery, but there was something self-indulgent about the amount of time spent dwelling on every little thing. Of course, as we all know, my opinion is unimportant considering the terrific success the book celebrated. Still, its successor in form, The DaVinci Code while packed with minutia, was much more user-friendly."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was that all about?","review":"Sorry. I have two university degrees and, after reading Foucault's Pendulum, I cannot tell you what this book is about. I read it from cover to cover, but just could not pick up the thread - that simple! I hope that \\"Name of the Rose\\" will be easier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hook, Line and Sinker","review":"Like others, I read this book based on the how much I enjoyed Eco's \\"The Name of the Rose\\". Page after page I slogged through, holding out hope that Eco was somehow going to redeem this little piece of quicksand. Only to realize that sometimes, even a great writer, will just let you sink."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the effort","review":"If you enjoy slogging through pedantic trivia, this is the book for you. Every time I thought I was (finally!!) geting into the story, we would go off on another 75 pages or so of uninteresting drivel. I quit after 400 pages because life is just too short to waste on a book like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many side tracks","review":"I read this book several years ago. This was an awful book; not on a conceptual basis, but on a \\"let me try and explain it to you in 25 words or less\\". Where was the editor? Certainly you could not stand in front of a classroom and try and explain it the way the author does or, as the translator. My advice is just skip it. There are many other books out there that delve into the same type of secret society schtick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somebody take away this man's library card","review":"A pedantic mudbath of fiction, fact and distorted truths so densely packed that spearating each of these would take months of research.But that is the least of the problems with this book, the story doesn't really begin until page 142. For the first 141 pages you will be assaulted by lecture after lecture after lecture of Umbault recanting history and describing ancient religous rites.After that, stodgy dialog, predictable plodding and no sex.The awful teaching he gives us is drearily accomplished for example when one character asks the other 'well tell us about the Templars' and then you get 5 or 6 pages of Templar history. Very little is revealed in the way of conflict, information is thrown at you like a piss pot from a window, exposition ad urineum.To be fair, 3 or 4 more rewrites and I think this might be a good 260 page read, right now it works well as a door stop for my study bringing in a nice cool breeze from the Adriatic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Able To Finish","review":"For those of you who will tell me not to review a book if I have not finished it, I disagree. Just like a bad movie, where one leaves half way through a movie, a book not enjoyed can be stopped and reviewed. I read about 300 pages of this book and only felt confused and lost. It was disjointed, rambling and without focus. There were occasional interesting scenes and sections, but I never developed a passion for the book, its subject, or any of the characters. I think he should have written two books, one novel and another on the history of cults. I enjoyed his The Name of The Rose and I am also looking forward to reading Prague Cemetery, but this one, I would skip."},{"rating":"2","title":"What the heck is the joke about ABULAFIA, anyway?","review":"Umberto Eco struck paydirt in America with the publication and subsequent filming of \\"The Name of the Rose\\", but \\"Pendulum will do little, I'm afraid, to enhance his reputation here. \\"Pendulum\\" is much too dense, much too intellectual for the average American reader. \\"Pendulum\\" is a brilliant story -- the last 100 pages terrified me, and snapped me out of the doldrums he had created the previous 250 pages. Now, go out and get \\"The Island of the Day Before\\" for a serious shipwreck story"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant! One of my all time favorites","review":"Although this book can be a bit imposing at times it is well worth the read. The story is ingrosing and extrodinaroly complex. Its a thought provoker and a parody. This is not a book for those with short attention spans or for those who dont enjoy puzzles. It takes quite a while to get to the payoff when he brings the story full circle but if you can get that far you wont put the book down again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow moving and tedious","review":"Although I was impressed by the author's intellect and encyclopedic knowledge of diverse topics, the characters and narrative were less than engrossing. The storyline progressed at a snail's pace as I kept waiting for an interesting plotline to develop. Although I learned more than I ever wanted to know about the Knights Templar, I find most history text books more engrossing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious and extremely boring","review":"The main purpose of this book is to promote the author's phylosophical ideas. He tries to show his erudition. But his Hebrew is poor (I live in Israel) and in one case he makes a mistake with numbers. What remains? The idea that the a conspiracy theory may be self-fulfilling? Endless attempts to find a sense in a random series of historical events? The author's desire to get Nobel Prize?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do yourself a big favor...","review":"This book will be a genuine waste of time for a reader that is well educated, it is insulting to our intellegence that works of this nature are published. Simple gramatical errors are acceptable for a high school book report... not a piece of literature. The concept seemed interesting enough, to pick it up. I feel that it is my civic duty to inform you, the reader, that this is a read you can pass up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother II","review":"Excited about the topic, I bought the H.C. By chapter 2, I was frustrated by the author's juvenile wording and repetitive style, thin characterization, formulaic storyline and lack of knowledge about certain issues (illustrated by over-use of cliche in characterization.) While the author does know his trademarks and technology, usage was overwhelming. The story was mostly \\"tell\\" with some \\"show\\" -- there was no attempt to build depth. Don't keep \\"telling\\" us that Matsubara had so much at stake, and Matsubara achieved such and such. Show it, and make us believe it. And yes, there were many editorial errors - from grammatical & spelling to run-ons in most paragraphs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't I give it more than 5 stars?","review":"I took a chance on this CD awhile back, and it has quickly become one of my favorites.

The lap function on the stop watch works as you would expect.The user interface is poor, changing the time turns the alarm on. There is no indication the hourly chime is on, and to turn it of you push lap/reset and mode together. Easy if you know it hard, if you don't.The durability is poor. I left one stop watch in my car in the parking lot for a day. The sticker describing the functions peeled off. Worse, the LCD is now only partly visible, and the parts that are visible change. Three days later it is still unusable. To be fair, I left it in the sun on a 75 degree day, but it's disappoint that I am already down one stop watch.If you want a really cheap stop watch, this will work, but don't expect it to last and don't leave it out in the sun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just ok","review":"I was just looking for a really basic stop watch, but this has an alarm option and a couple of other things.

Not only is it intriguing and informative, but it gives you real insight to the man himself and where his inspiration comes from.

I like that it is not a beginner's DVD, although beginners should not hesitate to get it. I like that it is not a yoga DVD. I don't need a warm up on every single DVD I own! Even a beginner should know to warm up before beginning. We don't need all that DVD time wasted with warm up (warm up is not a waste of time, but, again, not needed on every DVD). Ruby teaches a fun Turkish choreography in easy to follow sections, then teaches you zills to go along with it. You learn the zills seated first, but there is an inset frame to watch her dance at the same time, so you see where the zills are interacting with the dance. This is useful. In addition there is a tutorial on Turkish Rom dance and how to count 9/8 as a dancer.Turkish is considered more open and boisterous than the other forms, so get ready to add some kick to your dancing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Turkish is worth your investment","review":"Totally Turkish is definitely not a DVD for the beginner belly dancer. Although the choreography is not super intricate, the steps, turns and moves require a solid basic belly dance knowledge. Ruby is a delight, her movements are clean, energetic and fun. I love the setup with Ruby dancing to a mirror so that you can see the steps both from front and back. I'm also very pleased with the camera work. None of the \\"lets focus on the butt or boobs while she shimmies\\" nonsense. You can see Ruby full length at all times which makes it easier to study the foot work. I like the added instruction for zills, though I have to agree with another reviewer that I would have liked to seen that part broken down more.The DVD itself is easy to navigate and breaks down into section so you can skip and/or backtrack as you see fit. All in all this is worth your time and cash if you want to learn more about Turkish steps/movements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD","review":"Ruby is an excellent dancer and instructor.

These are \\"street\\" learned lessons, not those taught in high schools and colleges. Once you have been out in the world for many years you will understand how truly important these lessons are to learn, retain and apply to everyday life. I am going to re-read the book, use it as a motivator and as a reference book. It covers such a wide variety of areas, virtually everyone can use it to get an objective, wise opinion on situations in life you are faced with.

It uncovers our intelligent, adulterous, articulate, dishonest President Bill Clinton. I would recommend this book to my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, But Dated","review":"What struck me in reading this in 2012 is how far the United States has come. The Clinton years (even to this 32-year old) seem like ancient history and the protests during the Vietnam War seem like ancient, ancient history. The country has come so far.This book does serve its purpose, however, in highlighting the environment in which the President grew up, came into his own, and grew intellectually. The work is obviously dated given that it only goes to his decision to run for the presidency in 1992, but the early chapters are strong and compelling and read almost like a novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early to rise...","review":"- Probably the most successful politician of our time Bill Clinton has shared his ups and downs. In First in His Class: The Biography of Bill Clinton by David Maraniss, this historian delves deep into the history of our forty second president. Seems Bill Clinton always strived to succeed in what he did.The title reflects this relentless ambition, where a boy from the city of Hope, who came from a poor broken home. The book goes back to his roots and tells the story up to his announcement for President.What you learn is that Clinton used all his gifts to overcome his weaknesses. He enters his chosen profession of politics as a young age. His brief encounter with John F. Kennedy set a clear path to his dream of becoming president.This book is very rich and well researched and gives you well balance portrait of this boy from Hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating and fair","review":"This book is exhaustively researched and unbiased. Don't let some of these reviews fool you -- Mariness has no pro- or anti-Clinton agenda. Whether you loathe him or love him, you will leave this book with a greater understanding of why he has done what he's done, and you'll be amazed at how often patterns repeat themselves in his life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A complete picture of an enigmatic man","review":"A wonderful, interesting and objective biography about one of the most intriguing presidents in the 20th century. Well researched, well written, very compelling. A must read for Clinton fans"},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic 7-inch collection","review":"'Tossing Seeds' and 'No Pocky for Kitty' was my introduction to Superchunk and though the latter is probably a better choice, you do get some very cool nuggets of post-punk power pop in these 13 songs. The covers stand out as covers should: loyal to the original, but still retaining the stamp of the interpreter. The Sebadoh songs are fantastic and listening to them side-by-side with their originals is a tutorial in itself on how to cover a song. 'Train from Kansas City' is just ..... great.There are a coupla punky rave-ups that don't register with me (\\"Night Creatures\\", \\"Fishing\\"), but the remainder of the album is solid. There's even a song about writing songs (\\"Cool\\") that speaks to the nerd rock star wannabe in all of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than just \\"Slack\\"","review":"\\"Slack\\" of course, was the blazing single about workplace resentment that put Superchunk on the map. But this collection is bursting with worthy stuff.One standout is the defiant \\"My Noise,\\" wherein Mac declares that, even if what he's playing is stupid, he loves it and he is driven to play it for anyone who will listen. He also bristles with confidence on \\"Cool,\\" written in the spirit of the old saw about how good composers borrow and great composers steal. \\"What Do I\\" leads the album off nicely, and \\"The Breadman\\" is punchy.You'll probably enjoy the version of \\"Cast Iron\\" that appears on No Pocky For Kitty; the production is a little fuller. But this album's \\"Seed Toss\\" and the No Pocky For Kitty version are equally good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great early collection form a band that's still great","review":"I would recommend this to anyone who likes powerful, funny, indie-guitar music. This is a great collection of early singles form a band that continues to be vital and creative. The songs range from good to great but the great ones--like \\"Slack M-F\\" and the staggering anthem, \\"What Do I\\"--are as good as rock gets."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"This is a good well-rounded collection of Superchunk songs, good for those people who dont have their out of print songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wedemeyer Reports, a political general","review":"I wonder if there is any connection from Animal House, where the A** Hole ROTC commander with the white horse is named Douglas C. Nedemeyer, which seems pretty close to Albert C. Wedemeyer.... Since this book is written by Al Wedemeyer, we'll probably never know.Wedemeyer spent the first years of the war working for Marshall, planning the invasion of Europe. When Chiang, Mountbatten, and Roosevelt finally decided to dump Stillwell, Wedemeyer got one of his jobs. Wedemeyer became Chiang's chief of staff. Wedemeyer was convinced that the Chicoms weren't going to be a good thing for China, but was unable to convince Truman of that before we had helped them into power. We also kind of screwed up Vietnam about then. We did do the right thing in Greece though. Wedemeyer was more of a politician than Stillwell (read his book too). Actually, I don't own this book, I borrowed it from the library. If I bought every book I read, I'd have your warehouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"All the chapters were difinitely helpful. The colorplate of plants in the back stated what you could use each plant for. However, when it mentioned if a plant was medicinal or not, it didn't give you any info on how they where medicinal or what they could do or how to use them. Overall a Very informative book about surviving in the wilderness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a \\"survive until rescued\\" book","review":"This book is meant for the survival enthusiest. I.e. someone who likes to go out and intentionally spend weeks at a time living off the land. For them, this is a good book.It is NOT useful for hikers/backpackers/boaters etc. who are worried that if they get lost or stuck they need survival skills to last until rescued.It has a information on topics such as building a bow and arrow, setting trap lines of 100-200 traps, making stone tools, and tanning hide (all things that require considerable time, energy, and practice). What it does not have is any information on getting rescued - not even a mention of what makes a good distress signal.I haven't read many survival books, but if you're looking for a \\"survive until rescued\\" book check out The Complete Book of Outdoor Survival by J. Wayne Fears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great classic book","review":"I bought this book many years ago and I still love reading it. The book encompasses basic plant identification, finding water, and using primitive technologies. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very useful!","review":"This book really isn't very useful, especially for anyone living outside the southwestern desert. Mr. Olsen wrote the outdoor survival merit badge requirements for the boy scouts, and this is indicative of how the book reads. Most of the information is nice to know and even interesting at times, but it gets silly at points and is more historical in nature than anything. This book might be a good read for those interested in how people survived off the land in the distant past, but offers nothing in terms of modern survival skills. I believe that anyone interested in actually surviving in the wilderness would be better off looking elsewhere. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not useful","review":"I don't understand why this book gets such high praise. It is not a how to book but more of a show and tell. If you want to learn survival skills look elsewhere. I bought this book thinking I was going to learn something. It just shows you what a shelter is and what this is or that."},{"rating":"1","title":"No skills taught here","review":"If you want to read a story about how the author thinks he can survive in the wild, this is the book for you. I bought this book many years ago and found it useless at the time. I recently got it out again and thought I would give it another try. Same thing- almost useless. The author talks about a lot of things that would probably be very good to know/learn but the trouble is that most of the things are not explained enough for a regular person to be able to figure out how to actually do them. Your money would be better spent on a real survival book and not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A LIVE ALBUM !!!","review":"The front-cover says \\"Live\\".The back-cover says \\"Live\\".Even on the cd it says \\"Live\\".But the fact is that this is no Live album.It is simply the original and alternate studio tracksoverdubbed with live sound (clapping,screaming etc.)I think this is a very disappointing release,becauseof the false statement and the fact that there isno concert."},{"rating":"1","title":"what he said !!!","review":"Run away....very far away.I bought it used in the hope that one or two tracks might be worth it....WRONG!Buyer beware when shopping Sweet compilation cd's although Teenage Rampage on Castle and Blockbuster Alternative Takes on Cleopatra might suit your needs if the price is right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mismatched Items","review":"I received this as a gift and although very good quality, the products didn't match.

It is a worthwhile item for use as a toy, but don't expect a novice to gain any relatively deep understanding of circuitry.The projects are delivered in \\"cookbook\\" fashion, i.e. this-connects-to-that-connects-to-the-other. Reasons for why a circuit should be set up this way are minimal. Sometimes it will say something like \\"the transistor and capacitor provide the signal, while the other capacitor and resistor control the frequency.\\" Why we should use one capacitor over another is not addressed.The manual also attempts to teach the reader how to read the schematics, but this instruction is also lacking.Overall, though, this is an enjoyable kit, and worth the price in terms of how much there is to do. Someone looking for something more educational, though, might look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Son loves it.....","review":"Excellent introducton to basic electronics.

The projects were fun (some are annoying - noisy, but he loved them) and the instructions were easy to use. It is also a great learning tool for understanding the basics of how electricity and circuits work. My son learned some concepts in about an hour and then was modifying circuits himself in a way that was not in the book. One thing (and all electronics kits and most books) it lacks is the theory behind what is really happening in the circuit - why does a resistor of x value better than y value, etc. Probably not really necessary at this level. Perfect for 10-18 year old wanting to learn the basics."},{"rating":"1","title":"my true confession","review":"Saw this movie when it came out in the theaters ever so long ago, and haven't seen it since until this week. Having watched it, I am left scratching my head wondering what I found so appealing in this movie 30 years ago. I have no problems with the powerhouse acting of the two leads or for that matter the other characters as well. Excellent performances. Beyond that, the story seems slow and at times disjointed. I rewound several times to make sense of what was going on. I appreciate the many comments of reviewers here who have helped fill in my gaps of understanding. That being said, other reviewers who gave it more stars affirm that it's a movie more about character study than about story."},{"rating":"1","title":"True confessions","review":"Could not watch on my DVD .

It's nice to see that others love it, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"MGM DVD TRANSFER","review":"This is not a review of the film.Only the latest DVD from MGM which provides both a full screen version on one side and a widescreen version on the other.The widescreen version is not an anamorphic transfer which basically means it sucks.It looks like a compromised 1:66 or 1:71 to 1 transfer that has been stretched to fit a 1:85 to 1 widescreen TV frame. If you change your TV's aspect ratio to 14:9 it looks passable until the credits appear and then you'll notice the black bars (top and bottom)appear showing that your chosen aspect ratio is not right either! Up to then (the credits)the picture quality is only fair then when the credits appear and it gets tighter it looks very good but after the credits end so does the superior quality image on the 14:9 frame. Why on earth don't they just do one proper 1:85 to 1 ANAMORPHIC transfer on this terrific film and stop monkeying around with half ass letterbox and full frame crap?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A real classic","review":"This is one of my favourite films, an understated film full of anguish and regret. Duvall and De Niro managed to get across the internal turmoil and disappointment that only thoughtless ambition can bring. There was also a feeling of being trapped from all characters, living and dead, and from most of the scenes and situations.Frustration was depicted so well by Duvall and slow and intellectual regret was portrayed so well by an understated De Niro who used his facial expressions and body language to great effect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good for the money ..a little hiss...but i don't know why somebody would diss these!","review":"I feel for the money, coming from the uk and all, it was a good purchase.

I decided to hook it up to a SIRIUS tuner and listen to both an AUX portable CD player and also sat radio. Ihonestly was not hoping too much for the kind of high quality sound my paradigm speakers gave me at home. WOW! what a surprise!

Far worse is that the book is preciously short on quantitative and analytic methods, and long on third-grade-teacher types of admonishments.

There's a good variety of beats, but they all make you want to MOVE. Even if you have no familiarity with ZUMBA fitness, this is great exercise or dance music.My ONLY disappointment is that there are no lyrics available. Most of the vocals are in Spanish and use enough idioms that it's been difficult for me to figure out what's being said.

The coverage goes well beyond Visual InterDev basics and gets into XML, Script Components and database fundamentals from a Visual InterDev perspective. The topics all seem to assume no prior knowledge, cover the basics quickly, and more into useful code and examples.

I have spoken with many teaching professionals and all Agree this book is not up to WROX standards in anyway. It is written poorly and will only confuse you about a superb product.Ian is banking on the red Wrox label to cover up a very poor product.

Instead you are always introduced to concepts at a very obscure detail level. You will never understand Visual Interdev nor will you get excited about this incredible product by reading this rough draft.Don't take my word for it. Read Ian's Acknowledgement/forward on the inside cover - it makes no sense.

I was excited to see this title become available, but after a few hours with the text realized that this one is pretty bad. There's absolutely no context, order, background, or explanation to the topics. They're kind of just thrown out to you. (By the way, I'm an MCSD, so I'm not a programming neophyte). Most Wrox books assume you have a good technical background, lay a good foundation with clear explanations, and then become progressively deeper. This one just jumps right in.I was personally looking for volume that would give me a high to mid-level view of VID6. I believe the best one out there right now is the SAMS 24-hour book. Very approachable. If you need to get deeper, use BOL or Unleashed.On the positive side, the Wrox books for SQL7, ASP3, and ATL3 are excellent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time & Money","review":"Like the other reviews, the book skips around too much.

There is not continuity in the book. You read a chapter on SOM. Then you get a helping of Client Side Development. But no follow through. I always find that the easiest way to learn a new topic is to follow a project all the way through.This book is a hopeless hodge-podge of material.

When I put it on I realized that the big plastic part on the top was loose and moving.When I slightly lift it it came out completely. Also the one of black plastic parts on two sides dropped by itself. I can see the glue under the plastic parts. I looked at the same item at Target before buying it Amazon.com and they looked very firm and there was nothing loose. I requested a replacement.Check yours when it arrives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk.","review":"I ordered this helmet online.

Nevertheless I returned it due to the defective glue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddily made and limited customer service","review":"I bought this helmet based on the excellent reviews, but the piece in the back used to tighten the plastic strap fell out after about 2 weeks of light usage. I can't find it anywhere, making this helmet essentially useless. I called Schwinn, and they don't have any replacement parts so I'll have to buy a new helmet when only one piece of mine is missing. Many other bike companies have excellent customer service, but Schwinn is not one of them. I also do not like how the visor clips in and out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Value, Check out my Video Review","review":"Length:: 0:46 MinsThis helmet is a fantastic value for the money.

It arrived today and I put it on, sort of... The darn thing doesn't fit my head! I turned the dial to make it as large as possible and even at the largest setting it just doesn't sit right on my head. And I'm not a large guy at all.The helmet itself looks decent, but I have to give it low rating because it doesn't fit and it's not comfortable to me even at the largest setting. Guess I will need to run down to the local store and get a helmet after I can try them on for size.This adult adjustable does NOT fit all head sizes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Helmet","review":"The helmet was exactly what I sought.

I'm going to try to super glue them back on, but a product shouldn't come in this kind of condition. It seems like it was hastily made with little attention to detail.No doubt, this is a decent helmet that will probably protect your skull from injury, but for anyone thinking of buying this, you should also buy a tube of super glue in addition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Quality","review":"I purchased this helmet based on the reviews and what a mistake that was. I just finished packing up the helmet I received today as a replacement for the defective one I recieved last week. I had the same problem with this helmet.

I figured I'd get it despite the bad reviews or photos of the shell falling off...well, surprise, when it came it the side panels were off and the top part was able to come off with the push of a finger.

I can't say how well it works in an accident, and I hope I never find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dorky, but aren't they all?","review":"The Schwinn Thrasher thrashed my cool image. But the truth is any helmet would have done the same thing. This is a value-priced helmet to be sure. It's not fancy, high-quality or good-looking, but it does what it's supposed to do: protect your melon.There are a couple drawbacks that I'm sure are related to the price. First, the visor. Cheap. It pops off if you touch it. It exists more for asthetics than for function. Still, it should stay on, shouldn't it? Also, the chinstrap comes undone very easily. I have to wear it very loose so it stays clasped.One other drawback is that this thing is tall, I mean really tall. Other helmets I've seen don't add so much height that I have to duck under overpasses. Not sure why this is so tall.The positives are obvious: the quality (except for the visor and the chinstrap) are reasonable for the cost. And it will prevent your brains from being ultimately hosed off the street. Worth the cost. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems like a good helmet.","review":"Its a great fitting helmet, that looks a lot less dorky when you take the sun visor off. Its all black, so you can't go wrong with it matching your bike.

Inner lining can be removed easily for washing.Price fluctuates on amazon quite a bit. It's currently more expensive than what I bought it for. Even at the price I bought it for, it can be found for cheaper at neighborhood shops (surprisingly)"},{"rating":"2","title":"does the job, looks fine","review":"As someone who has owned quite a few different helmets (many much more expensive), this one is great. It looks fine (not ugly) and fits well. It may not be a super-lightweight racing helmet, but it is the protection I'm look for an a great price. You can't go wrong in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very easily adjustable, this helmet makes it easy to protect your noggin. Good price, too.","review":"This helmet can be very easily adjusted with a tightening wheel in the back and quick-lock fasteners on the sides. It is comfortable (for a bike helmet), has a removable visor, and doesn't look bad. I fortunately can't comment on how well it actually protects your head in a crash. Oh yeah, and you can't beat the price on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"THICK","review":"When I read the word micro I assumed it was one of the thinner style helmets. It is not. The thing sticks out pretty far on the sides of your head and on top. Not as bad as the solid mushroom looking kids helmets, but pretty close. It does adjust easily and would fit on many different size heads. The carbon fiber black look of it is nice and the visor is decent. However, due to the thickness of the foam I will not be using this particular helmet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap","review":"The shell fell of as I was taking it out of the box.

The helmet lasted about two weeks before one of the plastic pieces on the back fell off. Today, the large plastic piece fell off.I like how easy this helmet was to adjust and how comfortable it was to wear. I dislike how easily it came apart. It was either on my head or in my bag.

It is your head, protect it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks great.","review":"I haven't used it just yet.

It is comfortable,easy to adjust and stays adjusted. I fervently hope I never have to find out how well it performs in a crash. I do wonder what would happen to the area around the base of the skull if one were struck from behind, but all bicycle helmets appear similar in design and it looks like in a headfirst pitch the top of the head would be protected.

The \\"shell\\" on the outside is very thin and just cheaply glued on, it appears to be more like a hard cardstock coated in clear plastic than an actual shell.The padding on the inside of the helmet is almost non-existent. It does little to prevent the helmet from scooting around on your head a bit.Aesthetically, this helmet appears to be quite large in comparison to other helmets. I even overheard a kid say \\"What's that huge thing on that guy's head?\\"Ventilation is also not very good.All in all, it's a helmet and I'm sure it would protect your head in a crash, but with offerings by Giro and others available at only a few dollars more on Amazon, there's no reason to choose the el cheapo schwinn.Wish I could have the money back..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as the other Reviews Stated...

AFter reading the reviews, I decided to try this one. Not too bad, still a little bit of that \\"Mushroom Head look, but this is the best I've ever looked in a bike helmet.

Not a lot of helmet in US market nowadays fits Asian heads well.Cons: the helmet quality is not as good as expected. the shell part is glued with the foam part. after more than a month's use, maybe because the weather and I rode a lot, the glue seems weaker.

I was looking at some other Giro helmets because they have very cool designs. But after reading about the feedback and reviews on this one, I am sold. Before having a bicycle helmet, I use my snowboarding helmet for protection because I am a cheapo. But after receiving this Schwinn Thrasher through the mail and taking it out for a ride, I feel very comfortable giving it a 5 star.

The side of my head hit the ground, however, the helmet protected me. Without it, I am certain that I would have been at the hospital at the very least.

When I back to the office I checked the helmet and it was barely scratched! This helmet is comfortable, nice looking, and adjustable to fit your head. I really like this helmet and I will recommend it to all my friends and family. I was out riding my bike in the woods and my front wheel hit a rock good size rock that threw me over my handlebars.

It didn't prevent fleas when I sprayed it on the dogs before we went outside, and it didn't kill the fleas afterward. I would literally see a flea in their fur, saturate the area with the spray, and I could practically hear the flea going \\"Weeee! Bath time!\\" I'm pretty sure I could have come closer to getting rid of the fleas if I had just let the dogs eat a $5 bill. Doesn't sound like it would do much, you say? Exactly. Neither did this. Oh, and the smell is ridiculously gross. I'll never eat cloves again. It would have been acceptable if it had worked. But it didn't.I finally had to give in and put Frontline on the dogs, which I was hoping to avoid. I'm also using a 10% cedar oil spray, and that is helping, as we're dealing with the infestation.

This Cliffs Quick Review is great in that they have packed a lot of important information into such a small and readable book. The figures and tables don't compare artistically to those found in the extremely expensive full color glossy pages of the latest textbooks, but they are competitive in terms of being useful and helpful for learning.

There were a few typos here and there that probably could have been avoided with better editing; however, the overall content of the book is great. I needed something quick and easy that would give me an overview for some of the harder topics when it came to test time and this does the trick. Before I really start studying for my tests (usually only 1-2 days before) I read over the associated chapters in this book and all the light bulbs turn on. Things that my professor explains that sound like the teacher in Charlie Brown (wa wa waa waa waa)now seem so easy.

People tend to focus on life's milestones but in the end, it is the little things we treasure.I used the Samuel French script when I played Mrs. Gibbs in high school, and really liked the format of this script. The lines are spaced very well, and there is not a lot of commentary in script itself-which leaves room for the director to make most of the decisions. Although this is a paper back script, mine has stood the test of time. I man-handled mine, had my cast members sign it, the cover never came off and binding is still intact.I used this as a script for a production of Our Town, but my sister used it in place of the traditional book in her english class without any issues- it works just as well for your reading pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate to description given.","review":"The used book I bought was in good condition which was accurate to how they described it to be.

As I later found out it was about normal, ordinary, plain, bland everyday life. The message and story were wonderful but slow. Not a good book for a reader who likes action. This is best for people who are patient and enjoy seeking the deeper meaning in a book. I did love the paradox of the adress on the envelope that Rebecca is explaining to George.

Thanks to the school, I didn't throw it away. I usually like good plays like Shakespeare's and Miller's, which, too, can get boring, but always get much better later on. This book was boring all the way! The reason I gave it 2 stars instead of one was because I kind of liked how the girl realizes how preshis life is. There are better plays then this.

I was glued to this book the entire time...I even cried at the end. Even if you don't like to read plays this is a good one to read. Not only is it one of those books that everyone thinks you should read, it's a good story.

It deals with an ordinary little town in the USA at the beginning of the last century. It describes everyday life of normal people, their pleasures and their sorrows. This ordinary touch of the play makes it a bit difficult to see a message in the book at first sight.

There is no scenary, the first play of that kind. It takes place in a small Anytown, USA named Grover's Corners. It occurs in the early 1900s and has the act names of Daily Life, Love and Marriage, and Death. Half of our English class enjoyed it, but I feel it would be better to watch than read, like most plays.

Thornton Wilder is expressing the athmosphere in this town with humor and warmth. He wants to tell us, that there's no need in looking back. You should always look forward into the future. The mean idea of the play is the question about eternal life. Wilder is explaining this question in the third act."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Our Town\\" is nothing special","review":"Let me start off by saying that I love plays and was intrigued to hear that this play did not use props or sets. Thornton Wilder purposely underdeveloped the characters and made it lacking, but this was beyond underdevelopment and lacking -- why bother writing a play? The acts are very short, emotionless, and unmemorable and I hated the characters, because they were uncaring.

The whole story was about a bunch of boring New Englanders going about a very boring existence, some going to school, a marriage that wanted to be, yet didn't want to be, that was poorly acted out, and the stage manager just talking nonsense.

Albini eventually enters with some good guitar hurt. Many of you may skip this one, but you'll be rapt by the remaining half hour or so \\"This is a Picture\\" is certainly one of Shellac's finest moments, where Albini meditates on death and love rather innocently(for him,at any rate-his cynicism usually glosses over any real human emotions he may have), singing, \\"There are angels there...you know where they make angels...heaven, that's where...I can't wait to die/I can find me some/its where Ill find my wife/when Im through with my present one\\".

However, since then, I've been getting about two weeks of use out of every charge. And it does a pretty good job of shaving without having to put in much extra effort.

The battery recharge life is the shortest of any electric razor I have ever owned - after three shaves you definitely need to recharge.

If you can live with the noise and constant charging then it's okay for the price. Personally I doubt I will wait too long before I replace it with a higher quality razor.

It's faster and a closer shave than I have previously had and is great for quick shaves before going out for the night. The trimmer takes a little playing with to get used to, both for sideburns and for long hair. Also, this shaver is louder than others I have used and vibrates a bit.

Given the rather terrible battery life on this thing, that happens an unacceptable amount.This is especially bad given that working direct from an outlet would not cost more to implement - and it's absence is just done to cripple low end razors.

My daughter prefers her nude anyway. Have not had to wash Stella yet, so cannot comment on how she holds up.*Original Post*My 15 month old daughter just got Stella this last Christmas. It's her first baby and she LOVES her! I am looking forward to getting her some of the accessory kits. My only concern with Stella is keeping her clean.

I initially used his theoritcal position on calculating pressure drop in pipe for compressed air. His position seems reasonable and logical until you compare the results with practical applications. Ingresoll-Rand, the air compressor manufacturer, published tables of pressure drop verses pipe sizes, delivery pressures and ACFM. Futher ASPE has published a data book which leads the engineer into an empirical equation for calculating pressure loss in compressed air piping. The results with both Ingresoll-Rand and ASPE agree. Using Mr. Hicks' therotical approach drives the pipe size much larger than needed and therefore the cost of the project. My suggestion is that Mr. Hicks contact I-R and ASPE to incorporate their empirical approach to sizing pipe for compressed air and vacuum systems."},{"rating":"1","title":"These are FREE from the DHHS website!!!","review":"I can't believe people are charging for these!!

Its characters are painfully stereotypical (beautiful, tortured, blue-eyed heroine; reticent, tortured, uber-masculine hero) and the story's multiple plot lines are tied up so perfectly that the story surpassed \\"sweet\\" and plunged headlong into \\"treacly\\" territory. Character and plot development are tragically lacking, while inane details abound. Why in the world would I care what clothes they wore in every scene?I'm giving it two stars because 1) it obviously wasn't so bad that I stopped reading it and 2) the author's descriptions of foods were very good.This isn't the worst book I've ever read, but it's in the bottom five.

Even thought I was well within weight limits, and the cart was upright the 3 wheels just snapped off, and of course, broke the \\"plastic\\" and cannot be repaired.While this was supposed to be a rugged heavy duty cart.

Yes, you follow the instructions precisely and it works. But it is still hard to start, compared to the half dozen other saws I have owned. Worse, if you let the saw sit for a few months (which is common for me), then it is so gummed up that it must be dismantled and lubricated before you can start it again. Contrast this to another similar saw I have, which sat for more than a year and started immediately.That said, the saw works well and has plenty of power. Hard to adjust correctly though, it does not idle very well (even when new). I had to adjust the idle speed high enough that the chain was spinning, to keep it from dying. That problem went away after 6-8 hours of use.It is an acceptable saw, barely, but I would not purchase it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"For want of a gas cap","review":"I'm not too experienced with chain saws. This one performs well if not a little heavy for extended use. But it does have one huge flaw which I credit to bad engineering.

Problem is the plastic gas cap swells and it takes channel lock pliers to remove it and you can't replace it. Poulan customer service says and I quote \\"Put the cap in the sun for 2 hours.\\" Bull! I can put it in the freezer for a couple of hours and the cap struggles back into place.

The geometric intuition is as clean as it can be. This is a perfect book for a first course in manifold theory, provided the student has studied basic multivariable calculus and the differential geometry of curves and surfaces in 3-space. The prerequisites are kept lean by ignoring the general technology of abstract manifolds and dealing only with submanifolds of euclidean space."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very confusing introduction to differential topology!","review":"I couldn't disagree more with the reviewer from Texas. I tried reading this book as a first year graduate student, and seemed to struggle with every line. It was only a year later, when taking a course on differential geometry, that an instructor, Doug Moore from UC Santa Barbara, bothered to make these ideas more clear in his excellent lecture notes. Usually when I give a bad review, I like to also recommend a much better book, but unfortunately I have none to offer in the area of Differential Topology. My instructor's solution was to switch to Milnor's \\"Morse Theory\\", but I found this just as bad if not worse. If someone knows of a better book, please let me know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lightweight and overpriced","review":"I had to study this for my degree. It was one of those books that one person bought and was passed around mainly due to it's outrageous cost. It has a lack of rigour that is not made up by being more intuitive or giving the reader insight into why differential topology is such a great subject.Transversality is rightly given prominence, but you don't really walk away with a good feel for it's importance or power. Degrees, linking numbers etc I got for 10 GBP with Milnor's Topology from a Differential Point of View.As an introduction to differential topology - with a little point set and alot of algebraic throw in - Bredon's Geometry and Topology sets the gold standard, with Darling's Differential Forms and Connections doing a good job on the differential geometry front and Milnor's book above providing bedtime reading beforehand. You can buy all three together for around the same price as this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Introduction","review":"This book confers the intuition and understanding necessary for a solid foundation in Differential Topology. The exercises are well crafted and relevant too. What's more is that this book is actually readable: Some books are great once one already knows the topic whilst exceedingly difficult to the uninitiated. This book, however, is a reference as well as a solid introduction. And as an added plus the authors stray from the standard clinical textbook writing styles. Brought together with Munkres' Elements of Algebraic Topology and perhaps Massey's Algebraic Topology: An Introduction, you've got the foundations of a graduate career in Topology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nearly unwatchable","review":"I managed to get through the movie but it took an effort. The Photoplay Restoration was so heavily fuscia tinted it was almost imposible to make out what was going on. Very little was discernible in dark areas of the screen while the highlighted areas, such as the actors faces, were a sickly green tinged with fuscia. It would have been a much better in black and white.

If the box says the toy will teach my kids something, I'm tempted to buy it. I've been tricked many times into buying toys that are boring, breakable or not all that educational. This was NOT the case with Snap Circuits Jr. SC-100I bought this for my 4 year old for Christmas. I figured I could put together the circuits for him and teach him a little about electricity.I did put together the first circuit, but my 4 year old took over after that. For the simple designs, he's able to put together the circuits as easily as he can build a Duplo tower. When the light bulb turns on or buzzer buzzes, he is very proud. When it does not work, he looks at his design to see what might be wrong.As he is building, we talk casually about electricity and how it works. We also talk what other devices around the house use similar circuits.The toy is so simple and fun that we don't get bored or overwhelmed. I'm very impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snap Circuits Jr.","review":"This was a gift for our 6 year old grandson for Christmas and he played nonstop for hours!

It really does fit ages 8 to 108! My only dislike about it is that the 100 ohm resistor was actually a 1000 ohm resistor. I contacted the business for a *free* part, which it really is, I didn't pay shipping or anything (and it's really easy to do as well). However, the new part was also a 1k resistor too! Contacted the company again but only got an automated message telling me that I could get free replacement parts at their website (like the previous time).

I have to help him assemble the circuits but it's super easy with picture directions and a 10 year-old neighborhood friend has had no problem helping him make the other projects so I can take a break! WELL worth the money! All the parts worked, even after they got dribbled with water from another gift that leaked on them. Dried out on a paper towel nicely.

Beginners with no previous contact with basic electricity and/or electrons are fascinated with these kits. The parts are well built and durable. The kit is easy to organize and store. The plastic storage tray makes it easy to account for all parts. The kit uses rigid circuit components, making circuits easy to understand... as opposed to using flexible wires. Wires would tend to end up being an uncomprehendable pile of spaghetti. Included are many plans for pre-designed projects, yet the kit is safe and flexible enough to allow a student to experiment to his/her heart's content."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of use out this toy","review":"I got this for my 9 year old son and he loved it.

After about 20 minutes of explaining some basic concepts, I was off and running on my own. I always kept it at my grandmother's house whenever I visited, she would translate. I am an electronic engineering student today partly because of this toy. I still find it it fascinating to play with(albeit, limiting now). This is a great buy for kids who are interested in electronics/computers. I remember building an FM radio with this and accidentally tuning into a construction sites walkie-talkies(the tuner was not limited to standard FM frequencies).You will have to spend some time with your kid(s) explaining some basic concepts of electricity.

It has 100 simple projects that get more complex as you go and explains what you are doing when you put each project together. Definately good for kids that like to build things. The components are enclosed in plastic pieces that have the schematic symbol for that component so the kid will learn how to read schematics as they go. They snap together with metal snaps at the bottom of each part and very easy for a kid to take apart/put together without damaging the pieces.

Our Grandson is just shy of 6. He has always liked to build things and he can't get enough of the Snap Circuit. His Papa is a retired electrical engineer, so they both enjoyed working thru each project, the little one begging for just one more each time Papa needed a break. Grandson has caught on quickly and is already completing many of the projects. Love his excitement as he finishes the project and beckons Ninny to come look at his accomplishment. I am already looking for add-ons for his birthday in 2 months.

Me encantan los discos de Mägo porque todos cuentan una historia y este disco relata por lo que paso el Jesús de Chamberí. Al leer el nombre del disco pensé que era una herejía completa, pero no. Sus letras son muy críticas, sobre todos para aquellos que nos llamamos cristianos y no profesamos con el ejemplo.Excelentes letras, muy buena música y bien logrado. Lo recomiendo 100%.

It was quite decent, filled with energy and force. However, their sophomore record is far superior, in my opinion. Here, their music is melodic, anthemic, heartfelt and powerful all at the same time. Who would've thought mere rookies could emerge with such raw emotion by just their second album? The lyrics and subject matter strike dangerously close to home, mostly concerning the aftermath of 9/11. Often times, the energy presented here will make more mainstream political punk bands (Pennywise, Anti-Flag) appear as child's play, by comparison. Though less fast-paced than their previous album, this one has better songwriting and a more polished feel.Certainly worth picking up. I'd give it four and a half stars if I could, but I usually round up on Amazon.com."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their Best11","review":"This is thier best album out of all three the others are amazing also but this is their best cd you should definatly get it they are an amazing band my favorite but you should buy all thier cds but if your seeing if you like them or not get this cd revolutions per minute definatly"},{"rating":"2","title":"RAD!!!!","review":"awesum! this is a perfect example of political punk not that wanna b punk like Anti-Flag. every song is fast & catchy. hits ur ears & heart. makes u wanna play air guitar"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rise against is and will always be awesome!","review":"Great CD!

Rise against is an incredible band, with deep, meaningful lyrics, AMAZING VOCALS (THE best I've heard in punk music for a long time.), the screams mean something in this band, the singer can sing, and the songs are powerfull. The instrumentals are top notch. The album itself is a good combination of melodie punk and hardcore, personal and political all at once. A great band, that should definity be checked out.P.S. They did a track for American Beauty, my all time favorite movie, so add some cool points."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revuhlootion","review":"This is an absolutely amazing album from an absolutely amazing band. Rise Against does a very impressive job with this CD. I can't seem to stop listening to it. It's hardcore, in-your-face punk rock and from beginning to end, doesn't stop. \\"Black Masks and Gasoline\\" kicks the album off like getting shot out of a cannon into a glass wall then landing into a pool of salt and alcohol. It's intense and angry, just the way I like my music. And most of all, just the way I like my punk rock. \\"Halfway There\\" is another amazing song and the bridge on \\"Voices Off Camera\\" is one of the baddest f*cking bridges I've ever heard. \\"As the desperate cries grow louder, I know we're getting close...\\" I can't quit listening to this album.

Chapter one begins with LAPD dectective Sebastian Delgado's tiresome hunt for the Gryphon years after the first murder. After that, the suspense builds as the Gryphon kills one victim after another...until Wendy Alden escapes when he tries to kill her. What follows will keep even the most restless reader on the edge of his/her seat. \\"Shiver\\" has a surprising conclusion as Delgado's sharp detective mind finally clues in to the Gryphon's mysterious ways. A realistic, thrilling novel with an accurate depiction of police life in the large city. It's a definite \\"don't miss\\" for suspense fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Piercy's best work","review":"Like many of the other reviewers, I've been a Marge Piercy fan for years. \\"He, She & It,\\" \\"City of Darkness, City of Light,\\", and \\"Gone to Soldiers\\" (not to mention much of her poetry) are books I love and come back to over and over again. As a biracial Jewish woman who is active in politics, I couldn't wait to read this book. Once I started, though, I wish I hadn't. Trite, predicatable, cliched, with characters that are uninteresting, hollow stereotypes, there is nothing to recommend this novel. While I don't agree with some of the other reviewers (I found the college discussion of sex typical, not crude, and in my experience it is true that even non-religious Jews often want their children to marry people who are Jewish), I do agree that this book isn't worth bothering to read. Perhaps if I had been 16 when I read this it would have been engrossing, but this is not a book for an adult audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intriguing story of ambition and love","review":"Marge Piercy's The Third Child is a coming-of-age story tells of a prominent family where ambition comes first and third child Melissa has always felt she comes last. Her freedom at college leads her to Blake, a man of mixed race and unknown parentage, and a fiery affair which hides a secret which could destroy both their families. The Third Child is an intriguing story of ambition and love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful/NOT up to her usual!","review":"My alltime favorite author, but apparently was under a deadline to produce another book, or someone else wrote it?

It's good that I picked it up at a thrift store and only paid $1 for it. I spent the entire time reading this book waiting for something interesting to happen. I made it to the last page without having done so. The plot goes nowhere and the characters are empty and sometimes annoying. I won't spoil the book for those truly interested but the ending made me so angry that I actually threw the book. I could sit for an hour explaining all the reasons this book is awful but I am going to go start a good book, White Oleander by Janet Finch. You have been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Closing the cover at page 66","review":"I normally enjoy Marge Piercy's work, but this novel, unlike many of her previous stories, smacks of being pushed onto paper to fulfill a contract. The introductory narrative seemed stilted to me, but I ploughed on, hoping that Ms. Piercy's writing skill would shine forth as usual and I would be in for a pleasant read. Not so. The storyline threads are trite, the characters less than real, the dialog amateurish and unappealing. The Freshman English student Melissa, with all her faults, could have done better than Ms. Piercy has on this story. Saying anything more about this novel would be wasting my time - no need to be more specific. At page 66, I closed the cover, put on my shoes, and headed out to return The Third Child to the local library. As another reviewer has suggested, I will try \\"The Namesake.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateurish dialogue","review":"As a Piercy fan, I expected more. The plot was well executed, but the dialogue was ridiculous. Many times I just had to laugh at the stilted words spoken by these characters. What happened to Piercy?

I did finally finish it, but I still can't believe Marge Piecy wrote something so amateurish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it says it is","review":"I bought this specifically because the description said that it was a black fridge.

They have attempted to reproduce (or copy) materials relating to John Wilbur from his past journals, but in so doing, something went terribly wrong, and the entire book, from start to finish, is totally illegible. The only thing that IS legible is the title on the front cover of the book.

It almost reads like a first draft.I mean, this thing, has extra commas, just dropped in, like pepper!Oftentimes names are spelled one way at the opening of a paragraph, and another way at the end.

After having my head filled with heavily-slanted news profiles of places like Kabul and Jalalabad and the people of this part of central Asia, it was extremely refreshing to lose myself in Eric Newby's impressions of the land, the people and the history. Newby was not an expert or scholar - and this layman's perspective may be precisely why I found the book so interesting. Of course, I also agree with the previous reviewers who enjoyed the story of Newby and Carless' somewhat foolhardy travels. But I also recommend this book to anyone who wants to add to his or her understanding of this region."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Yarn","review":"A \\"short walk\\" is at once accurate and understated. Accurate because the walk is short, less than a month. Understated because its walkers confront extreme challenges and setbacks at every turn, ranging from hostile citizens and difficult weather to physical maladies that would drive the less intrepid of us to the nearest hospital."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so amusing...","review":"Eric Newby describes his travels in vintage English style. There is some dry humor in the book, and there are good descriptions of the places he traveled through and the people that he met. However, the journey seems to have caused him considerable discomfort, which is described in detail. His description of the Afghan countryside does not, for the most part, make it sound like an appealing place. He also, generally, draws very unflattering portraits of the local populace. The almost constant negativity, which too often did not reach the level of dry humor, made for a less than agreeable read. Endurance by Alfred Lansing, which describes the adversities faced by another group of English adventurers, is a much more entertaining book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good travel book","review":"This book was really hard to keep my attention. I did not find it exciting at all and did not get emotionally attached. I must admit that I did not read the whole book because I tried several times and never got into it. I bought it because Lonely Planet had branded it and I love all of their travel books. This is not in the same vain or writing style as a LP book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully amusing.","review":"In A Short Walk, Eric Newby and companions manage to do everything wrong in order to climb a remote mountain in the Hindu Kush, which happens to be located in Afghanistan. But that's only the best part. The trip starts with a climbing trip to Ben Nevis where the would be climbers are given a pamphlet on how to climb in ice and snow, which is their only introduction to high climbing. They drive a car from Britain to Afghanistan and manage to do everything wrong in a very earnest and english way. Their death defying attempt to climb the mountain has the best of intentions, the worst training and some rather dodgy gear. A brilliant travel story and a excellent guide on how not to climb mountains!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This is one of the best travelogues I've ever read. It is an account of travel to a little known corner of Afghanistan, which in itself is little travelled.

The scale of the cumulative fraud dwarfs the crimes of Bernie Madoff.

This book weaves together the past, the present, and an unlikely combination of settings to produce a fascinating story. The characters are so well-drawn that I ended up sympathizing even with the ones I was sure I wouldn't like. It reminded me of Charles Dickens in its irony and unvarnished views of life, and also in the fact that it's no easy read. If you're a fan of light fiction, this book is probably not for you, but if you like depth, action and plot twists, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG WASTE!","review":"When I first saw this item I thought, \\"wow, what a great idea\\". Then reality sunk in when I brought my baby home and realized that this was the stupidest thing. First, the hole didn't even land anywhere near my son's belly button. Second, the onesies seem to at least protect the belly button from the clothes you put on your baby where these onesies leave the belly button exposed to the clothes which can rub against the healing area. Last, the best thing for a healing belly button if you don't want to put a onesie over it is the side button tee shirts that they give you in the hospital. I swiped a few of those when we left the hospital and never used the two packs of these that I received at my shower. Not worth the money for maybe a week that your baby's belly button will be healing. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great idea!","review":"My daughter wore these every day for the first 10 days and I loved them. Granted, she was born at the beginning of June and so it was warm and it was all she needed to wear. Also, she hated being swaddled, so that removed the issue of having a hole for her belly button, but the blanket that was swaddling her rubbing which was a concern for one of the other reviewers. It made it easy for people who were holding her to ensure they didn't accidentally catch it on anything and boy was she cuddled a whole bunch :) But like the other reviewer said - I didn't need the wash cloths and although I got these for a shower gift and didn't personally fork over the cash for them, they were expensive and a smaller pack would have been ideal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Those Damn Teppers and Their Catchy Music","review":"This EP, a tantalizing taste of future greatness, is truly inspired.

What so bothered me about this book was the fact that Mr. Daly took a little bit of the truth and mixed in a lot of lies and confusion. This is dangerous. He did not represent the people or the events that took place in Le Chambon in a truthful or accurate manner. Even though he does state at the end of his book that it was a work of fiction, he could have written something better. Instead, he wrote a pornographic piece of trash.

Getting lost in Pellucidar, Edgar Rice Burroughs' world within our world, is rather easy todo since it is virtually impossible to get one' bearings there. The Sun remains fixed in the centerof the sky and the horizon curves upward so even the tallest peaks tend to merge into thebackground.

That's why I love it: it contains all the energy, audacity, drunkeness, and madness that a band like the damned should have at a crowded, dingy little pub in the middle of a working-class town, in the middle of a nation where class-oppression is the norm. You have to be on your way to a party or with people who know of the damned for it to be of any use. If you listen to this on your way to work, travelling up I-64 West at 6:13 am, half-awake, getting ready to process HUD forms all day, it will probably be depressing due to the fact that you didn't get to be in that band and have the adventures they did nor did you get to play in any band who wanted to go all the way because all the musicians around here have no ambition, and refuse to show up for practice for no good reason whatsoever. But hey, that's just me...."},{"rating":"2","title":"DAMNED CHAOS IN NEWCASTLE","review":"Another live by the lads this time in NewCastle in 83.

When placed on the shelf, my computer will rock back and forth after a light touch. The computer is nowhere near the stated 200 lbs. load capacity, and even just pressing down with my hands made the sides of the shelf start to bow.

Shelf construction is incredibly easy and only takes about five minutes. Like other reviewers, I found that the shelf dips a little in the center, but it isn't enough to be a problem, and it will definitely support the 200 pound limit it's designed for.

The shelf does what it should and is adjustable, like the description says. The wires of the metal shelf do tend to bend if pressure is put on them. They are easily bent back into place, but I would recommend making sure that anything heavy that is place on the shelf will also have its weight distributed evenly. (For example, if it is a heavy item and stands on feet, putting a board between the item and the shelf will spread the weight out and prevent the individual wires from bending where the feet of the heavy item would be bearing all the weight at those points.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"sturdy, functional, light weight, and easy to assemble","review":"i stacked several of these in a closet to create shelving upon which to store boxes of comics. the system works fine, is easy to assemble, is light weight, and looks quite fine. recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"The design of this shelf does not allow for a stable surface.

If the shelf is slightly off balance it collapses.....I guess you could use it if you were precise about the height and were only storing light things but I am currently looking for a replacement. This shelf fell apart repeatedly with all my laundry items on it.

One other item is that Marty does go on and on about evolution. I personally am not big on the whole evolution thing...species can and do evolve and adapt to their environment but I don't buy into animals completely changing... you are not convincing me that a manatee is a close cousin of the Elephant. One more item if you buy these, you get what you pay for. $39.00 is not bad for the 12 seasons but be real careful removing them from the containers!

I don't know about you, but I don't find that appealing. Other than the heroine's need for the hero to commit himself to her willingly and completely, and the hero's unwillingness to believe in her being a witch, there is no plot. The writing itself has a hasty feel, as though the author knocked it out in a weekend and never polished it.

I felt as though the book itself were stretched out longer than it should've been, therefore making it boring with it's usless comments. The chracters were not really in dept and the story line is too slow. Sebastion seems like a good inteeligent man, but it seems to me that it would be highly unlikely that he would fall in love with a women just after some dreams he was having about her.

This LP is a little more out there. The band is beyond the Flipper like noise and basically morphed into a twisted post punk/prog act with elements of the straight forward punk and a little metal too.

Sure the record rocks hard, but it does have its quieter moments when you can really hear that front man Blake Beckmann can truly SING. Stepa's debut was produced by Jay Baumgardner, and fits in the same category as his other credits (Hoobastank, Papa Roach, Godsmack), but Stepa still has a unique raw edge that is all their own. If it has to be compared, their music sounds like a heavier, younger, more aggressive version of Incubus.Pure and simple, Stepa is FUN music. \\"Aquarium\\" is the lead track and first radio single, and it's easy to see why--just try to get it outta yer head! Stepa has the potential to be something really big."},{"rating":"2","title":"funny but not balanced","review":"This very funny movie is also very unbalanced, not that it makes any attempt to be. Moore is good at showing a few of the kooks and local sights that capture the spirit of a rotting town, but when he starts trying to analyze why things went so sour, the film gets unfortunately naive. Don't expect a movie about corporate ruthlessness, because the ruthlessness is taken for granted.

Maybe that's part of the reason GM (and other US companies) are moving to Mexico and overseas - because they don't really have the magic money tree to pay the unions as much as they keep demanding. I just wish he had addressed this... Well, you can't have everything, I guess. Otherwise, the film is a darkly humorous depiction of what happens when unskilled union workers are forced to face the real world.

I just want to tell people that this is an awesome movie. I first watched this movie about 10 years ago and it truly woke me up from my slumber/apathy about what's being hidden/taken away from us in this country. We really need to stand up to all this BS! It's our country, not Wallstreet/the wealthiest 1% who have a majority of the money/GM or all the other greedy corporations! Our precious jobs are being outsourced by these greedy corporations and no one seems to know or care.

Michael Moore is the filmmaker and Roger is Roger Smith, the head of GM at the time, whom he tries, without success, to interview on the tragedy at Flint. Irony is the best device to use in a documentary like this, and Moore loads the film with it: people being evicted while the rich are saying life is wonderful there, and the city investing millions of dollars in tourism but the tourists never come. The ultimate irony is found in the running interview Moore has with a GM p.r. man who argues for the good of the company - but at the end he's laid off, too. The movie goes on a bit too long and certain scenes seem to be there for effect only (for example, those with a woman who raises rabbits for food - we see her actually skinning one), but it's a good documentary nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll never think the same about America or your Car again","review":"This is one of the most emotionally powerful documentaries on business I have ever seen. It's insanely dificult to create a movie that looks at both business and government the way this film does, but through an odd stroke of luck, Michael Moore pulls it off beautifully! The entire film is filled with the repricussions of an event which rocked the Automobile industry, and the entire town of Flint, Michigan. The logic makes you laugh, and the people make you cry. It's one of the best documentaries out there. Michael Moore did a fantastic job with this documentary, putting all the money he had in the world to make it. Watch it, and learn from it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Muckraker Moore's Early Work","review":"\\"Roger & Me\\" is one of Michael Moore's earliest pieces of work. It is quite apparent that Moore has always had a knack of being an investigative journalist - seeking out the truth and attempting to present equal air time for both sides. Moore's valiant and persistent efforts to reach out to Roger Smith, Chairman of GM, are admirable. It was rather intriguing to see how so difficult it was to get through to Mr. Smith. My interpretation of such a struggle to get to one important individual is a reflection of the American people's frustration with the system and the politicians.The \\"two Americas\\" that John Kerry and John Edwards speak of, are clearly exemplified throughout this movie ranging from the elites within GM and those being evicted from their homes at Christmas time. An excellent movie to watch if you want to get a glimpse into what America really is like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a review of the film, but of the PACKAGING","review":"When will Warner wake up and stop using those CHEAP snapper cases for their DVDs? I would like to think they're passing on the savings to me (wishful thinking). I'm sure the better cases cost only pennies more and, since DVDs (like laserdiscs) will last forever, they should provide a better package!I received my copy of \\"Roger & Me\\" and the DVD was flopping around inside the case, scratched to heck. The spindle/nub that holds the DVD in place was BROKEN. Amazon was nice enough to replace it for me (free return shipping, too!). Once the spindle is damaged in the snapper case, it's as good as trash. At least with better packaging, you can remove the artwork and put it in a replacement case."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Flint Stoning","review":"For any student interested in the negative power of bureaucracy--rent this movie. It certainly defines the need for value-laden organizations where employee voices are heard. The closing of the GM plant ripped apart a culture--and a community. It reminds viewers that we are all disposable and no job is sacred.Michael Moore, my hat is off to you. Your hometown of Flint should be very proud for bringing to life their stories--and in a very tasteful and sincere manner.I would love to see a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mean-spirited, egocentric - serves little purpose","review":"This movie is more about making people look bad than it is about General Motors. The majority of the interviews are not humorous, make no real point, and have nothing to do with General Motors or Roger Smith. Moore spends more time with the rabbit lady and the eviction guy than he does with anyone else. And what purpose does showing a rabbit being killed serve this movie? That nauseating scene makes the scene in Fatal Attraction look tame. There are no solutions offered nor is there much in the way of analysis of the issues. In his own way, Moore is every bit as elitist as the figures that he caricatures throughout the movie. A shameful manipulation that could only have been made to feed Moore's monstrous ego."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least MM is consistent","review":"Once again another MM project that has a few, good points. That's it people, a few, good points. The problem is then his points are wasted because of a smug, arrogant attitude. This is a constant theme in all his work. Those of you who think it's \\"hilarious\\" do not understand capitalism - or worse yet have some kind of problem with a company that makes a profit. MM has a personal axe to grind over Flint, Michigan, and he does this well. Bottom line, it's easy to gripe and rant when something doesn't work. It's harder to provide solutions. Thanks Mike."},{"rating":"1","title":"kjdfjhsdfgsd","review":"I think that the movie was pretty good because it tells the truth abuot Roger, He is really greedy.

Does this make the sum of the whole True? Answer: No.This is the preferred method of con artists, who desire to use truth to build their larger lies.

Much more subtle, tactful, and honest than the brilliant Bowling for Columbine.Moore's commentary is focused and (surprisingly) non-combative, discussing the making of the film and his personal connection to Flint.In regards to the full-screen presentation: The movie was shot entirely on 16mm, with the apect ratio of 4 x 3 (standard television size); it was then cropped and matted for its 35mm theatrical print. The DVD presents the film in its original 16mm format, so while it *is* modified from its theatrical version, you are by no means getting shorted.Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great movie","review":"Roger & Me protrayed the horrible effects of how a well known and prospering company can be shut down, and the horrible outcome for the citizens in the town. The well known company of GM was born and created in Flint, Michigan. After many years of large profits, a GM chairman Roger Smith, decides to shut down the Flint company. As the last car went down the assembly line, people releized that their lives were changed for the worst. In about 3 years a wicked lot of Flint citizens were thrown out of their homes and moved away from Flint. At one point, the city was in such horrible slums, that the rat population was greater than the human population. This documentary at some points was extremely annoying, but funny so it was able to keep viewers interested. The movie shows how a great living area can turn into a horrible slum, just because of one company closing. One thing can affect everyone, either for the best, or the worst."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roger & Me---timely and timeless","review":"This is a rare film, as it serves as a snapshot of corporate greed in the late 20th century, yet I believe that 100 years from now, people will still be able to relate to it, just as 100 years ago, Michael Moore could have gone to Pullman Illinois."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better than Bowling for Columbine","review":"If you are a Michael Moore fan, you simply must have this for your collection. Even if you have never heard of Michael Moore, you will enjoy this story. Moore takes you on an eventful journey as he sets out to confront Roger Smith (GM). You will laugh, cry, and become enraged. I watched the film and then watched it agin with the commentary immediately after. This is a rare occurance. My only suggestion to make the DVD better would be to add an alternate ending in which Moore ultimately gets Roger Smith alone and sticks a foot up his hiney :). Although the story takes place in the 1980s, it is truly a timeless tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roger & Me","review":"Good movie, sometimes a little slow, I hardly belive i would see it if I havent see Bowling for columbine and F.911, However Michael Moore shows you with comedy and irony how he starts to be the great movie filmer that he becomes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roger & ... Count Me Out","review":"I give it a point for an occasional insight into Rust Belt America and the corporations that tighten that belt. However, in general this film is wildly overrated.

Roger & out."},{"rating":"1","title":"A \\"Documentary\\" That is anything but....","review":"After watching this film, it moved me enough to do some research on the topics discussed and the film itself. I was shocked to find out that this film was edited and put together completely out of order and sequence in order to give more weight to the items that Mr. Moore felt were more important and suited his agenda. I felt lied to, and if you knew the truth and then watched this \\"documentary\\" you would as well. A true documentary states the facts and leaves the conclusions up to the viewer. Mr. Moore does not trust us with the truth especially if it seems it does not fit his agenda. Do not waste your time, there are many better films if you want to see fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manipulative","review":"This is not a documentary, any more than the 1930s works of Leni Riefenstahl were documentaries. It is cleverly manipulated, cleverly-designed socialist propaganda by one of the biggest blowhards in the film industry.Yes, Flint MI was hit hard by layoffs. So were a number of other rust belt towns (including my hometown). But if this was a true documentary, Mr. Moore might have examined some of the reasons for plant closures other than the greed of General Motors. Had he the courage to dig beneath the surface, he might have discovered greed of a different sort - e.g. that of the UAW top guns who dictated horrendously stupid, inflexible work rules.Also lacking is any discussion of greed at the government level, which taxes corporations to death. I guess when your objective is to uphold paternalistic government, you tend to cherry pick history to support that view, and that's what Mr. Moore has done here. Not fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like propaganda videos...","review":"you'll love this one! Michael Moore has a few good points in this movie, but he never mentions, say, GM's legal obligation to the stockholders to maximize shareholder value. Basically the \\"documentary\\" is more centered around his upset feelings at how the world works, making it long, drawn out, and fairly boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"What exactly was the purpose of this movie? Was it trying to help the poor working class of Flint? If Americans are going to be pro-proletariat I don't see why such antipathy for communism. So what if the pitiful slave rebellion succeeded? In the godless ephemerality of human life wether they all perish or continue to contaminate planet earth- what does it matter? If you gave in to be an american machinistic slave of a job, you might as well expect to be treated like a slave. What is wrong with Roger Smith? A cunning ingenious businessman if you ask me. The sarcasm, though I usually receive sarcasm well, was vomit-inducing. Stories with morals never fare well, and it is for humans like Moore that I wish hell existed; but alas it does not. Rebel- a mindless american romantic loose term pertaining to muckrakers. Who's concern is it about Moore, Flint, and muckrakers? A torturous classroom experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"here we go again","review":"If only Mikey would have concentrated on relieving the burdens on our corporations so it would be profitable to hire workers.

Thank your lucky star if you do: you won't miss anything. The only reason for giving the film one start is that it can't be rated lower. There is nothing even remotely funny with this film. It's a sad story of how he tries to get an interview with the owner of a car factory that will be closed, and he's acting like a complete idiot whist pursuing this interview.The workers of the factory that closed should all go up and slap Mr.Moore for producing something so hideous about their misery. He would have been better off giving the money it cost to do the movie directly to the workers instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This is the first Micheal Moore film, and the first one I've watched. This movie explores the devistating effects on GM's outsourcing on Flint, Michigan. This movie is better than I was anticipating- it is a very good documentary that makes you feel angry at GM and sad for Flint, Michigan and their desperate attempts to revive the city with such attractions such as the $100 million Autoworld indoor theme park. I would like to see Flint today to see what the town is like now- hopefully better than it was in this documentary. The only part of the movie I didn't like was when they showed the killing of the rabbit. That part could of been left out. (I guess they put that in to show some of the weird things some people would do to get by). This is a great yet now outdated film that I would reccommend watching- highly reccommended!

Still there was no R Rated material on this movie.I did think the movie was an example of what goes on in corporate America. People who put all many years manufacturing and suddenly get laid off even when the company is making big bucks.

Not all '60s rock divas make poor jazz performers; Rita Coolidge's album \\"And So Is Love\\" has several near perfect tracks even if the entire album is not perfect.

However when Ronstadt decided to try the stuff Ella, Frank, and Billie once recorded, it just made her sound immature and ametuerish. I am not influenced by but a respected and a NO BS jazz critic by the nbame of Will Friedwald shares my views and so does any serious jazz listener.

Perhaps her mother attempted to instill an uncommonly high level of discipline, but this hardly qualifies as the child abuse Ms. Furlong appears to attempt to portray. While it's possible that it is Ms. Watts who exaggerated, she claims to have loved doing everything she did for her parents as a child, and comes across clearly as unaffected and sincere.What then are we to conclude about Ms. Furlong's negativity toward Alan?

I disliked it rather heartily, as a matter of fact.

Ms. Grafton has given us readers a special gift in the form of Kinsey. Sure, A is for Alibi, is slow to start, and not much plot, but most first books are the same.

Kinsey Millhone is hired by a woman to investigate the murder of her philandering husband who she was tried and convicted of killing. Eight years have went by since his murder, but Kinsey still agrees to take the case.Finally got around to reading this. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would, but I kept getting these weird \\"Anita Blake\\"-ish vibes from the book. The heroines are so smiliar in thought to me. Maybe Ms. Hamilton read these books as well? Nothing to deep and thought provoking here. A nice little whodunit, even if the killer was pretty obvious to me.It was nice to see a story where the main focus wasn't the hero's love life, leaving the main plot of the story secondary. I'll definitely check out more in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs work","review":"I recently finished a Mary Higgins Clark book before I started to read Sue Grafton's 'A' is for Alibi. Why is it that mystery writers, in general, use the same plot twist for an ending? I liked Kinsey, but I didn't like the rest of the one-dimensional characters. I also didn't like all the descriptiveness in the book. The reader doesn't need to know every little detail and I get the feeling the author is being descriptive in order to fill in the holes of a very thin plot.

It has been 30 years since it was published and somehow I have never read any of the alphabet series. The book turned out to be a fantastic read, well setup and driven by a great lead character Kinsey Millhone. A Private Investigator, Millhone is hired by a recently released convicted murderer who wants Kinsey to find the real killer. Several recent reviewers said they found the plot to be difficult to follow. I did not find that to be the case at all. The plot was clear, linear and I enjoyed the chase.I strongly suggest that if you are in need of a great book, then give this one a try. In addition, you have a whole alphabet to go. Grafton has published every letter up to V is for Vengeance, so you'll even get to finish the series with a few midnight book release parties."},{"rating":"1","title":"A is for All right","review":"I had heard great things about the alphabet books; however, I was disappointed.

Laurence Fife was a slick divorce lawyer and a womanizer. There could have been anyone involved in the picture there that wanted him dead at the time.Kinsey has to re-open a case that is now eight years cold, and at the end is a chilling twist even Kinsey doesn't suspect-a second eight year old murder, and another corspe that has been found.Kinsey is working hard to put the puzzle together but not without some dangers along her way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing Mystery","review":"I enjoyed this murder mystery.

She is a hard-boiled private investigator in the mold of Marsha Muller's Sharon McCone. In this book she is approached by Nikki Fife who has just been released from 8 years in prison for the murder of her womanizing, ex-husband Laurance. Plenty of people had a motive for murdering him and Nikki plans to find out who really murdered Laurance. Kinsey works her way through a series of Laurence's business associates, past lovers, and their husbands as she seeks the murderer. Two new murders occur and the plot thickens as Kinsey investigates while wondering if she is next on the hit list. Kinsey is a no-nonsense, independent woman who is wary of emotional entanglements, yet somehow vulnerable through it all. This whole series is recommended for mystery fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"A-Z with Sue Grafton","review":"I have now read a number of Kinsey Millhone mysteries.

Not enough character development & too many characters made for a rather slow-paced and dull book. I would at least like to care about the characters - especially if they're going to live or die. In this case, none mattered. You never felt anything towards them. I found Kinsey very boring. Characterize her a little more, Ms. Grafton if you want us to care.

Our heroine detective, Kinsey, who is self-assertive, self-reliant, self-willed and self-important, is not attractive at all.

This book sets a groundwork for the later novels and gives some basic insight into Millhone's motivations which are expounded in later novels.

Nikki maintains her innocence and wants Kinsey to find the real killer--eight years after the murder.

Kinsey is an especially memorable detective. She's tough and no-nonsense, but still has her vulnerable points. She's smart, but not a superwoman; rather, a believable, down-to-earth heroine.The matter-of-fact narration is very effective. We get insights into Kinsey's detection technique along the way.

In the first of the Kinsey Millhone mysteries Grafton introduces her female detective through an investigation of a murder case closed eight years before. While the plot is interesting, the brevity of the novel leaves the narrative feeling underdeveloped. The characters are intriguing, but the ease with which Millhone forms relationships with other characters is grossly unbelievable, creating the sensation that the reader has walked in mid-story, missing a great deal of background. While 'A' is for Alibi is not terrible on its own, the Kinsey Millhone series is one that improves greatly as it progresses."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book!

This was published in 1982. I just went back to it after \\"P is for Peril\\" and the writing is undated (I noticed the exact same simile about the sea looking like a ribbon stiched to the sky, the penchant for describing every building in detail, and the lack of detail about guns).

It reminded me of Nikita because of the premise. Of course, this movie came out before Nikita."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fight scenes, very little noticeable wire-fu...","review":"Most of us watch action movies to see action. This one delivers in spades. The reality and cruelty of the training is a refreshing change from most candied US offerings. The fight scenes were choreographed expertly and rival Matrix special effects. Maggie Q has such charisma that she draws you into the movie and you can't stop watching it. There's a scene where she's dancing for her victim and she takes off her underwear. Then she tries to kill the guy but he knows in advance and gets the jump on her. The fight that ensues has her twirling and jumping all over the place yet her slip never goes high enough to reveal the goods. Is it CGI or just masterful camera angles? I don't know, but it makes for some teasing fun. If you have doubts rent it first and see for yourself. I enjoyed it though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexy Asian Babes, Kung-Fu & Some Gun Violence","review":"My Tittle says it all, If you like these 3 things than this is the dvd for you.

Does rip off La Femme Nikita a little but in that movie the trainees were not all female & did not have to kill each other to stay alive"},{"rating":"1","title":"Expect the least and maybe you'll enjoy this","review":"If you know what to expect from this silly film, namely, almost no naked girls, extremely idiotic dialogs, a flunking script, and flunking acting, you might just enjoy it. It did remind me of Charlie's Angels, esp. in style, but I found it much less entertaining and enjoyable than the silly-but-cool Charlie's Angels.Thirty minutes into the film, one of the orphan girls opines \\"This is total BS. It was BS from day one.\\" This pretty much sums up the film, which proves that attractive and fairly talented actors or actresses don't necessarily know how to act, esp. when the script is a total joke."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guilty Pleasure","review":"Granted, this movie is far from being one of the best. The acting is poor, the effects are a bit cheesy, and the plot is...wait there is a plot? Bottom line, I rated it more because it was simply entertaining to watch. There are beautiful girls, disturbing sexual scenes, and murder.

The only good thing about this movie is some of the fighting sequences. The lead actress (Maggie Q) is beautiful, but she and the rest of the cast can't certainly not help the bad movie script from the director. The story doesn't make any sense. Everything is so illogic. My friends and I had a good laugh at this movie but seriously, it's really a bad movie overall.If you are looking for a great Hong Kong/China/Asian movie, I will recommend these instead: \\"The Twin Effect (Vampire Effect)\\", \\"So Close\\", \\"Shaolin Soccer\\", \\"Hero\\" and \\"Infernal Affairs\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hilarious!!","review":"I don't know if this movie was intended to be funny but it was.

I connected especially with the stories set in my own backyard, like Heliotrope Ridge that I've ventured out on. It is so easy to imagine spontaneously sliding down an inviting snowy hill into an unseen crevace.

Here, the comedic touches can be a bit broad when they happen. The period film is also informed by a late 60's viewpoint. The most jarring thing for me is the music score, as the theme song and most of the incidental music is too modern for a film set in 1912. Well photographed in the Senegal, though.In addition to the topless bathing scene by Andress when they are on the run, there is also a topless group dance scene by the Senegalese early in the picture at Kramer's party to introduce the final form of the diamond after cutting."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hitchiker 1953","review":"Don't waste your money!

However, there is one incident that must be corrected. On page 36, D'Souza writes, 'On that momentous day in 1980, Nancy was given the honor of telling her husband that he had won. Mr Reagan sighed deeply and said, 'I am truly humbled.'' That's not quite the way it went. During a conversation I recently had with Nancy in the mosh pit at an Eminem 'concert', she was adamant that Ron had actually spluttered, 'Me? President of the United States? That's fantastic!

It elucidates the great changes that occured throughout the 1980's, allowing unprecedented expansion. The economy has, since 1983 faced continued growth and expansion of wealth with the exception of only one moderate recession. Since then, despite Clintion's massive tax increases there has been little sign of economic distress in the US. Reaganomics worked, and this book proves it. It depicts the fallacies of the left in attempting to palm the budget deficits entirely off on Reagan and declaring the 80's a \\"decade of greed\\". Congratulations to Mr. D'Souza in portraying Reagan as a leader worthy of a place in history next to Washington and Lincoln."},{"rating":"2","title":"To understand Reagan, read this book!","review":"A concise, accurate, and easily understandable book of what Ronald Reagan's presidency was all about. Read this book if you need a little bit of inspiration and hope about the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Manual For Great Leaders","review":"The obvious is revealed by Mr. D'Souza - Ronald Reagan is perhaps the greatest president of the 20th Century. When the century is over, it will be Ronald Reagan's legacy that will tower as a Collosus over the free world. It's a shame so many of our leaders are nothing but opinion poll takers. Ronald Reagan would never be accused of such weakness in times that required leadership and character, and not the personal self-interest of just doing or saying anything to get re-elected. Anyone aspiring to hold a public leadership position is highly encouraged to read and learn from this book. And if you are in a position of leadership....read \\"How and Ordinary Man Became and Extraordinary Leader\\" and weigh yourself in the balance with Ronald Reagan.

I was an admirer of Ronald Reagan, and I don't think this book gives him enough credit. I don't like the writer's style: his logic is difficult to follow sometimes, and he goes off on tangents instead of focusing on Reagan. He describes Reagan as a President that no one liked; this is NOT true!!Furthermore, I don't care for some of his (the author's) biased viewpoints that he threw in, like about the Vietnam War; they have no place in a book that is discussing the Life of Reagan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tastes Great, Less Filling","review":"This book is a classic example of hagiography. There's a lot of unadulterated praise here. A lot of it! But, there's very little real substance. I want to read about Ronald Reagan's life, not sing his praises from the highest mountaintop.

D'Souza's Reagan is the perfect embodiment of the \\"Morning in America\\" image that the Reagan Administration tried to project, but it bears little resemblance to who Ronald Reagan really was.Revisionist history, whether it be on the right or the left, is almost always bad history. Dinesh D'Souza's biography of Ronald Reagan is a classic example of right-wing revisionist history, and like other works of revisionism, it is bad history.If you like the fantasy image of Reagan, then this book is for you.

D'Souza's book merely perpetuates the myth that Reagan was a great man and some sort of knowledgable statesman, and the Reagan fans who wish it were so eat it up like pablum.In truth, Reagan had been a shill for corporate America ever since his B movie career collapsed in the early 1950s. His entire political philosophy was based upon variations of the same stock speeches that were written for him during his days as a spokesman for GE in the mid '50s. Rather than a life of \\"extraordinary leadership,\\" Reagan was a skilled practitioner of political mountebankery.Hardly something or someone to look up at with unadulterated admiration.

It takes the interesting tack of defending him not only from the left, but also conservatives who thought RR was too soft on Gorbachev, etc. As good as it is, D'Souza's RR is nearly perfect. D'Souza concedes nothing in this no-hold barred thesis (it is NOT a comprehensive biograhpy by any means) and that may weaken his points just a little bit, hence 4 rather than 5 stars...his explanation of why RR is so hated in academia may help explain the bile of the reviewer from Temple Univ below who obviously couldn't stand RR."},{"rating":"2","title":"In depth, and amazingly on target.","review":"This is an amazing book about the life and Presidency of Reagan.

In other words, the work will examine Reagan's place in the political history of post-war America, since few of us care about his days as an actor. D'Souza's book, however, is not scholarly, but rather is the purely ideological product of a rightwing think tank publicist. Reagan would make a fascinating study for a scholar, since he was so patently second-rate that many of us have absolutely no idea how anyone could take him seriously. The scholar's job, though, is not to write hagiography or demonology, but to write something that will enlighten all of us on a subject. D'Souza's book is brown-nosing propoganda and nothing else.

A mixture of intellectual comedy and haunting clarinet that seemed to highlight the synergistic nature of comedy and tragedy. It was the start of my fanaticism with the art of stand up comedy... a journey that would inspire awe and curiosity of those brave enough to take the mic. This book aims to address the many questions and in a way dispel the mysticism of stand up comedy, which Franklyn has done brilliantly through his introduction and a collection of star studded Q&A interviews he's conducted over the years. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in comedy and especially those pursuing comedy as a craft. It stands well above any other instructional on the topic that I have found so far. Five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!!","review":"Of all the comedy books I own, this has truly been not only the most helpful for a comedian, but also the most entertaining because of the comedians interviewd. Franklyn Ajaye asked all the questions anyone would want to know who's considering a career in stand-up comedy and also tells you the major elements that make a good comedian.

They take you into the backwoods, hills, and farms, not just the charming ocean villages. Only about 1/4 of this book is recipes. But when you come away with a \\"feel\\" for a region and not just a laundry list of recipes, you have a larger experience than just food. I wish more regional cookbooks gave you this kind of glimpse into the region. Despite all of this, I think there could have been more recipes. I learned so much about Liguria from this book.

Bruce & Terry owed a lot to the Beach Boys, whose California sound is closely followed on many of these tracks. In fact, there are three Beach Boys covers here. And ironically, Bruce himself later joined the Beach Boys. Terry later went on to be a successful producer, most notably for the Byrds & Paul Revere and the Raiders. This CD should appeal to fans of the California sound. Bruce & Terry aren't the Beach Boys, heck, they aren't even Jan & Dean, but they succeeded in making some fun records."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book made me an instant Peter F Hamilton fan!","review":"I've always loved the genre of science fiction loosely called cyberpunk, dealing with a dark future of societal collapse where humanity is a quality that is no longer taken for granted, and so my husband picked this book up, thinking I might like it. I loved it! Greg Mandel is not a stereotypical cyberpunk hero, his internal conflicts go beyond whether or not the girl he's sleeping with is a threat to his career or not, he is a thinking person's cyberpunk.

The plot does not immediatley pick up, but if you stick with it for a little bit you won't be sorry! The story is interesting and engrossing, and follows a logical (but not boring) course throughout the first half of the book.

Every song is amazing but especially \\"Max Says\\" and \\"I Must be Hateful\\".

R.I.P. Derrick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great release","review":"This album came to my surprise to be one of lagwagon's greatest.A few songs start slow and all of a sudden burst into energetic bliss. This band is not like most of the newer bands that just became main-stream and tend to claim to be punk (e.g. Good Charlotte). The major difference is that they will never come close to the energy that is held in these songs. Also all those other bands will never have the thought that is put in these brilliant songs. This is a must buy for any lagwagon fan, or someone searching for a fun band.Favorite Songs:(*\\"Never Stops\\")(\\"E Dagger\\")(\\"Billionaire\\")(\\"Burn\\")"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD Rocks!","review":"This is an absolutley awesome CD.

Only getting into punk recently i thought id just buy this cd without any expectations. After just 3 listens i was hooked on this cd. It has everything, fast riffing, melody - all the songs are awesum. The first 5 songs are the best i think. \\"Falling apart\\" is the best, and has very clever lyrics.

It's great that bands like Lagwagon still strive to keep punkrock highly energetic ... keep it up Lagwagon! Perhaps Fat Wreck should release Chris Shiflett's solo album which Joey Cape has a copy of it seems..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The good times can't last forever","review":"This is when Lagwagon really started to get generic. I think Joey just ran out of ideas. And most other Fat Wreck bands also sound generic now, buy ANYTHING from Lagwagon before this, and it will sound worlds better. And don't buy resolve either, it sucks. I'm so sad that Lagwagon had to take this path in their musical career. Hopefully, Joey will at least try to write a good song soon. And I also hate the production because it sounds so polished that it hurts my ears.

It is too expensive.\\"Hello? Can you spell \\"Internet?\\" \\"Email?\\" \\"Digital?\\" None of these terms are heard anywhere in the program. The liner notes give a code for entry into the author's website for (I quote) \\"Specific Action items, references and other goodies... available only to you.\\" I hoped that the CD was just a license for the real substance.

I couldn't get it to play in my car (which is where I like to listen to audio CD's), and her voice is not pleasant to listen to. Also, I just didn't find the content of her CD to be all that useful.I guess I should have known that Ms. Sullivan couldn't pass on real trade secrets in a mere hour. It seems to me that she just wants to sell her consulting services. Or maybe the \\"Marketing Strategies\\" in this CD are just out of date, more suited to the twentieth century.Either way, I bought a promise that just doesn't deliver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Web of Deceit","review":"Although this is a fairly simple mystery to solve from the audience point of view, this made-for-TV courtroom drama is nothing short of entertaining. Linda Purl is great as the respected Atlanta defense attorney who goes home after several years to defend an obviously falsely-accused-of-rape teen. There, she rekindles an old relationship with a high school lover who turns out to be the D.A. who is opposing her. Mysterious coincidences and excitement ensues. A nice cast and witty script, filled with some audience involving atmosphere, etc. help to make this an excellent murder-mystery with a rather expected twist but still shocking nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Suspenseful","review":"This glacially-paced \\"suspense\\" drama set in Atlanta was anything but suspenseful. While waiting for the plot to advance, it was fun to listen to Linda Purl lose her Southern accent when she got agitated. Also fun to see the sexy James Read do something other than sidekicks. But it was clear who the killer was from the first time we met him, and the ending of the movie is a grand disappointment! Not even any lovely shots of Atlanta. Two stars (both for Read) is generous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad it was cheap...","review":"Was a stocking stuffer gift so not a big deal.

Her first venture without the backing of Incognito and she not only nailed it shut, she buried it deep, dug it up and flung it out the ballpark! That's how serious it is! Her version of EWF's \\"Head to the sky\\" is enough to make one run and buy this CD, yet if you're still unsure, her duet with Will Downing on the brassy, latin tinged tune \\"Simply Life\\" is enough to make you leap before looking!

If you're interested in finding out about his working methods and his 'philosophy,' I would urge that this is likely the best place, in print, to check. The format, mainly, is unadulterated- colloquial question and answer with Kubrick. The interviews cover a wide scope (particularly the 1968 playboy interview). The book contains no interviews from the period of \\"The Shining\\" and none from \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" since he hadn't time to give any.

So what about the casual Rabbit in the Moon fan, who hasn't heard many of these songs? I enjoyed the Floorida remix album as well as some other remixes RITM has done, but have yet to attend a live show of theirs. Therefore, coming into this album without any pretenses, I am pleased to say it is just what I was hoping for. Dark and deep, juicy with their signature tech/electro sound. This album really doesn't leave anything to be desired, especially with the vocals by Bunny. I think for the casual listener who hasn't heard all of these songs, this album will be a better experience. Still, even for those who have heard and seen it already, isn't it great to finally have all of the original material all on one remastered disc, plus an amazing DVD?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappionting Effort from one of my Most Anticipated Albums!!","review":"I have been eagerly awaiting this release from RITM for well over 5 years, and I have been greatly let down. The name of the album is appropriate because the material seems dated, as if it was made over a Decade ago. In the nineties this probably would have been a great album. Of course, there are several great tracks but the old. Overall the album lacks creativety and versatility. However, I did give the album two stars for the addition of the DVD, which is well worth the purchase...too bad there live performances do not translate to CD. If you're new to RITM, I would recommend this CD, but if you are like me and seen the live and know the material get it for the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"this review concerns the dvd. i bought this for the dvd hoping that i would get a live RITM performance. unfortunately, there are only a few songs performed live. the rest are more like music videos shot inside a dark room with some lights. these videos are not performed live but instead just go along with the studio mix of the song. bleh. most everything that is so great about RITM is the experience of seeing them live with thousands of screaming fans. the few tracks that are actually done this way, are outstanding. i would love to know why their entire performance was not captured. check out the ULTRA music fest 2004 dvd and get most of the live material that is on this RITM release, and in addition you will get many other performance from the top djs in the scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"RECYCLED DECADE","review":"I hate this because I am a great fan . . . but I have to admit that these guys haven't really done much lately.Their shows are AMAZING!

As The Weird Travel On is, in most respects, better than Fearless. The band retains its perfect balance between speed and power, rage and melody, aggression and composition. But it also expands upon the complex songwriting of Fearless and Supernatural Addiction. This is, I think, death metal in one of its most evolved forms. Great work, guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ecstatic, Period.","review":"Well, I don't think all of the songs on this CD are great.

One is 'the onlything she needs' by UK (79 Danger money), and 'Canti e Suoni'. Generally I don't buy a CD only for a song or two but this was a true exception.

The tools and ideas presented in the book are a great addition to Microsoft's online help.I think that one nice thing to have added to this book is for every example done in VBScript, the same example should have been provided in JScript (and vice versa).

First, the retail price of $17.98 for the Miracle Pictures DVD is absurd. Their DVDs are typically sold in dollar stores and mostly feature battered public domain prints; I picked mine up in Kroger's baked goods aisle for a dollar. Second, the title cards are read by Jacqueline Lovell, a one-time \\"adult\\" movie actress (\\"I Cream on Jeannie\\"). I mean no disrespect at all, since she has moved on to minor roles in mainstream movies, but I am certainly curious about how she wound up reading in both this and \\"The Patchwork Girl of OZ\\" DVDs at the same time she was working in adult films under the name Sara St. James. For the record, her voice is extremely well-recorded and on good stereo system she seems to be in the room with you. I think she does a fine job in a rather superfluous assignment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you think this is.","review":"This is not what I was expecting it to be. I'm not sure where they got this wizard of OZ from. I was expecting the traditional one, but it was not, thank goodness it wasn't expensive!

My little girl was Dorothy and her dog was To To so we really wanted the familliar version and this did not work out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long to ship","review":"I purchased a music cd.

The presentation of materials is excellent, although sometimes boring by explaining very basic Windows general application instructions, like how to maximize and minimize windows. I am especially impressed by examples, with a lot of screenshots. Overall, this is one of the finest books in PSpice. The CD-ROM (included) has all examples used in the book, as well as some extra library files, and the evaluation version of PSPice itself. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"~ buyer beware ~ Just for show item ~","review":"This is a \\" only for looks \\" item. It is not very warm. I put this as a decorative piece over my feather blanket. It does have some discoloration. It looks like it has sat in the sun for a while. The upc regular price is $99.99 not $150.00 as stated. It does come with flyaways that need to be trimmed. Do not pull them the material on top is nice loking but will tear or fray if pulled. I doubt this will make it out of the washer...Much less the dryer. Becareful with the bed skirt it is so thin it needs to be placed in place do not pull it or you will tear it in half. Also you will need to order the next size or bigger. The Californis King I ordered barely fits over the top of my full size bed. This is not children friendly.

The author breaks no new ground here, except to show convincingly just how spiritually empty the New Spirituality is. Her musings on abortion, men, and Christians are particularly off base and misinformed. She consistently illustrates intellectually flawed 60's/70's liberal reasoning--dream up an opinion based on your feelings, then hunt desperately for some kind of proof to back it up. I was looking for Erma Bombeck with a 90's edge, but all I got was juvenile self-absorption. Very disappointing, lacking in true depth, and not very funny. This book was returned in disgust.

The reviews were grand, people loved it. And being a southerner, I thought I would just naturally enjoy it. NOT.Lucy Marsden is pitiful, her aged loony-tune husband is pitiful, and the other characters are no better. The stabs at comedy in this book were lost on me; I found the whole thing grim and depressing. And it's LONG and grim. Talk about diarrhea of the word processor.I am an avid reader and I enjoy ALL kinds of books, but I could never, ever recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good period piece","review":"This book nicely outlines the drama of human interaction against a rich background of relationships and changing times.

Ditto to what other reviewers have said about the bogged-down prose style, plus several other serious flaws, including but not limited to:characters that are developed at ponderous length and suddenly disappear, never to be heard from again; the incomprehensible pattern of events which the narrator chooses (giving us every random detail for about a 12-year period and then skipping over a whole lot of stuff that would have been nice to know); stomach-churning prissiness that attempts to pass as womanspeak (\\"I then scolded my prettiest girl for lisping so\\"), and a burning-of-the-plantation scene that is laughably stupid as well as flat-out physiologically impossible. Not for the literate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just tell the story and get it over with!","review":"Ordinarily I love a novel I can settle down and read - something really engaging.

This is a great stoller. My son is comfortable in this system and the wheels are different from regular plastic wheels that come standard on travel systems the wheels on this system are rubber which gives it a smoother ride.It's easy to collapse and although it is a bit bulky it's worth it for the comfort of my son.I also like that you can use it for up to 30lbs not the typical 22lbs, of course your not going to carry a 30lb child in a car seat but you wouldn't carry a 22lb baby in a car seat either...Basically my review is.. This is a great stoller and the car seat is a great product too... The Evenflo stroller was a crappy stroller and their customer service was \\"Horrible\\". I would not encourage you to buy an Evenflo...Hope this helped"},{"rating":"2","title":"CONVENIENCE","review":"It's a great combination with the carseat (new model goes up to 30lbs). We returned the Eddie Bauer travel system for this very efficient combination. It's very stylish, too. The only problem is the canopy. It's not a very functional design.

It was SOOOOOO easy and it took no time at all. I love the storage spaces for the child and the parent along with the cup holder. I absolutely love the one hand gravity fold. My old stroller you had to use both hands to make it catch in order to fold. I really didn't think the stroller was that heavy. I guess I am use to my old one.

Each song from this album, and their video, creates and recreates a lyric and musical odyssey. The artist, here as work, voice and image, floats through situations and keen life experiences to cover controversial topics: immigration, homophobia, the power of the word, love and enmity. Up to now, no one in the Spanish contemporary musical realm had put forward his ideas -musically and visually- with such conceptual simplicity and his artistic maturity as Bosé. I have my own questions, though I do not want to sin as a gossip: Why the symbol of a red cross? Could those rumors be true? What has motivated the artist to create a new closely personal manifesto? But, who am I, crapy mortal, to question God's manifestations in the creativity of a human.

In addition to thoroughly covering Premiere, there are general sections related to video, such as Frame Rate, Time Code, Interlacing, Aspect Ratios, etc..It should be noted that this book is NOT a step-by-step tutorial to teach you Premiere. It works as a reference manual, and does that job admirably. Although one could probably learn Premiere with this book, for beginners I would recommend Adobe's Classroom in a Book series and/or the tutorials that ship with Premiere.Overall, an outstanding book and an excellent value. ...END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful","review":"I found the book hard to read and to follow, unless you already know how to use the program. It states the information in a way that reviews the procedures in a dry format, which is fine if you using the book with a Premiere course.The book needs to do a better job at grounding the reader about the world of DV. It doesn't so I was confused as I was trying to understand the content. Big ideas need to be discussed, then discuss the details.I decided to buy some video tapes on the topic, which were amazing. Maybe a program such as Premiere is difficult to learn from a book. I have read many computer books, which have helped me with other non-video editing programs. I guess this program is just hard to teach through a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Premiere 6 for Macintosh & Windows","review":"After struggling with the program and the manual, I bought this and another book.

The other book will probably be returned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for beginners.","review":"Having a considerable amount of experience with other non-linear editing programs but no real experience with Premiere, I picked up this book to try out the program. Within an hour I had my DV cam hooked up and controlled by the computer; within four hours, I had completed my project and dumped it all back to DV tape, a half-hour long program edited to the minute. Without this book I would've been stuck. The only improvements I would suggest would be more in-depth demonstrations, but for first-timers, it's a must-have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unavailing and seemingly deliberately complex","review":"As another reviewer said, the structure is not logical, e.g., capturing video is at the end of the book, when it needs to be at the beginning. The author steadfastly recommends using the single-track, rather than the far more intuitive and simple-to-use A/B roll method of editing, forgetting that anyone buying a beginner's book on Premiere is just that...a beginner! Why not make it as easy as possible? His approach offers no real advantage.

Moreover, the soundtrack is wretched 80s synth sounds punctuated by a cacophonous Michael McDonald tune that plays over the credits. It's also a boring, pointless film and a challenge to watch so much talent return so little; almost as if no one tried very hard. Easily the worst performance I've seen for Donald Sutherland. On the other hand, Wallace Shawn and Sean Penn are quite good.

Bill's sound here is simple, but not simplistic. He finds a simple beauty in stripping down his sound and lyrics to what they need to be and no more and telling stories that seem straightforward yet profound. This particular album has some country sounds added to it, but they don't feel out-of-place against his laconic vocals and you don't need to know (or like) country music to like this album.

This is by far the best (Smog) album that I've heard. Think Leonard Cohen meets The VU w/a touch of beautiful pedal steel over the top of it all. This album really is amazing and it embraces all of the different stylings that Bill Callahan employs throughout all of his works. From violent pop songs set over a cheary beat (ala Ex Con), to the isolated and introspectiveness w/a gritty sense of humor (es Stranger). This album really hits home. The one thing that may annoy new comers to this album is the heavy handedness of all the symbolism that reoccurs throughout the album. To me it's perfect but to others it can possibley ware you down.

Of course, he blames the usual suspects and even throws in a few more (such as the trend of people dressing \\"down\\" for Mass. Come on)! What Groeschel ultimately wants, it seems, (though his confused style makes it hard to discern) is a \\"ghetto\\" Church (and at one point he actually defends this desire).

The story itself is an interesting one, as a psycologist has to question everything he has learned, including his own sanity to work out the puzzle of a woman who does not fit anywhere.The story rambles along, I found it a bit slow. What was interesting is that it is like a testing ground for other Brunner novels. I can see shades of _Times without a number_ and _Children of the Thunder_ in this book. I am not sure which books came first, but the other two carry their ideas across better.Once again, Brunner is guilty of pulling the rabbit out of the hat with his endings. The ending is not so much of a twist but more a totally different road!Not Brunner at his best, but a good one to get if you like Brunner's stories, similar to the early pencil sketches of a painter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dallas - Cheese on a Monday","review":"It goes to show you, people are going to have different opinions.

After the strong ending to the first set, I was hoping that the energy would continue to the second set, but I just didn't seem to happen.If you're buying the whole series, and you have to have this show, by all means, don't let me stop you. If you were there, and you liked the show, buy it.

Horney repeats herself over and over again. The entire 380 page book could easily be condensed into a single chapter. Many of her ideas are so integrated into modern thought (ie self-realization, tyranny of the should, alienation from self) that it is difficult to fully appreciate her originality today. As a piece of intellectual history, it makes interesting reading. But in terms of clinical relevance, its usefulness is quite limited. I, too, chose to read this because Yalom wrote in \\"Gift of Therapy\\" that he found it one the most helpful therapy books during his training.

The CISA Review Manual, MicroMash and Exam Cram 2. Of the three the Review Manual was probably the most complete, but the Exam Cram 2 re-organized the materials better and made better connections between the information and real life. MicroMash was just too dense for my tastes. As a recommendation I would have to say for those of you planning to take the December test: get both the CISA material AND the Exam Cram 2 book. Read the section in the CISA book and then read the corresponding chapter in the Exam Cram 2. It really helps. I passed."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK","review":"The actual test and this book are poles apart. The book, practice questions and the simulated test makes you feel like you know what you need to know for the test. But the actual test is a lot different (I would not necessarily say \\"difficult\\"), but reading this book is almost a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"CISA Exam Cram 2: Certified Information Systems Auditor","review":"Though I did have a financial internal audit background, I did not have a technical IS background or education.

I would highly recommend the use of the text as it was a definite help in my preparation efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Limited","review":"Short and simple, this book is a bad buy. It does not provide enough detail to answer the test questions. The test is extremely difficult and this book provides aid for only 10% of the test questions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful material","review":"This book is a great piece of review material for the CISA exam, but I would not use it as your only piece of study material. I would advise that one get this book as a review guide prior to taking the test as a refresher, but use one of the other books on the market to build their initial knowledge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Medicore at best.","review":"This will help you understand a few key points that the Isaca material fails to do on any points. I hope that Allen Keele's boot camps are more in depth than this book. The sad part is that this is one of the better study materials out there. I hope someone can produce a book for 2006 that matches Isaca test objectives...in a nutshell this book is way to shallow to condsider for serious study preperations."},{"rating":"1","title":"only mediocre","review":"This book was a disappointment. When answering the practice quesitons, if you got it wrong, the software just parroted back the question in the form of a statement. No explanation, no reference back to the book. The book is only mediocre itself, sometimes poorly written, and very poorly edited. Unfortunately, it's better than the CISA Review Manual, which is itself just terrible, full of grammatical and spelling errors and atrocious writing. For those taking the June 2006 exam, I hope something better comes out in early '06!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Explinations lacking","review":"After the long awaited Exam Cram 2 was finally published I was very happy to receive the book. I installed the SW on my computer with no trouble. The trouble came when I took the practice exams. When questions were explained as to why that particular answer was right, all it did was read the right answer back to you, there was no further explanation to help you understand. All in all I was disappointed with this book. If the author had explained the subject matter more I would have liked the book more, but I don't feel like it helped me at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Believe the Hype","review":"I couldn't believe this book received more than 4 stars. Or 2 stars for that matter, which I think it warrants.Yes, it provides a good overall picture of what day-trading is and would be a superb book for the beginning practitioners who wants a better picture of the background of day-trading. But if you're looking for trading ideas and strategies, my advice is to skip this book. The chapter on technical analysis is flawed. There were a variety of charts which looked good on paper, but that was with the benefit of hindsight. In practice those analysis would never have been possible.There's too much at risk if you put your money on the line using the trading ideas here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth it if...........","review":"It is worth it's weight in gold if you really understand position sizing and exit strategies. If you don't really know yourself and the rules of the game daytrading will deplete your bank account really fast. Read Trade Your Way to Financial Freedom , by Dr. Van Tharp one of the orginal Market Wizards and you'll understand what I'm talking about. Daytrading increases your opportunities but if you do the classic mistakes you be the 90% who lose money daytrading. If you really understand the rules you'll be the 10% who makes all the 90% losses. I have been trading professionally for about 6 years now and this can give you some ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate info!","review":"This book tries to cover a wide range of subjects in one go. It could have been useful for the *complete* beginner, if only the information given did not include so many factual errors. Get separate books for each of the various subjects you have to study: execution systems (ECN's, SOES etc), technical analysis, money management. Do not believe that one simple book will make it for you. You have to work hard before you are able to play the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Background info on day trading and never takes off","review":"This is a book written at a time when Nasdaq was very close to its pinnacle in 1999. Not from hindsight (of the index level today), but sheerly by content, the book is full of flaws in nearly every topic it covers, especially those on Technical Analysis. Facts, and pure facts were abundant. However, trading system, strategy and insight were in short supply. The authors might have been so optimisstic and carried away by the beautiful picture they painted about trading in Nasdaq that money management and discipline had rarely been mentioned, and the \\"real tactics for real profits anytime anywhere\\" on the front cover were by and large absent.p.s. This book contains the highest number of cartoon (eight) in those trading books I ever read. Sadly, most were drawn with one single theme, that \\"Day Trading would annihilate the brokers\\". That should have implied something about the direction and quality of the book, which I had mistakenly ignored."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best on day trading basics.","review":"This is the my very first review on any trading book.For a year now i've been studying the markets with regards to day trading and technical analysis.I have studied page to page all the hyped books.Some 30 of them. Some of them were of great value indeed. But this one i wish i had read at the very beginning of my journey. The writing is clear and most importantly, specific. These two authors can communicate to the beginner the reality he is going to be faced with, once he opens his/her trading screen(and how to set the RT III up).In the jungle of computer trading this book gives you the confidence that with care and planning you can make it without being eaten alive. You also feel that the authors are not trying to sell you a service or a seminar as many others do through their books."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Review","review":"Electronic Day Trading To Win is a must read not only because it explains the necessary theories behing day trading, but it also shows you the road map to getting started in a very practical way. This book is both informative and enjoyable to read combining the most pertinent information with some profound and humurous commmentary. I give this book a strong buy recommendation!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-Traders Provide Garbled \\"Insight\\" Into Day trading","review":"This book is a must only if you crave erroneous information about day trading and investing.There is NOTHING useful or informative in this opportunistic publication.As a professional day trader i am stunned at the lack of knowlege not to mention insight(what a joke!)about short term trading.AVOID!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WORTHLESS","review":"What a joke. I have never read a book with more erroneous, misleading information. The only person who stands to make a dime from this waste of paper is the Author. Skip this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Buy","review":"Every one will love this book. After perusing numerous (and reading several) books on this subject, this is still my favorite. This book is an easy, lighthearted read; yet is full to the brim with all the necessary information. Everything the rank beginner needs to go forward with their new prospective career."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total waste of Money","review":"The authors engage in an endless discussion of irrelevencies. Not good work. A much better book is Strategies for the Online Day Traders by Gonzalez and Rhee, which is really fine work and a must buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I fell for it.","review":"With all the great ratings and rave reviews, I had to buy this book. After reading this book and it's collection of useless facts, it's obvious to me that these authors are NOT winning traders.Then I re-read the reviews, and I noticed how similar the language were. It is my humble opinions that the authors loaded the reviews here to entice us to buy the book.I have bought over 50 books, and this is ranked in the high forties. Don't get duped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising idea, but unsatisfying and meandering book","review":"The first half of this book gives an interesting, but repetitive, history of the number zero and its religious enemies. The second half of the book discusses the problems zero introduces in physics equations, from the birth of the universe to its death. The author is obviously enthused about mathematics, physics, and history. He has some cool ideas, but this book is not that great. It meanders and repeats itself. Plus the author shrouds the real content in too many unfunny puns about zero and infinity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good coverage, annoying style","review":"The book covers a fascinating subject in a fair amount of detail. However, if you prefer thoughtful and well-worded books, this one is NOT for you. The author has overloaded an otherwise interesting work with too many verbal embellishments and glib expressions."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"The writing style is the true star of this one, although the subject matter is also fascinating. The author creates a stunning picture of the complications wrought by first the lack of zero, and then later its presence. Seife gives a chronological development of mathematical thinking from the ancient world of sheep counting (when zero was \\"unnecessary\\") to the present day problems of astrophysics (where zero is a stubborn devil that can't be wished away). Sure to be stimulating for the interested reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read before Studying","review":"I wish I had read this book before I studied the Calculus. It certainly doesn't pretend to tell you how to do the calculations but it is a wonderful guide as to why you are doing them. In a subject where the details can be overwhelming, it can give you some understanding of where you are going.A beginning mathematics student could do much worse than read this book before starting to study."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Return to This Subject","review":"Seife has written a masterpiece with this one. I found it VERY easy to read and very insightful. It opened my mind to so many possibilities within mathematics (and also philosophy). I picked it up 4 years after completing my undergraduate work and it blew my mind. I have read countless books related to this subject and this remains one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Entertaining","review":"I am a math teacher and read this book on recommendation from a fellow math teacher. The book is well-suited for high schoolers (as far as concepts go), but can also be used in middle school. I start by saying that I find history, even the history of math, fascinating; my emphasis in teaching is on the \\"why\\" and often times, that answer is found in history or in the field of ethnomathematics. Not only is the book educational, it is extremely well written. Often times it is even funny. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in history or math."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reviewing: Zero (Seife)","review":"This book was splendid. Seife was one of those rare (but, thankfully, increasingly less rare as time progresses) writer-scientists who write about conventionally dry and largely unaccessible topics in a lucid, beautiful, elegant, and often entertaining way. Reading this book not only made me laugh out loud (a curious enough phenomenon for a book that has math as its premise) but increased my appreciation not only for the concepts but for literature. Seife belongs to the welcome order of writers of Alan Lightman (of Einstein's Dreams). This book is a lovely little gem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Topic, Poorly Written","review":"This book contains many interesting tidbits of information and a general timeline of the concept of zero that is intriguing. It is sometimes a battle to get through the author's meandering style and I was tempted to put the book down many times (but the information kept me reading). If the author took out all of the times he wrote something like, \\"but they didn't recognize the power of zero,\\" the book would be half it's size and much better for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good effort but falls apart","review":"This book is a historical survey of the origin and meaning of the number zero from ancient Babylonia to modern astronomy. It starts out well, but it begins to founder the closer it gets to modern applications of zero in both mathematics and applied sciences. By the time you reach the last chapter in the book, it's descended into a mess of overexuberant cliches and poorly written passages. It seems that the author is most comfortable with the early and medieval sections of his history, and he does a satisfactory job explaining how zero factored into the beginnings of calculus and the techniques of integraton. But the second half of the book doesn't come together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Distracting, confusing, bloated","review":"This book's discussion of the development of the zero-containing Arabic numeral system and the calculus are valuable examinations of modern mathematics and its sources. Too bad the reader has to wade through so much distraction to get to these nuggets of knowledge.The pages of this book are filled with strange non-sequiturs and philosophical wanderings that have nothing to do with the topic at hand. \\"Zero\\" also has a questionable, at best, sense of humor (did we really need so much detail on Martin Luther's constipation?). And the last third of the book, covering applications, physics and cosmology, should have been left out entirely-- it's confusing, incoherent and totally out of place in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"zero the biography of a dangerous idea","review":"excellent book! the book was described as used with the only wear or damage being a sticker adhered to one of the pages inside the book as the seller said it would be. other then that the book was in prisitine condition. i would buy from this seller again. honest and accurate seller. book came in a couple of days after i purchased it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Brief History of Time for the Number Zero","review":"One of my favorite re-reads is A Brief History of Time. This book now tops that list. Seife provides many provocative thoughts from the religious aspect of zero to the pure mathematical aspect. Like Hawkins, Seife keeps the amount of math knowledge to a minimum; however, the reader should be familiar with the phrase, \\"as the limit approaches zero\\" from an intro to calculus class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"I find the idea of this book very unique. There are a lot of things in this book, that I wasn't aware before, and I really enjoyed learning about them. However, despite my basic knowledge of the related fields of physics (amateur interest), I had difficulty in comprehending a few topics. Overall, I can say that I enjoyed the book and would like to congratulate the author for such a unique idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, interesting book!","review":"This is a two part book where the first half is about the history of zero and it's view through civilizations over time, and the second part is about the scientifical applications in modern physics and mathematics. It is well written and explain things in a clear and direct way, however it does not go very deep. Overall: GOOD"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of a kind","review":"Very enlightening, I couldn't put it down. People who love numbers will enjoy the numerical calculations. The ones who don't will easily understand. And when you finish reading it you will feel like you actually have learned something from it. Zero is not just another book!It should be required reading in schools."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and poorly argued","review":"A chore to make it through. Seife's account of the history of the acceptance of zero is mildly interesting, but very repetitive. Seife repeatedly makes value judgements and then doesn't justify them (For example, he complains many times about the damage that the exclusion of zero has done to the calendar, without ever going into detail about why anyone should care as much as he seems to about the supposed damage).Seife should have stuck to history though; his attempts to tie together disparate areas of physics with zero as rhetorical glue amount to little more than annoying handwaving."},{"rating":"2","title":"...","review":"Very good book. Entertaining and fun to read. Arrived is good time as well. Anyone who likes math will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nice History of a Strange Idea","review":"This book is about the strange and counterintuitive idea of zero. Most of us think we have a good understanding of zero until we are asked to explain its metaphysical implications. For example, try to answer the following grand question: how can something come from nothing? Ultimately, this book reminded me that the universe may not only be stranger than we imagine, but stranger than we *can* imagine.Overall, the author does a nice job of explaining the history of zero. WARNING: Parts of the book (especially in the second half) get fairly technical for those without a strong mathematics and physics background."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and fascinating story on the importance of \\"nothing\\"","review":"Excellent book so well written that you cannot stop reading it. A fascinating story of a number that has played such a big role in the development of the scientific thoughts. I never realized before the importance of zero probably because I thought that it was always there. This book tells a different story. The more you read about the resistance in the western societies to accept zero the more you realize that it was not just the number; it was the struggle between the dogmatic thoughts striving to freeze the world and the brilliant brains that have made the western civilization flourish."},{"rating":"2","title":"good way to learn some math history","review":"Never realized zero was such a big deal. Whole philosophy hides behind that little symbol. If your scientific minded at all, you'll enjoy the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"zero- the nothing or the infinite","review":"What a magnificient job Seife has done. From the elusive \\"nothing\\" to the imponderable \\"infinity\\" --he leads us step by step through the history of the concept. Recommended for all who are interested in learning.(no it is not more than you want to know) It is uncommon to find a mathematician with a sense of humor who can write. I am a retired research engineer from the aerospace industry and \\"zero\\" always gave me fits.Well done, sir."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zero","review":"A totally fascinating book. Debunks Aristotle and the West's rejection of the concept of the void and infinity. I already have someone who wants to borrow it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book for anyone with a passing interest in Math(s)","review":"Seife traces us back through time, touches on many, diverse, areas of mathematics and the politics they often shape. Can't recommend this enough as a gift to the geek in your life. Not terribly technical about anything in the book, and it's very easy to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The old merging of philosophy and math","review":"Not only has zero not always existed, numbers aren't quite as concrete as our math teachers would have us believe. Seife presents the entire history of counting and numbers before getting into the history, philosophy and theology surrounding the number zero (and frequently, infinity).It helps to be somewhat comfortable with mathematical concepts, but it is not mandatory at all. Nor is it mandatory to know much about Greek philosophy-and the two get about as much attention.This is an excellent and sweeping history of how religion has had to change itself because of the immutable idea of nothingness. This also goes into the history of physics, particularly quantum physics and string theory, and astronomy. This is because, in almost all situations, mathematical theorums work beautifully and explain nature and the cosmos-until you have to account for zero.Well writen and researched. Highly recommended for any level reader-layman or expert."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 for 0","review":"0 is a fascinating concept and an interesting number. It is well described by other positive reviews. It is a much better read and much better written and than Longitude or A History of Time. I was a bit disappointed when the author leaped from math to physics. While the former is pure the latter is an approximation. I was interested in the concept and the philosophy of 0 from a numerical perspective and did not find enough in the early chapters to be satisfying. Somehow, 0 showed up in India. Though I was disappointed with the leap to physics, it was logically very well presented to be enjoyable and understandable, I did learn a few things and it connected a few things up very well though there are a few leaps of faith. Good job Charles Siefe - enjoyed it a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good subject. Awful writing.","review":"Zero is an excellent subject for a book, but Charles Seife's hyperbolic writing style is distracting and borderline absurd. He traces the history of zero from the early days of Greece and Egypt, follows its eventual rise in number theory, and finishes with its involvement in superstring theory. It's a fascinating journey, but his use of language is so sophomoric and over-the-top that it drains the text of any real value. By employing bombastic phrases like \\"men feared the nothingness of zero!\\" and \\"zero and infinity, everything and emptiness!\\" on every page, Seife transforms his book from a serious undertaking on an intriguing number to mere satire. Unfortunately it's not funny, simply tedious.If you want to see how a good mathematics book should be written, try out \\"e: the story of a number.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"hilarious and true to life","review":"Every adult who I have shown this book to, has laughed out loud. Every parent or grandparent who has watched a toddler \\"fling\\" the gift on the floor to obtain the light, colorful, deliciously crinkly tissue paper, will enjoy this romp."},{"rating":"2","title":"The rhythmic words and bold illustrations are wonderful!","review":"My five month old daughter squeels with delight every time I pick up the book. She seems to enjoy the great illustrations and the way the words sound together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this cd","review":"I love Chelsea, and was initially excited when I found this cd of early material, but this cd is horrible. It's petty much made up of crappy quality demos. Really crappy quality demos! Now, there's a place for demo type material, such as those that appear as bounus tracks on the re-release of Chelsea's self titled 1st LP. Those demos are solid, raw sounding tracks that give the listener a feel for how the songs were shaping up prior to their final recorded versions.The demos on this cd, however, have the feel of versions that were so badly recorded that they resided on the cutting room floor until some schmuck decided to piece them toghether on this cd.I am usuall fairly forgiving of medocre cd's, but I bought this used at a local record shop and sold it back about a week later.Don't buy this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Dissapointed","review":"I had a newer project by Scott and bought two more of the older CD's to add to my collection. I wasn't dissapointed at all. Scott's songwriting and singing have always been impressive and there is an excellent mix of ballads and upbeat tunes on this CD. Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product..Good value","review":"I bought this because I saw it on a talk show, I researched this & found it to be very good for you& that it was the best price here than other places I checked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lobelia Extract is what you'll get","review":"I just ordered this product. When it arrived, I opened the box and took off the bubble wrap. The bottle I got was Lobelia extract! This herb is also known as Asthma Weed, Pukeweed, and Vomitwort... I don't think it will taste much like Cinnamon.The bottle ships in a bubble wrapped bag. The bag had a sticker for \\"Cinnamon Bark\\" on top of the correct sticker reading \\"Lobelia\\"... I would not order this item until Amazon fixes the warehouse stock labels!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid read","review":"This being the second book in the series you really get to know a little bit more about how things work in this world. It's interesting discovering all the politics and what powers are in play. While this book does still have its share of erotic scenes it was a breath of fresh air from the previous book that held far too many in my opinion. Looking forward to reading more books in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the plot?","review":"I knew I was in trouble when I had read over 150 pages, and Merry and her guards had been to a meeting--that's it. Hamilton used to write really different erotic horror novels, but both this series and the Anita Blake series have of late been suffering from severe plot anemia. Hamilton has fallen into the worst of writer's traps: she tells rather than shows. If you like reading detailed physical descriptions of beautiful and unusual men, you'll like Caress of Twilight just fine. Otherwise, my advice is to wait until this comes out in paperback. It's definitely not worth the price of the hardback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely boring","review":"Probably one of the most boring books I have wasted time on in recent times. No plot: casual sex that is justified in a puritanical way (we are only being naughty you see, because I want to get pregnant) is no substitute for a story. Endless repetitions of lengthy description - who is wearing what - or not (equally boring). Meetings of several factions without interesting dialogue. The monster and the solution at the end smack of jack hopping out from the box since a built up plot is missing. No excitement, nothing to hold my attention.Conclusion: One star because the system does not allow to give none. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"very much LKH","review":"After reading all the Anita Blake novels, I decided to follow along with the Merry books. I have almost an addiction to Ms. Hamilton's novels, regardless if I have become somewhat disenchanted with her Anita Blake series after about the eighth book.I found Merry to at least start out relatively page-turning and read \\"A Caress of twilight\\" in two days.The imagination LKH has is great, but the overabundance of sex can be a little overboard. I find myself sometimes skimming over pages to get past lines like \\"He rolled his eyes up at me while(something NOT G rated!)\\". At least I've found this series to have more plot than the last of the Anita series.Bottom line is if you are a fan of Anita Blake, then you will like Meredith Gentry, but these books are borderline soft porn and not for the fan of Harlequin Romances..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good enough to want to know what happens in the next book","review":"I found it to be slow at times, but very well written. I like the course the story takes and the fantasy world created. I can't wait to hear what happens in her next adventure."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time","review":"LKH let me down again. I second the opinions of sclark39 (a few reviews down) but I think I disliked it even more than that reviewer since I wouldn't even recommend the price of, or time wasted in reading, the paperback; however, I know Laurell's fans will ignore my remarks and some will probably even like the book. If you're new to LKH's work, I'd suggest her earlier Anita Blake works. Ms. Hamilton used to be my favorite author. She's been gradually replaced since the release of OBSIDIAN BUTTERFLY, my first disappointment. I thought, with the new Merry series, there was hope but, after this latest letdown, I'm convinced LKH has lost or, at the very least, misplaced her talent (temporarily I hope)."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least I got to the end of \\"Narcissus in Chains\\"","review":"I laughed so hard, I couldn't finish reading the book. Somehow, I don't believe that was the author's goal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantatstical","review":"This book lived up to its appeal. It kept with the storyline that A Kiss of Shadows started out with and it left me drooling for the third book in this series to come out. Laurell hasn't dissapointed me yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the paperback!","review":"Laurell K. Hamilton must have been rushed to get this one out. If you are a fan of hers, and I am, after having read this book you will understand. This book will make you think of a short story that has been added to (to fill in space), but nothing is added to the story. There are many, many, sex moments. The mirror is used in place of a telephone, and there are many, many repeated incidents of using the mirror. And the details of what every character is wearing, or may ever wear, at any given time is graphically and boringly repeated everytime the scene changes.I have been a LKH fan since her first book and hope that this is not a trend caused by becoming a bestselling author. But I would still buy the paperback!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow paced story","review":"The premise of this book (and its predecessor) is great: fairy princess as hardboiled detective in L.A. Her non-monogamous relationship with a variety of supernatural guardians is an interesting plus. However, this novel moves very slowly. It is painfully obvious that Ms. Hamilton is planning to stretch Meredith's story over a long series of books and is taking her time in doing so. It is awkward when a character in a book written in the first person stops to describe herself and her beauty in detail. There were too many scenes involving her sitting on the bed, in various stages of dress or undress, having magic mirror telephone calls. The actual plot of the novel was quite thin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been there, done that...","review":"\\"A Caress...\\" focuses more on Princess Meredith and her harem's relationships. The big bad thing doesn't come into play until about the middle of the book. Its defeat was anticlimatic.The book in general seems to set things up for the third book. I hope Ms Hamilton takes a break so that she can provide a fresh and suspenseful story in the third installment. Because \\"Caress\\" wasn't it. At the end of \\"A Kiss\\" I wanted to know what happens next - even though I feel Princess Meredith is just a revised version of the Anita Blake character from Hamilton's Vampire Hunter Series. However, at the end of \\"Caress\\" - I can't say that I care what happens.I'll keep my fingers crossed and wait very patiently (and hope it pays off) for the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"When is the next book?","review":"I had a hard time putting this one down. Ms. Hamilton has outdone herself with the newest edition to her new series. As a die-hard Anita Blake fan, I was a little trepidatious about this new series. I was plesantly surprised and continue to be so. I can't wait for the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO LAME ...","review":"This book was a disapointment I should have been prepared for. Like so many other authors who have gained popularity,Hamilton has succumbed to the lure of quick money. No story line ,no character developement, but plenty of sex. Not interesting sex, with tension between characters, but BORING partner rotation to service Merry. Hey!! Hamilton ,just because a guy has long hair, it dosen't make him sexy. Did you forget Jean-Claude and Richard??? I won't spend any more of my money on this..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Caress of Twilight (Meredith Gentry, Book 2)","review":"An adult fantasy world worthy of getting lost in. Well written with memorable characters, I read the entire series and look forward to the next installment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something's Missing......","review":"I've been a huge fan and follower of the Laurell K. Hamilton's work for several years. After reading the first book of this new series, I was looking forward to the next installment. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed with this book.As I read this book, I kept trying to figure out what was missing, then it finally hit me, the plot was missing! Most of the book consisted of their preparations, discussions and arguing. When the \\"big\\" fight seen did finally come, it was way at the end and quite anti-climactic.I'll probably try the next book in this series just to see if it improves. If not, I'll be sticking with my favorite heroine, Anita Blake."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Step Up, A Step Down","review":"Definitely better than NIC, but not quite up to par with the earlier books written by LKH. Has her popularity gone to her head? Lately, she relies on frequent, and pointless, sex to carry the plot, instead of having a real story going on. I've been reading her work since Nightseer. I'd hate to have to stop, but if the books don't improve, why waste the money? As is, I don't recommend buying this book in hardcover. Wait for the paperback, or buy it used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the plot?","review":"I'm a huge Laurel K. Hamilton fan and found this lacking a true plot. The politics and interplay of the guards were an interest but it soon became boring. The book did keep you turning the page just to see if a true plot and sense of direction would emerge, but it just never happened. Also what happened to some steamy sex scenes, and descriptions of outfits and nude bodies just wasn't enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"erotic suspense","review":"the 1st book i read of the series and my personal favorite mostly because we get to see a bit more of Doyle :) i am a sucker for the dark and broody hero..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Caress of Twilight","review":"Very intriguing. Kept me interested. Can't wait to read the next Meredith Gentry series. Going to buy right now! Awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too much sex, not enough story","review":"While I do not shy away from books with explicit sex scenes, I do get a little upset when it seems like Merry is bed-hopping all the time and the big bad monster just kind of dribbles in, battles, magic, end. All this book felt like was Merry having sex with this faerie, that faerie, multiple faeries, etc. I do like the court politics, how we got to see more interaction with her aunt, her uncle, and her mother, but if you cut out all the sex stuff, I felt like I'd have a book 20 pages long. I like the Faerie idea a lot though, and will continue reading this series, unlike the Anita Blake books, which I've frankly gotten tired of. Hopefully, next time Hamilton will pay more attention to story and include a little less play between the sheets."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Caress of Twilight","review":"Another disappointment from Laurell Hamilton! This is definitely not worth buying the hardcover...you can wait for this one in paperback! Lately, Ms. Hamilton's books are showing signs of being too popular. I can see an intent to draw out these stories - with each book only offering a peek into a few days - with an ending that implies that the reader must buy the next book. The mystery was not intriguing either, I fell asleep reading this one a number of times. Although the characters are basically the same (with many missing from this book by the way), the reader doesn't learn anything new about Merry and her beaus. Pity the reader that picks this book up before A Kiss in Shadows...they will be very confused. My only advice - wait for the paperback!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Whew!","review":"Poor Merry! She has to get pregnant in order to inherit the Unseelie Faery Court's throne. To hasten this along she has to sample all her bodyguards and do her day job of being a private detective. For some reason I just can't feel sorry for her :^). There's not as much action and tension as there was in the first book that's why 4 stars, but we do find out more about her knights, the Unseelie & Seelie Courts (two sides of the same coin), her relationship with her mother (no Mother's Day gifts will be sent to this mom!), and her powers. I feel as if it's just a step towards a bigger pay off in the next book, but definitely worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entralling","review":"Oh my goodness, can a series get any better. I do not know how I will be able to wait until the next book to come out! I would just like to say that I am a major Frost fan. My friend and I are betting between one another on who the lucky one will be. She is wanting Doyle, I want Frost. However, after the last few chapters in this book, I am also vying for Rhys. I would want Galen, and truly would, except he doesn't show the maturity. Oh my. I just want to tell everyone to read the book. Ten stars if possible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nagging me to review.","review":"It was good. I approve. I ordered the book, it arrived, I read it, the book was excellent. Its kind of hard to screw up an order like this, but the seller asked me to review it so I am. They did what they said they would do. I got a good book at a great price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Discrepancies in 'A Caress of Twilight'","review":"Bitterly, bitterly, bitterly disappointed.Page 3 still has the WRONG colors for Nicca, even after an assurance from the publisher that the errors in the ARC would be corrected before publication. The ARC was more of the same from the first Merry Gentry and the last Anita Blake. *sigh*Why should I waste my time and money on an author who can't be bothered to remember her own characters? And if the author's memory is that inept, shouldn't editors and proofreaders pick up on discrepancies?Will I read this hardback edition that I made a special trip to the bookstore for? Probably not. It's lying on the floor in a corner from when I flung it across the room at page 3.Sign me a disappointed, and vocal, FORMER fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Big Let-Down","review":"I couldn't wait to read one of Hamilton's books, as I had heard so many good things about her stories. I thought I would try her Faery World first as the Anita Blake series is very big and I am behind.I couldn't wait for this book to end. It had no plot and the characthers did nothing but sit around, or have sex. And I found the sex to be boring as well!Very good Idea that just did not pan out well. I may try another of her books, but so far I am not impressed. I felt like I was reading very bad fan fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"My Cat's neck completely healed. He had a reaction to a cleaning product. i would recommend this product.Thank you:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Recorded Live Show","review":"This is a real shame because there's some great material on here. Basically you can hear vocals and drums but the guitars are buried DEEP in the mix. Most of the material is taken from the fantastic and overlooked Frenz Experiment album. If you're a completist you may want it for the first song \\"Just Waiting\\" which is a cover that doesn't appear on any other release, as far as I know. It's a very poppy, lighthearted number with a very infectious melody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good questions !","review":"Very good but difficult questions. High-yield material, but some questions are too detailed. Long and good explanations. Consider this book only if you plan to start early."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is a great toy because it fells like the stuff animal is real because it is a electronic toy!!!

However, she loves it. It does not always respond to her voice, but she presses on its hand and it will always respond that way. Its little cheeks light up, otherwise, it is a very simple toy. It seems to say \\"picka\\" or \\"picachu\\" just enough for her to be able to imagine that it is real."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now We're Talking","review":"This is where Season 7 finally shines. These episodes are great. This was the boarder of the old toon switching formats into the Red Sky episodes. I loved this season because they focused on characters other then just Shredder and Krang. The stories also weren't bad at all. The Don disk has some great ones on it.This is worth it for sure. It's only 7 episodes again but they're good episodes. The only downside is the special features are still very bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad boy fever","review":"this show sends my bad boy fever in to overdrive. They picked a great cast.

One must go all the way to the beginning, watching each single one before starting to watch because it is a story line.

I cannot wait til the next season to start, so very addictive! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must see show!","review":"You have to watch all seasons. This show unravels into chaos, love, friendship, murder, aggression and much more. It will keep you wanting to watch episode after episode.

Totally worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Business As Usual","review":"Season 4 keeps up with all the brutality and 'I love you's of the first 3 seasons.

Kurt Sutter is a masterful writer; each episode leaves you thirsting for more, and Season 4 does not disappoint! The characters in this series are so flawed, the story line so deep, you can't wait for the next episode to see what's going to happen. Jax's journey is intoxicating--his internal conflict between what's right and wrong, his passion for SAMCRO and his family, his constant struggle between his loyalty to what he loves and his growing disgust from what he's learned--all make for such a complicated and, yet, addictive story. All of the actors in this series are amazing; they make their characters so believable, it's hard to remember it's fiction!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My new favorite show.","review":"I absolutly love this show.

They have taken a page from the British shows, if it time for a character to die or leave the show, it doesn't matter if it is in the middle of the season, it is time for them to go.

At no point did the sound match the video for more than ten to fifteen seconds. More than several times throughout the video there was a delay in both sound and video, and extreme pixilation.

Too many good characters were killed off, just to start a new story line - next season will probably be about dealing with the big mobster wanting revenge for his daughters death. And the new regime - Clay trying to take back his spot, Gemma reconciling that she isnt the big girl on the block, now Tara is. She is now just the ex presidents old lady - or she and clay will have to work it out - or stay broke up etc. Some of it was a bit too much and too bloody.

What keeps it from being perfect IMHO is Dr. Tara. She looks too young to have the career that she does. She'd be more like a resident than a top surgeon. What keeps bugging me is how a doctor, presumably able to at least buy groceries and pay the rent, would want ANYTHING to do with a lifestyle that mainly involves committing multiple felonies, up to and including murder, on a fairly routine basis. And as the 3rd season showed, she'll do more than just watch. Her peers are now porn stars and MC old ladies, not fellow doctors. Also note the \\"love of the club\\" seems to be a tool used by the leader(s) to control or manipulate the rank and file. I guess this is no different from any real life crime gang, which is what this club is.Also maybe someone can explain why the local criminals need huge amounts of military-grade weapons???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sons of America","review":"Great show as it evolves from season to season.

Needless to say, the woman's mate is also a dumb nobody, and both form a painfully mediocre couple that seems an insult to Ms. Bakos' mundane moods.Bakos is not an ambitious researcher, but a gossipy society socialite, and that shows throughout the book. Real-Life reports on exotic sexual preferences are flooding into the market by the dozens these days.

I had written one book and briefly considered \\"vanity\\" press in order to avoid the hassles of setting up a publishing company, obtaining ISBNs, etc. But I read this book and the author covers all of the steps necessary to set up your company, legal requirements, promotion, fulfillment, etc. He explains everything in a step by step fashion including a timeline that tells you when to complete each step. In short, he made it very easy for me to set up my company and get my book into print. I highly recommend this indispensable guide.

Of course he exaggerates: he is a consultant to self-publishing authors. This book is an advertisement for his services, and he doesn't hesitate to refer readers to the order forms at the back of the book.Much of his advice is simply wrong-headed.I read a couple other books for self-publishing authors, and Poynter's is easily the weakest.

The stories have an effortless feeling as if they are being spoken rather than written. This free and easy quality combined with the spectacularly imaginative subjects make for a really fun reading experience.Unless you have a really patient child, however, I wouldn't recommend this edition for sit-on-the-lap reading. The illustrations aren't particularly engaging. Rather, I would let your kids sit down with some blank paper and a box of crayons and ask them to draw their own pictures while you read out loud to them.

The carpet is only 5 years old but it lifts and cleans so it looks almost new and the carpet is very light colored. Its light and easier to maneuver than the old canister. We love the extra long electrical cord and the long reach of the handle makes cleaning the stairs much easier than struggling with the canistor.

Hopefully this means our berber carpet floors weren't as dirty as I had imagined.

Also the set up was a cake walk compared to my old vac (it shall remain nameless). It is amazingly simple and easy to use. I did have a bit of a problem with the wand due to the spring back action and the floor tool did not work properly, the brush kept on getting cloged with pet hair.

I would never have guessed it was a refurbished machine.Emptying the dustbin is easy, no more messy than using bags if you're careful, and I like that I can see how full the bin is and that I don't have to purchase bags anymore.I'm very happy with my purchase.

It's the sound of fever, bottles shaking on tables, bugs and the vertigo rumble of an impending storm.

I called Dyson direct, and they said that because it was reconditioned there was nothing they could do or say to help.I am in the process of sending it back, which seems relatively easy, but has not yet been picked up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great suction; limited wand expansion","review":"The refurbished model I purchased did not have any noticable damage/markings. The suction on this product is great! The amount of dust/dirt it picked up on my first run was outrageous. The only complaint I have is that the wand doesn't stretch far enough. The wand is actually a little hard to manuever in tight spots. Overall, I am happy with this purchase; I'm especially glad I went with the refurbished model. I have been through at least four vacuums <$100 in the past 10 years and I'm looking forward to this one lasting at least that long if not longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Vacuum","review":"I've had this vacuum for about 3 weeks now and so-far-so-good since it's a re-manufactured item. This vacuum sucks up just about everything and easy to dump the waste. My only complaint and it's not really a complaint...for the money...Dyson should give you more tools. I will probably purchase the long soft brush attachment for picture frames, etc. I would have given it 5 stars, but the price is high with bare minimum tools, and, also, the warranty was not good for the re-manufacture purchase. I would highly recommend this vacuum, especially if you have pets and kids. My home hasn't been this dust-less in years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disappointed","review":"The vacuum works wonderful, well worth the asking price - however, it was advertised as having a 2 year unconditional warranty. When it arrived, it had a note attached that stated that it had a limited 6 month warranty. I would purchase the vacuum again, but I will verify any advertised warranty information prior to purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dyson Really Sucks","review":"Of course, it is a vacuum so that is what it is supposed to do. I am very pleased with this product and impressed by its performance. It really does suck a lot of dirt out of carpet. The carpet actually looks \\"refreshed\\" after vacuuming.My only knock against it is the accessories. Using the hand held brushes is a little unwieldy in close quarters. However, my previous vacuum was no star in this area either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Me & my two Golden Retrievers LOVE this.","review":"When I bought this machine after haveing to by a new vacuum every year for the past 3 years I was afraid it was all just hype. Amazon shipped it in two days and I was off and running. It is easy to use, not at all noisy, made my rugs look new and picked up everything on my hard wood. Easy to set up and get moving. I would highly, highly reccomend. My 'reconditioned' vacuum came like new with no indication that it was not completely new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dream come true","review":"I have two long haired shedding dogs at home, and there is black hair everywhere!! I looked everywhere for a vacuum that could suck up all of the hair! The guy I work with has this dyson at home, he loves it and recommended it. I figured why not - what have I got to loose?Let me tell you - this is the greatest vacuum ever. I used to dread running the sweeper, stopping 10-15 times to clean out the hose, etc. With the Dyson, I have to stop once to empty the canister - but that it is. It sucks and cleans like nothing I have ever seen.I absolutely love this vacuum, and would recommend it to everyone. It is just a shame that I can only give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Purchase!!","review":"buying this factory-reconditioned Dyson was probably the best purchase I made all year! Saved a ton on money for the same product-that was actually shipped from the Dyson Plant-so I know they reconditioned it and it looks brand new!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing is very over rated!!!!","review":"\\"Never losses suction\\" Good thing because it has less suction than most vacuums that are half plugged!!! Also the head is so high that you cannot reach under a kitchen cabinet. Yes, you could use that attachment but that is a real pain! I'll stick with Hoover and just change the bag once a month. Buyer beware!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deal!","review":"I'd give this five stars except that the vacuum we received and the user manual that came with it were slightly different models. No biggie, except the manual made it look like the handle was on backwards when we put it together and that made the assembly process take forever! But once we got it going we loved it. Great price for a great vacuum!"},{"rating":"2","title":"dyson vacuum","review":"I would give this vacuum a 4. The handle is a bit cumbersome to use, it takes a while to get used to. I also don't like that it does not have a light on it. But, it does do a great job at cleaning. It really has a lot of suction and picks up a lot of dirt. It is also easy to clean the bagless catch. I would buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressed","review":"WE are very happy, the unit came with all attachments and new directions, it works great. What a deal!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dyson dc 14 all floors","review":"This is a wonderful vacuum. It picks up dirt better than any other vacuum I've owned on ceramic tile and hardwood floors. It does carpet perfectly as well. It is very lightweight in my opinion, much lighter than my Hoover wind tunnel. I am able to vacuum the entire length of my stairs now without lugging the vacuum halfway up with me because of the easy to use, extra long hose! It is very easy to empty the dirt canister and also very quiet! No more missed phone calls when cleaning. I would have rated it 5 stars but there are two things that I don't like about this vacuum. Because of the shape (height) of the \\"nose\\" of this vacuum, it does not fit under the toe kick area of kitchen and bathroom cabinets. This means that you have to use an attachment to clean under these areas. Also, I don't like the weird angle of the attachment that you would use to get into corners and edges. The angle makes it all but impossible to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"DC 14 is a no brainer","review":"For $300 this vacuum was a no brainer. It works far better than all the others we've had. Wife is please so I'm happy. Just wish we would have purchased this one before the last two junkers :)The only issue we have is the hose extention length. It would help if it were longer but considering the design and where the hose is located, I'm happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"The first time we used our new Dyson we vacuumed our rugs with our Oreck. Then we revacuumed with the Dyson. You would not believe all the dog hair and other nasty stuff the Dyson picked up. I am sold on the Dyson."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not go for factory-reconditioned DC-14s","review":"In my past experience buying refurbished products, they're usually as good as new. Not in this case. The first DC14 I received came in damaged, with a very important clip broken and leaving the vacuum cover loose. Amazon replaced it in a couple weeks (i had to pay out of my own pocket to send the defective one back to amazon), but the 2nd one is worse. It is clearly used, scratches all over the plastic surface, accessories clips are broken out of the box, and the air coming out of the vacuum smelled funky... no suprise it's going back again. I don't know what else to say about this vacuum, but Dyson's factory reconditioning process should be called factory re-packing. Save yourself trouble and get a new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"warning !!","review":"This vacuum is very very powerful and does not have a height setting....your delicate oriental or older carpets will be damaged if you use this vacuum with the beater bar engaged. If the beater bar is not engaged, all you are getting is suction and it simply does not clean well because it is a hard wood floor setting. This vacuum badly damaged my gorgeous oriental rugs !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this vacuum!","review":"Great marketing - horrible product.The entire unit is clearly made as inexpensive as possible. Cheap plastic, very poor design - you actually push down with your foot to release the base from the handle. No suction. And I mean - NO SUCTION!I returned the unit in less than 1hr.Buy a Hoover. Good luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for the cat","review":"I have to give my cat an asthma pill so I grind it up and put the powder in some of this stuff, and she really goes for it. I save half a can in the fridge for the next dose a couple days later. Both the cat and I find this product quite workable.My veterinarian recommended this particular flavor because she finds cats always go for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extra Firm?","review":"The item arrived as ordered and was shipped quickly. my only gripe is that when I buy a name brand item I expect to receive the item as advertised.Maybe it is just me but this is not what I would call an \\"extra firm support\\" pillow. Nice. Comfortable. But in no way would I call this extra firm. But this is what happens when you shop for mattresses and pillows. We had to go to a specialty mattress store that actually sold what was advertised unlike the department stores that have supposed \\"extra firm\\" mattresses until you lie on one and sink in.If you want a nice pillow this is a good choice. If you want an extra firm support pillow go somewhere for a squeeze test as you may be disapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for us","review":"My husband and I are mainly side sleepers, sometimes back. We have been trying different pillows bc of back & neck pain, headaches, and my sinus issues. We got these at the mall during a great sale and thought they'd be great bc they're the same brand as our wonderful mattress.Unfortunately no matter how we tried sleeping on them they just werent comfortable and we would toss and turn, having to constantly readjust them. We've since tried a few more firm pillows that were varying levels of better. These were our least favorite and least supportive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Firm Support Pillows","review":"These pillows are of very good quality, however, they are much fuller than other firm support pillows I own. They are so thick that it is hard to put my arms around it when I sleep on my side.They look nice on the bed though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible DVD!","review":"This DVD is misleading. By the packaging you're lead to believe that you are purchasing a DVD that is both bilingual and educational. The contrary. It is a DVD of the primary colors. However, it doesn't contain a voice-over or any type of dialog what so ever. How is a baby (0-2 years old) supposed to learn anything from this. Instead, each color is introduced through a title page. Last I checked, my baby couldn't read. For example, the word, \\"Azul\\", is displayed. Then, 5 random blue (azul) objects float around on a black background to a classical song. It does this until the entire song is over. Honestly, I got a a little dizzy watching this. Then, it moves on to the next color, etc. It's not visually exciting either. The shapes displayed are low quality renderings. They look like the computer animations I created in my intro-digital art class in college. My baby was so bored! I can't believe this product is out on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD!","review":"Got this for my grandson when he was 2 years old. He loved to watch it just put it on for about 15 min. 3 times a week for about two month and he masterd it. This is how I taught him his colors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great detail, Lousy history","review":"Gideon Welles once said that the Porters were all liars and braggarts. This massive volume by David Dixon Porter goes far to proving it. As history, it is lousy, heavily biased, and one-sided. However, for the serious historian, there is a great amount of administrative detail that cannot be found elsewhere. A good source, if its limitations are properly recognized."},{"rating":"2","title":"a rare view","review":"Porters perspective of the navel operations gives the reader a rare view of history. written some years after the war to set the record of other navel histories of the day, straight. I find the detailed reports by participants and commentary by porter to be both informative and entertaining. Bias? Yes... but he gives his opinion in a straight forward manor and gives credit (both good and bad) where credit is due."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as helpful as I hoped","review":"This book does have lots of new races. But when you start to really take a look at them, they start to seem very similar to one another. I run a 3rd Edition D&D game and play in both d20 StarWars and D&D. I thought I would use this as a resource to create interesting new PCs and NPCs. But I have found that I barely open the book since I purchased it. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buddy Bowl","review":"The Buddy Bowl has helped me solve a huge problem I was having with my puppy playing with her water inside the house. She would step in her old bowl, blow bubbles in it--I regularly had a kitchen floor covered with water, and couldn't figure out what to do to stop the mess! The Buddy Bowl has helped get this problem under control. I have had no more floods in the kitchen. It is a generous size and was of much sturdier construction than I had expected. I am very happy with it. My other animals have had no problem adapting to using a different type of bowl. I only wish I had found it earlier!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bowl!","review":"I bought this for our golden 2 years ago and took it on vacation this year. My parent's goldens loved this one so much they stopped using their bowl and I had to give them a replacement to get ours home.

One that splashes her water all over and if given the opportunity will actually flip the bowl over (because that is more fun). I found a buddy bowl at a thrift store and fell immediately in love with this product. No more wet floors, walls, or wet food. But, the area I live in has extremely \\"hard water\\" and left my buddy bowl with hard water stains despite daily cleaning. It was time for a new bowl. I was thrilled to find the buddy bowl on Amazon and purchased two! But when they got here... they were huge. Seeming almost double the size. I ended up donating them to the dogs at a local animal shelter and they were thrilled. But I'm back to the splashes of water throughout my kitchen. Where oh where did the small buddy bowl go?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A true mircle","review":"As the mother of a toddler who loves to dump the dog water all over the kitchen floor and herself, I LOVE THIS!!!!!!

I have a cat that loves to tip over water bowls and if she can't tip it she will splash water out of the bowl. She can't tip this bowl and can't splash either. I've had the smaller version of the Buddy Bowl for years until it wore out. I decided to replace it with the 1/2 gallon size and my two cats like this one even better. At first I thought it might be too big for cats but it isn't if the cats are full grown."},{"rating":"2","title":"It does the job, but then over time the lid is hard to remove","review":"This bowl really doesn't spill.

Singer and songwriter Terry Miles employs just the right dry and dusty notes to frame his vignettes, which, he says, are \\"a tapestry of lonely city life and longing for the country.\\" With a down-home production (most of the material was recorded in Terry's basement on a laptop) and affecting touches - a shimmering pedal steel here and a simmering organ there - this album oozes melancholy. We come to empathize with such down and outers as Father Hill, Mad Cameron Howard and Rocco the Policeman (and his dog) just like Dylan engaged us with Hattie Carroll, Hollis Brown and John Wesley Harding. Tying it all together is Miles and girlfriend Kelly Haigh's harmonizing - he sounds as comfortable with her as Gram did with Emmylou.

In particular, I came to understand the basis of the co-op apartment building and how it has shaped the city.I gave my copy away to a friend who was teaching local history, but I think of it often.

Sadly, it was a waste of money. I ordered two and placed them in separate rooms. I guess with 3 pets in the house, the fleas could tell the difference between a real live animal and a lightbulb with some sticky tape. In a weeks time I caught 1 little gnat, 1 spider and a bunch of pet hairs and some tiny dust bunnies. While the traps sat empty of fleas, I was still combing a flea or two off of my cats every day. After seeing the desgin and components in person, if you really want to try this method, buy some double stick carpet tape and put it in a cardboard box lid then place a regular lamp over it.

Flea issue when we moved to a new house was horrendous, we have three dogs, none of which had ever had fleas before. They were in the carpet, because I was vacuuming them up constantly, we bombed the house, and still had problems (dogs were on Comfortis AND Tri-Shield). Finally after shampooing the rugs, and having an exterminator come out, the fleas are gone.I ran the Flea Trap right next to the dogs beds, and never caught one flea...in over a month! Kept it running for another month, just to see if there were any stragglers. Never caught anything at all, not even a mosquito, which come into the house year round in the south.Very disappointed...would send it back if I could!"},{"rating":"1","title":"caught by mistake?","review":"Used it for about 3 weeks.

Being the organic type I did not want to use foggers or any type of pesticide. I bought one flea trap to see if it worked. After one day of use I was so impressed with it, I ordered 4 more. Within five days the infestation was GONE. Yes, you have to put up with the nasty things for a bit longer than if you fogged or sprayed. That is a small price to pay for year-round flea control with NO pesticides!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"I do not have any animals in the house, but I had a flea infestation anyway [I suspect the previous tennant had a cat or dog in the house]. This product is great - it caught 9 fleas in the first 24 hours of operation! Hopefully this product will 'break the cycle' and take care of my problem. I tried spraying my carpet with insecticides, but that was not 100% effective - hopefully this trap combined with a re-spraying will solve the problem for good.Since this is a 3rd party seller, the shipping is not as quick as the regular amazon shipments, so check the shipping terms if you are in a rush to get your trap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ineffective","review":"I purchased the product in May 2011. It is now August 2011 and we might have one or two fleas in the trap, but have removed dozens upon dozens of fleas directly from our dog in that time. We located the trap near his crate, on the carpet where he rests, near the couch, but only a couple fleas in the two months we've had it during peak season. Regular flea baths as well as looking on the dog througout the week revealed plenty of fleas. We've sprayed the carpet and furniture as well. The dog is a much better trap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"I ordered this because I thought it was larger than the Victor Flea Trap I normally use, and because it sounded like it would catch more fleas. I was very disappointed to find it much smaller than I thought and not nearly as good as the Victor Flea Trap. The light in it isn't even bright and the plastic covering gets in the way of catching the fleas instead of attracting them! I've had it plugged in for days in a basement room that became infested and only a few fleas are in the trap. If I walk through the room I get more than that on my pants! What a waste of money. If you are looking for a pesticide-free trap try the Victor Flea Trap, it's much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"I purchased this for my home in Florida after noticing several fleas on my animals in late spring. The bulb is supposed to put off a heat level that matches the same heat an animal laying on the floor would put off, but it produced very little heat. The glue on the trap was very sticky, and I'm sure a flea would have been stuck very well if a flea had been attracted enough to it to get stuck. I have used this for a month and caught absolutely nothing. The flea problem is gone fortunately, but that was done with a combination of bathing the animals, vacuuming every day, and using flea powers/flea sprays on the carpet and furniture.

It would be very interesting to estimate the cost and time for this project these days; it simply could not be done as fast, what with all the regulatory hoops to leap through, and HR best practices to vie with.

The main reason I've kept this one is for the fishing hook sharpener, which works well on certain types of serrations. But, on the flat side of mine, the diamond plating is falling off in areas, and exposes ordinary steel. It has a smaller length sharpening rod than the Eze-lap (~2.5 inches vs. 3.5 inches), but when retracted into the handle it is overall longer than the Eze-Lap (~5.5 inches vs. 4.5 inches). The Eze-Lap is about twice as much money (about $7.52 more on amazon), but it is well worth the investment as it is a much higher quality than this Gerber sharpener.

Instead of what could have been another great album, they made a boring run of the mill soundtrack that blends in with 99% of the other bands out at the moment.

This is very important to someone training to be a research scientist.Yes, it may be understandable only to upper level students, but that is for whom the book is meant.

All my problems were solved simply by getting a different histology book.This book does, at times, go into greater level of detail than alberts, but if you are like me, you will be no smarter after reading the book than you were before.A preview of this book may not be enough to know whether this book is made for you or not, so make sure you have a couple of days on your return policy in case it doesnt work for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"I have to use this book because it is recommended by our teacher as the text book read after class. Its picture helps me understand a lot of basic knowledge in genetics. Most exciting thing is that I use only 31 dollars to get a hard cover which I thought should be more than 100 dollars. However, it lacks the history of finding in one field. For example, how to recognize the double helix structure of DNA is based on several different findings. I prefer a book that can focus on history of scientific finding and scientific thinking rather than simply telling the truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"fabulous","review":"the item is in excellent condition.The service is so good that I am gonna shop from amazon, everytime I need a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy pushing a pink stroller","review":"I bought this stroller mainly because it is lightweight and I could easily get it in and out of my car trunk without straining. Secondly, I bought this stroller because it is pink and didn't look like a boy stroller. I was a bit worried that it was a little flimsy and hoped I wouldn't regret my decision. Now, after having used the stroller I am happy with my decision. I have no trouble lifting the stroller in and out of my car (just as I thought) and the strap system that raises and reclines the seating position is sturdier than I thought it might be.I also bought the matching car seat. I like how it attaches easily to the stroller. The only downside that I have found is that when the car seat is attached to the stroller, my daughter appears to be tilted forward more than is comfortable.Everytime I have this stroller in use someone comments on how cute the pink is- which isn't important to the function of the stroller, of course, but the comments make me smile!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made","review":"This stroller isn't very light and is impossible to open or close if you are holding the baby in one arm. It rattles and shakes alot, which does unintentionally rock the baby to sleep, and it isn't easy to manuver. I bought a MacLaren and I am a lot happier with it. It's lighter and easier to use. However, this stroller does work well with the infant seat, which we were able to use that function for four months before my baby outgrew the infant seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for the money","review":"The color is perfect, I am so glad I could finally find a girly looking stroller. It feel it is also one of the safer lightweight strollers since it has the 5-point harness system. I have a 2 door car with very little trunk space. This stroller fits perfectly and with room to spare. I can easily get it in and out with no problems. I love how easy it to adjust the seat recline. My mom can even do it. There is plenty of space in the basket for the diaper bag, my purse, my mom's purse and our purchases. I would definitely recommend this to everyone expecting a girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lindsey- metrolite stroller","review":"I chose this stroller only because it is pink. There are plenty of others for the price that are much better but I wanted a pink stroller. It's real cute and light but it seems to have been made very cheaply and does not seem sturdy. The back part where the baby back and head lies is very flimsy and held together by little one inch vinyl-like straps that are attached to the sides of the stroller. It feels more like cardboard so there's not much support for the baby's back and head area and I wish it were a little more soft and cushiony and sturdy. There's not much room to put your pocket book or keys by the hand area. Just room pretty much for a drink. All in all I hope the \\"PINK\\" color of the stroller will be a good enough reason for me to have chosen this stroller and I hope it was not a mistake. We'll see in about 2 months if my daughter will enjoy it and if it will hold her weight and not buckle. It does fit the lindsey baby carseat though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping!","review":"Like other reviewers, I love Barbara Erskine's books. I just can't put them down once I've started! I am always happy when she has a new book out. She writes gripping plotlines that keep you on the edge of your seat. A lot of her books are partly set in Scotland, and being a Scot, I like to read about where she has written. Child of the Phoenix is especially exciting, and I take my hat off to her research skills. Poor Eleyne! Being affluent doesn't necessarily get you what you want in life. Aren't you glad we're living in the 21st Century, gals? Was she real, was she one complete person or a composite? Who knows. The story may be fabricated, but Barbara Erskine nonetheless writes her tale over a historically factual background. An inspiration to budding authors she is. I wonder how her novels would fare on film. Any offers?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Close It With A Bang","review":"Ah the last disk in the series. I gotta say this one probably has the best episodes on it. My favorite one being \\"Night of the Rogues\\" where Shredder hires all of the turtles toughest enemies to take them out. The magic is really in these episodes and the shows humor.Again the special features are on the crap side but the episodes more then make up for that. I wasn't counting on getting any special features cause we haven't been getting them really so I can't complain too much.If your a fan of old or new, you want to remember the turtles, get this set it's great."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for care-givers","review":"I have been a care-giver and I have been on the otherside.

I didn't want a small lap harp(not enough octaves) and I couldn't afford a harp any bigger.This harm is first, and foremost, beautiful. I bought mine with vines running up along the side and I couldn't be happier with how it looked...It plays just fine, but the sound is a little plucky. This is expected, as its not an expensive harp and it is a folk harp. If you want a very smooth playing harp you should not get this, but if you are ok sacrificing a bit of sound quality for more octaves (as I was) than you will be pleased with this harp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointment and Silliness","review":"This movie appears to have been made in someone's basement with poor scenery, poor acting, no plot of any substance.

I have a cheap mic, and this preamp dramatically improved the sound, and reduced backgroud hum. I really like the seperate imput and output controls, and the ability to run either 1/4 or XLR inputs is nice. It does lack some of the features that I have seen on more expensive models, and most of the tech is solid state.

If you take some time and learn its functions, it works very well. I use it for some live vocals that needed a little more presence.

Hardly state of the art equipment; however, the combination of the Rode NT-4 and these units gives my oboe a nice warm sound that I have striven for years with home equipment to create. I am considering purchasing another pair so that I can use both sets of mics for live recording of recitals with the AT 3035s being placed in the back of the hall and the Rode NT-4 in the front. Condenser mics need phantom power and these units provide it well."},{"rating":"2","title":"tube fuzz","review":"I bought this microphone preamp to use between my electric guitar and a 20W practice amp. It adds alot of warmth, and when properly overdriven, gives a great fuzz sound to my playing. I have a friend that also actually uses his to power a microphone! wow!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not necessary for good vocal mics","review":"I got this preamp because I heard I needed a preamp as well as phantom power for an AKG studio condenser mic that I was also purchasing; and that it would also \\"warm up\\" the sound a bit. That might help for cheap mics but there was absolutely no voice quality difference with 2 mid-range mics under diff recording tests than straight to an Mbox 2 mini. As a matter of fact, I got a little extra noise. (but that is prob due to the extra cable connection) I can't say what it will do for instruments, but for voice, it is totally not necessary if you have a good mic and interface. If not, then you probably need something like this.Things I liked: Solid metal build, 2 kinds of jacks, price.Things I hated: Gets very hot doing nothing, No on/off switch (you have to unplug it from the back each time)Although this preamp may work just swell, those last 2 hated points were enough for me to give it 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bucher Family Records","review":"This book contains documented information and photo copies concerning the history and background of Hans and Christina Bucher who lived in the eastern portion of the United States.

The general tells us a lot about conspiracy theory, while carefully excluding the account of massacre, pillage and raping of a defenseless 3 million Bengalis by his troops. Also the statements made out regarding the might of Pakistani army really sounds misleading, if this was the case then one wonders how the war ended in just 9 months.

To millions of truly Muslim Pakistani brothers, please don't take offense to my comment. My comment only applies to people like \`Niazi'.

Ultimately, the narrator (Dr. Plarr) is so disassociated from recognizable human emotion that he becomes a caricature of the a standard Greene plot device.Not a bad book if taken singly from Greene's other works, but there are much better representatives of this type of effort in 'The Quiet American' or 'The Confidential Agent'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Neither was good...","review":"I originally bought these b\\\\c I thought that the one was a movie I'd already seen (Season of Hope).

One always wonders about the families in these crashes, how it is handled, what they must experience.However, her investigation to clear her husband's name when it appears he is responsible for the crash leads to discoveries that she really didn't know him at all. It was fairly obvious to me quite early on what was going on in his life. Even the supposed plot twist was one I could see coming.

No imagery, nothing interesting in the language, nothing to nourish the mind. It is the kind of book to read on a plane - you can only half pay attention, and you'll finish it before you land. I believe people can appreciate more challenging literature than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"unimaginative","review":"While I found The Pilot's Wife to be compelling, I was continuously disappointed by each revelation about Jack's secret life. Without giving the plot away to potential readers, the secrets are terribly predictable. Shreve could have come up with something more imaginative. A friend of mine guessed the entire plot after I gave him two clues that the reader is presented with in the book jacket summary: a plane explodes off the coast of Ireland and a husband is hiding something from his wife. The concept of a secret life is rife with possiblities, too bad Shreve didn't bother to explore any but the obvious."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Totally predictable! I kept hoping that it would veer off in another direction but it stayed the course to a very predictable ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"This book was boring and predictable from the beginning. I kept wanting something to happen, but all the characters kept doing was reacting to what already happened. I could not identify with the main character, the wife. She seemed so weak and stupid. I like most of Oprah's other books, but this one isn't worth the time"},{"rating":"1","title":"A predictable disappointment","review":"I have enjoyed many of Oprah's selections, but can't figure out why she picked this one. The plot is interesting, and the theme -- how we never know how well we REALLY know someone -- is compelling. However, the characters are stock and shallow, and the story winds down to a predictable conclusion. Save your money and look elsewhere for a good read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly engaging. I couldn't put it down.","review":"Even though I knew how it would end, I still couldn't put it down. I love the way the story unfolds, how she believes her husband to faithful and devoted and then finds out he has a whole other family in London, the supposed suicide, the hint of a romance yet to come. Entirely fiction but also entirely possible. It's a good light read."},{"rating":"1","title":"seemed written primarly to be made into a movie","review":"I was very disappointed in this one...especially since I usually agree with Oprahs suggestions. It read like a screenplay and I kept imagining the actors in the movie (I KNOW it will be a movie, just has to be)-Michelle Pfeiffer as the wife and Kevin Costner as the inspector. Just a big bummer, and no big surprise ending either...You know what's coming, you only wish it didn't take so long to get there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably a good \\"stuck in the airport\\" read","review":"Sorry if I'm a bit dense but I found the last page confusing. If the pilot is dead and wife #2 is in jail, then to whom is Kathryn speaking when she calls to ask about the children? Please email with any answers or thoughts. Poorly written and predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING, BORING, BORING...","review":"It really bothered me that I spent the money to buy this book. You find out by reading the book's jacket that the husband dies, so what. Three quarters of the way through the book we don't know much else. We read about the wife's dealing with death, how can that excite anyone. The characters are boring, not developed and the ending I thought was just a last minute idea the author had to try to pull the book together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abrupt ending","review":"While this was a no-brainer, entertaining read while flying cross-country, when I got to the end I thought, \\"Am I missing some pages?\\" So, I went to a bookstore to look at another copy and discovered that I had, in fact, read the entire book. It was a very strange and abrupt ending. I'm curious if anyone else felt that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the big deal about this book???","review":"This was my second Anita Shreve book, and after I just couldn't get into the first one (A December Wedding) and found it miserably boring, several people suggested I read The Pilot's Wife because it is \\"fantastic\\". Again I was not pleased. Although the story progessed in a natural and logical manner, I had the entire plot line figured out in the first several chapters. Even if Shreve intended for the \\"twist\\" to be predictable and wanted to write more about the grieving process, she did not do that well. The antagonist's grieving process went from being extremely realistic to being overly cheesy and fake within a matter of sentences. The ending also had me sitting in my chair asking myself what in the world just happened! It was extremley abrupt and confusing. Quite frankly I don't see what the big deal is about this book or Anita Shreve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Implausible and Dull","review":"I was very disappointed in this dull, dreary novel but plodded through it as a member of a book discussion group. It is quite obvious that the author knows little about the airline business and even less about the conflict in Northern Ireland. The plot is contrived and the prose is not particularly well written. As a rule, I stay away from anything billed as an \\"Oprah Pick\\" and should have continued that practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your Time is Precious don't Waste it!!!","review":"This book is terrible, usually Oprah recommends good ones but this is not one of them. It totally wasted my time, it took half of the book just to get the plot established and then after that everything else was obvious. Please I beg you don't waste your time, read something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pretty Predictable Easy-Read","review":"I've read several of the Oprah selections and by the end of the book I generally agree with her rave reveiws --- not the case this time. It wasn't terrible, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It was simple and extremely predictable. So much more could have been done with the content and the character development. For example, once the IRA is introduced - why didn't Shreve build on the historical content? Develop around the movement? The book was OK --- an easy to read plot that had the potential to evolve, but never did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well-written; not entertaining","review":"I have generally enjoyed books that were selected by Oprah. This one, however, was not particularly well-written nor entertaining. The conclusion was too obvious. Characters disinteresting. Many other \\"Oprah\\" selections to choose from!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An unfulfilling novel","review":"This book is quite remarkable in many ways. It is a real page-turner and like many a reviewer, I read it in a single sitting. Yet it is also a rather vacuous book with a contrived and rather silly conclusion. This is truly the stuff that throwaway literature is made of!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting book with a truthful side of marital unfaithfulness","review":"I loved this book, and against a lot of people's advice I read it on a plane from Madrid to Miami...take their advice. It makes you question everything that goes on in your flight. You want to go and ask the pilot a million questions about how his life is going and such. About the book though, I sped through it, and when I was about 50 pages to the end, I couldn't believe it was almost done. The thing that I liked most about this book was it showed how unfair a marital affair is to a wife, her family, and anyone else involved. It shows the selfishness that takes place, which I haven't read it quite a long time. It was an excellently written book, and as long as someone is not entrusting their life to a pilot at the time, they should definately read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"fatally flawed, not a light summer read","review":"I delved into this book hoping for the rediscovery of a woman after a tragedy. What I found was someone who was too weak to handle the slightest grief, who wallowed in her own one-sided memories. The fact that it took most of the book to live through this \\"life-changing\\" experience was the agony for me, compounded by a whiny, uncontrolable 15 year-old daughter. I expected the story to play out over at least a few months. To my dismay, it did, in only the last chapter. I was not surprised by her, considering the example set by her mother. I did appreciate however, the way she felt insulated, and removed at the same time from even the most benign of daily activities. The detached style that the narrative was written in was fairly acurate. I would not recommend this book to anyone, unless they wanted the heavy, depressing felling that I got after I put this book down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time or money","review":"I was highly disappointed in this book. After hearing Oprah's recommendations I was sure I would like this book. I was wrong and will think twice before I purchase a book she has added to her book club. This is the first time I have read one and don't know if I will again."},{"rating":"1","title":"fluff....and extremely boring fluff at that!","review":"Thought this sounded good, and when it was chosen by our book group as the reading material of the month, I was anxious to get reading it. However, someone had said it was a page turner....and it was for me too......skimming doesn't take much time!! and I wasted mine with this book!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ditto, to all the others who gave this book 1 or 2 stars!","review":"Easy to figure out, sloooow moving plot, same old story. No, I am not a male. What more is there to say?"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"Boring , boring, boring. I only finished it because it was the only book I had with me on the 5 hour flight to San Francisco."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!","review":"This is my first time reading Anita Shreve. I loved it!! I finished it in one day b/c I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit on the boring side...","review":"If you want to know the story, just read the back of the book. It was too heavy on the emotions and slow-moving. Too many side dishes and not enough meat for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed","review":"I loved Anita Shreve's \\"The Weight of Water,\\" and \\"Sea Glass.\\" I read \\"The Pilot's Wife\\" after these two, and found it to be a disappointment. I think there was too much re: the initial shock and grief and too little of the \\"meat\\" of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A QUICK BUT SHALLOW READ","review":"As both an avid reader and a reader of most of the Oprah Bookclub selections this one was diappointing. Although it WAS a quick read, the characters had NO depth to them and the ending was just plain ridiculous. It reminded me more of a Danielle Steele-type book. The storyline line IS an interesting one, it's just too bad the author didn't develop it more. Will be watching for next months bookclub pick....."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book reads like a J Peterman catalog.","review":"This book was just one precious scene after another. From the old, ramshackle house they lovingly restored to the fact that they met in an antique shop, for pete's sake. The characters were so flat they seemed to only exist as props in the scenes. I felt none of the pain one would expect to feel when a wife loses a husband. I was greatly disappointed, as I often am by what passes for literature in modern america."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN!!!","review":"This book was boring, and predictable with plot holes big enough to drive a bus through. I admire Oprah for starting her book club. I'm glad she's inspired her audience to read. However, the books she has chosen (especially this season), seem targeted toward the non-reading public. They're mentally unchallenging yarns, written at the reading level of a high schooler. I think she underestimates the American reading public."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was I thinking?!!!","review":"I should have known!!The book was predictable and could have been done in 100 pages. Suffice it to say that I'm never buying another book that Oprah recommends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lightweight Predictable Plot - Don't Waste Your Time Reading","review":"I'm surprised that Oprah choose this book. I usually enjoy her selections, but this book was the exception. It was a one-scene plot line that was a total dud. I could predict almost every piece of the story before it unfolded. Boring, boring, boring with a dud of an ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping and compelling.","review":"This is the first time I've heard of this jewel of a writer, Anita Shreve, and, based on this novel, I plan to read more of her work.The novel drew me in from the first page and I barely put it down until two days later when I was drawn to the end.The writing is intelligent and beguiling, and I related so well to some passages, that I actually highlighted them, so closely did they touch a chord in my being.I look forward to many more intriguing works from Ms. Shreve!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"No, not all women write because they are angry at men. However, I don't want to defend all of womankind in this space! I read this book because I had read from sources other than the Oprah circuit that this was an interesting and original book. However, I was not impressed with it at all. The writing felt self conscious and clunky and I did not feel any sympathy for the main character. I realized at the end that I had not even formed a mental picture of the husband and couldn't imagine his life at all before the plane crashed. Blah is all I have to say. Next time I'll pick up a Guy Vanderhaeghe novel and breathe a sigh of relief as I am swept into an engaging and well written story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak weak writing!","review":"What was all the hype about? This was a terribly dissapointing shallow novel that did not deserve the success it received thanks to Oprah's show.It was predictable, lacking in compelling detail, contrived and at many times, boring.Don't waste your time or money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It Could Happen","review":"Outstanding book. This was my first Shreve novel, can't wait to read her others. This story is so true. People do live double lives. When a plane crash occurs, Katherine must find out the truth of her husband, who was one of the pilot's. The truth went down with him and sent her on a devastating search to his double life he may be leading, or did he have one? This is a very touching but also heartbreaking story. Get your tissues ready and enjoy this non stop page turning journey with Katherine and Mattie. This is a must read novel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"Ugh. Helpless female character's life is ruined by husband's actions, only after he goes down in fatal plane crash. I think Shreve meant to write her heroine as a strong, inquisitive, contemporary woman, but I only read her as bumbling and ordinary. This book came highly recommended from a trusted friend (her name is not Oprah), but I have no desire to pick up another Shreve book again. Sorry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too easy to predict","review":"I did like this book-it was an easy read and Shreve writes well. Although she tries to keep you guessing, I knew what was going to happen in the end. The book did pull my heart strings a couple of times, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instant Page Turner","review":"This novel depicts our most horrific nightmare- Deceit. What is worse than losing a loved one? I was intrigued after reading the first page, and this continued until the end. Shreve did a perfect job of captivating my emotions with her detailed descriptions of the protagonists feelings and thoughts. The details were so realistic that I could picture the events and characters when I was not even reading. I send this novel a thumbs up; however, at the same time if you are not careful the twists and turns of what Kathryn uncovers can leave you synical about trust and life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dud ending","review":"An interesting read, but what a dud ending. The author got sidetracked on boring issues. I wish she focused more on the husband's secret life."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEPRESSING","review":"I found this book to be terribly depressing. The writing was good but the book went on and on about what a wife experiences when she loses her husband. I was able to feel what Kathryn was going through emotionally, but I felt half-sick the entire time I read about her grief. Perhaps her loss scared me, but I did not enjoy the depression that I shared with her while I read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging","review":"I found this book in a second hand store and thought it might be interesting, so I bought it. Wise choice on my part! From the first page, the reader is drawn into the plot that carries forward at a very fast pace. I really couldn't put this book down. Kathryn's journey from shock, to grief, to realization is believable and definitely readable. I felt for her as she met each new turn the plane crash brought her way.I especially loved the way Robert Hart was written. He did his job, but with compassion. I felt for him as he tried to balance the need to do his job with the need to be empathetic and caring. An absolutely wonderful and engaging book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A subject that was treated many times","review":"I found myself bored many times. The author goes into lengthy details of clothing worn by characters to fill in material. Also, the matter was treated humorously in the movie, the Captain's Paradise many years ago. Would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the ending?","review":"Would someone please Email me the ending to this otherwise interesting novel? Unfortunately my edition of the book ends at the bottom of p. 293 with the words, I just wondered about the children, she said across the sea. ..... ? ? ....And the next page is blank. Obviously there is more that the printers left out, and I would appreciate knowing what it is. Help, someone, help!"},{"rating":"1","title":"predictable and unbelievable.","review":"Move over soap operas. I finished this book only because I was on vacation with nothing much to do and nothing much else to read. It transferred no feeling to me. Flat and uninteresting. The characters were not very believable or interesting. Sorry Oprah!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too boring and repetitive language","review":"Boy, what a waste of time this book was. Totally predictable and very slow moving. I agree, hardly any action ...the good part was that it was short. You can finish this book in less than a week! But, do yourself a favor...don't waste your money on this one. I can't believe Oprah would have put this one on her book club."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Can Happen!","review":"This was a good book! People don't realize that this could actually happen! People do lead double lives! A plane could crash at any moment anywhere, and the truth could be lost forever. I felt for Katherine and Mattie. This was not a far fetched story. I could hardly put it down. This was my first Shreve book, I look forward to reading her others. The Pilots Wife is a must read. Get your tissues ready and be ready for a non stop page turner. You will be glad you read this novel. Very touching and very heartbreaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who could possibly put this book down?","review":"I just have to put in my two cents worth about this novel because I REALLY enjoyed reading it. The vivid imageries I pictured from Ms. Shreve's superb writing style were almost too real! This is an easy to read book and it will keep you entertained. The emotions of the main character are conveyed perfectly and you almost understand exactly how she feels. I loved this novel and have given it to my mom and my best friend to read as well. The only negative thing I can say about this book is that I didn't particularly like the ending. Pick it up, you won't be sorry you took this emotional voyage :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pilot's Wife","review":"I hate to read- but I read this book in 2 days! Even though its predicatable-it carries your interest and make you want to read more. Its fiction - a make believe story - that is enjoyable to read. Can't wait to read more of Anita's books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ BOOK","review":"From the moment I picked up this book until I finished I was held spellbound..its the kind of story where you find yourself putting off other things in your life...like feeding the kids...just to sneak in another page or two. This is by far one of the best books I've read in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, transparent story","review":"I am writing this review simply in hopes of bringing the average customer rating of 3 stars down to where it should be! This book was transparent start to finish, (of course she gets the man...) mildly intriguing attempt to tell a story of the husband's strange other life, but not nearly enough information about WHY he would chose to do that. After this one I am leary of trying any other from this Author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Things are never what they seem.","review":"The Pilot's Wife takes you where you don't want to go.

Enjoy the trip -- it's may be a bumpy ride!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"SHOCKER\\" SOMETHING THAT COULD REALLY HAPPEN.","review":"I could see the faces and places in my mind since the book was so well written. I could not stop reading this book and I actually finshed it in a day and a half, a frist for me. I have recommended this book to my friends and strangers I have met at the book store.I now wonder if more spouses will really trust and believe everything they are told, when a loved one has to travel and acts strangly?I can actually see the sitution really becoming a shocking reality and how some could lead a double life such as written in this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good read","review":"I didn't like the title of this book, so I put off reading it until my mother told me how much she enjoyed it. It wasn't what I expected, some of Oprah's books are not what I would normally pick out for myself. Once I started reading I was captivated by the narrator of the book. She is smart, a good mother, loves and trusts her husband, and just can't help herself from finding out the truth , even though, at each step, she thinks to herself, \\"do I want to know this?\\" It shows how, even when you love someone completely, you may never really know the person that they are. Loved this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping, revealing and often heart wrenching","review":"As a mother and happily married woman, this book struck me on several levels. As a wife, it made me question the extent to which I really know my husband and to which I accept changes in our relationship that I would otherwise not question. As a mother, it made me ache for Mattie who I felt would always be scarred by losing her father and made me better understood the unquestionable faith and love my kids have in me and my husband. Also as a mother, I will always think about the little girl in London playing on her bed truely unaware of the adult events happending around her: telling Kathryn \\"..you talk like my daddy\\" and about the doll Jack had given her for Christmas. This book wasn't a tear-jerker but it was an emotional roller coaster at times. The descriptive writting sucked you in and didn't let you go until you were done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ending too abrupt, unbelievable characters","review":"This book was assigned for our book discussion group and I wonder how the six of us will find anything to say about it for more than five minutes. I was disappointed in the typographical errors and I am pretty sure there were pages missing because locales changed with no sequence or logic. What happened to Muire's two children? Who was Kathryn talking to on the phone on the last page?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Meaningful book, worth reading","review":"\\"The Pilot's Wife\\" doesn't quite deserve all of the acclaim it has received in certain quarters, but it is a fine novel just the same. I love these reviews, I heard about \\"The Triumph and the Glory\\" from a review and it was a wonderful discovery. I think my opinion is every bit as worthwhile as Ms. Oprah Winfrey's, and thank amazon for letting me, and all of us, express our thoughts in such a fine forum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Reading...hated the ending!","review":"This book made me question myself and how after being married for 21 years, would I feel if my husband died and I found out about his secret life.

I don't think so!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have been better as a \\"Redbook\\" short story","review":"Interesting, yes, but also massively predictible, and over before I knew it. Hardly worth the money. Oprah, what were you thinking?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!","review":"The plot may have been a touch predictable but I couldn't put it down. I was hooked from the begining and really felt for all of the characters. I think that the use of flashbacks really allowed you to see what she was thinking about that made what she was discovering make sense. I disagree with those who said that she was stupid for not knowing. It is much easier to see the whole picture from the outside or in hindsight. She trusted him and didn't want to have a marriage like her parents. I really enjoyed every minute of this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable....Easy to read...","review":"The Pilot's Wife was not as great a book as I thought it would be. I bought it after reading the summary on the back cover and I though it was going to be a good read. You can really predict what will happen next or how she was going to find out about her husband. It somewhat has some realism put into it but then, probably only a few can relate to what happened and how it happened to Kathryn. I love the cover though!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No-brainer!","review":"NY Times best seller?! Recommended by Oprah?! What did I miss?!

It was just a ho-hum romance, and a little on the depressing side. But an easy read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A quick, easy read but very similar to a soap opera","review":"The question how well do we really know someone isn't particulaly relevent to the novel. The question should really be, how naive do we let ourselves be? I didn't think that it was a huge shock that Kathryn didn't know about her husbands double life. Based on the flashbacks that Shreve provides in every other chapter it was clear that Kathryn's marriage was falling apart and she jsut didn't want to face the truth. Furthermore, the novel is one of the most predictable I've ever read. The whole question of how real we really know someone is a good one. Unfortunately, it is not well presented in this case. The whole idea of leading a double life with another family is trite and similar to an episode of Dynasty or All My Children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just when you think that you know your soulmate....","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, for it had my attention from beginning until the end. I was quite sad to know that Kathyrn's mate had a secret life outside of the city of Ely, MA. At the very beginning of the story, I felt that he was the perfect mate for her, until the uncovering of his second family. This story is no different from real life stories of infidelities. There are plenty of wives out there who have no idea that their husbands have fathered other children, while still married; or that they are secretly married to other women, simultaneously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry as Dust","review":"Please give me a break! Could this book have moved along any slower and been any more depressing. My advice- Skip it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat characters in a boring plot","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. I found it impossible to like or care about the characters who had no depth. And the plot was very predictable. There are so many wonderful books being written, I'm appalled that this is the best thing Oprah could find to recommend and make into a best-seller. Other people who bought it must feel as cheated as I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lightweight","review":"I ordered The Triumph and the Glory and The Pilot's Wife to find out for myself what all of the fuss was about. The Triumph and the Glory was terrific, a truly stunning novel. The Pilot's Wife was very mediocre, a lightweight effort, I can't believe Anita Shreve wrote it, she is usually brilliant. Boring plot, wooden characters, a trip to nowhere with no particular enjoyment on the way there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy reading but holds your attention well!","review":"Although the basic story-line is figured out before you get to it, the book is well-written and holds your attention.

A pilot dies and the widow comes to find out she wasn't his only \\"wife\\". It could have been a great novel about love/loss/betrayal - but it just goes on and on as the widow tries to unravel a mystery that my cat could have solved in the time it takes to clean his ears. You finally find out that there is \\"another woman\\" and the novel ends - no rage, no Texas Chainsaw Massacre, no \\"how could he do this to me?\\" just \\"the end\\". There are much better mystery novels out there - like, pretty much anything by Michael Connelly or Amanda Eyre Ward's \\"How to be Lost\\" - but not this!The Pilot's Wife (Oprah's Book Club)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and Predictable","review":"There were only two chapters in the book that kept my attention. The rest of the book I had to push myself through to read. I felt the characters were strange, yet predictable. In fact, the story line is what I expected in the first few chapters. This is not the first Oprah book I didn't care for, however it was part of a book club I belonged to, so I gave it my best shot. I felt it was boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attention all wives!! Read this book!","review":"How true it is...life isn't always as it seems. An example of what life might turn into if you aren't careful. One especially haunting passage describes that she just thought that's what two people who had been married a decade did - fell in love first and then just loved each other. Yet she knew so very little about her husband. How close to home this comes for most of us!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A lesser read than previous picks","review":"I was rather disappointed by The Pilot's Wife. I had grown accustomed to a certain level of literature from the Oprah picks. The Pilot's Wife read more like Danielle Steele than a quality read. I found it predictable, and undeveloped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but there are better books.","review":"It is an 'okay' book, but there are so many true accounts of brave and wonderful women who flew dangerous and unproven aircraft during WWII and after, that I don't see why this novel about a pilot's wife should garner such attention. My advice is to skip it, and pick up a non-fiction account of actual women pilots. I'd especially recommend Haynsworth's \\"Amelia Earhart's Daughters\\" or Van Keil's \\"Those Wonderful Women and Their Flying Machines.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT READ!","review":"There are few and far-between great spinners of a tale as Anita Shreve. I have read ALL her books and find each one a page-turner. My favorite is Weight of Water and I must say, if use Oprah as a guideline for books, at times you should reach further than her one \\"suggestion\\" with an author. Anita Shreve is great! The Pilot's Wife was a wonderful novel and everyone should read all of Shreve's works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable schmaltz","review":"I recognize that there are good elements to this book: it's obvious that Anita Shreve knows how to write, and it was easy to imagine scenes and characters from her descriptions. It was the STORY that stunk. It was a boring, obvious, predictable story that only a Harlequin reader would have been entranced by. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pilot's Wife: A Novel","review":"I could not put this book down! Although I figured out what might happen, I was somewhat suprised at the twist regarding the other woman's political involvement and how Robert got involved with her and the danger so whole heartedly. I felt sad and mad at how much of himself he did not share with Katheryn, she deserved more. This was a good book, it made me think about relationships in my own life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once you pick this one up you'll never put it down...","review":"This book was WONDERFUL! The writing within all aspects of this truly intricate story were fabulous. The stark yet startlingly accurate descriptions of grief were excellent at bringing you inside the minds of the characters during those incredibly sensitive moments. It was also exciting to see the pace of the narrative change entirely as the plot twists began to be revealed. If you read books so that you can be transported into the story, this is a great choice for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Book!","review":"Dear Anita Shreve, Hi, I am Hollie Swicegood A senior at North Iredell Hih SChool. I live in Statesville North Carolina. For my library assistant class, my assignment was to read and book and email the author to tell how I liked the book. I really enjoyed the book the Pilots Wife. It was a book that I couldnt put down. I really liked how the book was written. After Jack was assumed dead, along with everyone on the plane, you kept telling stories of his life with Kathyrn and his daughter Mattie. That kept suspense and story interesting. I look forward to reading more of your books! Thank youSincerely Hollie Swicegood"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"I generally enjoy SOME of Oprah's books, but this one was definitely a poor choice.

However, the book is really well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It!","review":"The plot of this story is unique and keeps the reader turning pages. I admit that I thought the first part of the book is too long with a lot of filler, and the second part of the book develops too quickly and certainly ends abruptly. Shreve described Kathryn's grief in so much detail and in great length, but hardly anything was said about her feelings of his second family. I had so many questions unanswered after the last page was turned. However, in this story, that was one of the pleasers as well because it left me to imagine.The book left me wanting more....that's what I like to feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll stay up all night reading this one!","review":"The Pilot's Wife is a great read.

Beautifully written, how it flashed back to scenes with her and Jack, it fit perfectly. I was always interested and looking forward to continue with this story even though the story made me so sad.

I felt like I'd read it or watched it somewhere before. The storyline was predictable.

We are taken on a journey into the life of a woman who has lost her husband (an airline pilot).

This isn't such a new concept and so I found the plot was a bit borring. Yea, I wish I were a pilot so I could have multiple families, or at least wifes in different cities. But, the \\"why\\" - is not fully addressed. She makes an attempt at the end, but give up without really trying, just asking the questions. The book is great in its description of a spouse learning of the sudden death of the other, but lacks in any detail as to why the husband would do what he did. The writing was tight and you moved through the book fast. Maybe no - one knows why this happens but the book makes you think.It's on Oprha's list so read it and you'll have something to talk about at cocktail parties."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pilots wife","review":"EXCELLENT !

I love Anita Shreve I think she is a fabulous writer-easy to read ,easy to follow, excellent stories!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Pilot's Wife","review":"This is a light read and an okay book if you don't have anything else to do. I have a problem, however, with books where you can anticipate each step of the way before you get there. Maybe that comes from having read too many accounts of situations like this in real life.Writing is not easy, and getting a story to the point of publication is even more difficult. So I have given this book two stars for the effort and tenacity of the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do I care?","review":"I started to read this book awhile ago, but couldn't get through it. So, I picked it up again when I needed something to read while I wait. Some of the descriptions were long and tedious. I thought the author was too caught up in the language and didn't put enough energy into keeping the story going."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling!","review":"I loved this book - I thought the author did a great job of combining both suspense and emotion to make a book that I literally could not put down until it was finished.

I have not read any other Anita Shreve books but I can promise you I will - the Pilot's Wife has sold me!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable With A Capital \\"P\\"","review":"I couldn't believe how predictable this novel turned out to be! From the very beginning, the plot seemed to move along without any real help from the author. Any reader with half an imagination can figure out what will happen within the first chapter. I do think that this book has potential, though. The whole concept of \\"really knowing another person\\" is one that could be explored in depth and worked into a captivating and original plot. That's what I thought Shreve would do with this novel, but I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Send this book back to the drawing board!","review":"This book reminds me of a college student who has a great idea but waits until the last minute to develop it - with the result being a quasi-developed mishmash.The author cannot seem to decide whether this book is the story of a woman's journey towards self growth OR a mystery. She could have successfully combined these two genres - but does not develop the story or the protagonist well enough to successfully achieve this.The \\"happily ever after\\" ending is way too pat. I felt that she could not decide how to end the book and this ending worked for her.This book was published while still in its embryonic stage. Send it back to the drawing board!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is #1?","review":"An insipid story where the action moves quicly without much reasoning behind the movement. The characters were not developed in a fashion where they were known to the reader except on a superficial level. Fortunately, it was a very quick read, thus not much time was wasted. It's popularity shows how hype can sell. I feel I wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, predicatable, wordy & a drag","review":"The book took forever to get to a point. The chapters were wordy and dull. Too much description of rooms and furnishings. I was very frustrated as I continued to finish the book in 3 1/2 hours just to get to a point. Nothing at all about the characters or story was original or interesting. I saw this double life of a pilot scenario on a bad Lifetime movie not too long ago. The sad attempt to politicize the crash was downright embarrasing. It's as if the author was grasping to tie it all together at the end.It's a shame, I so looked forward to reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF TIME","review":"I read this book and there is only one word for it completly predictable.

It was at about the same level as a Harlequin Romance novel. The story was ridiculous, predictable and totally stupid. This book was really bad! There was no character development -- nothing of interest. I can't believe that Oprah would recommend a book like this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you wondering what it's like to be married to a pilot...","review":"Having been a pilot's wife for almost 16 years, I found this novel both stunningly realistic, and outrageously ridiculous. Kathryn's internal monologue the night Robert shows up on her doorstep to reveal the news is chillingly accurate...I don't know a pilot's wife who hasn't run this scenario through her head a million times and wondered how she would take her ever next breath if it ever really happened. We all have had late-christmases, postponed birthdays, and the vague feeling that we are always being left behind. I often tease my husband about having \\"another wife\\" in Detroit (his base)when forgets if he has told me something, but Jack actually did! I'm not sure what kind of ending this book had. Like so many others, I was left with an empty, confused feeling. Maybe a sequel is pending? One thing is for sure, Ms. Shreve spoke to airline people before writing this book. Definitely worth reading, but buy the paperback not the hard-cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vivid Emotionality","review":"Pilot's Wife was my first exposure to the writing of Anita Shreve. It's not the plot so much that captured by attention, but the emotional travels taken by the main character. Accurate. Compelling. A sound depiction of what is experienced by the human heart and mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"50 ways to write about grief","review":"How many ways can you write about grief? This book goes on and on, describing in a multitude of ways how poor pitiful Katherine grieves. Give me a break! The first 3/4 of the book is about how she grieves all the time. The last part is too unbelieveable. I am sorry I wasted my time on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grabbed me at the start, and didn't let go!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. Although an unbelievable plot, it was still an escape into another world that I was not familiar with. Reading of Kathryn's pain, I was able to put myself into her shoes, and experience her life for a moment. Shreve does an excellent job of painting a picture that you feel like you can reach out and grab. I would definetly reccommend this for a leisurly afternoon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well written, very predictable","review":"I am sorry to say that I was very disappointed by The Pilot's Wife.

Nothing more."},{"rating":"1","title":"not realistic whatsoever","review":"I just couldn't believe the things that occurred in this novel....they were too **outrageous**(?) The prose on pain and emotional suffering was well written, but still a slow book. If your time is precious, this is not a book to leave you feeling satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably the worst book I've ever read","review":"I think my subject line says it all. I forced myself to finish the entire book, thinking it would get better or have a great ending. It was boring, predictable, and frustrating. Kathryn was a weak and annoying woman, and I didn't find myself caring about her character at all. I also didn't like how every other chapter would alternate between present and past...so cheesy. Terrible ending!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I would have read these reviews before reading it.","review":"I found this book .. boring ..

It ended too quick and I wanted more out of the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is horrible!","review":"What I want to know is why Oprah is recommending this book when there are better contemporary authors to choose from. The characters (besides Kathryn)are all under developed and the story just gets worse and worse as the book goes on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindnumbingly unrealistic","review":"Totally ridiculous to imagine that the extremely uninteresting Kathryn takes her husband's death so lightly as to brush off her daughter's sex life and start flirting with the man hired to investigate! And just when it started to become a slight bit interesting (postulating how a man could manage two families), Shreve throws in the IRA bit.... why? Just to appeal to a different demography of readers? Really, Oprah, your book choices are usually excellent. You must have been distracted during the hour and a half it took to get through this after-school-special."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiction is one thing; this was preposterous!","review":"Oprah's standard's mustn't be very high. I was quite disappointed. The book started off suspensefully enough, but the plot became totally ridiculous. Fiction is one thing, but this became so silly that I lost my sympathy for Kathryn. Each character seemed stupider than the next. It was a quick, easy read , but it did not live up to the good start."},{"rating":"1","title":"world's dumbest wife","review":"Although this book captured your attention, the time it took to find out about Jack's other life was much too long. Kathryn sounded rather intelligent so why did she not suspect anything about her husband when she could not even call him when he traveled. She had to leave a voicemail?? The book was really annoying because of the above and also because it had a stupid ending. What would motivate Jack to become involved in irish terrorist activities? An irish second wife is just not enough. It was a dumb book and I am glad I did not buy it (I got it from a friend). If I had known it was a Oprah selection, I would not have read it as I consider every book I have read which was an Oprah pick too dreary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, dry, and uneventful - don't bother reading this one","review":"I read the book on a flight from Dallas to DC. I finished it only in hopes that something exciting would happen, but nothing did. The writing was dry and flavorless. Oprah usually does a better job at picking them."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really WANTED to like this book...","review":"but I just couldn't. It was just so, so predictable! In addition, the heroine is a driveling idiot. She is a strong woman and a good mother, but when it came to 'the secret', NO ONE is so dense that they couldn't figure it out. The fact is: a woman knows if something is awry in the marriage. She always knows.By the way, my book seemed to be missing the last page. What's up with that? How very disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Breezy Read, But Kind of Disappointing","review":"Did anyone else finish this book and realize that you never really get a sense of \\"Kathryn\\" the person?

Also, it got a little predictable toward the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING BORING BORING","review":"Well, in my mind, Oprah failed on this one!

The plot twists were merely spice for a story that anybody in the airline industry could tell. It held my interest to the end, but was stereotypical and extremely disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out for the movie","review":"This was the most incredibly shallow book that I have read in some time. Not only did it read with all the poetry that a screenplay provides, but it was not even an interesting screenplay, being both predictable and wide of the mark in terms of the reactions and relations between characters. It is always a shame when an author pitches their work so obviously to Hollywood- and Hollywood doesn't make very many interesting movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Figured it out by just reading 30 pages - waste of time and","review":"Too easy to figure out and should've been a short story.

Now I know why. The writing is average; and the subject matter is too \\"womanly.\\" I'm not knocking books about women by women, but this ain't no \\"God of Small Things\\" by Arundhati Roy. There is something very tedious about the protagonist in this book. One reviewer said this book was like a movie off of Lifetime. That can't be good. Another reviewer said that the most interesting character in this book is the husband, and he's dead! I nearly fell off my chair laughing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book after you get past the first 200 pages","review":"I found the first two hundred pages a bit tedious. Reading reviews, I knew it was about a shocking secret life and the journey of a woman to find out who her husband really was... Only the first two thirds of the book was all about the grieving process of loosing a husband and father. For me, I was waiting for the \\"good stuff\\". The story did take a good turn when we got to the last third of the book, keeping me on the edge of my seat to find out what would happen next. But I wanted to find out more of what made the husband tick... There were too many questions left unanswered, and perhaps that is the point of the story - we really don't know Jack Lyons. While that may be an interesting premise, it makes for a lousy novel.And I have no idea what was up with the ending... total disappointment - the ending alone makes it not worth reading.This could have been a great book - but instead was only mediocre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This novel was disappointing at best. As a \\"real\\" pilot's wife, I found the plot to be far-fetched.The affair with the flight attendant and subsequent marriage was especially predictable. Come on, Ms. Shreve, you can be more original than that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start, poor middle, dreadful end","review":"Whilst the initial element of suspense and touch of the unknown lead you to fly through the first 40-50 pages, disappointment rapidly sets in with the typical Danielle Steele love element and the truly awful Irish connection all adding up to a poor TV drama. The charactors (approx 4 main) are dull and listless. Even the main female lead is of a personality that makes you almost sympathise with the husband. The daughter - if only she'd been on the plane, and the grandmother - what was her name? Perhaps if you're looking for a truly featherweight read and you can't get your hands on a Harry Potter..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"I only bought this because the plot sounded interesting, however once I started it I had a hard time sticking with it. It was unbelievably slow and boring! I was so annoyed at wasting my money on it! I usually devour my books and reread them over the years. This book became my \\"in the bathroom\\" book and after I was done I immediately got rid of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waiting for the heart stopping plot twist....it never came.","review":"This was not what I expected. Characters were not developed, description of the emotions too \\"bubble-gum\\", the whole middle could heve been left out and you would have had the story anyway.

Should have bought Memoirs of a Geisha."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN...............","review":"I have to agree with many reviewers who ask...\\"How did this come to be an Oprah book?\\" It read like a boring afternoon soap opera. I guessed every step of the way...not really caring about these flat underdeveloped characters. When I was finished, my first question was \\"Was it REALLY possible that with ALL the authorities from many organizations working on the case (going through his belongings AND seizing his computer?)....the Pilots Wife unravels it all herself first? AND...after the short period from the time of the tragedy to the completion of the book...the author found that to be enough time to end the book with Kathryn actually caring about Muire's children? MAYBE in time...but c'mon! Gee...No stages of mourning for this wife, huh?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh! so true","review":"Began the book by not even reading the back cover but just guessed that he had someone else. Ofcourse I am not saying that all pilots are leading such a double life but when MEN have the type of jobs which take them away, are difficult to contact,(now mobile phones help!) then the chances and opportunites are all there.

I'd recommend it to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Distressing book with odd plot twists","review":"This book is not poorly written. I read it in one weekend, and did not want to stop, but I did not like it at all. It was disturbing what horrible things The Pilot of the title did and hid. The final explanation of what motivated all his actions seemed very far-fetched and not well-explained at all. This is the only book I have read by Anita Shreve, and suspect she is a talented writer from what I saw in this book, but the story itself was too disturbing for me to enjoy. I also lost some respect when I read the official press release sent to me about the book and noticed two typos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"This is the last time I ever purchase a book without reading the first few pages...Extremely predictable plot with the auther stretching out the story with inane fillers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-written, but very predictable","review":"I concede from the start that Ms. Shreve is a talented author. In this book, she very subtly paints a portrait of a woman living an \\"ordinary\\" life in what she believes is a good marriage. This depiction is thoroughly convincing as are the New England setting and the supporting characters. Unfortunately, she saddles us with an extremely predictable plot and the book grinds forward until every foretold event unfolds. A few \\"twists\\" are thrown in near the climax but there is no real depth or emotion to any of it. At the very end, when something new and creative would be required to hold the reader's interest, the story abruptly stops. My impression is that this could be, with editing, the first third of a great book. While it is a disappointing read, I'd certainly try another of Ms. Shreve's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing.... predictable","review":"I was disappointed by this book, the first I read by Anita Shreve. It was not gripping or really very interesting. I kept reading thinking it would get better, but it didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another brilliant book by Anita Shreve","review":"I loved this book. It was beautifully written but it is also a good plot. It would be hard enough to lose your partner in an accident, but to find out they had betrayed you at the same time. It is hard to imagine. But the novel brings out all of that anger, loss and heartbreak brilliantly at the same time as avoid anything too predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not compelling enough","review":"The idea for this book is excellent; a woman lives a life of wedded bliss until her husband dies under suspicious circumstances and she finds out the secrets that he kept from her.However, I did not feel the emotion that could have been there. My connection to the main character was not strong and her story did not make a lasting impression on me.We used this book for a girls-only book club selection and had some great off-shoot discussions about the topic but not particularly the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than mediocre due to a slow and predictable tale.","review":"The book progresses slowly to a predictable end. Even the \\"twist\\" that the author adds at the end comes across as a last desperate effort to make the reader feel that they didn't waste their time. It is awkward and unsatisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"very very good","review":"Dieses Buch hat mich schon sehr lange fasziniert.

Throughout the book I was trying to envision scenerios for the ending and came no where close to how the story played out. This story was beautifully written, powerfully played out with characters you developed a place in your heart for. Do we ever really know someone? After reading this book I realize I will now question my own judgement about future relationships. I only wish the story did not end there. I encourage Anita to write a sequel for those of us who need to know where the story goes and indeed \\"how are the children?\\"Sincerely,Laurie Johnson Anchorage, Ak"},{"rating":"1","title":"Book was a disappointing read with unbelievable plot line.","review":"The Pilot's Wife is a frustrating read in that the main character, Kathryn is out of control in her own home from the first page. I am surprised that Oprah chose a book about a woman who is a victim, opening the door of her home to a stranger and allowing him to take over her life without asking important questions. Mostly the questions weren't asked so that manipulation of the reader and the suspense could continue to the last 75 pages of the book. Who could relate to a woman without a clue? This book is just not believable. I also resented the comment from the main character,a high school music teacher, that the best thing about a small school was the shortness of the awards assembly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic book!!!","review":"I loved this book. It is thought provoking, sad, and intoxicating. I have read it three or four times.I don't know why I was so moved by this book. The story isinteresting and well written. I fell in love with Katheryn,and even her scoundrel husband. The daughter was realisticallyportrayed, a bratty teenager.I am obviously NOT a writer. I just wanted toconvey what a stirring, haunting tale it is. Readthis book!You don't want to miss this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG DISSAPOINTMENT","review":"The plot was so slow I had to force myself to finish the book. This was the first, and most likely last of Anita Shreve's book for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the last time I read an Oprah endorsed book","review":"I feel that the few books that I have read endorsed by Oprah have all been the same; women as victims, while I feel it's great she is endorsing reading for the masses, we need books of more substance.This felt like a screenplay for a television movie of the week. I didn't care about the characters as they were so thinly developed. Typical of this genre of novels, she is duped by the man in her life and left to fend for herself - and ultimately, it doesnt feel like she triumphs at all. The details were so messy and implausible, I found it rather aggrevating. Never have I seen in the news the family of the pilot of a commercial airline exposed like a celebrity - can you name me one? I read it - but I also eat potato chips and eat ice cream once and a while - the prognosis for this book is; it's full of air and has no nutritional value but won't hurt you if you limit your intake of things like this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple book","review":"Simple book for the simple minded, pass on this. Trust me, go get another Oprah book if you have to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hannah HighSchool could have done better.","review":"If this is an example of Anita Shreve's writing, it'll be the only book of hers I'll ever read. Really dumb character development."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!! I coudn't put it down!","review":"I started reading this book and I did not stop. I read until 1:00 in the morning. I took me 1 day. The story is so easy to follow. One thing leads to another, and there's just no place to stop, you keep wondering what could happen next. I almost didn't read this book because the comments were so negative, but I'm glad I did. An excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A SOLID read throughout with a bit of a weak ending.","review":"This book was an extremely interesting and enjoyable read. It kept me entertained until we found out the secret that Jack was keeping in London. Once this secret was out, I think the book lost its zest. Basically the last twenty pages were the weak link to an other wise very entertaining read. Shreves' writing is extremley detailed and she makes you feel like you are right there. Recommended -**** out of *****."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs down!!!!!","review":"Very disappointing!!! Too many gaps; the writer jumps all over the place. After reading 3/4 of the book, the plot is reveal and it turns out to be a dud going downhill fast!This is first grade reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping and captivating. Shreve never lost my attention.","review":"From the very first page I was captivated by Shreve and her ability to spin a great tale. I only wish it was a longer book, because I read it too fast!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting and Emotional","review":"This novel explores the many stages of grief, from shock and horror to acceptance. Kathryn's character development is somewhat weak throughout the book -- I wanted her to triumph over adversity or at least begin a believable road to recovery. The ending was a let down. On a positive note, the story was intriquing, in an \\"emotional-rollercoaster\\" kind of way. I wouldn't bring this to a book club, if you want to keep your friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling, Fast Read!!!","review":"I thought that this book was a very enjoyable read. I found that there was something about it that pulled me right along. The author dances to the edge of the absurd, but somehow she pulls it all together. It worked for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time","review":"Unfortunately, once I start reading a book, I am committed to finish it. I found this book to be shallow, very one-dimensional with a plot that is too predictable. The plot does not expand beyond the main character's anguish. A dozen or so pages before the book ends, I was teased with some intrigue, then the plot slides back to the same morose track. It could have been a thought provoking book, but instead it lead me down a one way street that didn't go anywhere. By the time I finished reading the book, I was angry. Angry that I had to read the whole thing. The gutt-wrenching emotions that readers witness throughout the book is very real, but the unravelled \\"secrets\\" in the plot are cheesy at best. What a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, Easy Read","review":"I read the Pilot's Wife to be an enjoyable, easy read and a bit overwhelming at times. Shreve's novel captured my attention, with her descriptive language and easily digestable plot (yes, it was a bit predictable, but it didn't diminish the story). A good summer book -- not too complicated and not very time consuming."},{"rating":"1","title":"It could have been better","review":"I really got into the book at the beginning but then it just seemed to drag on and on and on.... etc.Then to read the hole book and not like the ending just disappointed me. It was very predictable. I did like the plot of the book though, but felt it could have been better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big waste of time -disappointed in Oprah","review":"Don't waste your time on this one, its chief merit being that is is easy to read, but so is Danielle Steele. The plot is absurd and the characters are banal and unbelievable, and to top it off, Shreve throws in the IRA. Give me a break! In the end, the reader has no inkling what motivated any of the characters in their ultimately crazy lives. but then, who cares?"},{"rating":"1","title":"slow going from the beginning--but got better toward the end","review":"Very dull & boring from the beginning, from the previous reviews I read I really thought it was going to be a good book. I was very disappointed Actually the last half of the book was good. (two last words) dry & blah!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A read until it's read book","review":"This is the best book I've read in ages and I'll definitely be reading Anita Shreve's others. In addition to skillful handling of grief, it brings up the scary idea that we don't know the person we know best as well as we thought we did. Shreve is excellent at dropping hints that you don't notice until later--the marble bench in the garden that makes no splash in your consciousness until it turns out to be an altar, Jack being good at surprises (buying the house). It you really want to see how well this subject is handled, watch the movie Random Hearts. Spouses dying in plane crash leads to discovery of affair. Wife wants to forget the whole thing; husband wants to be angry. Lasts over 2 hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotional journey, I loved every minute of it","review":"The love story here didn't have the power or mystery of the chemistry between Wilson and Gabrielle in my other favorite of the year, The Triumph & Glory, but Shreve made up for it with a riveting plot. A very good book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A quick and entertaining read","review":"I finished this book in one day (and night) - Labor Day. Not much else to do that day I guess. I enjoyed it - not a really great book but a good read. I noticed that Anita Shreve has another book coming out in Jan. 2000 - \\"Fortune's Rock\\". I beleive their was a place in this book called Fortune's Rock. Could this be the sequel to Pilot's Wife? If so, maybe we will find out more about the IRA plot twist which was so vague, what \\"A\\" is, Kathryn's interest in the welfare of the other children, and of course a romance between Kathryn and Robert."},{"rating":"1","title":"This story is disappointingly predictable and boring.","review":"The Pilot's Wife is an attempt to explore the grieving process of a young woman and her daughter after the crash of a plane flown by her obviously (from the start) unfaithful pilot husband. The process is complicated by answers to the wife's search for meaning behind the crash, and, ultimately, details of her past husband's personal life. Get a clue, Kathryn. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"No one knows another as well as they think","review":"I found the book a rivetting read. The pain and anguish of losing Jack transmitted to me. I was taken on the grief journey along with his family and I wanted answers too.Anita Shreeve reached into a woman's heart and described the pain and loss she felt at losing her partner, and her daughter's father.I was completely at the mercy of the author because I wanted answers to my questions and to find out why Jack had died.Another page turner for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down...","review":"The kind of book you pick up and never want to put down, even if it means to go to sleep... Two days later, I was done!I highly recommend this novel, it keeps you on your toes and makes you think... do we really know the people in our lives, even the ones who are close to our hearts?Hmmm... and what if...Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging book and easy to read","review":"This was a nice book to interject between 2 heavy novels. The Pilot's Wife tells a story of a woman married to a pilot who goes down with his plane (this happens in the first couple of pages, so I'm not blowing anything big here). The rest of the book follows the widowed woman's journey finding out a whole other life about her husband that she didn't know existed. The book will keep you engaged (easy to get engaged also), and provides an easy read. Refreshing after reading a very heavy novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly plot line leads to formulaic ending...","review":"This book can be summed up as such: Girl gets boy. Girl loses boy. Girl replaces boy with strong silent type and lives happily ever after. Ho-Hum!Other than a quick moving movie-of-the-week plot line this book offers little more substance than a store brand, caffeine free, diet soda. The events are predictable, the characters are formulaic and the circumstances are difficult to swallow (ask yourself why she didn't hire a lawyer early on...c'mon).The only thing that might have saved this book would have been a hard look at why her husband did what he did. But we can only guess at his motivation because...well...he was dead before the story began (literally). Sheesh.If you're on the beach or in a plane or killing time in a waiting room, and need something to occupy your mind for a stretch, pick up this nonsense and escape for a bit. But if, like me, you need something that is less Meg Ryan and more Meryl Streep then don't waste 300 pages here."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Chick Book","review":"A commercial airliner mysteriously blows up off the coast of Ireland. The doomed pilot's wife, Kathryn, discovers that Jack has a 'wife'(Muire) in Britain and has fathered two young children through their union. Although Jack never goes to church with Kathryn, with Muire he's a dedicated, church-going Roman Catholic. So far, so good. What I cannot accept and find absolutely preposterous is that a commercial pilot would merely pick up a bag to take on his aircraft without first inspecting the contents. That Kathryn's new love interest, Robert, is part of the investigation is also a stretch. But, this is a chick book and doesn't require any deep thinking."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book will make you think","review":"This book will make you think about things that maybe you never wanted to think about before! Of course, the book is entirely fictional but it will make you question your thoughts. Some might say that they know what is going to happen. In the back of my mind I knew what was going to happen also, but not to the extent that it did. A GREAT BOOK. Im now going to read her other 6 books. (I read this one in a day)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it - from a \\"real pilot's\\" wife","review":"I'm a wife of a pilot and I was personally offended by how \\"we\\" were portrayed. I doubt that any pilot's spouse would be so naive. I know where my husband is every minute of the day and believe me, I would know if he was leading a double life. It would be more plausible for the pilot's spouse to have a double life. I read the entire book hoping it would get better...don't make the same mistake that I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pilots Wife Reviewed","review":"Anita Shreve's novel \\"The Pilots Wife\\" was an excellent novel, I enjoyed it thoroughly, and although it was predictable, it almost had me in tears the whole way through. It is very touching and makes me wonder what would happen if something similar were to happen to me. Shreve tells the story in a very delicate way, yet manages to evoke so much of the reader's emotion that they just want to put their arms around the main character. Wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting reading","review":"I thought this was a quick and interesting read. It was a good story that kept my interest...I read it in one day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I read this after \\"The Weight of Water\\", which I thought was excellent. This book was very predictable - you could see the plot coming a mile away. I think in general, her reputation as a writer is overstated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing low-brow novel","review":"One of the reasons I read this book was because I saw the author had taught at Amherst college in western Mass. If this is the quality of writing skills they teach at that school then my previously high regard for the school has gone down.This is at best a trashy holiday-read. Shallow characters (characters get introduced but never developed), stereotypes (dashing tall airline pilots) and plot elements borrowed from every direction thrown into a blender.The underlying premise of the book was good (do you every really know somebody), but Ms Shreve needs to go on a creative-writing course to learn how to turn that into a well-written novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing novel","review":"After reading I Know This Much is True, by Wally Lamb, I was eager to try another of Oprah's selections. The Pilot's Wife had an intriguing premise... Unfortunately, I found the characters to be shallow and one-dimensional, and found the story extremely predictable. Relationships between the characters were unrealistic, and the main character was an unflattering example of today's average married woman; if I was supposed to empathize with her, I couldn't... her clinginess and emotional dependence probably contributed greatly to her husband's desire to get away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly","review":"If you want to read a good novel about a pilot and his women try \\"the triumph & the glory\\", or even that old Hailey book, \\"airport\\". Shreve just concocts a bunch of silly melodrama here"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful, poorly written with a undeveloped plot. Laughable.","review":"This book is, without a doubt, the worst piece of fiction I have read to date.I realised from the outset that it was going to be a dreadful waste of my time and intelligence. Why then did I read on? Insomnia and no other reading material at hand. I suspect it was my sado-masochistic streak which propelled me to inflict such pain on myself. The characters are bland and poorly developed. I felt no empathy whatsoever for Kathryn and her one-dimensional daughter.The plot was badly woven, the story written in a childish style.Just when I thought things couldn't get any worse Shreve threw in the IRA out of the blue. Just stuck it in there at the end so she could finish up. What an insult to our intelligence. Why did Oprah include this amateur rubbish in her selection? The next time I see that \\"Oprah\\" label, I'll run a mile in the opposite direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly written, poorly read","review":"While listening to this book on tape, I twice had to look at the cover to make sure it wasn't the abridged version. Kathryn made life changing decisions and momentous discoveries with such breakneck, willy-nilly speed that I thought I must have missed large portions of the book. Rarely have I encountered such an irritatingly witless heroine. To further add to my disgust, the narrator of the unabridged audio version often gave an odd emphasis to words, making it difficult to grasp the author's meaning without rethinking the phrase to oneself with normal emphasis. Also, my advice to narrators is that if you can't do an accent, don't even try--it's distracting and embarassing to hear someone try to struggle through a now you hear it, now you don't execrable Irish brogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book is also a bomb!!!","review":"There are two bombs to the book, \\"The Pilot's Wife\\"--the first one that was found in Jack's handbag on the aircraft, which lead to the explosion and the death of hundreds of passengers; the second bomb is the book itself.The book was shallow and totally predictable. I think I must have seen the same story line in about 10 movies already. No reason to hash it out once more in paperback.The only redeeming qualilty of this book is its cover. Besides that--everything is trite and uneventful. Doesn't probe the mind nor fascinate the reader. Cheap entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"After having read such wonderful books like \\"The Rapture of Canaan\\" and \\"I Know This Much Is True\\" where on earth did this book come from? I was intrigued by the story line, but this book fell flat. The characters were one-dimensional and the writing...I was bored and disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Thing I Borrowed It","review":"When I started this I thought it would be a good read because I was attracted to the writing style. But the writing style alone does not make a book. There was a sense of emotional detachment and underdeveloped characters. I thought Jack's secret life was more shocking than it actually was. And Kathryn's relationship with her daughter was repaired too quickly in the end. They should have been affected much more by the secret life their husband and father was leading. Wouldn't they have needed therapy, or something? And Robert--what was the point of him? He and Kathryn seemed to be attracted to each other, but their relationship was so ambigious it was annoying. Save your money. The writing style is excellent, but there's nothing really enlightening here."},{"rating":"1","title":"An easy read is not always a good read","review":"I left this book feeling unsatisfied and in a way, grateful that is was over. I felt the book insulted my intelligence by asking me to believe anything within its pages. BORING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"Friends told me this was a great book. The author was focused on the relationship between mother and daughter and seemed to throw in the rest without going into detail. A lot of expansion could of been done here. I also would like to mention that I was disappointed in the last line of the book. It seemed out of place. Shame on Oprah for recommending this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I read all kinds of books from the most simple and predictable to the very involved and detailed. I can find appealing aspects in all kinds of writing. This book has none. It was the the most boring read I have ever had. It is below 1 star and worse than a really bad Lifetime movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Read","review":"This is the first book I have read in years that I could not even bear to finish.

Let me know if I missed anything!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent read","review":"The Pilot's Wife was overall pretty much just \\"okay.\\" I didn't feel a connection with any of the characters even if I felt bad for Kathryn.

A quick read; \\"no brainer;\\" good for the beach type book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and dull","review":"I did not particularly enjoy this book for several reasons. First of all, I had absolutely no sympathy or any feeling at all for the main character. Secondly, her husband was a caricature of a man and it felt as though Shreve had spent very little time exploring his side of the story and more just trying to shock the reader with his betrayal. I have a hard time not finishing a book once I get started, and I did manage to make it to the end, but was bitterly disappointed by the conclusion. The one male character that was introduced ends up being her savior and her mate....blech....I would not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"well written and detailed","review":"From the first page of the book I felt I was there with Kathryn.

The characters are one dimensional and Mattie is too bratty to command any sympathy. I find it hard to believe this isn't the author's first book. What's with the constant and very annoying references to arms (crossed over the chest; crossed over the face, etc. etc. etc)?? Reads like a reject from Writing 101.

Three strikes and she's out as far as I'm concerned!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One hell of a page turner!","review":"Kathryn bring you into her world and does not let you go until the last words that leave her mouth.

(I don't.) I was skeptical, but I love to read and don't mind taking recommendations. What a waste of a couple of hours this book was. The writing was flat, the characters were practically devoid of any realistic emotion, and the plot was so predictable I was just waiting for the \\"revelation\\" to come through so I could get it over with to see how Shreve dealt with it. I found the writing to be subpar and lifeless. I didn't care about this book, the characters or the author. That'll teach me to read ANYthing Oprah recommends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vastly overrated","review":"One of the most hokey, fakey books I have ever read. Melodramatic. Unrealistic. Contrived. NO ONE seemed like a real person. I finished it mainly because the first 2/3rds of the book are an elaborate delaying tactic; by the time I got that far, and the book really started to go off the deep end, I read quickly to the last page just to see how Shreve tied things up. Kathryn, the protagonist, figures the whole \\"mystery\\" out in about two seconds 2/3rds of the way through and then there's a flurry of action in the last 1/3rd. A complete waste of time. There should be a \\"no star at all\\" option. Oprah is out of her mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it -- you'll be glad you did","review":"Terribly disappointing, thoroughly unrealistic tale.

But there's nothing else about this book that I found even remotely compelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and poorly written","review":"This book was a huge disappointment. I can't believe Oprah recommended it. The writing was amateurish. The story was obvious. I wouldn't read this author again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Wordy","review":"I picked up this book because the storyline of a husband with two wives seemed interesting. However, this twist did not appear to almost the end of the book. I felt that once Shreve starting discussing the other wife, it was rushed. Also, the writing was extremely wordy. I often found myself skimming paragraphs and sometimes even pages, which I NEVER do. I love when an author describes a scene, a person, etc so that I can picture it but in my opinion, Shreve took it to an unnecessary extreme."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Plot Holes","review":"Firstly, would a man like Jack really carry aboard a flight bag without taking a peek inside? Especially since he was aware of the danger.Then there's Robert. How convenient that Kathryn has a strong, caring man to fall into during the grieving process. Most women who lose their husbands must grieve alone - Robert's role was too cutesy. All we needed was a Mariah Carey song in the background. Women CAN survive a death without a white knight running in to save the day!!Hands up how many people would let strangers into the house to rummage through drawers? I think not, Anita. You boo-booed here in a big way.Oprah, I love you, but why this dud book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully dull -- NOTHING HAPPENS HERE!","review":"I just finished this dull, dull, dull book, just read the last dull sentence and closed the dull covers (actually, the covers are the most interesting thing here, which just goes to show you that you can't judge a book by, well, you know).Maybe it's a woman's book, but I hate to say that and therefore insult the taste and intelligence of women.I'm not giving anything away when I tell you that this is the story of a woman who becomes a widow and has to deal with the tragedy of her husband's death. We learn all that within the first ten pages. It takes another 200 pages before anything -- I mean ANYTHING -- else happens. And what does happen is both predictable and dumb.It's a bad book, folks. Avoid it like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Could Have Been a Really Good Book","review":"The author came up with a hellava story, there just wasn't enough of it. This was almost a short story with the text looking like something turned in for homework and it had to be X amount of pages.

The story line is interesting, even intriguing, but it has all the trappings of being made for Hollywood. It is a rather flat novel. Shreve does not get far beneath the surface of her characters or of the story. The main characters are stereotypical, and the texture of the various settings is rather empty. WEIGHT OF WATER is, in my opinion, a far superior novel, but even there the historical characters and the crime are what drives the novel and not the contemporary characters of Shreve's imaginiation."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Boring and predictable, couldn't wait to finish it.","review":"Why did I bother to finish it I ask myself? Because I was sure it had to get better. My first Oprah book club book, and if it's anything to go by, definately my last. I found it incredibly predictable and un-challenging. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing ending.","review":"I thought this book was very descriptive, and although slow reading, it had me sucked in. That is. . . until the ending. It was not 'too predictable' as others have said. The ending was far too ludicrous to be predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"starting to read - need clif notes","review":"Our book club is reading this for Aug of 1999. I would like to know if clif notes are available?"},{"rating":"2","title":"great story line, interesting","review":"I thought this was a very good book with a good story line which was entertaining"},{"rating":"1","title":"A very slow read until the final few chapters.","review":"This book seems to go from bad to worse. The author gets very wordy at times with descriptions of completely irrelevant things. Then we are swung completely out in the unbelievable premis of her husband's double life. I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping, hard to put down. Well written and very enjoyable","review":"The book captivates your attention within the first chapeter. The indepts writing style of the author allows you to know the characters, become involved with the plot and stick with it until the end. The writers discriptions allow you to see the events, be a part of them and not loose any connection with the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"This was one of the first books we read in our book club. It has a few twists and turns that we did not see coming! It was a little slow in the bringing but keep reading!! This is a good read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously Dull","review":"The first half is boring, oh the drama...oh the shock. On and on and on. And the characters don't develop at all, they just sink. When the second half picks up, there's no real surprise because by then no one cares. The characters are one dimentional, a couple glimpses of 'back story' just doesn't cut it. The other life that Jack has lived is baffling, but never interesting. In a nutshell its nonsense. As each 'surprise' or 'twist' comes along, you may find the need for another eye roll. Do yourself a favour and leave this one at the $5 booksale, which is what I should have done."},{"rating":"1","title":"An interesting story but not too fulfilling","review":"When I heard about the plot to this novel, I was interested enough to go out and buy the book. As other reviewers have noted, the novel is a quick read and pretty digestible. However, I am disturbed -- personally -- by the focus on gender-specific worlds. For example, Kathryn continually remarks on the \\"masculinity\\" of the pilot's world and how men are always in control. Gender, as we know, is a social construct and Shreve's novel only undermines such thinking. Additionally -- I noted several editoral errors, including a reference to Dierdre's \\"Samantha\\" doll (p.230) which is later referred to as a \\"Molly\\" doll (p.269)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are wives really that dumb and blind?","review":"This would have been a better book if the protagonist (the pilot's wife) wasn't so unbelievably stupid. She and her husband essentially lead separate lives, for years. This is because of his job as a pilot (supposedly). She just goes with the flow and never stops to think if things should really be THAT separate. So....She is easily deceived on a consistent basis, and for a long period of time...yet was totally surprised when the truth was revealed after her husband dies. Real, average women aren't that stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let me just say... UGGGHHHHHH!","review":"HORRIBLE. BORING. PREDICTABLE. There are about 5 interesting pages, you can imagine what the rest is filled with. It is an interesting concept and might have made a WONDERFUL short story, but not a full lenght novel. It was just PAINFULLY boring. Slow, painful, overly descriptive (of nothing), boring. If you've already read it, sorry. If not, keep searching you haven't found the right one yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special about this book","review":"I borrowed this book from a friend that loved it and insisted that I would love it too. The story is interesting, a woman that finds out about her husband's second life only after he dies. It could have been an awesome book if the author actually wrote interest things about the characters and added some thrill to the story. It was mild and boring, boring, boring. I turned every page expecting something interesting to happen and nothing ever happened, it was just very frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hallmark Channel","review":"This was the first Anita Shreve book I read, and the Oprah's Book club choice sticker should have warned me that it was a contrived piece of chick lit. The whole book felt like a syrupy over-draamatisation of a TV movie of the week, with implausible characters and a ludicrous plot. The whole IRA stereotype was jack-hammered in; if a thin plot has any connection to Ireland, the IRA has to be involved! It reminded me of \\"The Long Kiss Goodnight\\" (with super-unbelievable lines as \\"Sinn Finn will take full credit for this!\\" for an IRA attack, and the character's name being Charlie Baltimore), but at least the Long Kiss was funny. This book was an eye-roll; Shreve being the daughter of a commercial airline pilot made it more cringeworthy. Surely she should know better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"well-written mediocrity","review":"I didn't hate this book, but I certainly didn't enjoy it, either. It starts off with a geniune tragedy, and then keeps widening the tragedy with small doses of revelation. There is a bit of mystery, but you can see the big reveal coming some way off.In the end you wind up with several emotionally damaged, tragic women, a male antagonist that is completely reprobate, and another male that casually uses women for his own agenda.I predict this book will end up as a made-for-TV movie on the Lifetime \\"Men are Evil\\" cable channel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I Miss Something?","review":"This is a book I really enjoyed reading. It captivated me fromt he very first page. However, as I got more into the book, and my eagerness to learn more about the plot grew, I seemed to have missed something. Something very important. Or perhaps the story wasn't as clearly written in the end. I finished the book not knowing how it ended. I have re=read it twice now, and still can't figure out the ending. I am so disappointed that such a wonderful book seemed to end so inexplicably. Help me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vastly overrated.","review":"This book was, O.K., but not at all what I expected. The last paragraph was so puzzling and unsettling, I thought my copy was missing a page. It's one thing not to like an ending, it's an entirely different feeling, not to UNDERSTAND the ending. Anita Shreve, please enlighten me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, but not thrilling...","review":"I must say I am a little surprised that this was an Oprah pick. This book doesn't possess near the writing quality of many of her other selections. But it was a good, easy read, a bit predictable, but fairly compelling nevertheless. I'd recommend it on a slow day anytime!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How soon will we see the movie?","review":"Shreve is finally achieving her well desrved commercial success. Check out her previous novels to find her real style. Maybe Kathryn doesn't sustain dramatic personality changes, but Kathryn's loss is the reader's gain. The Pilot's Wife is an important novel. She deals with philosophical issues of perspective that many people never even consider. How could Kathryn assimilate the information that she is given? The foreshadowing that occurs when her daughter reveals her secret indicates Kathryn's reactions are not what we might expect. But how would you react. What is realistic?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Okay.","review":"Although I have to admit I enjoyed this book, I could not understand why it got such rave reviews. It was a very unoriginal story and VERY predictible. This is a perfect example of something that gets so overrated to the point that the reader or viewer is dissapointed... kind of like the Titanic movie. It was okay."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is dark book that wanted to be an adventure.","review":"It is a quick read BECAUSE it is natural to want to skim over the post-death experience. And just when we happen upon the slightest hint of adventure, the book ended. This writer held tightly to the realism of death, which sacrificed what could have been a very scathing, juicy adventure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliche and predictable in a comforting way...","review":"From a literary point of view, the book was written well. The story, however, seemed cliche and predictable. From the moment scraps of paper are found in a husband's (who travels for a living)jeans, another woman is the only possibility. Further, that Muire has children is almost as predictable -- why shouldn't she, just to thicken the plot?I was underwhelmed by the book, thinking that in the age-old struggle for men and women, marriages, and relationships to be understood, there might actually be a fresh twist. Unfortunately, I don't feel as if I found anything fresh, new, or revealing. Perhaps for some readers, however, that is a comfort. For me, it was a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much to do about nothing","review":"I also made the mistake of following Oprah's recommendation. This book was rather disappointing and quite boring. Although I did care about the Pilot's wife and I was surprised about her husband's deceit, it wasn't enough material to write a whole novel. It was predictable and the end of the book was slow to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stunning","review":"Starts off as an incisive and measured meditation on loss and grief, and turns into an hysterical, pulpy and thoroughly unbelievable soap opera about bigamy, terrorism and smuggling. A stunning failure of both craft and imagination. Yes, it is a page turner and one may find it hard to put down, but only in the same way that one might find it hard to look away from a grisly car crash. Overwrought, trashy, awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Pilot's Wife","review":"I have read Anita Shreve before, in her book \\"Where or When\\". I have heard so many people talk about this new book, and decided to read it. I found it very disappointing. The story itself seemed jaded and syrupy. The writing style is trite. I continued to read and finish the book, but literally threw it down in disgust at the end. I feel a book should illuminate you in some way, and it obviously has made an impact on many people. Unfortunately, I was not one of them. I would recommend it as light, entertaining reading only."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe how horrible this book is...","review":"I was hoping \\"The Pilot's Wife\\" would be an enjoyable read and not one I couldn't wait to finish. Anita Shreve's writing is so predictable and boring that you can't wait to actually put the book down. I know this review isn't exactly great, but there isn't much to say about such a poorly written and boring novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another Romance novel!","review":"Publishers think that if you put non-romance novel cover on a romance book that readers will believe it is a great literary work. It worked with this book. This reminded me of Bridges of Madison County."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was very disappointed in Anita Shreve's latest novel. I thought Weight of Water, although it had a terrible ending was intriguing with the two stories told. Eden Close, an earlier novel, was a memorable story of a girl and young man. I didn't connect to any of the characters in Pilot's Wife and I was disappointed that Oprah chose this novel when Shreve's others have been so mcuh better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointed","review":"Having picked up several of Oprah's picks, and having read about the general plot, I was very disappointed. The idea was great, the execution fizzled. Wouldn't recommend it, and I'm wondering if I should pick up the other Shreve book I was contemplating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlike reality","review":"As the wife of a pilot I couldn't wait to read this story. Boy was I disappointed. This book left me bored and let down as I have enjoyed other books by Anita Shreve. None of us are as naive as Kathryn and not all pilots run around (although most people seem to think that they do)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enticing concept, but I was extremely disappointed","review":"I was enthralled with the concept of reading a book which was about not knowing the person to whom you've been married for so many years. However, Kathryn's character was not fully developed and you never get to understand why her husband, Jack became so discontented as to fall in love with the other woman and start on the road to his demise. The ending for me was a total let down...I even thought that my copy of the book was missing a few pages!!! A lot more could have been done to make the story more intriguing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly, manipulative and contrived","review":"The view from this one woman's eyes is claustrophobic. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad if the writing weren't so stilted; the author seems to be trying to create literature, and if so, has failed miserably. Or the problem might be the plot - for goodness sakes, the bereaved and betrayed widow falling in love with the airline representative bearing news of the crash is a bit too much. And then we have annoyingly stupid details as when, after footsteps are heard inside, a door is opened \\"abruptly, as though the person behind it were expecting a delivery.\\" Huh? Sorry to have spent the time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite","review":"This story is ridiculous. Interesting concept, but that's about it. The characters are never, ever developed and I so wanted them to be. They are cartoons! It's as if a child wrote this...how did this even get published? I feel foolish for having bought it, (and I paid full price), but I was desperate for a \\"read\\".The characters are shallow enough to make a \\"fabulous\\" Demi Moore feature film...look for it, it's bound to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"a good book for the beach or an airplane trip","review":"Although this book is not the quality literature that I have come to expect of Oprah's picks, it was light and readable. I would recommend it for a lazy summer afternoon at the beach or for an airplane trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughably bad","review":"Who talks like this except on daytime television? I'm not sure where Anita Shreve learned to write dialogue and I can't fathom how she's qualified to teach writing. The book rings false from start to finish which made it impossible to care for any of the characters. Jack's double life is preposterous--the only thing more ridiculous is that his wife didn't have a clue! I recommend avoiding this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"It was like a T.V. movie. It sort of keeps your attention, but ultimately, it was just a way to kill a few hours. I thought the Robert character was entirely weird, even creepy. Who would want a stranger hanging out with your family, day after day, when you're mourning the death of your husband?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Pilot's Wife","review":"I just finished reading this book this morning. After reading 'The Last Time They Met', I decided to read another Shreve piece. It was a little disappointing, although I could not put it down because I wanted to get throught to the end to see exactly what Jack had been up to all that time. Makes people in relationships question how well they really know their partners. The ending was very predictable. I kept flipping back through the pages and re-reading some of the earlier chapters because I thought I had missed something. Read it if you have the time, but don't go out of your way!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Well this was CERTAINLY a disappointment. This is the first book I have read that was recommended by the now defunct \\"you know who's\\" Book Club. There was no believeable character development thus no empathy ensued for the book's characters. And to boot, there were improbable situations and reactions by all characters in the book. I slogged through the book as I am recovering from surgery. I'd have been better off napping. Perhaps her other books are better?"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you've seen a Lifetime movie you know how this story goes","review":"I made the mistake of blindly following the recommendations of the Oprah book club and buying this book. When I got into the gist of the story I had already figured out one of the \\"secrets.\\" It was predictable and overdramatic. If you must read this one, don't waste your money--check it out from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very tedious book","review":"I tried to think of an apt word to describe this book, and after a while came up with \\"tedious\\". Tedious people, tedious plot, tedious writing, apart from the gaping holes in the plot. How long would it take the newspapers to ferret out the fact that that the man had two families? It wouldn't go unnoticed for long. It has not encouraged me to try any more of the authors books."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an enormous waste of my time!!!!","review":"Can not tell you how much I hated this book. Way to many words to describe nothing. Sooo unimaginative, sooo predictable, a pilot having another wife and family...this is a surprise??? why I even bothered to read this, I kept thinking it was going to get better. This is my third read of Oprahs book club...now I know that if she has recommended it...avoid it! After I finished it I screamed out of frustration over wasted time. So glad I have a means to vent my great great frustration over such a STUPID book!!!! Enormous waste of paper and ink...YUCK!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good, yet sad, read.","review":"This is a very popular book, but it has a sad story. I felt badly for Kathryn and Mattie, who thought they had a normal happy family, but really didn't. I also thought that the IRA stuff was a little far-fetched, as well as the fact that Jack was able to pull off having (at least) two families. However, I thought that the book was well-written and kept the reader interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had trouble keeping this book open.","review":"Unfortunately, once again, Oprah's choice of books to include in her book club, has left me disillusioned to say the least. I kept waiting for the plot to thicken and become somewhat interesting and it bombed. Why doesn't Oprah pick something wonderful like Lee Smith's Fair and Tender Ladies. Now THAT's a wonderful read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Immediately involving, moving, poignant and enjoyable.","review":"Having little patience for too much description and unnecessary imagery, I was struck by my immediate and intense involvement in this book. I was completely wrapped up in Katherine's shock, grief and ultimate understanding of her husband's double life while also breathlessly anticipating the tentative, growing friendship with Robert. Couldn't put it down and yet dreaded its ending because I wanted to continue sharing in her life! One of the best books I've read, ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very good, easy read","review":"Although the topics dealt with in this novel are all heavyweight, the book itself was a very easy read. The story flowed very nicely, and the characters were all so genuine (well, except maybe Muire) that you have the urge to hug and comfort them. When I finished the book and thought about what I read, it was then that I really appreciated the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star is too good","review":"This was the most slow, predictable, horrible book I ever read. If you have to buy it, get it at a yard sale. Better yet, go check it out of the library. I can't begin to express my disgust in this book. Boring, boring, boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insomia? Try reading this one...","review":"Predictable and plain boring. I tried to feel for Kathyrn but could not find empathy for any of the characters. It took me over a week to read this book. I had to force myself to turn the pages. I will confess that I finished the book but breathed a heavy sigh of relief when I was able to put this one of the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice takeoff, horrible landing","review":"A good premise, and the author plays the grief card very well. The wife is strong, but in love. The relationship with the union guy was well written too. You really liked and trusted him, and believed that he could take care of things. But, about halfway through this well-developing tale, it seems as if the author wanted to quickly wrap things up. Too much information is given too quickly, and with little explanation. And then the book ends, just like that, and you're left to feel as if you took a wrong turn back in the middle of the book, and ended up in some other novel. A great start, smooth and slow. A horrible ending, short and brusque."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please do not read this...","review":"stare at the wall instead. Seriously, that would be much more interesting. You could make up a more entertaining story in your head in 5 minutes. I read this years ago when it first came out, and I still cannot get over how awful it is. Thank god Oprah lost her credibility with me early on. I am sure it has saved me many a wasted hours reading dreck from her book club."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Predictable...Poor Style","review":"The premise of the book - love and betrayal - had my interest throughout the novel. However, the character development was poorly carried out after a good start. It seemed that the plot lost its steam with a very very long and tedious set-up. But I kept reading through the end to find that there weren't any twists or further psychological developments...on top of that there was a cheesy new relationship being developed that I felt was only to appease the stupider readers who couldn't handle an ending that left the woman - whom we are supposed to view as gaining emotional strength throughout her ordeal - single. I think I need to pick up a real novel (e.g. Thomas Hardy) next time. These modern best-sellers are painful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Luckily it was a quick read. The author is a good writer, but the story was less interesting than your average \\"Lifetime Network\\" TV movie. I expect they've already bought the rights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and Predictable","review":"I love to read and when I finished this book, I felt as though I had wasted my time. This was the same old story told in the same old way. How many ways can you tell this story before it gets monotonous?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worse Oprah Book Club selection to date.","review":"Part I of the Pilot's Wife was a little slow and so I had hoped Part II would pick up the pace, but I was wrong. I had thought about reading this book when it first came out, but was influenced by a bad review so I did not buy it. But when I heard it was an Oprah selection, I decided to give it a try. THE PILOT'S WIFE WAS A WASTE OF MY PRECIOUS TIME and MONEY."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm donating my copy to the local library","review":"This book was awful. I purchased it for these reasons: Oprah raved about it, I was curious, and the local library wait-list was too long. The story was so predictable it could have been written as a 2 column piece in a tabloid. Ugh. Oprah's picks are popular because many of us don't require much intellectual stimulation. Never to be duped again, will I rely on a celebrity's word about books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time!","review":"How did this book get an Oprah recommendation? Superficial, boring, predictable and amaturish - don't waste your time on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like Danielle Steele...","review":"If you like Danielle Steele, then you will like this book. If not, this book sucks. It is very predictable, and it is more like a love story than anything else"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spellbinding Narrative","review":"Shreve did in this book what she failed to do in most of her other books: hold your interest from beginning to end and create likeable characters. I could not put this book down until it was read (and I know two other people who felt the same). These characters were real and courageous. Some of the moments were so true to the heart of human experience that my cheeks were wet reading them. And, as icing on the cake, there are a few surprises to pick up the blood pressure along the way. This is a truly great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"just okay","review":"I was initially excited about reading this much-recommended book but found the story implausible. It started off very intriguing; shedding light on how a pilot's wife is dealt with following a downed plane. This part really pulled me in to the story. The whole business with the secret life really got too far fetched and made me think \\"boy, this is a made for TV movie plot\\" not one of my favorite genres."},{"rating":"2","title":"Predictable,but worth it!","review":"This book deals with a touchy subject; just how well do we really know the people we love? It does it in a very rich, fullfilling way. The characters are loving created and relationships are explored. It does have some predictability, but the exploration of emotions in a stressfull situation makes it worth it. The author does throw in one or two unexpected twists!An enjoyable, thought provoking, quick read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Yawner from Oprah","review":"I read this book some time ago upon the recommendation of a friend...they were favorably entertained by it...I was not. I found myself pushing onward through the pages waiting for a fire to ignite the plot - I pushed to the end and never really even found a spark. I was fairly bored by the plot from the beginning and the characters failed to be engaging...although the meeting and relationship between the widow and the mistress had the potential for some real drama. So...again I find myself uninspired by Oprah's latest \\"pick\\". Is it just me or is anyone else finding her book choices to be less than exciting and worthy of lunch and water-cooler chats?? I surely think this one is the least desirable read of all."},{"rating":"2","title":"a haunting, evocative story by a wonderful writer","review":"Anita Shreve's work is always compelling, absorbing and a pleasure to read. The Pilot's Wife tells the story of an external tragedy as a way to unfold an internal betrayal -- a literary thriller that is almost impossible to put down! I also highly recommend Shreve's Resistance, The Weight of Water and Eden Close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entirely forgettable","review":"Books I read can usually be categorized into 1) thought-provoking works that stay with me for years; and 2) pieces of fluff that occupy my time much like trashy TV. I place this book in the last category. I read it a week ago and have already forgotten the point--as well as the plot! PLEASE--don't insult us by calling this a \\"woman's book\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too predictable","review":"I read this book on a weekend. I read this book in two days because I wanted to get it over with and get on with my life. I finished the book hoping that I would understand why people found this book so interesting. I knew the plot once I found out Kathryn and her husband had separate accounts. It was predictable and there seemed to be very little character development."},{"rating":"2","title":"An easy read but very good","review":"My sister recommended this book to me and I didn't think I would really enjoy it. I started reading it on Friday afternoon and finished it by Saturday! I couldn't put it down. I agree with a previous review that there were some typos and a few sudden locale changes without explanation (I had to reread paragraphs several times to make sure I didn't miss something). However it was still good and definitely a good beach read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and absurd","review":"While other Oprah books have kept me entralled and longing for more spare time to read. This book was an insult. After about 5 pages, I knew what was going to happen. And when the author tries to throw in a surprising twist, I ended up wondering why? This book had so many holes in the story, and too many unanswered questions. Oprah. . . next time read the book, don't just listen to a publicist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Summer reading","review":"This is not a remarkable book, but one which fills the bill for an easy read. Take it on vacation or to the beach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three words: BORING, BORING, BORING","review":"Oprah has made this socalled \\"Mystery Thriller\\" a bestseller. So much for Oprah's taste and judgment, I must wonder how big a cut she gets? Has she even read the book? As for reality who has ever seen a guy sit down, cross his legs and then put his hands in his pockets? What a waste of my time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This is a wonderful books that shows how love can often blind a person to the truth that is right in front of them. This book reads very fast. You never know what is going to happen next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it if you are a Pilot's wife","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. It was extremely overrated. The plot was weak, predictible, and unrealistic. From the beginning, I could see were the story was going. Pilot has an affair with a Flight Attendant - could anything be more cliche? I was annoyed at how oblivious that Kathryn was to Jack's schedules. Everyone knows that an international pilot would never work 5 days on and two off. Also, Ms. Shreve, I would love to know how a pilot starting with a startup airline could have every qualified for a mortgage on a $400,000 house. There are too many inaccuracies for me to list and too many questions left unanswered."},{"rating":"1","title":"The pilots wife","review":"A touching story I'm sure but the authors delivery of plot considerably depreciated any ounce of compassion that could have been bestowed upon the characters. Staying awake through out the novel was a daunting task, I highly recommend some sort of literary training be presribed the author. In sort, you killed it for me. Out of respect I did give it the benefit of the doubt and read the novel from beginning to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"80 Pages is a Fair Chance!","review":"Before today, I had never looked at the reader reviews while I read a book, but I just had to know \\"is this worth it?\\" Clearly not. Thank you all for sparing me. I kept going - 80 painful pages - waiting for some sign that this book would improve. It seems my initial impression (this book is worthless!) was correct.At BEST, The Pilot's Wife is an easy read. If you don't want an intriguing plot, a creative use of language or complex characters, this is the book for you! It is terribly unoriginal. My goodness, if she can get published, so can I!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A flaw now and then but still deserving of praise","review":"I think reviewing a novel is best achieved by comparing it to others that most of us have read, so prospective readers have something to measure it against. So I would say that The Pilot's Wife by could be best described as a spellbinding novel of suspense, it features a pilot/wife dilemma and a relentless pace and stunning plot similar to The Triumph and the Glory, the vivid imagery of Cold Mountain, and the style and flavor of Oprah's book club's best."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this was a movie, it would have been panned.","review":"This is the first book I have read from Oprah's Book Club. The first half of the book was good - well developed characters, good plot line, etc. Then it fell apart. It seemed like the author had no idea how to bring things to closure. Character development ended and we had just some barely connected scenes. I know how hard it is to keep the effort going once the \\"denouement\\" has been reached, but this author didn't appear to even try. I am disappointed that this was a selection of this book club and will be very careful before buying another of Oprah's choices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last line confusing","review":"This is the first book by Anita Shreve that I have read. It's hard to believe that the airlines would handle a difficult situation as a devasting crash the way it was described in the book. I didn't understand the last line \\"I just wanted to know if the children are all right,\\" she said across the sea. Did I miss something?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The plot of this book is somewhat unrealistic. I've often wondered about people who didn't realize there were marital problems until his/her spouse suddenly left one day. Shreve's descriptions of people and the location are well done. The story did keep my interest. I had to finish the book to find out what would happen next; I just didn't like the story line. I prefered the \\"Weight of Water\\" better than this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"fast read, but totally unbelievable","review":"As a pilot's wife myself I found this book to be totally unbelievable from start to finish. No airline would treat the family the way this one was treated, no pilot would risk the lives of his passengers or his crew by carrying a bomb or anything close to it! I also found it very hard to believe that he could have two families and Kathryn wouldn't have found out - the whole story was totally bogus. I did, however, find it was a page-turner for at least the first half, a very easy read. Is Oprah really reading these books or not?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a total waste of time","review":"I agree wholeheartedly with the reader who described this book as predictable and shallow. It reads like a made-for-TV movie. Its only redeeming quality is it's an easy read, getting us to its uninspiring end that much quicker."},{"rating":"1","title":"And the point of this book was...?","review":"I don't understand the popularity of this book. If I could rate the book with zero stars, I would. To be honest, I was bored to death with it. The story was predicatable; it wasn't involving; the characters weren't particularly interesting; the plot was unremarkable; and the writing was often uneven - the author tried too hard with the prose. Sometimes she got it right; most of the time she didn't. Like other readers, I kept hoping it was going to get better or maybe something might happen that I wasn't expecting. It didn't. Sadly, I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Anita but I thought this book was almost unbearable!","review":"Reading over the reviews I am amazed that some people can call this a masterpiece and others a complete flop. I did not like anything at all about this book. There wasn't one character that I liked or cared about what happened to. This combined with the many different things brought up but never really dealt with (for instance Mattie's confesion of having \\"done it\\" when she was not quite 14. I get the feeling that would have been a bigger issue with most mothers, husband dead or not. The writing did nothing for me, I thought it was to thought out. I knew I would hate this book after the first sentence, gramatically correct or not it was not a sentence in my head - too flowery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"I find it hard to understand why literature that is so incredibly simple and dull becomes a best seller. Ms. Shreve's writing is comparable to a high school student's, and her plot is as predictable as a bad Hollywood movie. For the re-print, may I suggest the cover sport a photograph of Fabio dressed as a pilot? And, for added drama, Kathryn should wear Enzo Angiolini mules instead of Easy Spirit flats. Don't waste your reading time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been great but so superficial","review":"I am happy Oprah has her book group as it gts people reading. I believe she should upgrade her reading list and her audience would respond accordingly. The Pilot's wife could have bena true character study of huma nature, but instead took a serious issue and made it rather superficial and contrived. You knew what was going to hapen after the first 30 pages. Pick plot OR character development neither was met here. How hard it is it to find sympahty with a \\"pilot's wife\\"? Put a little debth to her character and you might have had a beter story. All in all a very unsatisfying page turner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Montanan says.....What happened?","review":"Give Anita Shreve some credit. She hooks you into what appears to be a well-written, well-paced novel about a woman grieving the loss of her husband, a pilot killed when his airliner crashes. But pretty quickly the questions crop up: Why do the airline people take over her house? Why does she let them tell her what to do? Why is she such a whimp? Sadly, despite some nice plot twists, the novel loses momentum and credibility. In the end, (finally relieved that this book is coming to an end) when you read the last sentence, you ask yourself...what happened? Lots of potential here, but sadly under-utilized."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Way with Words","review":"This book is a quick read, and enjoyable. I read the first third of it outloud to someone on a three hour drive. He keeps asking my how it ended...I told him he'll have to read it.I enjoyed the word pictures and writing style as well as the actual story. A good vacation book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Worst Kind of Betrayal","review":"This is the story of a woman who discovers after her husbands death that he has a whole other life and personality when he leaves the comforts of their home. The wife's struggle as she comes to terms with her husbands betrayal as well as the international scandal that results leaves you sympathizing with the wife and feeling her frustration. This book was well written and keeps the reader interested throughout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Oprah Selection","review":"I should have known going into it that this book would have some sort of cliche man hating theme...Oprah liked it. And, as we all know, Oprah is a man hater, so she likes this book.If you are content with cheesy cliche storylines and boring character development, by all means get this book. If you appreciate good writing and unique and creative storylines, avoid this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH IT","review":"As an avid reader, I feel compelled to write a review on this awful book. Never have I been more disappointed by a book than this. How in the world did this wind up on Oprah's book list? Was that a joke? The first 50 pages were intriguing, however, the story quickly fell apart shortly thereafter. The inconsistencies, the unncessary details, it just bored me to tears. I must have rolled my eyes at least 35 times. I wound up disliking the main character (Kathryn) instead of having any sympathy for her. I couldn't wait for it to be over. Please save your time and your money. NOT WORTH IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oprah disappoints AGAIN!","review":"After reading and loving \\"Fortune's Rocks\\" by Shreve and knowing it was given the stamp of approval by Oprah, I began \\"The Pilot's Wife\\" prepared to settle down with a good, solid, interesting book. IT STUNK! This is, perhaps, one of the most boring books I have ever read - right up there with the Pulitzer Prize winning \\"A Death in the Family\\". I didn't care about any of the characters in this book - I was too busy wishing it would either get better or end. It never got better. Fortunately, it ended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Random Hearts.","review":"I will not go into the story line as so many others have allready and I don't want to spoil it for someone else. I bought this because of the reviews after watching the movie and reading the book Random Hearts. It was like a drink of water compared to a shot of booze. Same story line, but The Pilots Wife didn't have any kick in it. Like one person wrote, I have been through it all before. Dull characters, slow paced and poor ending. I found myself skipping pages to speed up the action. We all have different taste in our reading so if it sounds good to you, go for it. As the old saying goes, One persons garbage is anothers treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where is the rest of the book?","review":"Read the whole thing in a day... couldn't put it down. Then got to the end. Flipped through the last few pages. Where is the rest of the story? This is the end?Bottom line: Great, well written book. Ending sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pilot's Wife Review","review":"I first read Anita Shreve's Body Surfing, and then just had to order another one of her books. Seeing as how The Pilot's Wife was on Oprah's book club, I figured it would be a good read and was yet again surprised by the twists and turns Shreve builds around in her novels. She is an excellent author and I would recommend this book to anybody!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was good for a couple months until it died","review":"I loved this piece until it suddenly died on me.

It was exactly what I needed, and works perfectly. It was also inexpensive. The shipping costs, however, more than doubled the price of the flash drives I ofdered. You offer a very convenient to sit home and order my needs and have them delivered, but the cost of delivery is not worth it. The cost of the 3 flash drives was $20.91. Shippping and handling charges were $24.96. All you did was to drop them in a bubble pack mailer (that cost less than $2.00) and pay postage ($0.88).

But the first time I ever read Michelangelo's poems directed towards Vittoria Colonna I knew that I was in love. The intensity and the beauty of it is so touching especially considering he was an old man when they were penned. Make it much more real, like a man who is truly pouring out his heart as opposed to someone who is just spouting words to gain the \\"favors\\" of a lady.

Press, 2005), Michelangelo's language of art and faith become clearer: He found himself closer to God believing in His grace almost the same faith as a Protestant that came from his deep spiritual involvement with the reforming Catholic faith of Vittoria. Images of young men who had inspired him for his art works receded and remorse remained. They explain the growth of several lines of interpretation of the last judgment on the wall of the Sistine Chapel. End result was that Christ is not judging in spite of the fact of martyred saints around him were expectantly looking toward him. He is presented as a Copernican sun rather than a mere resurrection in human form."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I've read in a long time.","review":"Although it includes a few helpful tips (such as the list of interview questions in the back), most of the information does not go beyond common sense.

If the songwriting is bad on this album, the vocalist is terrible. I don't hear the emotion... I don't hear the range. The instrumental songs on here are pretty good (The Fall Of Reason nearly comes to an epic bombast), but the rest of the songs are more-or-less boring. This album as a whole is not powerful to me and it just can't hold my attention. \\"Two Versions of the Same\\", however, is very good - too bad the songwriting couldn't carry over to the rest of the tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"This band is a definite must have in anyone's prog metal collection. Very heavy emphasis on accentuation and fantastic melodies. Vocals on this album are absolutely insane. 24 second note solo is where it is at.The only drawbacks I see is that like any prog act, it sounds very similar to other's before it, but the rhythmic qualities and harmonies make this album stand out. Lyrics can be deep at times but also seem odd word choices. Also the vocals although absolutely amazing are definitely a reminder of the 80's keyboard bands. As great as they are, they stand out a bit too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying","review":"I bought this power metal cd just because of Olaf Thorsen,he is so good at guitar(shredder).Olaf is the one who formed the band Labyrinth.This album is crap,the singer Michele Luppi sucks,his voice is so annoying.The keyboards are awful.There is one good song on the album and it's Out Of The Maze,the singing sucks on the song of course but the guitar playing is awesome.The songOut Of The Maze is about Labyrinth.This band is from Italy.Don't buy this crapy album."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE A TREE, SAVE YOUR TIME","review":"This book is so badly written I had trouble giving it even one star.

I had hoped to find a book that probed the relationship between a mother and daughter. Instead, I found a waste of paper. I finally gave myself permission to quit grinding my teeth, close the book, and throw it away. After the tree and me, no one else should have to suffer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Compaq Centric","review":"This book is very Compaq biased. Some of the text reads like a marketing glossy from Compaq: \\"Compaq was the first to announce new products that can....\\". This statement would be fine if it was part of a survey of vendor offerings, but to be presented as a sole opinion is disgraceful. There is no indication on the cover or otherwise prominently displayed on the book that this book is laced with Compaq ads. They should be paying me to read this book, for I am certainly not the biggest fan of Compaq products. On a more positive note, there is some decent advice on how to structure your business for internet commerce."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprise it's Alice In Chains!!!","review":"This is a really good cd, but be warned it is not hair metal like the excellent first release, Under The Influence. This is a great impression of Alice In Chains. Once you get over the initial shock at the change in style, it's actually a really good grunge album. This is the best attempt at adapting to the style of the day compared to attempts by Dokken (Shadowlife) and Warrant (Ultraphobic, Belly To Belly) to name two others."},{"rating":"1","title":"For obsessive collectors only","review":"I like Jack McDuff but I was rather disappointed by this release. In reading the inside liner notes, I then understood why. Basically, this collects all the songs from his 60's releases that hadn't appeared on the other \\"Good'Un\\" albums (wish they'd noted that on the back of the CD). In short, they picked through all the best stuff for those other albums and this album incorporates all the remnants.It's not bad, and there are a couple of pretty good songs (\\"The Morning Song\\", \\"What's Shakin'\\") but for the most part it's rather uninspiring organ soul jazz with a number of eight minute songs that get boring about half way thru.

However, these books of the American Girls Collection are supposed to offer young children a glimpse of life in their specific time period, and as such they fail miserably when they aren't historically accurate. This story deals with a young girl who wants to keep the Swedish tradition of St. Lucia alive in her family even after they move to America. Trouble is, this story takes place in 1854, and the St. Lucia celebration didn't start until the early 1900's. How can you give kids an accurate picture of the past when the entire plot centers around something that didn't yet exist?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and \\"lovely\\" pop music","review":"The lovely feathers deserve some credit for making music that is creative, eccentric, exciting, and not so caught up in itself as so much contemporary pop music is. The more I listen to My Best Friend Daniel, the more I like it. I think this band has the potential to bring pop music back to its proper roots. If more catchy, creative and sincere songs like these were playing on the radio I would turn my radio on more often.

That alone is reason for her ideas to not be adopted. I admit there are some good ideas contained in the book, but all of them can be found in other books by authors who can actually write a coherent sentence (something Whiteside does infrequently). I can't comprehend why Whiteside is willing to dimiss centuries of pedagogical practice that has been proven time and time again. Not that there isn't room for new ideas, but saying everything is wrong but your (Whiteside's) view is extreme. My experience is that a teacher who is so willing to dismiss any ideas aside from their own, is not a good teacher. Take a look at any of the pedagogical books published by Dover or the book by Sandor. All of these have great advice and none take an extreme stance on the topics they discuss."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book changed my life","review":"I would like to urge all pianists with a serious interest in piano technique to read this book CAREFULLY and SLOWLY. It is not \\"light reading\\" but it will, with patience, reveal amazing things about playing the piano. Try following Ms. Whiteside's recipes as literally as possible and you will find that they work. I agree with some of the other reviews that her style is less felicitous than it might be, but give the lady a break! She is attempting to describe in words some very complex physical sensations. I first read this book in the summer of 1998 and have returned to it again and again for the details and the inspiration it consistantly provides."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pianoplaying with the complete body and mind well described.","review":"The most important aspect of this book is the author's opinion, that everything in pianoplaying involves the complete body and the complete mind. She starts with putting what she calls 'the basic rhythm'as a starting point for all improvement of piano technique. Her writing is not allways clear, and readers are advised to read some of the passages over and over again, to grasp the true meaning of what she writes. She has been searching to find the right approach to teaching, just as every teacher. That means that some of her earlier writngs seem to contradict the later ones.

Still waiting, after 2 weeks, for answers to online queries and you get parked in 'hold' limbo when you call.The monthly plans are not good at all and YOU CANNOT REMOVE THEM once you sign up. the only way is client service, but they do not answer the phone nor the mails.Lastly: the connections have been hit and miss. Tried QoS on router but did not really help. Do not think it is my DSL since I use that with no problems for video conferencing and XBOX Live.Anyways, nice looking phone, but they are not ready to support it.This can only get worse now that they are throwing the phones online for bargain prices: spike in bandwidth, overwhelmed support.

After seeing this film in a couple of it's incarnations I can say that it not only captures the sights, sounds and emotions of the Jesus People Revolution but it also challenges us today in our presuppositions of what it means to be \\"a Christian.\\" My life was changed by the ministry of this man of God, Lonnie Frisbee. I hope many will see this film and be encouraged to seek for themselves the love of God found in Jesus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Step Back","review":"I must point out that one needs to back up a little and view this account from a larger scale. Lonnie's life, unfortunately, is always viewed from the prism of a \\"timeline\\". (ie He began this way, he was used that way, he was ill treated another way, he died on the way)--most good documentaries are edited that way. But the reality is, God does not see us as a timeline. Rather, God looks at our lives based on two criteria, 1)amount of revelation given and 2)what we did with that amount of revelation. Lonnie was given a hefty dose, no doubt. But God will not judge or apply reward according to post-Jesus Movement decisions, where he slid backward, or how he died. But rather, will judge according to his life as a whole and all things considered therein. It really is not up to us to come to conclusions about Lonnie, Smith, or Wimbur... but rather to keep our eyes on the Prize before us, lest we look back and miss it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.

It says for ages 2 and up but if your child is a typical active 2 yr old, this will bore him/her to tears. It's very repetitive with boring graphics and sound.

Surprise, but this biography of Patrick O'Brian is a surprise in it's own right. Dean King has done an excellent job in his biography of the famous author, especially given the lengths to which O'Brian went to conceal his real background. I enjoyed the book very much, and although Tolstoy's competing biography of O'Brian claims that Dean King has made a lot of mistakes in his book, still it was King who opened up the truth about O'Brian.Not to give the wrong impression, I am a real fan of O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin books, and I consider him to be a wonderful author. His personal life is outside my judgment, and I was fascinated to follow his progress from humble beginnings to fame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well Written Gossip","review":"Although well researched, given the elusive nature of his subject, the book bordered on the tedious at times, especially in the reprinting of large passages from POB's works. Designed to offer Dean's readers an insight into some of POB's actions, they inevitably ended up being more speculative than insightful. I also felt that much of the book was based on gossip and hearsay, again probably inevitably, but one felt ocassionally uncomfortably intrusive touching on so many irrelevancies. Basically, the book lacked grace."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like \\"A Life Reviled\\"","review":"Consider the author's introduction, when there were differing accounts he chose to believe everyone except his subject.

In a compelling biography, King shows how the author's real-life adventures relate to the sea saga and other tales O'Brian churned out in seven decades of ceaseless toil. A must-read for all O'Brian fans, and indeed anyone interested in the relationship between life and art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great book","review":"There is nothing of interest here.

It does provide some protection for the telescope, but it is cheaply made. The case is of thin aluminum with plastic corners holding it all together. My case arrived with a cracked corner, so it would not shut properly after being opened the first time. The foam is not properly cut for the accessories, so they fit in poorly. The telescope itself will not fit in the precut slot unless you fully rotate the focus in. This requires you turn the tiny focus knob on the 'scope about 30 times to store it and another 30 times to make the telescope useable again the next time you take it out. Overall I was pretty disappointed with the case, but it does at least give me a way to move the telescope around without damage, though I was hoping for something more substantial based on the picture of the product, showing metal construction.

Not only are her plots tight and skillfully and imaginatively woven, but her imagery and writing style are one in a million. I can only think of Robin McKinley as a comparison.

It is an intellectual slumber pill; it is mind-pausing escapist literature. One's time could be much better spent reading one of many other books. The book has George W Bush as president of the United States, though he is thinly disguised--- he is as much an incompetent violence-solves-it idiot in the book as well as in real life.

I wonder if this was maybe the first book he ever wrote; he should have left it in the attic.

Anyone who has written books involving military aircraft, for example, should know that the F-16 has side-stick controllers; the pilot never puts \\"both hands on the stick\\". He'd have to reach all the way over to the right hand side of the cockpit with his left hand to do that. And since it is fly-by-wire, the added strength of the second hand wouldn't be needed anyway.

I had very high hopes for it, and had heard great things about the author. I could not even get halfway through the book, though, before adding it to the pile to go back to my used book store. Ugh!

Reading material helps pass the time away, and this is about all Saucer can do. The writing is amateaurish, the characters are paper dolls. While the main characters carry the plot, the romance is elementary school. In all the book was a short poorly developed story, much more could have been done with the premise. For a quick adventure it is worth the price but it would not be worth a second read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book - Great author","review":"Stephen Coonts is a natural storyteller and has a way of writing that will appeal to all walks of life.This is no exception - a fantastic story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful, trite.","review":"One of the worst books I've read, so simplistic its a no brainer.

He has written some terrific books like \\"The Red Horseman\\" and \\"Under Seige.\\" Unfortunately, \\"Saucer\\" wasn't up to his usual snuff. I liked the premise, but the characters seemed flat and the dialogue rather unnatural. There wasn't a lot of inner thought to really bring out the characters and strengthen the story. I still think Coonts is an awesome writer, but even Barry Bonds strikes out every so often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meant for kids?","review":"Like other reviewers here, I've enjoyed Coonts' other books. This one, however, feels like it was written by somebody else. Its plot and characters are very shallow. The book seems to be written for younger readers, although it doesn't specifically say so. If you want a great Coonts book, try <I>Cuba</I>."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saucer not the best","review":"This is the first Stephen Coonts book I have read. I thought the science behind the saucer was a bit simplistic. The way the ship was powered left a lot to be desired(water & nuclear?).The characters were also drawn very basic. The people were black and white and no shades of gray. It is a very quick read and you should be through it before you start gagging."},{"rating":"1","title":"It could have been soooo much more!","review":"I am an avid Coonts fan, but was disappointed with this book.

Until I read this one! This is Not his style of writing, in fact the plot and style are almost juvenile.. The story is there, the development is weak and almost childish."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment","review":"SAUCER was very disappointing--the name Coonts should guarantee more at this stage. While starting out showing promise, it soon devolves into implausibility and the cartoon characters are unable to rescue the material. This light-hearted romp takes no notice of the likelihood that the fight for possession of the world-changing technology at stake could easily lead to WW3. How that event was avoided could have been the basis for a thoughtful, suspenseful story. Unfortunately, that is not the story that was written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saucer / echoes of Robert Heinlein","review":"A super story for the sci-fi or space opera fan. Pacing is good, a great set of characters and enough technical details to make it interesting and plausible without getting into the minutia that puts you to sleep while you're waiting for something to happen.As I read this I kept remembering another great writer of science fiction, namely Robert A. Heinlein. This story with its' subtle comments, and the not so subtle comments about government(s), and the politicians in general reminded me of classic Heinlein works. If you ever read and enjoyed a Heinlein story, this will surely please.Highly recommended. Falls into the can't-put-it-down category. My only complaint would be if there isn't a part II forth-coming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saucer by Stephen Coontz","review":"The fact that this book even got published is an embarrassment for the publishing company. I have never forced myself to get halfway through such a poorly written, poorly researched, poorly conceived piece of trash in my life. And I am one who is willing to forgive quite a bit for the sake of sci-fi and put up with some pretty lousy writing. The saddest part is that it got a favorable review from The New York Times! I used to find their reviews helpful. Now they are utterly suspect and useless. Sob! If you've got 12 pounds to plunk down for this book, do yourself a favor and just throw the money out the window. You'd be putting it to better use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining Story/Clever Plot Devices","review":"As the day, November 1, 1993, progresses from dawn to dusk, so do the lives of the characters beginning with the births of the principal characters, Hazel and Spencer. Strangely, all events in the story occur on that date. But the story does not follow a straightline progression but parallel courses (just like the characters' lives), because Beard switches cleverly from pivotal past events of each character's life (except for one) back to the present until the story's climax at which time all the lives intersect. This device enables us to watch the characters' lives develop so we can learn how they got to the present (and their current predicaments). Ultimately I found each character sympathetic.Overall, this is a book of effective, entertaining writing that enabled me to ignore a muggy gray Saturday."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 FER'","review":"#1. excellent value#2. great musicThe bonus is the fine service provided by seller.This is BULL----!

And I was disappointed.The plot is weak, full of flaws. The characters are shallow, without consistency, feeling like a mixture of real people and cardboard figures. Sometimes I got annoyed with their silly or undeveloped behavior.The story goes on and on, with some characters introduced you don't know why or what for, and then disappearing.I gave this book two stars only because around 30% of it was a reasonably good reading, and 10% a very good reading. But if you consider this book has more than 800 hundred pages, you realize there are long uninspiring stretches.Now I don't know if I'm brave enough to read other books by this author, in spite of all the praise given to him by some other reviewers. His daughter Molly Costain Haycraft, however, wrote a nice historical fiction,My Lord Brother the Lion Heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attention keeper","review":"This book is long but worth every bit.

The premise was hilarious, so we expected it to be delightfully awful, instead it was a funny feel good movie. It's not a blockbuster for sure, but the characters are enjoyable, the plot flows well.

Missing is any discussion of the debates of the meaning of Jesus' life and mission that must have been alive at the time.

While I liked the full-size stroller that came with the system, I quickly found that space-wise, it wasn't practical for my needs, and that the stroller seat cushion shortly became damaged from the constant scraping on the ground when folding it up.I was looking for something more manageable, but didn't want one of the ultra-light umbrella style strollers. This one is super-easy to fold with one hand and a push of your foot, and stands upright when folded. It's only 21 lbs, easy to lift up into my truck bed, and it also fits nicely inside my truck when needed without crowding the carseat. (I drive a 4-dr full size pickup). The underseat basket is huge and I love the parent tray. It's sturdy, yet very easy to manuever. All in all, a great purchase, especially if you're searching for a mid-size stroller."},{"rating":"2","title":"We LOVE this stroller","review":"I got the Graco Kenbrook Quatro Tour travel system for my baby shower. I loved the look of it. However a few months later, my brother found this stroller my mother had bought and put away while I was pregnant (she since died of cancer) and he brought it to me. We kept it to put in the other car. Right away I LOVED this stroller.It has great handle, rides very smoothly, the canopy is nice and big. The basket is HUGE, and it folds so easily and automatically locks so down at the beach getting on and off the boardwalk tram car was a snap.We loved it's lightweight frame so much, I sold my Quatro one and bought the Vienna travel system in a different pattern. So now both cars have this wonderful stroller for me to use no matter what car I have, it's easy for me to hoist into both SUVs without hurting myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nearly Perfect!","review":"Excellent for $100! We purchased this for our 2nd son because of its adorable, soft & comfortable seat cushion, its overall style and excellent manueverability. It ranks close to my 1st sons Peg Perego Venezia carraige which we love & he still uses. The only thing this stroller needs is for the handle to rotate so that I can view my child while pushing the stroller, and for it to come with a boot to cover him up. Then it would rank right up there with my $375 Peg Perego!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Deal!","review":"This stroller is great! There's plenty of basket room in the bottom. The stroller is lightweight and folds up and unfolds very easily. It's Graco so you know the safety is tops and it's interchangeable with other Graco products. It's easy to push and has shocks to make Baby's ride a little less bumpy on rough sidewalks."},{"rating":"1","title":"avoid","review":"In the name of \\"rare\\" recordings some awful quality issues have emerged.

Is that say for example you are just doing Harriet Tubman or your just doing Frederick Douglass, it would be difficult to just find information about one, because you could think thier talking about about Harriet you could get the wrong information, and research the wrong information.

However, in working out with the DVD it becomes very monotonous after the second time. I have done workouts of other trainers with a range of different excercises which keeps your interest.

It is baffling how acountry with such rich cinematic history is now turning out actors ofsuch subpar quality which can only be compared to the worst acting onAmerican soaps. I understand that there is a new acting school in Romefrom which they all graduate, and it shows. Unwatchable.Having said that I do have to point out that the scope of the film does give a very good insight on socio political events spanning the decades bewteen the late 60's through early 90's in Italian history."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Italian family saga","review":"It is a beautiful and touching story of an Italian family but the focus is really on two brothers Matteo and Nicola.It is also a good choice for people who like History,because they can follow the political, economical and social changes that took place in Italy from the sixties to 2002.Last but not least , if you speak Italian or if you are learning Italian it is a good way to brush up on the language or to review and consolidate what you have been learning in class."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of Youth is the best","review":"This family saga focusing on two brothers in an Italian family who livethrough some of the turbulence of the twentieth century in Europe ismagnificent.

North American TV producers could learn much from this splendid piece of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Those Were the Best of Times and the Worst of Times..","review":"Inspired by a Pasolini poetry collection, this is a stunning cinematic opus spanning 40 years in the Carati family. Italian culture, North and South, is explored through personal and political landscapes. Although filmed for television, this film notes a resurgence of Italian cinema, which was so often criticized in the eighties. As with the best films, you will laugh and cry, as you identify with the emotions and experiences.

It is a wonderful journey that you are immediately caught up in from the first frames. I only wish that everyone who watches this could see it first in the theatre; I openly wondered at the conclusion of the film if the impact would be the same on the small screen. I felt as it I were in Italy and in the Carati(?) family.

Worth every minute of your time and worth every penny you spend. Simply beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film!","review":"I purchased this film after friends kept raving about it. The film is very long (six hours!), so we watched it in two three-hour sequences. This is a classic, very touching, very well acted and directed, and well worth owning. It would be of special interest to baby boomers, as it tracks the lives of two Italian brothers, from the sixties up in to 2002 or so.

At the Cinema Arts Center, in Huntington, NY, all six hours were shown in one day, with an hour break for an Italian-style dinner...to a sold out audience, on a snowy January Sunday!

If you've read Swann's Way and Within a Budding Grove, then you realize that this achievement is far more exciting than any summary can convey. Here Proust also develops the narrator's friendships with Saint-Loup and Albertine, presents us with one of the most beautifully written death scenes in Western literature, dissects the salon culture, and introduces an unforgettable ...mentor.

They are solid tunes (especially the studio account of \\"Satin Doll,\\" but a version of that can also be heard onRediscovered Masters, Vol. 2), but hardly worth the purchase alone. \\"Live at the Prelude\\" has lots more music than this title, so you can see why \\"Strecthing Out\\" is being phased out.

Like everyone else has mentioned - the lack of toys makes this one piece of extra baby stuff that will never get used. For a bouncy seat, the thing doesn't bounce unless you push on it really hard - which is more than a baby can do. It is more of a seat with its upright position, and my daughter wants nothing to do with it.

The Poets: The poets stand in the rain,/They wear no raincoats./They have no umbrellas./They are discussing the shadow of a shadow of a shadow.//But their poetry is already soaking wet--/They have not developed their reality muscles/So they walk with a limp while admiring the color of a vein in a leaf."},{"rating":"2","title":"an amazing book","review":"I found this book while I was living in England at Border's in Oxford. When I look for books I read the first page and if it catches my attention ill read it. When I picked up this book I read the first page and couldn't stop. But I couldn't read the whole book in the store so I bought it. I was also looking for a book because I was taking a week trip in the French Alps. I finished this book in four days. I was addicted. The writing in it was different from any other book I have read. It never got boring and you felt for the main character even though he was a pessimist, and I am the most optimistic person I know. When I was done I gave this book to my friend Paddy to read and he also thought it was great. I definately suggest this book to anyone who is looking for a different style of awesome reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Denver Daze","review":"We saw JFW read at the Lion's Lair in Denver.

She's an agile, intelligent writer, and her faith, warmhearted wisdom, and joy in life shines on every page. By all accounts, she and her husband, Frank, were wonderful parents who handled the challenge of this mega-sized family with grace.Unfortunately, the book is out of print, and remaining copies are expensive. If you're diligent, though, and patient, you can find a reasonably priced copy, as I did a couple of years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Band that Fits","review":"I needed a band for my old Rolex, but I was unable to find the right size, quality and material where I normally shop.

When going from Crazy World to this, you are almost amazed that it is the same person. Brown's awesome screeching and wailing is toned down and put to very 1970's dance music, and where Brown once excalimed \\"I am The God of Hellfire!\\", he now Barry-Manilows his way through \\"The Lord Will Find a Way\\", \\"Is There Nothing beyond God\\" and \\"The Lord is My Saviour\\".If you like the Screaming Jay Hawkin's-meets-Iron Butterfly sound of the older Arthur Brown work, then stick with it and pass this up. Because although tracks on here like \\"She's On My Mind\\" and a mellower version of \\"I Put a Spell On You\\" are good, the CD, even as two albums, goes nowhere and does, indeed, end up sounding like hippy Disco music from a bad romance movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great ramekins, not so great lids","review":"the ramekins on this are nice and stakable but the lids crack easy and strech out os they dont fit very tight.

It's a great movie and has an incredible supporting cast including Bob Hoskins as a police officer doggedly on the title characters trail. Adding beauty to the movie is former Bond girl Jane Seymour as Selleck's girlfriend and the impossibly sexy Lauren Hutton as a Nazi.With OTT Nazi's as the villains this movie truly is a great ride and a DVD release is long overdue.There is a DVD available in Europe (Region 2) for those of us with region-free players."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST SELLECK MOVIES","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Tom Selleck as the charming and romantic cat burglar.

The total package was delightful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lassiter","review":"DVD arrived quickly and in good shape. I was delighted to find Lassiter was now on DVD, it was previously only available on VHS. Tom Sellick does a good job as a loveable jewel thief in pre-WW2 London.

Thank you Graco!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A number of problems...","review":"We purchased this stroller when we were expecting our second child. I should have read more review about this stroller before purchasing. We actually have it in a different pattern - but the same stroller.Pros: (1) the new basket drops down so that you can put things in it even in you have the infant carrier in the back seat.(2) I love having a cup holder for each seat + the parent cup holder.Cons: (1) When the infant carrier is in the stroller, it is almost impossible to get baby in or out.(2) Very hard to steer after a few months of use.(3) Seats are small(4) Recline - for the back seat - it's either reclined all the way, or sitting straight up. For the front seat - it doesn't recline at all(5) To fold this stroller you have to fold the front canopy down, drop the basket and put the back seat in it's upright position. (when you're in a hurry, or it's rainy - this is a pain to do!)Needless to say, I am looking for a good side-by-side stroller for my kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Duoglider","review":"I have a newborn and 16 month old. I am using my carseat on the backseat which is not handy at all. First you can not push the stroller and see the baby because the canopy hides her (with it opened or closed). Second, you really have to reach in to get her out. It is very difficult to pick her up and take her out. This is not a stroller to use with the infant seat. With my son in the front seat, he can see everything but I can hardly see the top of his head with the canopy on. The basket is very big but with the infant seat on and the regular seat needing to be reclined it is difficult to get to. I am not overly impressed with this stroller and am hoping that a different graco stroller works better for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for 2 kids under 2","review":"I have a 3 month and a 19 month old and absolutely love it.

Even though our oldest walks well now, we still use this when we are out for long walks or shopping so as to keep her closer to us.Pros: The car seat that came with the single child travel system works with this stroller too. Car seat can go in either the front or the back.Durable.Drives easily, rides smoothly.Cons: Difficult to collapse and open again. The wheels have to line up perfectly(!) with the frame so that the locking mechanism can catch. Also, the catch is so tight it's hard to unlock it in order to open the stroller again.Somewhat heavy to get in and out of the SUV.Bulky - Fits fine in our SUV, but in a car it has to be put in the trunk upside down so the trunk lid shuts. The problem with this is 1) stuff falls out of the basket; and 2) I don't like the parts my girls touch to be on the bottom of the dirty trunk.I'd get one again though. Once it's open it's a dream."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your $$$$$$","review":"What a horrible stroller!!!

The front seat reclines but my oldest daughter is forever hitting her head on the carseat above her!

But Vikki Clayton, who has filled in the \\"Sandy Denny role\\" at many a Fairport Convention concert, is quite up to the task. She opens this album with Denny's signature tune, \\"Who Knows Where The Time Goes,\\" in sort of a throwdown to any potential detractors, and as on several other songs, her rich, confident vocals and understated arrangements carry the day. There are a few iffy touches, mainly in the electric filters and effects added to the bass and guitar, but overall this is a pretty strong record. Clayton herself is quite lovely to listen to.

Since the millet itself doesn't have much flavor, I fill a large bowl with 95% millet, and 5% granola sprinkled on top (plus some ground flax seed); I then add milk.

This is a tale of stolen land and power crazy coal owners that will go to any length to get the coal. It is very heart wrenching to read this story. At the very end, the author has an afterword, which leads me to believe this is based on a true event and even uses the real name of the people involved. The characters are very true to life and the dialect is spot on.

Yes, it's gorey and heretical but this only adds to the movie's drawing power. Both Hugh Grant and Amanda Donohoe are absolutely terrific in their performances. {Darn}can she be so scary and still so sexy, as in the scene where upon hearing a recording of a snake charmers music, she emerges from her wicker basket and sexily slithers across the room and out of the house, dressed in skin tight black leather (how else would a snake wear it's skin?). Another impressionable scene occurs when the lovely Catherine Oxenberg is ready to be fed to the white worm. The poor victim is hanging by her wrists over the lair and the half-serpentine Donohoe, nude and painted blue, doning yellow snake eyes is summoning up the serpent.

The game acts if your playing an MMO so you have a desktop and other applications on your \\"computer\\". This also explains it's simple but versatile fighting styles. In fact I find it easier to play because there is no learning specific patterns to pull off a combo instead each button is a different attack. The way the story is laid makes raiser to follow ad well because when in game play your objectives are usually announced by some character also if you should forget and objective it's stored in you memoir option so you will never really forget what to do overall this is one of my favorite games exspcialy for simple gamers."},{"rating":"2","title":"dothack//GU 2","review":"I purchased this game for my daughter.

Even though there's a recap, the amount of references to the first game as well as the connected anime, ROOTS, will confuse you a bit. That being said, if you understand the plot, then the story is amazing, one of the most emotional I've seen in a while. I already feel as if more has happened than what had happened in Rebirth, and I think I still have a ways to go before beating the game. There are a lot of sidequests, with the new ones being quite interesting and fun, especially the bike races. The gameplay is not much different from Rebirth, although a new awakening as well as the addition of on the fly weapon changing completely adds to the combat. Overall, this game is better than Vol. 1, and if you liked Rebirth, you will love this one. Pick it up if you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game","review":"This is one of the most fun games I've ever played.

I thoroughly enjoyed how this game plays and with the second volume, it adds several new battle mechanics, plus a few mini games for those continuing the series. This game continues the awesome story line that G.U. vol. 1 Rebirth left off on, and basically brings the player closer to solving the mysteries that the game set out for the gamers and Haseo, the main character, to figure out. The difficulty in this game was cranked up a lot from the previous version, so I've been seeing myself get game overs more often and such and it is exactly what I'm looking for.

It's a jazzy, strutting, ethereal masterpiece of music that hasn't aged a day in almost 30 years (don't those cymbals and echoing snaredrum wafting in over the piano on the intro just give you the chills?) and stands as a major landmark in both movie music and the career of Marvin Gaye. The rest of this soundtrack is just that, beautiful 'sound'. The instrumentals that comprise this collection incorporate elements of jazz, soul, classical and light pop, to stunning effect.

From the first I found the book overwhelming and confusing. Maybe it's my style of learning, as I was expecting a more linear style. Something like, \\"Okay, here's what you need to know to get started\\" and \\"Now that you know this, here's how you do that.\\"But this book, to me, is needlessly complicated. While it's excellent for detailed descriptions, I wouldn't recommend it for beginners. I found myself reading and re-reading descriptions and information, breaking out the highligher pen, trying to glean the basics from pages and pages of details that were, for a beginner like me, irrelevant. I say irrelevant because I was given information on things I hadn't learned yet.I wound up purchasing other resources to learn Photoshop. Now that I have a basic understanding of the software, this book is a little more useful, though still too complicated for my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsuitable for a beginner","review":"This might be a good book if you are already a Photoshop expert, but I bought it hoping to learn how to use Photoshop. I was extremely disappointed. The instructions for accomplishing tasks are bareboned at best and filled with terminology that is never explained. Basically it is just a book where the work of photoshop artists is displayed and explained in an incomprehensible way. So as not to have totally wasted my money, I plan on going back to the book after I actually find another method of learning the program. I might be able to glean some useful information out of the book at that point."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for the beginner","review":"Very nice book but not for the beginners.

Buy this book FIRST.","review":"I'm an amateur photographer. Initially, all I wanted to do with Photoshop is crop a scanned picture and maybe change a bit of its background. After several weeks of searching three other books for what I wanted to achieve, it became patently clear that 1) Photoshop was an extremely deep and complex program, and 2) I would never be able to accomplish simple tasks unless I dedicated my life to the study of Adobe. Then one day, The Photoshop 6 WOW! book's colorful presentation caught my eye. One hour later, I had not only cropped my photo and given it an entirely different background, but I fully understood what I had done and learned some additional tricks along the way. This book's graphics are delicious and the accompanying text clearly explains each step required to reproduce them. You will be compelled to try everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alot of content","review":"I learned a lot of great little tricks and shortcuts from this book. A lot of those things you see and wonder \\"how did they do that?\\" this book explains. It is a little hard to follow the step by step guides sometimes. If they could number the steps, or put in more of an outline form, it would be perfect. Still, with all the info that is here, I think they probably did it the only way that would make sense. A very good book to look at for ideas when you are in a little bit of a creative funk."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK","review":"Just goes to show that just because these bozos can use Photoshop it doesn't mean they can explain what they are doing.

What arrogance! She states it is her love of children. I can't believe it is anything but her love of self and her unwillingness to age gracefully. How unfair and selfish to force that child to have her 70 and 80 year-old parents to send her to college, if they are still alive, and not sick or disabled. Is this what the women's movement has come to. Middle age is not 51 and 61--most of us don't live, and certainly don't live vigorously, to 102-122, shame on you Sylvia Ann Hewlett."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ms. Hewlett misses the mark big time","review":"If we take Ms. Hewlett's observations to the natural conclusion in a perfect world American women would all be white trash and get knocked up at 19 regardless of their ability to succesfully provide for themselves and their children.I have no delusions about my biological clock yes I went to grad school and did the career thing, but the real problem is finding decent,intelligent, emotionally available, finacially stable, non-commitmentphobic men.

Regarding fertility technologies, we use technology to extend life, go to the moon, etc., so why not use it to extend childbearing years, expecially when Ms. Hewlett's alternative is marrying some [one] at an early age. Speaking of humiliation. ...Why is there no mention in this book of freezing embryos when one does have young eggs or efforts (as yet unsuccessful) to freeze eggs? Perhaps a little too radical for this book's retro recommendations for women.Obviously this book was a ploy to profit from the aging boom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very depressing","review":"As a woman who has been dealing with infertility for 6 years, I thought this would be a help to put my mind to rest as we approach our final attempt at IVF and our outlook toward work and family. Instead, I found myself wondering if there was any hope at pursuing this venture yet another time. If you are doing research on the subject this book is for you - filled with lots of statistics - most negative to a woman over 40 trying to conceive. I cried through most of it and ended up throwing it in the trash. Yes, the over 40 generation knows the percentages, but lets focus on the positives of those that work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another guilt-trip for women","review":"Has it ever occurred to people like Ms. Hewlett that \\"having it all\\" does not necessarily include motherhood? I resent the implication of her book's title that women who choose to forego child-rearing somehow lack \\"a life.\\"The so-called 'biological clock' is nothing more than a politicaland social construct designed to manipulate successful, intelligent, well-educated women into having babies. ...What books like this fail to take into account is the significant number of women for whom motherhood holds no interest. Instead of joining in the collective Baby Boomer hand-wringing over this \\"issue,\\" childfree women are out there enjoying life, and not experiencing the empty hole that the media keep insisting they should have.Women over age 35 who choose to remain childless are growing innumbers. We have disposable income, and we vote. It's time thisdemographic stops being overlooked. We're not buying thebrainwashing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Influential but flawed","review":"This book has many biases and flaws. Other reviewers have already gone into detail on these points, so I won't belabor them. I gave this book 2 stars because it created huge waves when released: was the subject of many magazine articles and television shows in the following months. So, if you are like me and enjoy keeping on top of books that have helped shape the news, note that this was one of the most most talked-about books of 2002. That being said, my other point is this: there is a business in making people scared and prophesizing doom and gloom. Does a woman's fertility decline as she ages? Sure. But it varies wildly from person to person. Do you really want to put your money towards trying to scare the wits out of high acheiving North American women, making them feel even more pressured than they already do? I, for one, would rather not."},{"rating":"1","title":"LADIES!! DON'T LISTEN TO THIS [person]","review":"I asked my OBGYN about this book.

Now I'm eleven weeks pregnant with my first child.Thanks heaps, Hewlett."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Woman's Opinions","review":"I was horrified by the implications of Creating a Life. I, an unassuming childless woman, picked up this book only to be lured into reading about the author's biast opinions about childless women. Not only does she say that children are a nessecity to a happy, fulfilling life, but she makes it blatently clear childlessness is the wrong choice. It wasn't for me and I believe Sylvia Ann Hewlitt's book is demeaning to all women who should be free to make their make their own choices."},{"rating":"1","title":"not another book to make me feel guilty","review":"I picked up this book on the reccomendation of a friend and was appalled at what it espouses. I am a hard working freelance writer who owns a business. I am independent, unattached and would have liked children. I made the determination that I would only have a child if I was married. I was raised by a widowed mother and it is not an experience I would inflict on any child. I truly tried to find someone to share my life with and raise a family. It didn't happen. So now, I not only have to deal with the ever present guilt inflicted upon me by my mother for not giving her grandchildren, and the prospect that I will die alone and unloved, I must also feel guilty for not getting knocked up in high school. Somehow, this seems a heartless and cruel attitude and I resent the implications that my life is worthless because I do not have children. I returned the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hewlitt's assumptions and biases undermine and derail study","review":"There's a reason that women who achieve a lot don't always have children; it's called opportunity costs. And, the road not taken is often avoided by design. Hewlitt needs to give men and women more credit - not every woman is infantile and not every man is insecure. Sometimes the choices we make just seem inadvertent to people who cannot see beyond their own agenda.Overall, Hewlitt's assumptions and clear biases undermined and finally derailed any legitimacy her research might have had. Further, her analysis was in the end sophomoric and disorganized."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Attempt to Meddle and Dictate.....","review":"If there was less than one star, I would have chosen zero. Why do so many authors believe they know what is best for women?Do they really believe we are such incompetents that we NEED advice about how to conduct our lives? Especially disturbing is the trend by authors like Sylvia Ann Hewlett to actually PROMOTE one \\"traditional\\" lifestyle for women regardless of diversity, personal tastes, ambitions and preferences. To get married is to be \\"happier and healthier?\\" Certainly not always. Not realistic. Also unrealistic is the idea that most women who remain childfree will eventually experience regrets. Simply not true. I know many women who have remained childfree and have absolutely no regrets. I am one. At 56, my very successful career has provided me with all of the nurturing satisfaction I need -- with none of the hassle. Authors like Hewlett are entitled to their opinions. Their motives should be questioned and they must never be taken seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Life is About Choices","review":"This book has received far too much press. Women finally have the freedom choose and don't have to settle for less than they deserve. As a \\"high acheiving\\" corporate professional woman, I do not have regrets and take full responsibility for the choices I have made and their outcome. Many married women with children would say the same thing. If I found a man who truly wanted to be my equal in parenting I would probably \\"have it all\\". We are responsible for raising children in the best possible environment and not have them just for the sake of having them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for all women","review":"I have recommended this book to friends of all ages and all carrer types. Everyone has loved it!! It is one of the only books i've read that really begins to investigate the socioeconomic impact of career women choosing not to have children (or having them much later in life). The author acurately captures the emotional, economic and social pressures that women face 30 years after the initial \\"women's rights movement\\" began. Her analysis is objective and thoughtful and should be read by all women and all parents with daughters. This book celebrates the successes of the women's movement, but also examines the new problems created by it and offers corrective solutions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't wait to be FORTY to put all this nonsense behind me!:P","review":"It's not like a fresh, healthy baby is the symbol of a woman's youth and ego! So, if a girl grows up actually WANTING a family of her own someday, of course she should focus on THAT as well as launching a successful career. And, it looks like most women today are doing that just fine. So no, it's just not a good idea to try and scare us childless folks into breeding at a late age just because of some biological warning! Instead, bearing or not bearing children is far TOO serious a decision for that, of course. Not to mention the fact REALITY means that childbearing is still HARD WORK nevertheless whether you manage to have a kid or not - along with juggling home and work as well!

The people in here say things MUCH too openly (when is the last time your lower status coworker who doesn't like you came right out and told you so?). The plot was not believable and was overly complex. I used to live in New Mexico and have been in the four corners area where these novels take place. You really don't get a very good feel for what the area is like from this book. For ex, I remember being in a McDonalds in Gallup, NM with very traditionally dressed Navajo women and Navajo men in jeans and cowboy boots. I think many people would find the area almost as different as a foreign country.Won't be reading more of these - I will go back and reread some Tony Hillerman."},{"rating":"1","title":"London Blue Topaz Earrings","review":"I was not at all happy with this purchase.

In its brief pages you learn the history of money, what money should be, and how governments throughout history have used money to control society (to the detriment of individuals)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Factual account of a history of money.","review":"I am relatively new to the written word of libertarianism, but have been there in theory and practice for quite some time. That set aside, this short, yet informative, book will give ANY reader looking for an account of the history of money all they would need and then some.I was very pleased with the content of this book. It first explains how money came to be, and then, expands on how it has progressed to it's frail existence today. However, the primary focus is how government intentionally inflates money through various interventions. It also explains how things could be drastically different with money back on the gold standard and untouched by regulations.I'd recommend this book to anyone looking to expand their knowledge on the history and workings of the monetary system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rothbard is a genius!","review":"Rothbard traces the history of money (gold) as a means of exchange all the way to the development of fiat money printed by central bankers. Rothbard demonstrates the dangerous nexus of government, corporatist rent-seeking, and central banking. In this process, Rothbard illustrates the methodical destruction of the gold reserve and the apearance fiat money and inflation directed by the U.S. government and the central bank. The end result is that central banks grow richer from the creation of money while enabling the unchecked growth of the welfare and warfare state at the expense of the free market and the individual liberty of the U.S. citizens.It is not a long book and it is accessible to the average reader. The prose is excellent and Rothbard provides multiple examples and explanations to illustrate his ideas. It is a must read for anytone who really wants to understand what is happneing in the U.S. economy today."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gem","review":"\\"What Has Government Done to Our Money\\" is an excellent introduction to the consistent libertarian view of money; namely, that government need not intervene in a nation's monetary life at all (either by printing money or regulating banks). In a relatively short number of pages, Rothbard explains money, inflation, banking, and the history of monetary policy. Rothbard notes that the dream of the banksters is a single currency that can be inflated at will. With the rise of the EU and the Euro, we are getting closer to that day.Don't stop with this book -- be sure to get Rothbard's \\"A History of Money and Banking in the US\\" and also \\"The Mystery of Banking.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"Overall this is a very good book. It explains the theory of money and how governments handle it, which is to say not well. The only contention I have with it is on foreign trade. In a perfect world where trade was between near equals, such as the small European regions that were observed to form the Free Trade theory, then it could work. In the real world, not so much. But the rest, about the need for some kind of limiting factor on government's ability and willingness to inflate currency is spot on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exactly what I was waiting","review":"this book has one big problem: it has more ideology than economic theory, more beliefs than science"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad delusions of goldbugs","review":"This book is your usual right wing rant against governments as a whole and Keynesian fiscal policy in particular.Only the extreme right want a return to the gold standard, the vast majority of mainstream economists from both the left and right reject a gold standard as inflexible and out-dated.Try again please."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Lucy Show","review":"Fellow Fans, Today I've gotten this Dvd in the mail.

Never before had Jack Dangers put his voice, or his samples to better use to weave a protest against the Reagan/Bush/Thatcher administrations of the 80s and early 90s. He was, like a lot of us youngsters, upset at what had been dubbed the \\"New World Order\\" and he, along with Johhny Stephens used Satyricon as a forum to vent their frustrations on issues such as politics, animal rights, corporate greed, depletion of natural resources, overpopulation, even organized religion was a target.

Nevertheless, don't waste your time and money on this album; there's far better stuff by Meat Beat Manifesto.Depending on what particular era/style of techno or industrial you like, go for either their early albums, 99%, or SUBLIMINAL SANDWICH, all of which are far superior to SATYRICON."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I was hoping","review":"I bought this because it was the closest formula to some of the older, better weight loss supplements. Unfortunately, this wasn't a good replacement. It could be that my body doesn't react as well to this formula as it used to, but there are other issues as well. When I opened the bottle, at least 20% of the capsules had burst during shipping. Since it's an oil/liquid supplement, it coated all the other capsules and made them slippery and difficult to take. I got some energy from JetFuel, but not enough to justify the price. I'd skip this one and try something like VPX Redline Ultimate or Meltdown.

Ted didn't come off as being tough enough. You know when you watch an action movie and you get that sense that the hero in the movie is going to kick butt and mess up the bad guys. I never really got that feeling from Ted; he came off as a guy with an adorable smile. He just didn't have that dangerous vibe that a one-man hero need's. Even John Cena came off as being more tougher than him. Ted was playing a experinced Marine in this movie, but he came off as being a guy who just joined the marines rather than an experienced Marine. He just wasn't believable as The Marine 2 and WWE could have casted this movie better. It's an okay movie, but there are no highs.

As an actor, I would say that he can compare with any carboard figure in the world and come out losing. And he doesn't know how to fight. In fact, any ten year-old karate student from the school across the street can not only teach him a lot but also beat the crap out of him. Why didn't they let him wrestle the bad guys rather than throwing girl scout punches?In this movie he has to fight some Thai experts who beat him in a most disgusting way and, at the end, had him win. It's ludicrous.Among other annoying flaws of this movie: anybody acts decently and does a good job, except DiBiase, the hero. What a downer! Where were you, Tom Cena?I give this flick 2 stars, just because all other actors were superb, compared to DiBiase. Oh, and he has a few tender moments with his movie wife (beautiful actress Lara Cox) and looks awkward and out of place and is as romantic as a pine cone."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok movie","review":"I won't go into the plot- as that has been discussed in other reviews.

I wasn't expecting anything great seeing as it was movie starring a WWE star and it was straight to DVD, but I thought I'd get at least a decent action flick. I rented it off netflix and quickly learned I was wrong. Dibiase (along with everyone else in the movie) can't act to save their lives. It's not believable that Ted is a Marine (or a part of any armed forces for that matter). The plot was even weaker than the first. The action is mediocre at best. About halfway through the movie the disc skipped a bit and the audio went out of sync with the picture making it seem like a bad Godzilla movie.

The hat with the brioche stitch is a pattern with confusing directions as well in that the stripes according to the pattern are at a slant when I knit them. I've tried twice with no success.

There is a segment on how to take a relaxing bath. Run water, light candles, music, bla bla bla. Like I never thought about how to take a bath? As if it never occured to me to clean my tub before bathing or to light candles? Then there is a segment on how to brew tea from loose leaves. Really? I would think the author would figure out that if one has high enough knitting skills to complete the complicated patterns presented, surely then they would know how to bathe or brew tea, or bake a simple sugar cookie recipe.Also, the table of contents is terrible and you can't find a pattern by looking it up this way.sorry to sound mean but this book is terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty pictures but poor instructions","review":"I am an experienced knitter and was very excited about getting this book as a gift.

In order to finish these I had to completely revise the pattern and ignore the book. Even after this I felt that one bad pattern wasn't worth dismissing the entire book, so I tried the brioche scarf.

This book has little to do with technology or hypermedia as a form of communication. He reminds us, and again suggests, and then points out, and later reminds us again that hypermedia is different from books and periodicals printed on paper. This insight, delivered through meandering and pointless prose, often obscured by subordinate 'critical' statements, is not much of an insight. Using work done in the 1980s and 90s Landow suggests a great reconfiguring of narrative, of writing, and of authors (or authorship- but that's not clear). Much, much better books covering far more ground are \\"Convergence Culture\\" by Henry Jenkins and \\"Radiant Textuality\\" by McGann."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dark Side Interviews","review":"This is the worst pink floyd DVD in fact the worst DVD that money can buy.

The price is very deceiving as excellent prints of other DVD's run at this price or lower sometimes. \\"The Torture Chamber of Dr.Sadism\\" sorely needs a release with a quality print in it's uncut entirety.

Aside from selections taken from all of Marx's major works, it contains lesser-known selections on a variety of topics. The whole presents a steady stream of selections through Marx's life. Consequently, it gives the length and breadth of Marx's writing without burying you in a life-time of reading. Short explanatory introductions help place the selections in Marx's development and in broader history.A good follow up is Main Currents of Marxism by Leszek Kolakowski (3 volumes).

It starts out kind of slow, and it takes place in San Fransisco rather than Brooklyn, but if you want the beginnings of this loved show, I would check it out.Maybe Shout Factory will be able to release the Pilot in the Third Season of the DVD collection, or release a special edition with it.

Wanna hear a good singer singing great songs that they actually wrote pick up Stevie Wonder, Donnie Hathaway. Not that I'm an old fogie or anything I love new music there is just less good new stuff out there. If you want something new that is good check out Velvet Revolver, Audioslave, or if your into pop at least Christina Aguilera can sing her but off, although the songs are kind of lame.

The rest of this album is a bunch of mediocre to flat songs, from the lame, bland Dane Deviller and Sean Hosein ballads to the ones that Montell Jordan and a just starting Mario Winans contributed. Only Nick Lachey is the best singer out of this group and Jeff Timmons and Drew Lachey didn't sound good here. Their '98 album was much better than this fluff.

The main character, while the author tries to make her likeable, felt stiff and unyielding to me. Of course, this may have been deliberate on the part of the author - however, I kept trying to find something to hang on to in the story and I could not.I have, however, rated the book a 4 star for the absolutely excellent portrayal of what an eating disorder can do to the person suffering as well as the family members. Ah, denial....it is a powerful thing.This book is well written and hits all the right chords, but there was just something slightly off about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect - The Perfect Novel for Eating Disordered Teens","review":"I grew up with anoreixa and I now see many of my students suffering from both anorexia and bulimia. This book gives insight to what it is like to have an eating disorder and why it becomes an addiction.I read Perfect in a day. Although it was short and the writing wasn't exactly Newberry Medal material, Natasha Friend illustrates an eating disordered girl's life very well.She sheds light on other disorders (compulsive overeating and anoreixa) and lets you see how easily a teen can be sucked in and manipulative when in the grasp of bulimia.You never find out what happens to Isabelle in the end, but from the message the book sends, I believe she gets well. Eating disorders are horrible and its great to see a book that doesn't sterotype or judge those that have them, but just makes people understand that its not just about weight, but about life events too."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Read!!!","review":"I absolutely loved reading this book.Throughout the whole story you feel like you're actually there,like the story is very real.I recommend this book for teen girls and moms.I was at the bookstore one day looking for a book and when I saw perfect I knew I just had to read it!You will love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely acurate, great read!","review":"Although I am far above the recommended age of reader, 23, I picked up this title because I have struggled with anorexia and bulimia for 12 years. Unlike many other eating disorder fictions, which I usually find cliche, too textbook case, unrelatable, this book was dead on. It did not shy away from specifics about the life of a bulimic, it was candid, emotional, and in so many parts mirrored my own life exactly. I recommend this book highly to any pre/early teen girl, and also to older teens and adults who have patients, children, siblings with eating disorders, as this book does an excellent job of explaining the mindset of someone with an e.d. Those who, like myself, have had an e.d. will relate to it.

As a school nurse, I feel that this book is too graphic for girls under the age of 14 and should only be read in a setting where an adult is available to ask questions afterwards."},{"rating":"2","title":"some real cons","review":"I loved this book for the atmosphere, and all the reasons mentioned by the others, and yet, when i read this as a preteen, I had never heard of Bulimia, and this book gave me all i needed to experiment with it some!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Why\\"","review":"As a reader, I find it increasingly more difficult to determine whether I want to see and digest the contents of a book before I read it. I am of the opinion that once someone sees, hears, or feels something repeatedly, the shock value wears off and the person begins to accept it as normal. Why do authors targeting youg readers find it necessary to insert sexually shocking scenes into their work. The book is certainly well written and appealing, however, I would not want to recommend it to the audience it targets because I do not want to promote, homosexual relationships, internet porn, nor sexual threesome \\"romps\\".

She hid one of her father's old shirts in her closet...hasn't everyone heard of this a thousand times before?There were also the issues of the characters immaturity...calling her sister 'Ape Face' really wasn't so cute the first time, and seriously annoying by the end.All in all, fine to read if you're very, very bored and it's your only option...any other time, pick up something better.Cheers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic.","review":"This book was very unrealistic.It annoyed me from the very beginning.

I must have seen this hundreds of times and I never get tired of it! Arthur is just a hilarious drunk rich man, who falls in love with a waitress (Liza Minnelli). With his hilarious drunken escapades, and Hobson - his dear friend and butler, this movie will keep you and everyone else in your family in stitches. This is a sweet and funny story, with a strong moral that stresses that love wins over money and money does not buy happiness. This movie will be enjoyed by the entire family!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightfully funny","review":"Arthur is a wonderful ride through a poor little rich man's life.

Multi millionaire playboy Arthur Bock has very few close friends, save for his butler (Gielgud) who's all but raised him, with mixed results. The problem is that Arthur dates tramps until he meets a beautiful young shoplifter (Minnelli) whom he cannot marry due to prearranged plans between the Bock and Johnson clans.Stormy weather ensues, with probably the least likely heroine coming to the fore at the film's climax. Throughout it all,though, it's Gielgud who really stands out, sparing no one with his haughty, sardonic remarks, and playing a key role in the film's final outcome, just before his untimely demise. You're really missing some good fun if you've never seen this comedy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No sound","review":"The DVD came and the whole family sat in front of the TV with popcorn.

There are flashs and the movie moves constantly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sir Gielgud steals the show.","review":"As others have noted, Arthur is a delightful comedy taken from the 1930s screwball \\"My Man Godfrey\\" genre. It is an effectively told, outlandish story that winds up succeeding despite some dodgy jokes and an overabundance of lukewarm sympathies.However, without Sir John Gielgud (a gentleman who truly deserved the knighthood), the film's faults would be much more apparent. He elevates every scene he is in with his impeccable refinement and a wit that is sharpened to perfection. He is the pillar in a film which desperately needed credibility.And the title song is a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best laugh you will have.","review":"This is one of the best movies made in that it allows you to forget the Politically Correct world that we live in.

The only flaw in this movie is that it appears to condone alcoholism and irresponsibility. In this film, these issues can be put aside at least until the picture is over.

These soles go up the side of the \\"shoe\\" so he won't ruin them when he wears them outside to put the dogs out or to go to the corner for a paper.The upper part of the slippers is very comfortable, fuzzy, warm and soft, but the hard sole does mean the inside isn't as \\"squishy\\" as that of my own dearfoam's. Mine conform to my feet, sort of like memory foam--these don't do that but are still very comfortable.

Giving us stellar performances of masterpieces such as \\"Elijah\\",\\"The Creation\\" and other large choral works.

I was hoping to hear a little more 4-part harmony and less singing in unison. I was very disappointed because this was NOT what I was looking for. I am surprised that this CD is rated so highly,(which is why I bought it).

My preference as always been for simple, traditional, a capella arrangements of Christmas carols. The Robert Shaw Chamber Singers' sound is so perfect in tone, so beautful in color, so musical in phrasing... it just doesn't get any better than this. If actual angels knocked at your door and sang you Christmas carols, it would sound like this.Since I know not everyone shares my taste, here is what you might miss if you like the huge-chorus-huge-orchestra Christmas albums -- you WON'T get bangs and crashes, trumpet sections, grand finales or 20th century arrangements.Christmas carols + tradition +a capella voices + simplicity + beauty + perfection + superior musicianship = Robert Shaw Songs of Angels"},{"rating":"2","title":"That warm and fuzzy feeling","review":"I love everything about this album and can't recommend it enough. My mom listened to it when she was a kid, and she continued the holiday tradition when my brother and I were growing up.

Plus, the selections range from classics that are well-known in the States to little-known carols from Spain and Britain, which are lovely.

While some people may complain about the change in song structures towards the end of the album, I think it makes for a better listen. This collection of songs is a perfect introduction to what hardcore used to be, and you can even see the metal influence creeping in toward the end of the cd. It has been said that Reagan Youth were adding the metal sounds as more of a joke than anything, but it still makes for an intriguing listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful...","review":"Yes, beautiful. You probably don't hear that word used to describe a hardcore punk rock CD often, but this one deserves it. It has some of the usual hardcore punk rock songs, meaning they are short and fast. These songs are very good. This CD also contains a lot of slower songs, but they still sound hardcore. These slower songs are amazing! Jesus Was a Communist, Queen Babylon, and Heavy Metal Shuffle are some of the best songs on A Collection of Pop Classics, and they could be considered \\"stoner\\" music, meaning they are long, drawn out, and have great guitar playing.If you are interested, search the Internet for a short biography telling about lead singer Dave Insurgent's life, it is pretty sad, but very interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recording nuh good","review":"this would be a fantastic CD as the songs are great, if you could hear them.

I was hoping the album would be a Gilberto Gil interpretation of Marley's music, and in some few and far between instances there is some of that; but I have to agree with the review that states that this album is a \\"too faithful interpretation of Bob Marley\\". It is Gilberto doing Marley without any Gilberto flairs. It's not a fusion of Brazilian music with Raggae, just an artist singing the old tunes with the old band (which still has what it takes, I must add).

You can't connect your cable to the unit, you're going to have something else to tune and convert your cable signal to composite, RGB, or S-Video. Then you're going to have to carefully position the IR emitter of the Archos DVR station so that it's pointed into the IR receiver of your tuner. In all likelihood this means you can't put the DVR station where you want it.You'll be better off without this. Get a tuner for your computer, use it as your DVR and transfer the recordings via USB."},{"rating":"2","title":"Record TV directly to 605 without needing transcoding","review":"The DVR charges your 605 much faster than through USB. But the best function is to record TV or any other video sources directly. First, it does not have a TV tuner. With this limitation, I connect the DVR between my VCR and the TV. When I set up for recording, I have the DVR faces me and its remote. When finish, I have to turn it around so it's IR emitter faces the VCR's IR receiver. Other than this issue, it works well and relatively simple. One thing, I recorded a show that was four hours long (3 GB file in size), it plays fine in the Archos. But in transferring the file to the computer, the video actually was separated into two avi files--a avi and a av2 files. The av2 won't play in the computer.

Leaving the archos 605 docked to a plugged-in DVR 24/7 will kill the battery. My 605 160gb was perfect for about a year. Then , i left it on the DVR for week straight, something i've never done before, and the battery only lasted 5 minutes after that. Before, I got a few hours of video time. Apparently, you're not supposed to leave the unit plugged in and attached to AC power for long periods of time.

It has a qwerty remote which makes it possible to use the internet while your on your Archos on the big screen. If your not a thumb typer it still has many features which will interest you. Converting your archos into a dvr (or DVP) is great. I have not used the DVR functions so the issues that others have had with power on and off have not botherd me. I convert my DVD's to digital and use this to access my hard disk through the wireless network. It queues up easily, plays with not hick-up's or network lag and allows remote control access to over 2TB of video, music and photos without having to figure out where I put that disk last time I watched it.

However, even I felt this book was a bit condescending. The tone of the book would be fine if the publisher had chosen to be upfront about what you could expect to find within it but the exterior of the book leads you to believe you are going to find some tips and techniques about getting your homeschool organized. This book is much more of a \\"mind set\\" about being organized and relying on your faith to help you attain what you are seeking. I'm fine with that premise but that's not why I picked up this book.If you are basically organized and are looking for support in what you already know, this book might be for you. If you were not born organized and you are seeking actual suggestions to help you create a peaceful homeschool environment, I'd recommend finding another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it says it is at all","review":"I never would have purchased this book if the description or back cover comments had told me what the book was really about. This is a very religious book with a hint of organizational methods thrown in. This is a complete waste of money if you are really lookiing for organizational tips. If you want bible lessons and a lot of preaching this is the book for you. I am hoping I can return it because it was sold with what I consider a very dishonest description in order to get people's money and lure them unwittingly into a lecture on god. Any other book on this topic would have to be better for a non christian."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is encouraging?","review":"I wanted to like this book, I really did. Heaven knows I have been weary of my disorganization. I picked this up at a used curriculum sale and bought it based on the title without first glancing at the contents. If I had, I wouldn't have bought it, even at the \\"bargain\\" price. There may be good hints in it, but I could not get past the first two chapters to find them. I had to put the book down. The tone in this book is extremely arrogant, as if the author is yelling at the reader. (There are exclamation marks everywhere!) If the goal of this book is to encourage a disorganized person like me into making changes, it fails. Maybe some people like to get beat up, but I'm not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I expected...","review":"I was very disappointed by this book lack of warning of its religious premise. It is not necessary to be religious or Bible savvy in order to be a homeschooler or organized. If a book is going to quote the Bible so many times it ought to warn the readers on the back cover. The copy I got offered no warning at all and it wasn't until the second page that I realized that this book was not for me. I have nothing against religion but, a book that uses it to justify the meaning of homeschooling or being an organized parent is useless to me and others like me. The author and publisher should have been more upfront about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible author equals cheap price","review":"In my opinion this author is just plain terrible.

I thought the standouts were the actors portraying Lonnie, who seemed to be comfortable in his role, as well as Ameera, whose tell-it-like-it-is persona is very reminiscent of a real-life girlfriend.The lighting was inconsistent.

Two men in love with the same woman join forces to bring down the guy they think is responsible for a murder and there broken hearts. Is this guy guilty or innocent?When the author introduces Van Holt, a former FBI agent things really begin to take off. The tension builds and builds.

I enjoyed the tension between the two men--and the terrible bond that held them together. I'm happy to have discovered T. Jefferson Parker recently. Loved The Blue Hour also. Parker has the ability to capture the inner workings of his characters' minds--and besides that he can tell a mighty interesting story. I must also say I was drawn to the villain in the story. It was so very hard to hate him...

Also, the characters were too contrived and lacked credibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hackneyed, heavy handed fantasy writing","review":"There's actually a good story here, which in the hands of a decent writer might have been turned into something really good. Unlike his namesake Robert, this Parker's writing is cringingly bad, with cartoon characters and heavy handed lines. His FBI is political fantasy, both in terms of characters (yeah right, a Jew, woman and WASP), character and politics (what happened to the FBI involved in 'dirty tricks,' assassination of civil rights figures and unlawful and warrantless surveillance?).

While the book is interesting, as a more mature woman, L believe Schreiver's assumptions about the feelings of older women, men and sex are way off base.

It starts off in typical Shriver fashion, but peters off within three chapters. Too wordy, too little introspection, in a word, boring. You don't really get to know the characters, they seem to be shoved at you as opposed to actually learning their personalities/figure out whether or not you like or dislike them.

Why isn't the maker of this board looking into the problem?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Bamboo times two","review":"This is the second TB Congo I have purchased in the last month. I've thrown out all of my other boards. The board is the perfect size and heft and is downright beautiful. With proper maintenance, I expect a long life from these boards.My Amazon experience this second time was disappointing.The board arrived in the bottom of a large box with the protectant air bags on top of the board. Any impacts to the bottom of the box would have damaged the board. I was lucky. Additionally, this board came with one loop of jute twine around it and one TB tag. It was clearly a (barely) \\"repackaged\\" return from someone else. My first TB board was entirely wrapped front and back and packaged securely, surrounded with air bags.I expect and have gotten better from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warps and cracks","review":"Owned for a year now.

Cracked as well -- even though I oiled it a few times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got a warped one!","review":"I read good things about this board in Cook's Illustrated, so I picked one up to use as a second board. I do most of my cooking on a huge Boos Rock Maple board and wanted to replace my smaller board with something nice.Unfortunately, my board came in warped, as other people warned about. The warp is quite bad - in two directions so it wasn't stable on either side.Real shame - the board is very attractive and it feels and smells nice.Any, I just returned it. Maybe I'll try the Totally Bamboo Flat Grain - from what I have read it it thicker, but more solid than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Bamboo Congo (almost) totally great!","review":"I have had my board for 1 1/2 months. It is wonderful to use! It is so easy on my knives, but still doesn't mark appreciably. It is large enough to handle almost anything, but not too large to handle. It has warped a little with use. I just use it with the concave side down, or I could use a towel under it. I am careful to wash and dry it immediately after use. I keep it oiled with ordinary mineral oil. Except for the slight warping (which doesn't bother me, but might bother others), I recommend it very highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice, but not built to last","review":"I bought one of these a year ago and it worked well for a while. I oiled it with mineral oil every month and always washed it by hand. After a few months it became warped, but a few months later it straightened itself out again. Now it has split down the middle. It looked nice and worked well for a year, but I wouldn't buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cracked within months","review":"I purchased this board on the recommendation of Cooks Illustrated. I was really pleased with this board - for a few months. I oiled it as recommended, but it split in two places after about 3 months. Their ad specifically says it will not split or crack. I wrote to Totally Bamboo, and they are replacing the board for a new $6 shipping charge. In the meantime, it has warped badly and is difficult to use. I will see how the new one holds up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"I received the cutting board in perfect condition.

It's very easy on the hands and beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prone to Cracking","review":"I used this cutting board for about 6 months before it started to split down the middle. I had only washed by hand and had applied mineral oil consistently. I exchanged the cutting board for a new one, which arrived in the mail with a split already in it. That was enough to convince me that the first splitting was not a fluke and that this very nice looking cutting board doesn't actually hold up for very long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally warped","review":"Stay away!! Board came VERY warped and wobbly. Utterly useless. Returned it-- I will now invest some real $$ in a real cutting board."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cracked first board, cracked second board (before using!)","review":"We received this board as a wedding gift. It arrived in good shape but when we took it out to use for the first time, it had already cracked. When I contacted the company for a replacement, they sent another one, which was cracked beneath the sticker that wraps the board. I'm disappointed by this product b/c it was so highly recommended by Cooks Illustrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very apt title","review":"This book is hot from start to finish - no need to skim read or page turn for the good bits here.

A lot of people complained about this and apparently after reading another review they followed the same pattern with the DVD release.The fansub group that was doing this series originaly added pictures of the characters in this series and it sparked a huge debate. The banner was changed eventualy. The viewers complained about the series being on about the same level as Hentai.On a frequent basis the main characters close will suddenly explode leaving her completely bare. I won't give you any details as to why if you do decide to watch this series.This series in the end landed in my pile of never to watch again.I will admit though the ending song is probably one of the best songs I have heard on any anime series.

The writing style is immensely easy to read and the knowledge contained within the book is truly eye opening. It covers all aspects of the brain from addiction to emotion, and memory to relationships, and more besides. I agree that Winston strays from the narrative at times, but it generally seems to be done to make a point, and I found it added to the overall entertainment of the book (after all, it's good to enjoy a book whilst you learn as well!). This is a good first book to read if you're interested in the human brain and how it works and if the interest grabs you there's plenty more out there to explore.

Easy to read and even easier to know from your own experience that the message is true."},{"rating":"2","title":"A whistleblower from inside the mainstream media speaks out","review":"Goldberg provides the evidence about what most Americans have known for some time. The mainstream media has a cultural/institutional/philosophical bias to the left. It's the phenomena of group think. Goldberg was on the inside of the mainstream media for many years and tells it as he saw it. He offers criticism for left-wing ideologues in the media but also praises those that strive for balance. Sadly, fair-reporting seems to be going extinct. Between his book \\"Bias\\" and this one, Goldberg has done an important service. Although this does at times seem like a right-wing political diatribe, it's just because of the author's passion and the pervasiveness of the bias he had to deal with throughout his career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read.","review":"I like this book very much as it was written by an insider ,Mr.Goldberg. Of course, the more liberal readers will try to denigrate the book by name calling of the author(something they do rather then just read the book),but in this case Mr. Goldberg is a LIBERAL,but a rare honest one.Must read if only to set the record straight through the eyes of an insider."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Disappointment","review":"Much of the information here has already been covered in his previous book Bias. Given Mr. Goldberg's tone in the book the title probably refers to his own viewpoints. He has a harsh tone and a I-know-everything point of view. The most liberal of all media owners publishes his book at the same time Goldberg is crtical of liberal media. Hahahah What a joke! It seems to me that the author has sold out to the highest bidder and this casts a dark shawdow on his real motives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough Bernard!","review":"After reading both of his books, I find Bernard Goldberg to be very different from other politcal writers. The difference is, I'm not even sure he believes the right wing propoganda he is soliciting. It is quite obvious that he is very bitter over the way he was treated at CBS, and is trying to embarass them and make money for himself with these books. He changed all of his political views overnight to try to get back at his former employers. He wished to be one of the so called \\"Media Elite\\" and since he can't be with them, he is against them. Do yourself a favor and don't waste you time reading this book written out of bitterness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrogance","review":"I can't believe Goldberg is calling anyone arrogant. He's not a serious person. Just the kind of person Fox or someone like that likes to quote without asking any serious questions. Goldberg and his crowd just aren't held to the same standards as the New York Times, CBS and the rest. Really awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Right on!","review":"The author is right on about the arrogance of the elite media like Fox News, the Washington Times, and the Wall Street Journal, for if they had not parroted President Bush's false claims about WMD, we would never have entered the ill-fated Iraq War. Instead, we are in a war, which seems to have no end in sight. What arrogance!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weekend at Bernie's Part 2","review":"Wake up, Bernie!

Gimme a break, already!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Insiders Look at the Media","review":"If anyone would know the people who work in the media, Bernard Goldberg would. In this book, he nails down the culture behind the newscasts and tells the reader exactly why most people who work in the media are biased on the side of liberalism. He explains that this whole process starts in journalism school, and makes its way into the newsrooms and studios of most TV and mainstream print media. He makes the case for the mindset of those starry eyed journalism graduates and the sometimes naive approach to the news. This book explains in detail, why those working in the mainstream media believe the way they do. How they associate only with like minded people and would never hear an argument against anything they have come to believe about themselves or their work. How they exist in a self created vacuum, and the cultural bubble that surrounds them. Great book. Worth every penny if you want to truly understand today's mainstream media."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arrogance","review":"Thank Goodness someone has shown Bernie Goldberg \\"the light\\" he exposes all the dirty little secrets in the newsrooms that no one else had the courage to speak about. Its a fantastic book- well researched and very entertaining I especially enjoyed the cd version. I would love to get Dan Rather and those other useless anchors put them in a padded cell and make them listen to Bernard Goldberg's book. He shows a lot of courage in his writings and is not afraid to take on the tough subject of race in America and how the media treats the subject. He exposes the PC police which are the mainstream media! I hope the NY Times owner (I believe his name is Salzberger) reads this book and realizes he needs to move out of his distorted 60's mindset and start giving us some real news which is meaningful! We're sick of him using the national and global news as his own editorial page! Kudos to Bernie! He's my idol in 2004"},{"rating":"1","title":"I second the Daily Howler posters","review":"Well, I was going to post a review that mentioned the Daily Howler's excellent articles on this book, but I see I have already been beaten to it.

Mr Goldberg merely presents the examples that fit his agenda."},{"rating":"2","title":"In depth analysis","review":"\\"Bias\\" blew the lid off the subject of bias in the big media and \\"Arrogance\\" is an excellent follow up to that title for those who want to go deeper and understand more about this profoundly important subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Homerun from Goldberg","review":"This is a terrific addition to the literature concerning the growing bias and arrogance of America's national media. One need only to scan a few of the major networks news broadcasts or pick up a national newspaper to see the bias writ large. It is so blatant and \\"in your face\\" now that its existence can no longer be denied."},{"rating":"2","title":"EVEN BETTER THAN HIS LAST BEST SELLER","review":"If Mr. Goldberg needed to provide any further evidence that media bias exists, the best example would be the fact that this book, which is even better than BIAS, hasn't been reviewed in the New York Times - despite the fact that his last book was on the best seller list forever, and this one made its debut there last week! I mean, come on - Al Franken is a more important writer? Anyway, this would be a perfect holiday gift for your liberal friends (assuming you've got 'em) and relations; a very civilized, well-organized and abundantly convincing examination of institutionalized meadi's leftward slant, with some revealing interviews. It's a terrific book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest.","review":"This is a well researched, informative read. The author spent a few decades in the media world he is critiquing. This gives him far more credibility than those of us on the outside looking in. He gives a myriad of examples of how many in our media are eternally trying to change America by manufacturing consent. There truly is a culture war going on. \\"From airhead celebrity rantings, academics, editors and journalists pushing anti-religious, anti-traditionalism, Political Correctness, Secularism, Moral relativism, Socialism, and big government solutions to problems. Ex: Walter Cronkite's fifty year love affair with the corrupt and often incompetent United Nations. His conclusion that their left leaning bias comes from their insulated world that is very often totally removed from that of everyday Americans is logical."},{"rating":"1","title":"A letdown after BIAS","review":"I was expecting much more after having read Goldberg's previous book, Bias, which I thoroughly enjoyed. His second book on the subject of how the media is biased against conservatives is disappointing. It doesn't read easily and is often repetitive and unoriginal. While I applaud his effort to help us understand just how those in control of the national mainstream media are warping the news to fit their agendas, I cannot recommend this book. Sorry, Mr. Goldberg."},{"rating":"2","title":"The title should be Absolute Arrogance","review":"This work validates my sense of the American Media base. I simply could not accept that the majority could hate its own country as much as the media would have me believe. The main stream democrats that I know (including high ranking democrats) simply do not side with the media's view of liberals and the liberal left. It is as though the media has formed its own political party with a strongly separate agenda from both the republican party and the majority of democrats. It is truly scary when I consider the powerful blows the media lands to influence its viewers or readers. It almost seems there should be some sort of objective mechanism in place to verify the claims of the media before they are hoisted on the public."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Goldberg should take his own advise","review":"I read the book after watching Mr. Goldberg on television several times. I was looking forward to the book. Mr. Goldberg attacks mainstream media for not checking it facts while making obvious errors, for taking things out of context and for media taking sides in the issues of the day. He then fails to follow his own advise. On page 219 and 220 he allegedly quotes Ted Turner for calling the 911 hijackers brave. Obviously this was wrong and he puts words in Mr. Turner's mouth. Then he cites a speech of Febraury 11, 2000. Either Mr. Turner can see in the future or the refence is wrong as this speech would have occurred 19 months before the hijackers took over the planes.He then ends the book by saying the media elites should follow Ed Murrow for their guide. He then quotes Mr. Murrow taking sides on a great issue of the time.I thought the book drags on and he takes long to make his point. I agree with what he says he should just follow his own advise."},{"rating":"1","title":"im not convinced on this product","review":"i purchased this from lowes because buying it from here they remove the cables and remote that come with it. then they sell it seperate.

Drake Bell is appealing as the Peter Parker-type teen who gets bit by a dragonfly and develops superpowers. Other cast members, including Leslie Nielson and Sara Paxton as the love interest (mugging like Kirsten Dunst) do a good job, too, but they can't make such a lame script funny. Unless of course, you find flatulence really funny. There's lots of farting in this movie. And a few small clever bits, but they are few and far between.

Those of you who say it takes time to snap it on and off aren't thinking about what you have to do to change the crib sheet. First of all, the bumper has to be removed just to get to the mattress in any reasonable fashion and that's a pain to tie on and off. Especially when you get it on there just right. Then you have to lift up the mattress to get to the sheet bottom and pull it over the corners. Did I mention that moving the mattress causes that cute little dust ruffle to get out of poistion? Ugh, I don't think so.I'd much rather deal with a few straps and snaps then have my daughter sit on a soaking sheet (this pad wicks away the moisutre) and have to go through so much trouble to change it.As far as the \\"imprint\\" on her face, I haven't noticed any and she hasn't been bothered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not use this item- crib death danger","review":"If you research the toxic gas theory for crib death (which has been around for 15? years) you will see that this item can produce toxic nerve gases just like crib mattresses can.

The story of Martha Graham is inevitably the story of Modern Dance-- which many would say she invented--and the history of American artists--of which she was the queen.De Mille's book is both extremely informative and thoroughly enjoyable. She gives you the history you need in order to put Graham's revolutionary dance technique in context, and then she offers personal insights and observations on the life, love affairs, personality, triumphs, and tragedies of the inimitable Martha.A portrait of a truly incredible, inspiring, tiny giant of a woman by another who is at least her equal in intellect and probably in artistry as well.For anyone interested in dance, this book is an absolute must."},{"rating":"1","title":"Designing for EMC article Review","review":"The article currently being offered for sale is defective.

However, the engagement goes bad, and Gallahad must think of a way to get his godson into the castle to mend the relationship. Pure Wodehouse.This story is a good read, but not the best of the series. However, if you're a Wodehouse fan, you probably should pick this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pelican at Blandings","review":"This CD arrived promptly and in good condition. As for the content, I am an admirer of P. G. Wodehouse's humor. The performer reading the story was excellent, and seemed to be enjoying himself. He was spot on with the characters and brought them to vibrant life. Altogether a very enjoyable experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better later Wodehouse novels","review":"If you are familiar with the menagerie at Blandings Castle, this has every element that will make you happy. Much of Wodehouse's later novels have simpler plots and fewer of the fantastic comic sentences for which he is loved. This novel is an exception. It can stand up to the best of Wodehouse's mid-career work. The interplay between the siblings Clarence, Galahad and Constance contained in these pages would make a great introduction to anyone unfamiliar with Wodehouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must for PB enthusiasts","review":"It had to be See For Miles, United Kingdom to assemble this scarce collection.

The tracks carefully selected are difficult to obtain even on vinyl discs. I have some old 45 rpms, but they have been played too many times to give a true reproduction. Hence, this CD is very welcome."},{"rating":"2","title":"APOCALYPTIC WESTERN","review":"Earth has left the drone and the low guitar and bass sounds to allow this time slow and atmospherical western strings, the whole environment the sounds of Hex: Or Printing in the Infernal Method sugests are desertical, grey in times, dry, nostalgic for old american days, charming, captivating and serene, far from the heaviness of previous Earth works and less complicated in instrumental arrangments, of course I hope they return in coming albums to their basic sound but this is a great experimental and conceptuall release, Dylan Carson have made of Earth a cult band in the field of progresive drone, doom , country and western.HM"},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing characters and a strong plot...","review":"... always make for the best mysteries.

Can't go wrong with Skippy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fast read~didn't want to put it down!","review":"I really enjoyed the Skip Langdon female lead character. Especially good were all the references to New Orleans, where the story is set. The characters were from so many different segments of the population, ranging from mob lords, drug dealers, inner-city poverty scenarios, respected business men and the very wealthy and affluent Garden District patrons, and yet somehow they were all intertwined in a very believable way.I would have given this 5 stars, except I found two glaring typos ( actually misspellings) which drives me crazy.

The songs fall under the category of romantic salsa but with a fast tempo. They are definitely all danceable. The most popular songs are: Arrepentida, Bongo (a nightclub favorite), He tratado (a nightclub gem as well) and Juliana (a salsa lover's delight). This edition is better than some of the newer Calle 8 editions, don't let the year fool you, this salsa is still popular among the connoisseurs of this genre and salsa dancers in general.

Great information and a lead in to one of comics Greastest story lines that is already out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Windows Media Only Digital Copy? What the Heck?","review":"I liked the movie, but what really disappoints me is that the Digital Copy is only Windows Media compatible. Now to be fair, it does say so on the package, if you squint real hard and look at the fine print on the back. I've taken up the habit of buying movies with digital copies because I've got a lot of room left on my iPod, this is the first time I've run into this problem. Other movies I buy offer a Mac or Windows version, as was the case with \\"The Dark Knight\\" (say, wasn't that a WB release too?). As for the movie, the animation is the best I've seen from any of the DC Direct to DVD movies. This has the potential to spawn some sequels, and if they keep the quality up I hope they do. So anyway, I liked the movie, it is much like an intergalactic cop movie, the digital copy shaft still hurts though."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly made","review":"I was kind of excited to get an animated green lantern blu-ray.

Very bad move WB. Windows DRM is terrible, after binding the copy to your pc, good luck getting the license to work if you have to reinstall the OS!

The other DC PG-13 animated features, such as \\"Superman Doomsday\\" and \\"Justice League: The New Frontier\\" have either more exciting action or better stories. The rules about the Green Lantern's powers were also unclear in the movie. It was unclear why he would be in distress one moment and then winning the next. The animation is okay but not pretty or creative. This movie is mostly for fans of all the various DC TV cartoons, rather than a brooder audience.

But I thought I was buying the live action release of Green Lantern. As a lifelong comics fan, first of DC superheroes and then Marvel Comics characters, I am always excited to see the tv and film versions come to life with live characters. Is there an actual Green Lantern action movie in the works?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"As a GL fan as well as a DCAU and DCU fan, I was extremely excited when I heard that Green Lantern was going to get his own animated movie. I made it through little more than half way when I realized that this movie isn't exactly all I was hoping it would be. After struggling though the rest of this \\"masterpiece\\", I came to the conclusion that, to me, this was a really boring movie!I could go on and on about what I didn't like about this, but I'll spare you all. One thing I did enjoy was the voice acting; Christopher Meloni as GL was especially inspiring, as was Victor Garber as Sinestro and Michael Madsen as Kilowog.Other than that, the story was underdeveloped and dull, and the characters themselves were as well. Plenty of action, but not much of anything else.\\"Green Lantern: First Flight\\". This flight needs to be grounded, permantently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting","review":"With all the hype that surrounded this film I was very dissapointed in the story line. This might be a spoiler but the biggest problem I had was the fact that the movie was named \\"First Flight\\" and yet Hal knows how to use his ring as soon as he puts it on. I did not want to see a comic book turned into a animated movie with the script being word for word from it, but some form of linear progression would have been appriciated. The characters are also surprisingly one dimensional and most of that has to do with the fact that much of their backstory is left out. Jordan's military background, Sinestro's rule over his own planet, and even Kilowog being in charge of handling new members. The animation was incredible and the action scenes do deliver, but I would honestly rent this movie before buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you liked the live action movie...","review":"You will love this! For a first time DC fan as well as a first time Green Lantern fan, I have been slowly getting wrapped up in the DC Universe. After seeing the movie I wanted more. This film acts almost as a non official sequel to the movie and kinda sorta picks up where the movie left off. If you were wondering what happened next and don't want to wait for the next feature length film to come out, be sure and pick this one up, you will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Hal Jordan!","review":"I had ordered the animated series on dvd and saw this was available as well and decided to get as well, even though I haven't seen before.

Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Green Arrow first flight with toy","review":"The movie itself is great, its one of the better story wise to the original origins of green lantern to the later half of the comics. the toy its nice to have but would of like it to be a 7-9inch toy than a 3-5inch toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie is okay, but digital copy doesn't work like other DC or WB products","review":"The movie is okay, and even has some really nice moments from a visual stand point. The plot is paper thin, but the action sequences are pretty. However, I have been taking advantage of these digital copy versions so that I can put the movies on an ipod touch for my kids. It doesn't make sense to not support the format that dominates how digital content is consumed. The ipod and itunes are by far the most used products when it comes to digital content consumption. They're trying to force those of us that use this feature to buy the movie twice, which is sleazy. It would be nice if they at least differentiated the versions that are itunes/ipod compatible and the ones that aren't."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Dimentional and simplistic","review":"I am by no means a huge Green Lantern officanato (meaning I have read only a handful of GL comics, but I do enjoy GL. I was certainly disappointed with the movie. Not for continuity issues or anything nick picky like that, but simply I felt the story was very rushed and one dimensional. Like one review said it was straight to the action, it had no character development, at all. I would imagine this would be entertaining if I was under the age of 13, but honestly the straight forward \\"Jordan has ring, One Lantern is Bad, Lets all fight, Jordan saves the day\\" Story was just too bland.Great art, and great voice acting by far. But the story was simply lacking. Certainly not worth buying (unless its for the kids)."},{"rating":"1","title":"digital copy will not work.","review":"The digital copy does not have Itunes support.

Why PG-13 kids movies?If you are The Dark Knight, more power to you. Spoiler alert- you ARE NOT The Dark Knight. The PG-13 route for something that could be kid-friendly shows you are not making good products. If you can't make something appeal to everyone (hey, ever hear of Empire Strikes Back? I hear that did pretty well) without being \\"too cool for school\\" for the sake of pretending to be edgy then follow this procedure. Stop. Start over. Repeat this process until you can make something good without false edginess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money.","review":"Buyer Beware! Rent this movie BEFORE you spend any money on it. Bad does not begin to describe the total lack of story. Micheal Bay fans, ok you might like it. 77 Minutes of film 3 minutes of story, ugh.

The animation was good and it was good to see the origins of the green lantern come to light.

Hal Jordan brought the Corps into my reading list way back when, but my favorite GL will always be Guy Gardner. Enough talk about me though.WOW! WOW!! WOW!!!The voice casting was really good. I wish we could have heard more Kilowog though. Michael Madsen didn't really get a chance to show off his vocal chops in First Flight.I'm sure the JLU cartoon fans are screaming bloody murder that John Stewart wasn't in the film, but I'm overjoyed they decided to start the GL animated franchise off with Hal Jordan instead of anyone else. If you don't count Alan Scott, then Hal Jordan was the first human chosen as Green Lantern to patrol the universe after all.After seeing First Flight at least five times already, I can barely wait for the sequel. Hopefully, we'll get Sean William Scott to voice Guy Gardner in the followup. I've rambled enough already, so I'll shut up now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids and I liked it for the price","review":"I'll start by saying I'm not a follower of the Green Lantern comics and hence didn't sit down to watch the movie with any pre-existing expectations or background (neither did my 4 and 6 year old). I thought it was entertaining, visually well done, and what I expected and wanted for the price. The kids loved it and will watch it several times. So for me it was worth it and I would recommend it to others just wanting an animated super hero flick you as an adult can sit and watch with younger kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"1st of Green Lantern","review":"Good movie about another super whos time has come. i just hope that this is not the last Green Lantern animated comic.

The PC DRM video file is not compatible with itunes, so this \\"feature\\" is completely useless to me now. WAY TO GO WB!!!! Why did you mess with this??? Even worse, if you had to monkey with this you should make this clear that this is NO LONGER COMPATIBLE WITH ITUNES!!! BAIT AND SWITCH!!!

I am glad that he does. He breaks everything in Buddhism down into terms that are very easy to understand for the Western stream-observer. In one chapter, he manages to compare a theory of dualism and the process self to a tape recorder. And it makes total sense. I recommend this book if you are interested in Buddhism, because this guy knows about all there is to know, even though he's just a grown up hippie from San Francisco who's done a lot of reading and meditation. He even took the cover photo."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Passionate love story","review":"Ok, at first the story was very interested, I was hooked on the first two chapters, then it go very tedious, the story leaves you feel cheated, the only best character is Ophelia, she is very self centered she is the bad guy. But it seems like the two main characters just ignored each other. Duncan could have been more a man and fought for Sabrina, and Sabrina is too forgiving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not typical Lindsey","review":"I was very disappointed by this latest book. I was expecting your typical exceptional Johanna Lindsey story, was was blahed out. I have been an avid reader of her books since I first found \\"The Captive\\", but I might just wait until her next one comes out in paperback before I commit any money to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The Heir\\"","review":"I have always loved Johanna Lindsey but this book was so sophomoric and juvenile I could hardly finish it. Come on old girl, lets at least give it the old college try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Lindsey","review":"Sabrina Lambert is the type of girl who men want to be friends with--not marry. Accordingly, she isn't that thrilled when the London season is upon her and with it her coming out. A beautiful, but conceited titled young lady, Ophelia, takes her under her wing for the coming season. Ophelia herself has nothing to look forward to having been engaged at an early age to the heir to a marquis. In her efforts to lose the unwanted fiance, Ophelia takes no prisoners, the kind and gentle Sabrina included. Luckily her fiance, Duncan MacTavish, has other plans. This is one of the finer Lindsey novels I've read, though I love most of them. The passion between Sabrina and Duncan is palpable with every turning page until you can't wait to see if they'll work things out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"None of the characters were really interesting enough to care about, and the villainness of the piece, Ophelia, was just so ridiculous the only tension was to sop from bursting out laughing. the 'love scenes' were sex with little else, and not even very exciting sex at that. it only made me think the hero was even more immature and callous than I had already assumed.I used to love Lindsey's work, but the last few novels have been so depressingly flat I am not going to waste any more of my money. Just because the book has her name on it does not mean it is any good-I see a recommendation here at amazon's website for heart of a warrior, and that is far worse than this book! ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time","review":"I had always heard good things about Lindsey's books but I must say this one was a complete waste. I was expecting SOME romance in this romance novel and there was none. I was totally hating Duncan about half way through, and totally tired of \\"friends\\" as well. It took every thing I had to finish the book (hoping in the end it would redeem itself.) Unfortunately that wasn't the case. So disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"maybe 1 and a half stars..","review":"it was OK, but really not worth reading. i listened to the cd while i drove (a commuter) so it was entertaining enough, but if i were reading the actual book I would have put it down after the first chapter. Sabrina is supposed to be so loveable because she's so funny - but really, she isn't, she is just average and too fakely sweet in my opinion. Couldn't believe LIndsey wrote this.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain Ol' BORING!!!!","review":"The hero doesn't lust after the heroine at all! There's not one sentence which talks about why he wants her. But all of a sudden he's in love with her? I got sick of reading about how beautiful Ophelia was (blonde, blue eyed,skinny) and how \\"not a beauty\\" the heroine was (a dowdy brunette with curves, though). The weird thing is the hero never speaks of her looks... She was supposed to be funny and witty, but, it was corny and annoying! The hero seemed more a boy than a man. I didn't dislike the characters but I didn't like them either. I was indifferent. Oh, and what's really weird is that they really were JUST FRIENDS, in my opinion.THIS BOOK IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Ms. Lindsey's best work!","review":"I am a big fan of Ms. Lindsey and I have read all of her books, but I have to say that I was disappointed with this book. It was not her usual writing and I kept wondering what had happened for her to write such a story. I felt that there was no real romance between Sabrina and Duncan; they lacked the chemistry of Ms. Lindsey's characters from her previous books. I found myself more interested in Ophelia's character and how she was developing than in the relationship between Sabrina and Duncan. I hope she will do better with her next book and I still look forward to reading her works. It would be nice to read more about Raphael, I found him to be intriguing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Heir is all HOT AIR","review":"Where's the fire? Where's the passion? Where's the romance? WHY ARE THESE TWO THE MAIN CHARACTERS?!?!?!? They are boring boring boring!!! And unlike some of Lindsey's other books, there's no spark. She should have focused on Rafe, or even Ophelia, they probably would have made a more interesting book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than I thought it would be!","review":"From the boring back cover to the lukewarm reviews, I was sure that this book would be a waste of money, but I was actually pleasantly suprised! The characters were all well developed, and the dialog was very witty. The supporting characters were especially enjoyable, and I look forward to a book with Rafe someday in the future. The description on the back cover is slightly confusing (or maybe I'm just dumb) so to clarify...Sabrina is on the marraige market, as is the girl Ophelia who Sabrina is hanging out with. Both are the same age, and Ophelia is trying to figure out a way out of the betrothal she is already in. It is not a book about Ophelia and Duncan not being able to be seperated because of the betrothal, which may come as a relief to some (and perhaps an inducment to actually buy the book?) Anyway, just wanted to say that it is much funnier and more enjoyable than it seems to be on the face of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"There is something in \\"the air\\"","review":"OK, bad pun. I liked this book to a degree, but I felt a strange distance to it--been feeling that a lot with several of my favorite authors. It's like there's a wall between me and the characters--a writer friend says it's because there's too much telling of the story and not showing it. I think I agree with that. I felt like I was just an outside observer as opposed to one of the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goodie but not Oldie","review":"I will agree that this is not classic Johanna Lindsey, but when has she ever stayed the same? Her style, characters, everything is constantly changing. That is one of the reasons she is so good. The Heir has friends falling in love, not something anyone has ever done well. I think these two work as a couple. I also liked that she concetrated more on the humor than suspense or minor characters. Johanna will always be the queen of romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a new trend?","review":"I have all of Ms. Lindsay's books ,I only read a handful of authors. I always looked foward to a new release. I felt like the past few books have lacked any kind of passion or conflict. Is it because hard covers have to be more politically correct? That is not why I read fiction. I agree with one of the other reviews about liking Ophelia's character better in the end. She had real emotion. I thought fixing her up with Rafe who hated her would have had more to offer. The kidnapping made no sense and I forgot about it until I read it in these reviews. I gave it 2 stars because I finished it. It is a readable book that has no real surprises. I feel this has happened with Jude Devereaux and Judith McNaught also. Their books have seemed to get tamer since they have come out in hardcover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly and insipid","review":"This book rated one star, it's strictly for the teen age set. Perhaps, even they would not think it was good. The plot is insipid and full of adolescent behavior on the part of supposed adults.From now on, I will not be paying good money for Lindsey's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly lacking!","review":"I have in the past really enjoyed Lindsey's books. This just like the previous book of hers is a true exception. Both have been lacking something and I even debated on whether or not to buy this one. Well....I did buy it and wish that I had just went to the local library and checked it out... The characters in this book were mundane and it was hard to find true passion between the characters that was authentic and believable. I sincerely hope her books improve. This one just doesn't seem to have the depth previous books of Lindsey's have. Sorry....wish this could be a better review...."},{"rating":"1","title":"spent money on the hardback","review":"sigh. Having enjoyed Johanna Lindsey's books for a long time, I was excited to see the Heir come out. I have noticed, like a few reviewers before me, that he latest book have lacked the flair that her earlier books have had. I am actually a bit depressed to spent the money on the hardback version, which I rarely do with books unless I know the author well. I found it to be a sweet story, but it just didn't keep my interest that well. It is all right if you are looking for a sweet story about two friends falling in love (more like it happens in real life, which is great in real life, but that isn't why I read romance novels....), this is for you. If you are looking for the sensual passion found in Ms. Lindsey's earlier works, you will, more likely than not, be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Heir","review":"I have read all of JL's books and I think this is the most boring book I've read in a long time. The characters can't stand up for themselves and are extremely gullible to let the Ophelia's of the world manipulate them. The love scene was quick and made the characters seem very juvenile. There was no build-up to understand why they were attracted to each other, was it because she makes him laugh, because she was well endowed? That's pretty shallow! This story primarily takes place over one week of eating and dancing, not a good setting or amount of time to learn about the characters. Both the scandal and the kidnapping were dumb. The overall story lacked any depth and you never bond with the two main characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Heir","review":"Hi my name is Nikki and I'm from Melbourne, Australia. Two weeks ago the \\"The Heir\\" started selling in one of the bookstores I was so excited. I quickly purchased our long awaited book and immediately start reading.After 20 pages I was so bored but kept reading on. \\"What a let down\\". Its taken nearly 2 years to get her new book here and at $24 AUS a book \\"What an expensive let down\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the Mallorys? Reggie Would Sort this Mess Out!","review":"I wanted to like this book. I really did. I love J. Lindsey's work. Regencies are my favorite. But...these characters were SO one dimensional. She makes him laugh. That is it. That is her only personality characteristic. He is Scottish & says \\"blaudy\\" every other word. That is it for him. The heavy Scottish brogue was a bit wearing. Things were getting so dull I was rooting for Ophelia to win! At least she had some spark to her. The thing that got me is that the characters, though thin, were not true to themselves. They were not the sort of people to have a quick interlude in the carriage. That totally did not make sense or fit in with the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed .","review":"I found the heroine and the hero so immature. Plus the \\"beautiful gal\\" totally obnoxious. There was no growth for the character and the other major people just sat back and just watched to see how their lives would work out. I found it VERY difficult to finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!","review":"I usually like Lindsey's works and there are some better than others but this one is the worst she's ever done. I didn't care for the characters and she seems to have the habit of having other plots combined with the main plot which is annoying because they come out of the blue and it doesn't enhance the story. A big disappointment! I hope this won't happen again or she hasn't lost her touch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Yawn","review":"Duncan MacTavish is the heir. He has been betrothed by his grandfathers to a selfish, self-centered, mean-spirited beauty who is not to his liking. Instead, Duncan is drawn to Sabrina (a plain Jane with wit and immense integrity with \\"drop-dead\\" gorgeous violet eyes.) Duncan's strength of character and wonderful Scottish brogue are a winning combination. This reviewer had a ball in the beginning, feeling the rhythm of the dialogue roll off the tongue. However, \\"tongue play\\" was not enough to maintain interest in this story. About one-fourth into The Heir, and it ceased being a \\"page-turner\\" It does not come close to the mettle of a Johanna Lindsey story. There are no sparks flying between the two amorous characters. The dialogue is mediocre with a few bonfide retorts. This reviewer expects more than this lethargic story, especially with the hard cover prices. Sad to say, but The Heir was a yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNBELIEVABLE- A DUMBING DOWN OF A BEACH BOOK","review":"THERE WAS NO STORY, NO CONFLICT. CHARACTERS WERE STEREOTYPES. THE FINAL CHAPTER WAS EASILY FORSEEN BEFORE THE ENDING OF THE SECOND CHAPTER. I HAVE TO STOP WASTING MY MONEY ON THESE BOOKS. YE GADS."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"This is just such a boring book. I didn't buy, because of what the other reviewers said. So I checked it out from my library and boy am I glad that I didn't waste any money. The book started out with promise--especially the hero Duncan seemed gorgeous and mysterious. But there was just no chemistry. Johanna, how could you do this? Remember James & Georgie? Challen & Tedra? Garrick & Brenna? For a long time now, Johanna's writing has dwindled. Stick with her older stuff. Now those were the books that you couldn't put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather disappointing","review":"This is the first of Johannas' book that I could do without. I think this would have made a much better novela, rather than a full length book. It starts out pretty good, with Duncan and Sabrina becoming friends and confidants. That was all well and good, but the on again off again engagement was a little too much. If Duncan didn't care what the Ton thought of him, he should have gotten a back bone and stood up for himself. If you need a Lindsay fix, reread any of her earlier works. Sooo much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful escape!","review":"\\"The Heir,\\" by Johanna Lindsey, is an enjoyable and lighthearted romance due to the witty interplay between the cast. Though the story line remains inside sub-genre guidelines, the enchanting characters, both main and secondary, turn the novel into a pleasurable reading experience. The rapid dueling dialogue between Duncan and Sabrina is simply enchanting while Ophelia's efforts as a matchmaker adds a delightful amusing element to the novel. What I found so enjoyable about the book was that even though it was predictable in its conclusion the journey to get there was a delightful escape in the romance reading experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"So, So....","review":"I was disappointed in this book. It was kinda boring. The story just fell flat. The front title said \\"Best Seller', so I thought it was going to be good. I was skimming over pages terribly with this book, especially at the end just to get it over with. I never do that, I usually savor each word. This book was mediocre at best. I didn't like the Highlander accent. The characters were ok. Duncan just sounded like a big Oaf with no back bone being jerked around by his Granddaddys and Ophelia etc. The storyline was ok. It didn't do anything for me. Sorry, I don't know how anyone could have LOVED this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe it...","review":"The first Johanna Lindsey book I didn't LOVE, and I can't even tell you why because I couldn't finish it. I'M SORRY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Heir did not inherit positive comments from me","review":"The Heir was probably the worst novel Lindsey has written. I'm not a 'die-hard' Lindsey fan, but I must confess that my 'favorite novel list' contain several novels written by her, and I do find her books more than tolerable. However, the Heir did not inherit neither the romance nor action usually associated with Lindsey's earlier novels.Actually, it was so 'boring' that I had to literally force myself to finish the novel.The hero and heroine were 'weak' characters and the menace, 'dear old' Ophelia was obnoxious and dizzy, oh well, as she was written to be. The hero's uncles were just plain 'stupid', the heroines two aunts reminded me of the two aunts in 'Arsenic and Old Lace', and the month long 'search for a bride' party became blase'.After reading The Heir, I decided to read a good old fashioned classical romance to appreciate the fine art of writing.Happy Reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wast of money","review":"I have read almost all of this writer's other books, and enjoy her work. This book, however, was a waste of time and money. I wouldn't recommend this book to my worst enemy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audio book review","review":"This book is wonderful on tape! The love story of Duncan and Sabrina has been summarized in several other reviews, so I will stick with the basics. The narrator / voice actor, Laural Merlington, does an awesome job with the voice inflections. She makes an average story come to life. She switches flawlessly from a haughtly British accent for Ophelia, to the sweet and honorable voice of Sabrina, to the commanding Scottish burr of Duncan MacTavish. The unabridged version that I listened to is about 10 - 12 hours long and is good for a long car trip. The love scenes take place toward the last 1/3 of the story, so make sure the kids are asleep or aren't in the car then! There have been some negative reviews of this book, but I greatly enjoyed the audio version and would recommend it to any regency romance fan. The audio version may be available at your public library."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Heir. One of The Best...","review":"I have to say \\"The Heir\\" was one of the best books I have read. It was my first Joanna Lindsey novel, and it definately has gotten me interested to read more of her books. It is a must read on my list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor story","review":"I just don't get the story. Okay first Duncan is speaking in Scottish accent. It's fine with me until i caught up what \\"tae\\" and \\"ken\\" meant. Anyway, the worst part of the story is when Duncan doesn't really care about Sabrina after what they did. Duncan doesn't even talk to her for months! He plainly doesn't love her. On the other hand, Sabrina is crying because he's getting married to someone else. I just want to be part of the story and shout at her--\\"Get a hold of yourself! He never really loved you!!\\" And the worst part is, he proposed to her and she accepted. They WERE just friends, plain and simple. Nothing more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the paperback","review":"As an avid fan of JL I have every book she's written. Unfortunately I have bought the last couple in hardback (simply couldn't wait for the paperback) and regretted it. This book lacks the fire of her earlier work, I didn't connect with any of the characters and felt that there was no depth to them. I actually started liking Ophelia the most by the end of the book. I will buy any JL books that come out, but I'll make myself wait for the paperback now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lindsey Inherits the wind","review":"I have been a great fan of Ms. Lindsey's work for many years, and have read each and every book she has written. So, when I heard she released another book I was elated, and bought it w/o benifit of storyline. I enjoyed it . She has sensuallity and romance downpact, however, for the fist time, I was neither in love with the hero or the heroine, and thats why I gave it 4 stars instesd of 5. They were likable, but They lacked the unstoppable passion of the characters in Warriors Woman, and the unriveled turbulence of Silver Angel. I liked it but it was missing something. but I have enjoyed endless hours of reading due to johanna, so I'll make allowances."},{"rating":"1","title":"MY REVIEW","review":"I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS BOOK I EXPECTED MORE FROM JOHANNA LINDSEY SINCE I PRACTICALLY OWNES MOST OF HER BOOKS.

I found it hard to believe that Johanna Lindsey herself wrote this book.( I recomend the Man of my dreams the Malory novels... anything but her newer novels)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book needs more fire!!!","review":"Johanna Lindsey's other books will pull you in to the story and make you believe that the man and woman in the story are real and alive. I never can put her books down! But, The Heir lacked that luster. The sparring and fighting and romance between the 2 main characters was nill....and these are her trademarks! These make her stories alive and keep your heart pounding for for the turn of the page. The Heir was hard to get in to and I found myself VERY surprised at that. I have never had a problem w/ getting in to the characters and the story - this book was different. I kept yearning, page by page, for the potential to come that I saw for character development but it never did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I've read quite a few Lindsey books and she is my favorite romance author but this one was one of her worst. There was no fire between the romantic leads - there was too much talk of \\"friendship.\\" The hero didn't lust after the heroine. The story was really poor. There was no witty or teasing banter between the lovers and the heroine was pretty much a doormat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some writers should just be \\"idea\\" people","review":"Johanna Lindsey has wonderful ideas for her books. Each time I've read her book's description I get excited! I wonder how the book could possibly be bad with such a wonderful premise. Oh, she finds a way. The one thing that bothers me the most about her writing, and especially in this book, is the inconsistency of the character's personalities. She will draw up a character's personality for you, and then when said character is faced with a decision they do something completely opposite to their supposed personality. I rolled my eyes through this entire book. Not only that, but her historical accuracy is TERRIBLE. I found myself shaking the book and yelling, \\"Do some research, woman!\\"She is hands down the worst author of Regency era books I have ever read. Her ideas are epic, but she should have given them to someone else to write."},{"rating":"1","title":"too long, too boring","review":"this book was a huge disappointment. i would hardly call it a romance. it simply was not interesting. unfortunately, once i start a book i have to finish it and i did have to force myself to finish this book. the plot was uninteresting as were the hero and heroine. she was described as witty and able to make people laugh but mostly she was just weird and annoying. the hero wasnt much better.i get excited when a book is long because then i know alot of twists and turns can happen in the book. not so. by chapter 8 the hero and heroine had yet to meet each other and the few interactions they had were blah. there was no chemistry, let alone passion and i could barely see them as friends let alone why they loved each other. the book was long and boring and dragged on. even when the book should have ended, it kept going for several more pages adding nothing to the plot but adding to my agony over trying to finish it. dont even bother checking it out from the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful as always!","review":"I enjoyed their tsuendere personalities.

Russia is far from a utopia and to not picture the every day tourist scenes is perfectly fine, but I guess I would have wanted more explanations. The picture quality however was very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made with Poor quality material","review":"This item had a horrible smell as you opened the package.The material was infused with a stink that wouldn't go away.I washed it. It fell apart despite the fact that it was \\"washable\\".The zipper never worked. I threw it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underated","review":"Mastermind, is an underrated movie. It has aged gracefully over the years. Mastermind is a funny movie.The humor is subtle at times. Other times it is more obvious and done very well. In beginning scenes, where the bodies of the victims are \\"frozen,\\" in the position that they were killed in, are hilarious.Zero Mostel, was a great comedic actor. He has great stage presence and it works well for his character throughout the movie. At times it's what he doesn't do, or what he gestures with body language and facial expressions, ever so subtle, that make the movie enjoyable.The cast of supporting actors are great. Overall, the movie is a winner. It should get a proper DVD release."},{"rating":"1","title":"One size does not fit all","review":"This particular back brace-support is made for men who are no larger than a medium.It does not adjust for waist size. If you're a woman, size large, it might fit.It WILL NOT fit if you wear a men's large, and if you wear an extra large shirt, it will noteven fasten. Not only that, but you can go to Home Depot and find a comparable, highquality belt with shoulder straps in multiple sizes for 1/4 of the price...$14!"},{"rating":"2","title":"adds a little class","review":"Very eegant looking without being too pricy adds a great look to a vintage Lucian Piccard watch my grandfartehr willed to me"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"I love Crosstide, I've been listening to them for about 2 years and they have become one of my all-time favorite bands.In their music you can hear that they have been influenced by some awesome bands such as the beach boys, U2,and New Order but they definitely put their own spin on it and that's what makes them stand out from so many of the new bands out there, they are definitely their own band.I was so excited when this CD came out because now I can listen to them all the time! This is definitely a record worth buying. (you should) Sleep is an amazing song, it never fails to make me happy! I cant wait to hear what Bret, Nick, Erick, Matt and Rian come out with next!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A record worthy of praise","review":"Crosstide has been flying under the radar for several years now, but this record seemingly has all the components necessary to change that. Bret Vogel's vocals are right on the money, and production has improved dramatically over the past few years.Personal favorites from the album include: \\"Anybody Else,\\" \\"(You Should) Sleep,\\" and \\"Choking.\\" The musicality of this album instantly imparts that these men love what they do and that they know they have found their stride. This is a really fine album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah! Great for a plastic!","review":"I have been playing for 8 years and I normally play on \\"high quality reeds\\" but they worked great for jazz band they are loud and don't break as easy. Be careful plastics squeaks! I would buy again, satisfied with shipment!! Thumbs upppp!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The bundle software (onDVD) is an old version","review":"The bundled software \\"onDVD\\" is an old version (v1.5), which does not include audio function in it's photo slideshow VCD burner. According to it's website product introduction, it should include audio and photo edit function.The same product I saw at retail store is light blue color, but the one I get here is black. Obviously, it's an old model, and the worse part is, the software is also old version and with very limited features."},{"rating":"2","title":"A step back in time...","review":"I recall my youth in every song! Very early 60's. The theme song always brings tears to my eyes. It seems to capture both the heartache and the hope of the movie. There are a couple of funky numbers, but the main theme is well worth the price of the cd! I have enjoyed it many times over. It's terrific!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful if this is for D-Lux 4","review":"Was shipped as a backup battery for Leica D-Lux 4. It's shape is minutely different enough so that the spring will not pop it out of the camera. Will have to help it out with flat pointy object -- this will require 3 hands. For $21, you can get lots more mAh (shooting time) and a perfect substitute for overpriced Leica ($70+). That's Amazon's BTR-CGAS005-J-006 battery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vernon Girls.........................","review":"The Vernon Girls never quiet got there. Their sound is rather bland and uninspired....the mediocre material didn't help. What's interesting is that The Breakaways came out of the Vernon Girls...with a thunderous roar! Sadly, that music in nearly impossible to find. The Breakaways had the Phil Spector Wall of Sound...like The Crystals meet the Ronettes meet the Shangri-las. Back to the Best of the Vernon Girls...white bread at it's mildest.....but, a part of the British History of early Rock Music. Forutnately...it got alot better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing for a book from these guys","review":"I bought this based on other books these guys have written, but was disappointed. I could have saved the money and simply read the whats new guide. The whats new guide does not have the examples this book has, but they are not worth the cost of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Already covered in What's New Guide","review":"I was disappointed in the depth of the material. I had already read the What's New manual and found much of that repeated here."},{"rating":"2","title":"best ever home cooked hashbrowns","review":"I've tried my entire life to replicate a good plate of diner-style hash browns, I've finally found the trick. These are essentially shelf-stable dehydrated potatoes. I followed the box directions to cover in boiling water for a few minutes, then fry them up in margarine. It worked great! No question the best hash browns I've ever made, and a great accompaniment to my marinated steak grilled over an open fire. see story and photo at http://www.baribob.net/?p=816"},{"rating":"2","title":"hash browns","review":"I love this product. No stores in my area carried it, I wouldn't have gone on-line, however....the on-line purchase was for many boxes...and I'm okay with that!! I've since found a store that carries it.YUM YUM....I've always love hash browns and here you can make them 'less greasy' than the kind you get when you eat out. Though I confess I love to add olive oil to it to make them crispier."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY TOO MUCH SEASONING","review":"I am sorry I bought a dozen. I though I could save some money over store bought hash browns. But the onion taste and smell overpowers the dish.I dumped out half of the first batch because of the strong taste and odor of onions. Then I tried rinsing thw second batch with lots of hot water, hoping to reduce the seasoning; but I could not reduce it.I wrote the company asking them to make available the hash browns without seasoning but have not as yet had a response from them.At the same time I bought a dozen of the Betty Crocker Cheddar Cheese dishes. I hoped we would eat one a week, but they use the same seasoning and too much of it. It was good the first time, okay the second and the third time the smell, which stunk up the whole house for a day, was outright objectional.I signed up for the automatic shipment every six months but cancelled. I think we will have these for a year or more and may give give some to charity, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not relaxing!","review":"I agree with the other reviewer from Maine. The speaker's voice is very annoying. She keeps saying, \\"go deeper, deeper down,\\" with an amusingly nasal sound on the \\"deeper\\" and a harsh pronunciation of d-OW-n. She also gets loud and excited - one night when I was very tired, I fell asleep listening to the tape. I awoke with a start and nearly fell off the couch as the speaker was describing a ride down a sliding board - \\"DOWN you go!\\"This tape developed no deeper bond between me and my baby than already exists, and it certainly didn't relax any of my anxieties about childbirth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Hypnotize","review":"This tape does nothing to induce a state of hypnosis. At best, the first side can be used for relaxation if you can tolerate the speaker's irritating voice, the silly imagery and the poor sound quality of the tape. The second side of the tape would be humorous if it weren't so shrill and annoying. Gayle Peterson needs a lot more hypnosis training before she uses that word in the title of her books or tapes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This tape gave me the results I wanted.","review":"Editing issues aside, I rated this a 4 because I had a short relatively painless childbirth. When I was done I actually thought, \\"I could do this again\\". As a student of hypnosis I can tell you that background fluffy soundscapes, while nice, are not required for results. Often times with hypnosis the client will think the session is \\"not working\\", but the proof is in the results. Obviously if the person's voice bothers you then you will be less inclined to relax. Contrary to popular belief, hypnosis is NOT brought on by relaxation. Also, if you are listening to another's voice it is not considered \\"self-hypnosis\\". That would be when you are giving yourself suggestions. I lost this tape over the years and am buying it AGAIN, not because I like her voice, or the quality of the recording, but because I like the results!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not relaxing at all","review":"I agree with the others who found the tape extremely annoying. It may have had good things to say, but I could not get past the woman's voice or inflections. Just when I was starting to think about relaxing, she would say something so distracting or annoying I was snapped back to the present. I never made it through either side of the tape, but instead, threw it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the...is wrong with you people??","review":"Scooby-Doo the cartoon was great and classic - This movie just takes another property and turns it into trash. Really bad story gets worse and worse. If anyone has ever seen the cartoon you have a million questions - like why does the gang hate each other? They never disbanded in hatred of each other! Were Fred and Daphne interested in each other in the cartoon? Who decided they should date? Shaggy all of the sudden has an interest in women over food and Scooby?They went about this all wrong. the only right thing was the parts of Shaggy and Scooby. They were the most true to the original. The director should have played more on the simplicity of the story lines and look of the cartoon rather than dulling it up with a convoluted plot line that is unplausable and is just plain stupid. The director goes on how he mimicked the cartoon but I did not see it anywhere. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupidest Movie I've ever seen!","review":"Too stupid for adults, and definitely not for young children. Too many dope-smoking references, and when fred and daphne switch bodies fred (who is now inside dapne's body) looks down his (her) shirt and says \\"Wow, now I can look at myself naked\\". Shaggy and scooby were the only characters who resembled the cartoon. All the others have some sort of interpersonal battle or social problem. Don't waste your time. This was just plain dumb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thats retarted","review":"Dont waste your time with this. not only is the acting poor. but they totally screw up scrappy doo's well known part in the cartoon. and its just lame. an unbelievable. they try too hard to be funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Good As It's Supposed to Be","review":"I thought that this was supposed to be like the cartoons but when I saw it, it was not as good as I thought it would be. For one thing, Freddie Prinze, Jr. is not Fred. The movie was not that scary and had little humor. While you can sense the friendship between Shaggy and Scooby Doo, their scenes got a little bit weird. As the movie got on, the mystery started to get confusing. All in all, this was not a very enjoyable film."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],W={key:0},j={key:1};function C(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=m("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",O,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",j,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",W,"See more"))],8,B)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(M,[["render",C],["__scopeId","data-v-47a87590"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/37.md","filePath":"guide/37.md"}'),N={name:"guide/37.md"},L=Object.assign(N,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{P as __pageData,L as default};
