Children become easily overwhelmed during this sensitive process but this book doesn't try to hit them over the head with any sort of message. It merely explains through humorous descriptions and drawings why animals couldn't use toilets (an elephant would smash it to pieces; a goat would eat the toilet paper)and why they are meant for big boys and girls instead. My nephew, now in pull-ups, ran to the bathroom as soon as it ended, he was so excited.

It provides some truly marvelous views of the park from the early 1960's, including Tom Sawyer's Island, Tomorrowland and the Monorail. There are a couple of views that aren't actually possible, but that's the magic of editing.The lighting is great, the scenery is wonderful and the story is delightful if a little weak. I'm giving it five stars for the 1960's slice of life aspect as well as the excellent fifteen minutes worth of Disneyland scenery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Great movie.

Suzanne Pleshette as a romantic endeavor never looked better. And Phil Silvers' portrayal as the loveable tough guy Uncle Bernie can't be topped. The \\"chase\\" scene thru vintage Disneyland is pure fun. This movie truly is a family classic!This is a great movie, director Norman Jewison's first film, and this is shameful disrespect by Universal Studios with a DVD-R release.

The ridicules \\"chase scene\\" takes place in Disneyland, highlighting many of parks attractions, even what used to be a Disneyland standard: the helicopter ride from LAX to the Disneyland Hotel. The director took some liberties with how they arrive in the park and the views don't match the vantage point. Great fun to see how many \\"errors\\" are in the film, but all designed to make it possible to cover the entire park as if they were running in a straight line.Shown in its original theater format with beautiful picture and sound.

With 425 pages (11 chapters), the book only talks about J2EE component security in 2 chapters (Chapter 9 and 10) and stops at high-level with spending pages on configuring tomcat and weblogic 7. The author comfortably skipped discussing content over complex issues and finally completely forgot about illustrating real-world security issues and measures.Although the book covers some very basic aspects of Java security, ultimately it provides a dreary drawn-out overview of j2ee security which is better found more in google and elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book needs a revision.","review":"This book is similiar to sun java security tutorial with little additions specific to weblogic 7.0 and apache axis 1.0. The code examples don't run on j2ee 1.4 platform. The book also needs a new edition with revised examples to include newer security mechanisms with j2se 1.5. Except for chapter 1 - A Security primer, all other chapters are technically obsolete.If you wish to pick a good alternative book, choose Core Security Patterns by Chris Steel et all - that is the best book I have seen for Java security."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"I had the opportunity to read this book in manuscript form and it is a good read. The examples are great. Many authors (publishers?) go for weight and size rather than content. While this book probably won't fit in your pocket, it manages to avoid that size/weight trap by providing just good content and examples.If I didn't already have this book, I'd buy it. There are good overviews of available standards, and enough information on each part of the security puzzle to educate the reader enough to implement solutions. If you're in the security area and program in Java there is no reason not to own this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing !","review":"I am not new to J2EE, but I purchased this book for understanding J2EE security based on the good reviews it has received. I was quite disappointed in this book, which is both repetitive, drawn-out and shallow in its coverage of J2EE as a whole. Although the book covers the basics but it missing the real world complexities such as Single sign-on, JAAS Authentication and Authorisation in J2EE, Integration tier security etc. The book is completely lost in Web services security as it considers only SOAP-RPC security, repeating the similar examples from Axis and Verisign. BTW, This book only covers obsolete versions of Axis, Weblogic and Verisign. As a result almost nothing is covered in great detail, and the ages ultimately provide a dreary drawn-out overview of J2EE security which I find better elsewhere. Now the book stays on the shelf collecting dust, while I google around the Internet for answers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"Be careful when you buy this book. The book has no concrete focus on J2EE or J2SE of any sort and it is pretty much INCOMPLETE. Unless you already have pretty good knowledge about Security concepts, you won't be able to understand them. The content is messy and it confuses the reader. The worst part is 75% of the book is not specific to J2EE or J2EE components. The authors tries out HELLO WORLD kind of examples using a Microsoft environment.

Bought the unit, had it less than a month, had it replaced and still no joy. The basic problem is that while the sound quality on hearing your caller was always superb, the volume with which the other party can hear you worked fine then diminished to a whisper--and no amount of fiddling with the microphone position or warranty repair could correct the problem. Additionally, the ergonomics of the unit (considering that the mic has to be practically IN your mouth to work when it worked at all) are very wonky. In the first few weeks while the unit was working properly, I still ended up wrapping the cord up and over my other ear (as I used to do with my freebie earbud hands free) to stabilize it.

There is VERY QUIET background music to the speaking on these tapes, but the text is basically exactly what is in the book. These tapes are meant to be a companion to the book and you need the book to really use them properly, as they clearly state at the beginning of the tape series.You do get to hear the channeled voices of Orin and DaBen which may be interesting to some. I guess I was expecting louder relaxing music in the background to set the mood better than I could myself, and I ordered these tapes to give me a little more confidence during my first channeling sessions. All in all, I think I could have done just as well without them, just using the text in the book for script and making my own tapes.My own experiences so far have been positive.

This book covers it all. This is a man who has lived a daring, dangerous and fascinating life that most people can only imagine. But at the same time many people will relate in some way or another to every frustration, realization, joy and sorrow.

And it seems that this is the base most of the amazon reviewers are coming from. I being neither simply wanted a book that lived up to it's salacious title. And on those terms this isn't a book, it's a pamphlet. Thank God, I didn't shell out of this sucker. And to save other readers the expense, I have a suggestion. Go to one of those mega-booksellers where you can sit and read. Open to the chapter entitled \\"Making Porn\\", pages 219-237. 20 minutes max. Now go take the money you saved and buy something worth while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Who Was He In Porn?","review":"I think the Advocate had every right to discriminate against this book. Clearly this guy was trying to sell this book based upon his so called \\"porn career\\". However, he obviously didn't make an impression in that arena because there is no mention of who he was in porn in any of these reviews. So I'm guessing he made 3rd rate films for a no-name porn company. You would think since he is hawking the book by way of his prior porn-status, he would have been \\"named\\". Pass this book up guys, who really wants to read another sob story of a loser? He gives all gays a bad name. Not all gays do drugs and are alcoholics. Just the low-life ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"out-dated and boring","review":"This book absolutely made our whole class hate psychoanalysis. It was so boring and antiquated.

I hope Amazon will be able to offer the original for sale soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No shame","review":"The original 1962 Billy Budd, directed by, and starred in by Peter Ustinov, is a classic. One of my favorite movies of all time. I remember seeing it while serving in the US Navy. The story is very compelling and heart-wrenching. I've been telling my wife all about the movie and set out to search for it, but the only Billy Budd movie I could find is this one. I was very dissappointed because an opera, to me, is foolish and annoying. I hope Amazon can offer the \\"real\\" movie soon.

It seems like this book was going to have a lot of information but it does not. The print is very large and there are many large empty spaces on many pages. The content is completely out-of-date. This book was first published in 1985 and most of the content is from 1985. The photos in the book are blown up jpegs stolen from web sites (hence the different photo credits on EVERY image). It still refers to servers as \\"mainframes\\". This book basically tells you about the different kinds of bar codes and how they are read. And THAT IS IT. There is NOTHING about software or modern hardware. There is nothing on creating a database. There is nothing about wireless technologies.

When my local co-op stopped carrying it, I special-ordered it for a while, then decided to buy it here. This product has the same name as what I've used, but a different appearance (new label, white cap instead of brown), and a completely different scent.

Therefore, you should ignore all of the pre-2012 reviews.I used the original version for 20 years and loved it.This new version is terrible with a pungent fragrance that is simply horrible.Queen Helene/Amazon need to get their act(s) together and stop running a misleading photo showing the original product.I wasted my money on a six-pack.

Even though it's advertized using the same picture, the actual package is different, it has a much longer list of ingredients which are different from the \\"old\\" formula (I compared it to the \\"old\\" deoderant), and a much stronger smell.

This book passes over every chapter at the speed of light, leaving many issues unexplained.To all of this, it must be added the fact that the book costs as much as other really wonderfull and longer books.It's been frustrating that feeling I had while reading, as I have wasted my money and I'll have to buy another.

He has severe dementia so an ordinary book wont do. These have to be the stupidest, incomplete stories I have ever read in my life. You are reading the one or two page story and it just ends. You are sitting there thinking \\"what the heck happened to the rest of the story\\". Some of the 'stories' are not stories at all but just a mass of words that make no sense what so ever. I cannot believe anyone would have the nerve to actually put their name on this book. And I am sure it had to be self published as no reputable publisher would touch this with a ten foot pole. Do I recommend this book? Hardly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this","review":"These stories are boring. There is no point to any of them. It's as if these writers are competing for last place in a literary contest. These are all just snapshots of boring events, like someone wakes up in the morning, goes down stairs and brews some coffee. There is no plot, or ending.

I don't know that I would buy a whole series of these though."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Whole Series is Made with Love","review":"There's a reason why this humble video was expanded into a series of six, plus. It's not just great for kids, but fascinating for adults too. You may not be a model train enthusiast now, but watch these videos and you just may find yourself a new convert. I never dreamed there were so many beautiful and diverse kinds of toy trains. To see the pristine-condition shiny silver tin \\"Mayflower,\\" and others from the 1920s are a rare treat.

One is they show toy missiles destroying train cars. The second is they stage a head-on crash between two trains. What's funny about that? Not only is it unnecessarily destructive, but then is presented as ENTERTAINMENT. Just great. My son first saw this video when he was two and burst into tears when the trains crashed (my fault - I should have previewed the tape first but what with the glowing reviews on the box I thought it harmless). I happen to have it out of the library now (hoped it was NOT the one I had seen before but was wrong) and am still totally unimpressed.I can't speak for the other \\"I Love Toy Trains\\" videos by this same producer, but this one I can happily live without.The only reasons I gave it one star is for the songs (except Old MacDonald, which is overdone) and the explanation of a saw mill."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Masterpiece of Absolute Dullness","review":"Let me guess...this video was shot in some guy's farm basement in about three weeks, right?You have a bunch of film of a toy train collection, with sound overlays of real train sounds, children singing \\"Old MacDonald\\" at least 5 times, farm animals that talk and tell jokes right out of the world's worst dime-store joke book--what this has to do with trains is anybody's guess--a few actual shots of real trains (maybe a minute, 30 seconds altogether), a toy train collection that appears again, and again ad nauseam, phd graduate actors from the university of bad acting, etc., etc., etc.I've seen dental hygene movies that were more entertaining!

From designing the park to designing your own rides, there's just a great progression in this game where each level your able to do more and more.

Each of these pictures look as if they have not been retouched, and they were masterfully shot.On the other hand, there is very little variation in the technique or the type of location. Basically, you could see five or ten of the shots in the book, and you have a very good idea of all the content in it.By the way, I saw this book was tagged as erotica, and if there's something this book is not, it is erotica. More than three fourths of the pictures include someone naked, but the nudes are rather innocent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Been Looking for this soundtrack for years!!!","review":"I remember playing the game and how much the soundtrack added to the gameplay experience.

But it IS a live show after all. You know there's just dub no overdub (bad pun, I know). The performance is energetic, Robbie in particular had a fine night, and soulful and these songs just groove so hard I am compelled to rate it much higher."},{"rating":"2","title":"RARE DUB DVD!","review":"This is one of the very few dub DVD's available and it's a good one. It's not as refined as the original Black Uhuru from 20 years ago but it is a tasty dub/reggae excursion. With strong backing from Sly & Robbie this has solid drumming and bass. If you'd like an interesting, alternative, refreshing new dub/reggae version of the classic Dark Side Of The Moon then this DVD is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really like this dvd....","review":"Ok, so they're not doing backflips and handstands onstage; the sound quality of this dvd is solid (I have no idea what kind of system that other reviewer is using to hear this stuff), and some of Black Uhuru's best songs are on the dvd. I would highly recommend buying this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a really poor example of Black Uhuru.","review":"On this DVD, the band sounds unrehearsed, and they lack the original hypnotic groove (They sound sloppy), that made the songs good in the first place.

It worked fine for a while, but recently it stopped working. It will only stay on for a few seconds, and then it shuts itself off. I contacted Kodak, but they told me it would cost $136 to repair the frame. I would much prefer to buy a new frame that will last than to sink money into this one. Searching around online, this appears to be a common problem with Kodak frames. I will not be purchasing another Kodak frame in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short Life","review":"I have had this unit for a little of a year.Now all I get is a short red flash on the screen when the power is turned on.My network still sees the WIFI and the PC can access the internal memory through the the USBI suspect the LCD display has failed.Kodak wants $145 for out-of-warranty service.

The backlighting gives out after a few months of use. The one which still works hardly ever gets turned on (thus why it still works I guess). I replaced one with a D-Link DSM-210 Internet Photo FrameD-Link DSM-210 Internet Photo Frame. Only time will tell if it holds up to daily use, but I am already much more impressed with the features. It looks similar to the Kodak, but with many more features."},{"rating":"2","title":"EX-1011","review":"Kodak support never responded to my questions.There should be a sort order capability - it was difficult to get the files to play in certain order.Movie files appear darker. I spent the most time trying to get the movie to play without any choppiness.

It doesn't. There are no driver to make the wi-fi work as it is tied to Microsoft Media Player and you can not use an IPOd as again it must be MP3 on the Windows Media Player. Kodak support was useless and they said sorry but had no downloads or help get this to work.The screen is nice but the software needs work.Also the packaging from the seller \\" Ace\\" was really poor, no offical Kodak box, parts just but on box, along with manuals.Maybe these are gray market goods?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good frame -- as long as you're not counting on Wireless","review":"I purchased in January and found that the frame presented sharp, color-rich photographs. I found the instructions for connecting to my PC incomplete and inaccurate. I phoned Kodak's technical support and found their support staff to be completely ineffective in providing assistance. Additionally, the support staff became rude. They insisted that I had not configured my wireless router correctly -- I explained that the router must be configured correctly as I could connect my shared, on-line Kodak Gallery. For this reason, even though the frame presented sharp, color rich photographs, I cannot recommend this frame to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this if you use a Mac","review":"Yes, that's right. Don't buy this if you use a Mac. I am not computer illiterate, but suffered several hours of frustration with this unit. Even the manual (what there is of one) gives the wrong web address for Kodak's help section for digital frames. And the updates are img file format rather than dmg. Thanks for nothing, except the hole in my budget. That's all I have to say about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Video!!!","review":"Does not play any type of video, the ads & description lie!! Spend hours upgrading firmware, trying different codecs but the video just won't work. Try to get support! Kodak should be ashamed of themselves!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did NOT love it! Would not recommend.","review":"At first glance, the frame is nice looking and rather simple to use. You can play videos and display photos that you download from your camera. However, it randomly turns itself off. And after a few months of use, it has completely broken. Only random (1 of every 20 photos) will play. Otherwise the screen shows black."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good pick!","review":"Just a disappointment for ease of use, especially considering it was going to an 85 year old person.It cannot be managed without a remote that is too small for anyone with vision or dexterity issues, and the commands are not intuitive.Design and features geared more for the \\"thumbs\\" centered culture and not for the aging.Paid too much for a used product. Makes me rethink the value of shopping with Amazon as if they are a screen for best prices and products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible product, worse support","review":"The EX1011 acceptance of JPEGs are random so you'll spend lots of time discarding JPEGs that won't show and you won't be able to show all the pictures you want.

Look for another manufacturer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this product","review":"I have had this frame for 13 months. It broke. I went to get it fixed from kodak and they told me that it is out of warranty and it would cost $150 to fix.

After trying two different frames (bought one, shipped it back because it didn't work, they sent a replacement), I have come to the conclusion that this is just an extremely poorly designed product. The wireless feature works maybe 5% of the time (which is great when it works) and the frame is soooooo slow to respond. It takes up to a minute for it to respond after pressing a button. I really wanted to keep this frame - I have like 200 albums on Kodak Gallery that I wanted to access through the frame; but after two totally defective worthless frames, I gave up. Do not buy this frame!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Picture Frame","review":"Excellent product. It connected to my wireless network, and I was able to download photos to it without a hitch. I plan on getting a couple more as presents for my relatives."},{"rating":"1","title":"WiFi functionality does not work as advertised","review":"It's a normal picture frame just like many other on the market, but I bought this one because of it's wireless capability. The claim is that it can be synch up with a home desktop via wifi so that it does not store any images locally but rather gets the from the desktop. THIS DOES NOT PRACTICALLY WORK! The bug is that you can make the two connect and start the slide show. However, whenever there is any minor network or a computer slowdown, that happen a couple of times a day never mind power outages, the slide show stops. The only resolution is restarting the show manually. There is no automatic restarting of the show. Unless you want to be restarting the show several times a day wait till this product matures."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID -- Kodak online policies changed","review":"I purchased the EX-1011 as a great way to share photos with my family and friends. I bought two frames for my parents and my wife's parents. After spending $600 (they were more expensive in Dec08) Kodak is now changing their online policy -- now they require a regular photo printing purchase or they will delete the photos in your gallery.Kodak, are you kidding me? I spend $600 and then you try to nickle and dime me out of more money with a blanket policy.If you're buying this for online sharing (and why else would you pay this much for a frame) then I'd look elsewhere. Who knows what the next policy change will bring."},{"rating":"1","title":"WiFi is subpar","review":"I like the picture frame but the WiFi doesn't work well. It works but not like they lead you to believe if you want to run pics directly from your computer. In that mode the scheduler doesn't work, the sorting or random play doesn't work(you will always see the oldest pictures first and follow in chronilogical order) and and frame will lock up often if it doesn't like a pic. Overall very poor firmware. Support said they are releasing an update soon, but who wants to wait and who knows if it will be better. So I returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy photo frame","review":"I bought the kodak EX-1011 digital picture frame for its size and the wireless capability.

I guess it respond the tv or stereo remote control .You could copy picture to your frame only by sharing them through microsoft media player... And even that is painfully arcane.The frame crashed and rebooted twice when I select many pictures at the same time.There is no way to push the picture from your PC to the frame directly.

The product is not mature and support ... none","review":"I bought an 8-inch model a month ago and like the photo slide show. But it does not play AVI video as it claims. After I found out that was last year model, I returned it and ordered the EX-1011 from Amerson. EX-1011 has a bigger screen, and that's all the good news. The features that I like in the old model (dissolve in/out slide transition and random slide play) are not in this new model. The slide shows photos in the same order every time. It gets boring after a few showing.It still does not play AVI video. I emailed Kodak technical support. They suggest I try with a new memory card, try with a different camera, try ... I finally attached the video file with my reponse back and never heard from Kodak's technical support again.I didn't bother to try the wireless function after I read the negative comments. It is a pity, EX-1011 has a nice screen. I will wait until Kodak fixes the bugs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great frame but the wireless capability is VERY week.","review":"Great frame. Great picture. The wifi set up never worked and contacting Kodak for help or information is useless. I emailed them a very specific tech question on set up and on how long can I keep the frame runnig, and they sent me a link from the Kodak page that doesn't answer the questions. They say that they will contact you in 24-48 hours, but both times it took over 5 days. To use the wifi they suggest being in the same room with your wifi.

Forty years later, it just sounds bitter and ineffectual. I bought this book for research for my own forthcoming \\"A Returned Catholic Looks at His Church\\", but it is utterly unusable. Instead of serious discussion of Jesus's (or St. Thomas's or St. Augustine's)written and oral statements about clerical celibacy, divorce, abortion, war, capital punishment, our responsibilities to the poor, sick or weak among us and a myriad of other important issues, Father Kavanaugh resorts to lame caricatures of Catholics who find no solace in the Church but find great warmth and understanding in Kavanaugh.

The charecters names are similar. Thepremise of the story is too, however Max Lucado does a good job finding an authentic meaning to his story with much deeper implications. As he usually does, Lucado takes you through a true narrators vision of Gods love towards his children, young and old. And the story is meaningful to both young and old as well. It holds timeless meaning for your child, should you teach them this story and what it means, but it is also a book to keep for years to come on the coffee table for visitors to see and, hopefully, read. And just maybe, touch their heart in a life illuminating way. The truth of Gods love for us usually does.

This book is so good that even if the child damages it after 1 reading you will have gotten your money's worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is not just for children!","review":"I've read Max Lucado's book a number of times but it wasn't until just recently that I was able to fully comprehend it's powerful message. Too many times I forget that my identity doesn't lie in who I am or what I do or even what I've done. My identity lies in the fact that I am a beloved child of God. What He thinks of me should be all that matters. Instead of letting others decide whether I receive stars or dots, I should be visiting with my Maker daily and living as His beloved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book..makes my cry!","review":"I love this book..it's such a wonderful story..and I love to hear my 3 year old say, Mommy, read You are Special! I don't know that he really understands the story, but he loves it and I love to read it. It's such a wonderful feel good story that teaches about God and Love . What a warm fuzzy to read before prayers and night night time. I'M soooooooooooooooooo GLAD we bought this book. GET IT! You won't be sorry. We're going to buy it for all our cousins as gifts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Profound Theological Text","review":"I think often times it is easy to get caught up in the complexities of life, and to forget the simple truths that are so important. Children's literature is focuses on teaching kids lessons they will need for healthy growth and success as they grow older, yet we forget that as adults we still need such lessons in our lives. You Are Special by Max Lucado, as my friend said to me once in reference to this book, is a \\"profound theological text\\" because it captures the essence of what it means to be God's children, loved and adored by their creator, and that the fickle appraisals of self-worth that others might place upon us only pale in comparison to God's affirming love for us. It is good to remind ourselves of this as adults, yet I truly believe that there is something about this lesson being written to children that makes it all the more insightful and meaningful to me, even as an adult. This is a priceless message for children and adults, and is very very well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!","review":"This is a wonderful book for helping kids to realize how special and perfectly created they are in the eyes of God! I'm buying one now to read to my children -- when I have them! I would definitely recommend this book for all kids!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the paperback version, not the hardcover","review":"My best friend has this book for her children and I loved it. I wanted to buy two copies, one for my children, the other for my son's preschool teacher. When they arrived I was MORE than disappointed. In this smaller format, it loses ALL of its charm as a children's book. 48 pages?!?!?! It's wordy enough and can be difficult to keep a small child's interest, but in the format of a young reader's book, it's near impossible. Could not be more disappointed to wait for this book to arrive and receive this nonsense in its stead. It should be mentioned further up in its description that it is small and not a charming picture book like its paperback counterpart. When you purchase a hardcover book, you expect it to be as good, if not better, than it is in paperback and more durable, you do not expect it to have most of its illustrations taken away and have it be 48 pages of young reader material."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Children of All Ages!","review":"This is truly a book that should be in the library of every family home. The manner in which the message is brought forth will touch everyone who reads it. I initially heard the story read as the Children's Message at a Church service on a Naval Base and was deeply moved. This book will become the \\"gift of choice\\" for our friends with children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uplifting! Encouraging! Wonderful!","review":"My 23-month old son LOVES this book! \\"Special Book\\", he'll request at bed-time.

We are ALL special."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Splendid Blending of Text and Illustration","review":"The text of this book reads so smooth, and the illustrations are aesthetically pleasing as well as sophisticated. Perhaps what is best though about this childrens book is that nowhere is the \\"G\\" word to be found (read: God), and so it is possible to take this book into the public schools and read it to school children (I'd only recommend it to grades K thru 2nd) where they can learn of God's love for them. This book is one of those rare books where the text is great, the illustrations are beautiful to look at and the message is inspirational."},{"rating":"2","title":"arrived quickly","review":"I have a new copy of this book and love the story. I wanted to give it to a child so i bought a used copy off Amazon.

At a great price.. yes i would order again from this seller..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy-handed","review":"I love children's books and when I saw the illustrations in this one, I was excited about it. And then I read it. I found it to be one of those books that was written with the moral in mind and the story awkwardly crafted around that. Such heavy-handed treatment! I see that I'm in the minority here, but after reading it a few times, my opinion is only confirmed. Children love stories. Period. Not stories told for the sole purpose of delivering a moralistic message. Nothing wrong with the message in this book, but my goodness! Nothing light in the delivery, nothing original in the story-telling. Every word thuds. Children--and adults--are much smarter than this author believes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sort of OK..","review":"The basic idea is that what matters is not what anyone elsethinks about you, but what God thinks about you.Nothing wrong with that.However, what is missing, is the idea thatLove is not the same thing as Tolerance, andyou shouldn't call good what is bad, or bad what is good.I would not want a child to think that God loves them,therefore it doesn't matter what s/he does.Other books by this author I read were, Best of All, andYou are Mine, and I was very unhappy with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy-handed","review":"I'm obviously in the minority here, but I think children are smart enough to know when they're being preached to. I received this book for my daughter's baptism, read it once, and put it back on the shelf. As another reviewer said, it's like the author picked out a moral/message and then wrapped a flimsy story around it. It also sounded like a Christian knock-off of Dr. Suess. There are great stories out there that also have a message, but they're well-written enough to disguise the preachiness. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"You are dreadful!","review":"This book is a cheap rip-off of The Sneeches and The Warm Fuzzies and Cold Pricklies. It is corny and contrived. If I lived in this land, and this book came up to me, I would put a dot on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't belong in a public school","review":"I was pretty surprised when my daughter brought this book home as homework. It's a thinly-veiled attempt to push the creationist agenda and shouldn't be anywhere near a public school."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a picture book - Where are the pictures?","review":"This is a kid's picture book but no pictures downloaded to my Kindle. I only got the words.I got a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Size was small","review":"I have one of these stories and love it. I wanted a storyboard book that I could use in teaching a class of preschoolers. I was surprised when it came and it is a tiny little storyboard book. I probably didn't read the description well enough. Oh well, still love the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful children's book!","review":"I absolutely adored this book the first time I heard about it. When I received it and got to read it to my nephews, it made me fall in love with it even more. The message in the book, that you should not care what others think of you, as long as your \\"maker\\" loves you, that is all that matters is powerful. Especially towards the end. The illustrations are fantastic also!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY THIS BOOK!","review":"I have given this book to almost everyone I know over the last 5 years. Everyone, of all ages, loves it! Almost everyone cries and hugs. It reaches into your heart and gives love on so many levels. Max Lucado explains God's love for all of us in such simple yet profound words. I gave this to a psychiatrist friend who says he reads it to all his patients. We all need to know God's love. BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful message, wonderful book","review":"This is a timeless story that teaches a wonderful lesson.The book was shipped in wonderful condition without defect."},{"rating":"2","title":"An all-time favorite!","review":"I first encountered this book when one of my students brought it to school.

It is a great book for teachers to read to their classes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We All Need This Book","review":"I can't tell you how important it is to have a relationship with God. He loves us unconditionally. If parents would just take the time to teach children that God is so essential to their every day....What a better world we could live in."},{"rating":"2","title":"What A Warm and Wonderful Story!","review":"I read this book last night (at the prompting of a friend who had bought it for her daughter last year) and I was very touched! What a wonderful way to tell children and adults that each and everyone of them is very special - no matter what others say about them - because in God's eyes everyone is perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book for all ages","review":"This book tells the most wonderful story of all ... that God loves us all, no matter what anyone elses' views of us may be because He is our Creator and created each and every one of us in His sight. This book is taylored towards young children, but it is wonderful for children of all ages ... from 2-102.Max Lucado does an excpetional job of telling the story in a way that young children can relate, but even us adults can get something out of the story. A must have for your children's or your own library!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"Max Lucado does it again! His books and movies are all outstanding. You are special reveals just how special we are in God's eyes. It's okay to be different. You were made to be yourself. We are all unique and special in our own way. My children love it. It has great animation and a storyline easily understood by toddlers and adults alike. I have watched dozens of times myself. It's great to watch anytime. I need to buy another copy before ours wears out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful book!","review":"This is one awful, awful book. I hated it. It was NOT funny, as I think he intended it to be, and it had no content value at all. He is basically trying to sell his diary. To be honest, I didn't finish it. It didn't help me at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I'm an incoming freshman to UGA, Go Dawgs!!!!, and I absolutley loved this book. It was funny and easy to read. Lots of helpful hints for the nervous freshman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"I'm glad I bought one before they ran out of them. I've used mine for a couple of months, and I love it. It fit in my cooler perfectly, there are no leaks, it is easy to refill, and the water tastes good. It has already paid for itself in savings versus water bottle delivery."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD SELLER","review":"The seller claims, \\"Each Filter cleans 320 gallons of water, lasts through approx. 1 year of regular family use\\"; however, the filters last 1-2 months and filter 151 Liters. I wouldn't have bought this if I knew it lasted 1-2 months AND the replacement filters aren't manufactured anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great water","review":"Bought it to replace a water filter that left a slight taste of chlorine. Though the product design is cumbersome, the water tastes a lot better, not a hint of chlorine. I feel better knowing that it also takes out MTBE, lead, mercury and a bunch of other contaminants. If only it would take out fluoride! Contacted PUR and was told that they are working on the filter problem (compatible filters are no longer produced.) We'll see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product and filters ARE available.","review":"This is a great product. Fits on my cooler but it does wobble a little when there is no water in it. The weight from the water keeps it stable. Contrary to a previous post the new CRF950Z filters do fit in this cooler. I was worried about this and went to Walmart and bought one of the new filters and its fits perfectly. Only thing the new filters do not have is an indicator telling you when to change the filter. We had a Brita cooler before and for some reason they stopped making it so we replaced it with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This","review":"This product is great, but unfortunately it has been discontinued by Pur since last year. You are going to have a hell of a time finding replacement filters. Even Proctor and Gamble does not make them anymore. They have some in stock that they ship out as a courtesy if customers complain enough about it. But good luck finding replacement filters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Knock Off stay away!","review":"I just received this Apple knockoff from SF Planet.

You do not need the Ipod dock to use this connector as it may seem from reading about it. The connector clicks into the bottom of the Ipod. You can plug the firewire side into the AC charger so that the battery is not used while transferring files and the USB 2.0 side can be plugged into your computer at the same time. If you have any money left to burn after the cash you dished out for the Ipod, get one of these handy connectors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Straightforward to Use, but Great Anyway","review":"Basically, most people don't have a Mac computer, so most people only have USB connectors on their computers. So go to TARGET and get this Dock Connector for $14.95. It works great for USB ports, and the great Apple interface makes updates a breeze. Overall, great product for computers other than Macs."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can also............","review":"Another thing this cable is good for, is if you have word documents on your iPod. You can connect it to more computors using the USB 2.0. Not all PC's have a firewire port. So if you want to have a more universal iPod, this is a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Afficvtionados only","review":"This is prime Joan Sutherland, and she is at the top of her form. This said, please remember that this is \\"bel canto\\" and do not expect a gripping plot or even anything remotely like real events in history. This is Bellini providing good voices a chance to really exhibit what they can do. The plot is downright silly. If you are not a real fan of great singing order something by Puccini. The sets and staging given this by Operal Australia is all it deserves. Just watch the singers, listen and marvel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Look Back at 1960's Technology","review":"A terrific book about the 1960's NASA technology used to build and fly the Lunar Module to the moon.

I have many space books but still learned new things from this book. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Photographic History of the Lunar Module","review":"This is a must have for the serious space flight history buff. Although light on text, this photographic history is rich in information about the development and preparation of the Lunar Modules produced by Grumman at Bethpage, New York. As a space flight historian, I was surprised that included in this small book were a number of photographs that I had never seen before. For something of this size it packs a great deal of space flight history into a small book.

I bought the product in the believe that an upgrade can't mean a step back in the development... which was an error... it really DONT support .raw ... I asked the helpdesk if they plan to support the .raw file in future... their answer was NO, they decided against raw format.Nevertheless the picture viewer and the video things work fine, just for those who want to store .raw files as in the past, forget it...Thanks Archos, so you make it easy for photographer to change the backup system to other companies like Creative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Archos 504 : buyers beware !","review":"I have had Archos 504 for one week .

The company rep, who was very nice on the phone stated that this would not be a problem, and I should mail the unit in for repair. After archos received it, I was e-mailed by the same rep who I spoke to on the phone, and informed me that this repair was not under warrenty and they would need $200.00.

I have never dealt with more incompetent and un-professional people ever in my life. I had the 504. Everytime you touch this product it sends a shock through body of the unit causing it to reset, shock it enough times by merely touching it, and then you have to try to get the product fixed. Archos will tell you that they'll fix it, which then you waste more money shipping it to them, just to have them turn around and try to charge you more money. Sorry, but I already spent enough money on a media player that worked for three months, why would I want to pay another $250 for another 2-3 months of glitchy frustration? Long story short, avoid this company, there are many other manufacturers of media players."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best PVP ever","review":"I bought my Archos 504 after I returned my creative zen vision w because lack of AC3 audio support. I definitely got the better product in the archos 504. It comes with 80 gb memory instead of the 60 gb for the zen. Archos is actually a little cheaper than the zen. Comes with more accessories and can record tv programs. The screen is about the same size as the zen, but can display 16 million colors rather than 200k for the zen. It supports more video formats than the zen. I bought the Zen believing it could play more formats, but it turned out to be the otherway around.

Well the MPEG-4 plugin is a additional cost item, as is the AC power supply. These are items that come free with almost any other player. I called Archos about this and they replied \\" we did not say you wouldn't need an optional for cost plug-in\\".

The book answers common questions about diet and health. It reviews issues as simple as the water you drink and the air you breath in the context of positive health. The significance of regular exercise, relaxation, rest and sleep is emphasized. Not only that, the author reviews specific ideas on how to prevent specific killers like heart attack, stroke and cancer etc. Finally, Dr. Weil talks about basic natural treatments including the use of vitamins, minerals and herbal supplements. This is a keeper!Anil Minocha MDAuthor: Natural Stomach Care"},{"rating":"2","title":"A review on natural health&medicine","review":"This is an excellent book by Andrew Weil. I came across Andrew Weil by reading an interview with him in the Time magazine. He came across as highly knowledgeable about his field and fairly pragmatic so I decided to buy his book which I found delightful. Among the gurus of diet and health, Andrew Weil stands up as highly knowledgeable yet not too dogmatic in his approach, which is based on facts and common-sense. To those like myself who are amateours in this field, he put forward a detailed description of the basic principles of healthy living and eating and information about how natural remedies and medicine can improve your lifestyle. His book was so readable and applicable that many of his advices rang a bell immediately I chose some of his suggestions enthusiastically and I enjoy it ever since. So, if you are up to a healthy change this is a book for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the read","review":"I received this book for Christmas one year along with a few others and this one was a dissapointment. First of all, if you're already a pretty healthy person with some knowledge of how to eat right and take care of yourself then much of the information won't be new to you. I found myself skipping ahead a lot for that reason. He also has a very narrow minded viewpoint and like another reviewer mentioned, he's not really much better than your typical allopathic doctor. It seems he's just cashing in on the trend of people interested in a more natural life style.I could find a lot of faults with this book but what I particularly didn't like was his dismissal of a lot of diseases as \\"faddish\\", and his complete dismissal of coconut oil which is actually very good for you. A much better book in the same vein is the \\"Encyclopedia of Natural Medicine\\" which I received at the same time and would highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right On","review":"Dr. Weil is right up there with Rayna Gangi on attempting to educate the public on taking charge of their health. I actually think the two books, Gangi's and Weil's should be purchased as one because as two it is a powerful set of instruction, experience and wisdom to help anyone who's interested in at least trying to take charge of their own health. Weil is less holistic than Gangi, as evidenced in the chapters on specific \\"remedies\\" for specific conditions, and Gangi is more spiritual in several chapters than Weil is. All in all, a great book for beginners or those advanced in understanding alternative health."},{"rating":"2","title":"love Weil","review":"good information and easy reading, i think everyone is trying to look for more natural solutions to living and this is a great place to start"},{"rating":"2","title":"coffee table or reference","review":"I enjoy this addtion to my fashion library mostly for its large full color plates. The text, broadly and briefly summarizes history in general for each period, as well as the fashion specific to it. It includes pictures of ancient frescoes and busts to help illustrate fashions of earlier periods. There are some examples of actual artifacts pictured. Most of the artifacts are jewelry, hair accesories, combs, the odd shift or bit of lace. The bulk of the book uses portrait art and fashion plates to represent the periods. The only photographs are twentieth century. There are not any photos of surviving garments.I would recomend this book to someone who has a general interest in fashion and history. I use it because I do costuming for many different time periods and it's a good \\"inspiration book\\", that I can thumb through before I commit to an exact design.

There are a few references to technical data on equipment that far exceed the explanation of the Vietnam war.

They were firm/stiff, but not hard to pull out at all. I'd say it was perfect.

Let's face it, it's kind of hard to have character development with virtually expressionless marionettes that don't smile, frown, or walk. On 'Thunderbirds Are Go', the 60s style dialogue with the limited capabilities on the marionettes was easy to endure because there was plenty of action, explosions, and other SFX. Not the case on Thunderbird 6; what we get here is a long, around the world flight of Skyship 1 and a dull script.

The first CD, \\"Happy People\\" seems like one big song at times. This CD is strictly for the steppers as every song on here is a stepping song. The best song on the album in my opinion is \\"Ladies Night.\\" If you are a young R. Kelly fan and have parents who grew up in the 70's and 80's your parents might like this album because R. Kelly really has the old school R&B sound going on with this album. The second CD, U Saved Me is like a gospel CD. The song with Kim Burrell and Kelly Price is like a phone call, and the song \\"U Saved Me,\\" is very inspiring. But if you like hearing R. Kelly talk freaky or if you like the R Kelly that has a hip hop edge this CD isn't for you, wait for his next CD with Jay Z. However, for what it is, a stepping CD and a gospel CD it's very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new sound","review":"Kelly is a genius. He's gone as far as creating his own new sound that I cannot compare with anyone's. 'Steppin' is creeping into the clubs now, and it's sure to be copied. 'Happy People' is currently my favourite in a 1000+ strong cd album collection. This is the kind of sound to lift your spirits at any time. 'U saved me' will however douse them again! It's well written and composed, but don't expect the same as the other disc in the box. All the songs are about God and Jesus. I am a god fan, but you won't appreciate it unless you're after divine inspiration. The song 'U saved me' is enough though to inspire everyone.

It's good to see the different side of him.

Happy people is especially a good Cd if you are a Stepper. Happy people will make you feel like dancing and it will lighten your mood. I really give this Cd four and a half stars. This is not the type of Cd that we are used to hearing from R. Kelly. This is in a sense a CD for the more adult crowd because there are no rap songs with bangin' beats. It's more of a layed-back, chill-out and socialize CD.His, I believe, second attempt at a gospel Cd didn't turn out too badly.

I would not recommend it to anyone unless they are prepared to hear the same song about ten times on each disc.

Each song on \\"Happy People\\" and \\"U Saved Me\\" sounds a lot like the title track, with only a couple of exceptions.

It had the opposite signal needed for my Casio CDP-100 (opposite meaning the Yamaha is 'open contacts on sustain', and the Casio wants the contacts closed on sustain).So, owners of non-Yamaha pianos beware!

I opened it up, plugged it in, hit middle C and the keyboard speakers filled with rich reverberation; only problem is that I wasn't stepping on the sustain pedal. Every time I pressed on the sustain pedal, it would act in reverse and cut the sustain. Likewise when I released the pedal, the sustain would resume through every note played, but with no control of how much sustain. I researched for different ways of solving this problem where I concluded it could be a wiring problem (possibly out of phase), or even an incompatibility issue with my keyboard. Needless to say, I decided to opt out and return it. I'm using the meager, but effective, Casio sustain pedal that comes with the PX-330.

The action is firm and realistic, and feels like a real piano pedal. The cord is sufficiently long, but not so long that it gets in the way. The construction is good, and the appearance is nice as well.My two minor complaints are: 1) the pedal slips on my tile floor; there are only two skid pads in the front, so I'll have to add my own on the back. 2) the pedal is rather deep, and with my digital piano up against a wall, the pedal has to be pushed back against the wall to be in the right spot.I do recommend this pedal."},{"rating":"1","title":"MISLEADING INFORMATION","review":"The product information states that it is for electronic keyboards that have a sustain jack.

Jeff Carrington did not plan to fall off his horse, leaving him paralysed: neither did Hope plan on falling for her brother's best friend - and live in the shadows as a little \\"sister\\".When Jeff closes the world out, as his way to deal with pain, Hope steps in - and despite how \\"tough\\" it is, she pushes him to try and improve the quality of life he has left; and hopefully discover that her feelings for him are far deeper than anything he may have known before.I like the way the character's continually develop in this story. To me, it is not just a case of two people meeting, having a misunderstanding and making everything alright in the end.In fact, it is a good thing that Hope knew Jeff from before and continued to help him, despite his rough character he portrays in this story.I would love to read other books in this series, now that I have already been introduced to Cole and Ross!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An intriguing debut","review":"Jumping between the US and Peru, Daniel Alarcon's stories depict the harsh realities of life from an outside in perspective.

I enjoyed the reading and highly recommend it. However, I felt that this style has been largely used by older Peruvian authors although perhaps rarely printed in English. Excesive \\"realism\\" should not be used as a main line. Yes, those things really happen in Peru, but we have read that before, it is not new.

Aside from the brutal installation (our trusses were spaced at 21\\" and 27\\" rather than standard 16\\" or 24\\") this rack is solid and beautiful. We ended up angling the hooks to reach the bolts that we screwed in, but it has turned out to be better since angling the hooks raises the pot rack and allows for less shaking. Minus one star: the rack comes with too few hooks which are priced too high when purchased separately. The rack easily holds 4 more hooks but cost a hefty $30 to add them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Looks great hanging in my kitchen.

You don't get the full range you'd get on a regular djembe. As I bought it as a drum for guests and/or non band members to play, I can't complain.

(If you want to teach yourself Indian cooking, check out my \\"So You Want To...\\" guide for helpful cookbooks.) Since then, I have tried many pre-made spice blends, most of them lacking in flavor when compared to what I make myself. And then I found Neera's Garam Masala on the shelf at the market, and discovered that this amazing product is as intense, lively and flavorful as the garam masala I used to spend HOURS making. HOORAY!! I was very happy to find it online at Amazon, because the markets I shop at do not carry specialty products consistently, so I was becoming frustrated when I couldn't find a new jar as my old jar was starting to look empty. DOUBLE HOORAY!!

Stopped the movie 30 minutes in and moved on. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I thought","review":"This movie was highly recommended because it was about (allegedly) St. Josemaria Escriva. Well, it wasn't really about him, but his friend. It wasn't particularly inspiring either. The ending wasn't bad, in light of the rest of the film.

The lead man, who the story is about, kills the woman he loves because it's what he thinks she wants. The fact that she does actually want to die does not justify his action. I was very disappointed in this movie, it was slow, sad, contained too much language for a family film, and the ending was not that great. It had a few tiny moments of goodness, which is why I am giving it 2 stars and not just 1. Would not recommend this movie to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I espected a movie on the life of St. Josemaria, and I was even prepared for the violence, but I never expected to see a movie that focused more on Jospemaria's friend and used curse words left and right.

I disagree. As prominent as he was, St. Josemaria was, from what I ascertain, an understated though deeply interesting person, and the movie portrays this well.I am preordering this.

The rest are more pictures of the same work.If angels, clouds, and birds are not what you aspire to paint exclusively, then stay away from this book.

Unfortunately, I found most of the recipes that I tried very bland and boring, so I didn't get very far through it. I held on to it though and over the past year I've been rotating it with my other vegetarian cookbooks (I am no longer vegan, but still try to cut out animal products where I can). My opinion on it hasn't changed - the recipes are mostly bland and tasteless. There's no reason vegan food has to be this way!If you don't mind bland food you might like this book. The concept is good, and it's well-organised. But I would definitely not recommend it to anyone with a more creative palate - or to anyone thinking about going vegan because it will put you right off!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought this book 12 yrs ago... and still loving it","review":"The recipes are varied and all very tasty, but what really earns this book 5 stars are the extremely convenient weekly shopping lists! The lists really help motivate me to plan my meals each week and they tell me the exact amount of groceries to buy so that nothing goes to waste.Another useful thing about this book is that the ingredients/ groceries are listed in both the metric and the imperial system, so I've had no trouble using it while living in the States and in Australia.Even if you're not vegan (I'm not anymore), this cookbook contains delicious, healthy meals and presents them in a very practical format.

All the reciepts are even in both metic and american measurements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good cookbook for the single cook.","review":"I really enjoy this cookbook and use it regularly. It is really the only vegan cookbook geared towards a single person. The recipe's are easy and tasty, though wih a British palate. Some conversions from english measurements to american measurements seem to be off. Overall i would highly recomend this cookbook and look forward to trying all of its recipes. So far my favorite is the smoked tofu a'la king (and this had to be one of the easiest of all to make!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could have looked through before buying","review":"I bought this book on amazon when I was first going vegan. I didn't realize at the time that the book was structured as a series of meal plans. You're supposed to buy all the listed ingredients at the start of the week, and make each meal from that as you go along. I found this a little too planned for my taste. What happens when you want to go out to dinner, or feel some other burst of spontaneity? It's very structured, and allows for only one dessert a week. I don't know about you, but I need cookies in my life. Try the New Farm book instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've learned something","review":"If this book has taught me anything its how to make smaller portions. I came from from a big family and we cooked big meals. However, being a single parent, I had to change my methods or else be subjected to a life long experience of too much leftovers.I'm not a vegetarian but the recipes are delicious. They are also quick and easy to prepare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland food but well organized","review":"This book was disappointing in its plain foods and repetitive seasonings - the type of book that gives vegetarian food its boring connotations. I suspect some of this is that I am used to a wide variety of fruits and vegatables as well as more spices. It does give a good shopping menu and offers ways to use a dish more than once a week. I returned the book as there was nothing I didn't already have in a more interesting recipe at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good value for an energy drink","review":"Many energy drinks are fortified with vitamins and herbal blends. OSO only provides Niacin(76% of the RDA) as a supplement. Other energy drinks such as Monster Lo-carb, Sugar-free Socko, sugar-free NOS, Rockstar zero-carb(in a purple can) and sugar-free Rockstar(in a white can) offer good taste as well as a near full complement of B vitamins and an herbal blend as well as taurine(an amino acid thought to help metabolism). OSO has an average taste in my opinion. The taste is reminiscent of a weak Monster lo-carb combined with a weak berry drink. I would recommend other energy drinks before this one. I will concede that the shipping speed on this product was excellent even with the super saver shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"This is far from the best tasting energy drink.

Comes out perfect every time.I've also used them for cookies. I adjusted my cooking time downward and used parchment. The results were outstanding.I gave them 4, rather than five, stars because one of the pans arrived dented. At this price, I think that's not acceptable. Since other reviewers have mentioned the same thing, this is clearly a recurring problem. I don't know if the problem is with Amazon, the manufacturer, or some combination of the two. But it's a problem.I will buy this brand again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chicago Metallic Professional fan","review":"Chicago Metallic Professional pans are sturdy dark pans that are extremely non-stick. Since foods cook faster in these pans, cooking times might need to be reduced. If using for cookies, parchment paper or sprays are not necessary. If you like foods browned nicely - ie. vegetables, breads - these work beautifully and cleanup is a breeze. This set only comes with one cooling grid (not non-stick) but another one that fits can be bought at Amazon that is nonstick - 16.7\\" x 11.5\\" x .5\\". Obviously, the nonstick one is nicer. Cooling racks are great for cooling cookies but are excellent for keeping waffles crisp while making the rest of the batch.

Cliff Richard looked and sounded good as did Sir Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton, Rod Stewart and Ray Davies. Sir Elton John could have selected a better song to sing in that regal setting. Noticably absent were the Rolling Stones and The Who. Otherwise every big British name from the 60s and 70s still alive was there, and in good form. I was very touched by the appearance of Sir George Martin as chaperone to the royal family when they were introduced to the performers. Then Paul McCartney took charge for the finale.

Unfortunately, there was NO Bruce Springstein, Jackson Browne, The Who or even Pearl Jam. Bands, whose songs drove the plot and characters in the movie. The powerful scenes in, which were sync with \\"Love reign O'er Me\\" by The Who, and sounds of the Boss's \\"River\\" album were non-existent.

Many reviewers rated this 1 star because it didn't have the music they were looking for on it. However the music that is actually on this CD is amazingly beautiful. It is, as one reviewer stated, understated jazz, and NOT, what another reviewer stated, muzak. This CD is rich with atmospheric textures and paints an aural landscape. True, it is somewhat melancholic, but that is part of the beauty of this amazing CD. If you are looking for the classic rock tracks that adorned the movie, skip this.

I am on to the second book now, \\"Stalking the Angel.\\" Here's the reason for the title: At the front of the book, a poem is quoted that reads\\"Winter downpourEven the monkeyNeeds a raincoat\\"-BashoI think this refers to Elvis providing the protection, a metaphorical \\"raincoat\\", that his client needs in her time of distress, her emotional \\"downpour.\\" Or, maybe he just thought it was a cool poem! You can never tell with Robert Crais! Enjoythe book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A hot new mystery writer, WOW!!","review":"With the Monkey's Raincoat Robert Crais joins the greats of mystery writing. This well plotted book tells the story of drug-dealing and the kidnapping of a young child. Crais's main character is a cool LA (left coast) private eye named Elvis. Crais's characters have depth and are believable. The book (now books) are easy reads and I look forward to the next one from this excellent author."},{"rating":"2","title":"good detective novel","review":"The characters, Elvis Cole and Joe Pike, reminded me of Dirk Pitt and Al Giordano from Clive Cusslers novels. But Pike is one bad dude, much more menacing than his couterpart (Giordano). I found myself wanting to read more about Pike. The last 100 pages of this one were page turners for sure. Enjoyable"},{"rating":"2","title":"Elvis is the King","review":"\\"Monkey's Raincoat\\" is the first novel in the Elvis Cole L.A. Private Eye series. The main character is a cynical, yet soft, private eye, with a penchant for morning yoga stretches and Disney collectibles. You can't help but enjoy a main character who has a Pinocchio clock in his office, loves spicy food, and has a sidekick with an empty office.As another reviewer pointed out, this book is more of an \\"action\\" novel than it is mystery. There are no major plot twists that leave you in shock. There are no subtle clues at the beginning of the story you should pay attention to. You feel more that you are the listener to Elvis' outloud ramblings that help him in solving the case.The book flows, and I found myself absorbed in the whip sharp dialogue and wondering how Cole can eat what he does while still remain healthy and on top of his game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early Parker and Block","review":"If you liked Parker's early books and Block's Rhodenfuror and Scudder series, you will thoroughly enjoy Crais. He developes his characters as well so you get to know them and root for them. Elvis Cole - the main PI - has a sense of humor and irony. Many scenes are laced with a wry comment and his own editorial comments on it. Pike is similar to Hawk, but Cole eyes him with a speck of humor also. Oh- and also - the mystery part is darn good too! This was my first of Crais, I've read another, and am hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crais's first novel?","review":"I only have one problem with Robert Crais. He just does not write fast enough.

Elvis is just too smart-mouthed. It is one of the few novels that I quit on in the middle.

Too much uninteresting and unnecessary verbiage."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good first novel...but greatness comes later...","review":"Crais and Elvis Cole, I imagine, will grow after this book. This was short read, but took me a long time to get through. The book didn't flow as well as Demolition Angel did. Cole however is really cool character as is Joe Pike. The odd pairing works. This book is a bit dated now, almost 17 years later. The story is not all that deep or surprising, but still fun. However, I think I will continue to visit with Elvis and his world and see how he has grown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"I got this to get all my brother and father's Joe Pike references.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monkey's raincoat","review":"The\\" Monkey's Raincoat\\" by Robert Crais was a fun read.

I bought the LA Requiem as a book and I liked it. So, I decided to read more by this guy living now not far from me. The LA based books may force me to visit that city more often.

It introduces private detective Elvis Cole and his partner Joe Pike. While the book has earned a number of awards, I thought it started slow and was a little hard to get into. It did, however, finish in a fury. Crais spends much of the first half of the book establishing Cole as a witty, clever and wise-cracking private detective.The case involves Ellen Lang, who comes to Cole seeking to find her husband, Mort, who has taken their nine-year-old son. Mort is connected to Kimberly Marsh, an aspiring actress and girlfriend. Mort's partner in a talent agency, Garrett Rice, has problems of his own. Mort also was having money problems.Of course, nothing is as simple as it looks. Cole and Pike soon find themselves in the middle of an organized crime feud. Along the way, Ellen, gains some self-esteem and determination, allowing her to play a key role in the outcome."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Raymond Chandler","review":"Purchased this based on all the good reviews. Readers must enjoy books that have all the same basic features: stolen cocaine, police hostility, and graphic beatings. The author seems to think he is a modern day Raymond Chandler giving his protagonist clever sayings. However, they are not clever and so annoying and unnecessary that you feel he deserves it when he gets his mouth slapped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the read","review":"Page turner??? Yeah, just to get it over with.I agree with Harmoni. First I thought it was too unbelievable that a detective would risk his life and go all out for a client without getting paid. Second, because of his too sarcastic (I guess he's supposed to be funny) antagonizing wit, puts law inforcement on the defensive. Pike who is supposed to be \\"a fearful fellow\\" gets shot just when Elvis needs him the most, so he does it alone against the mob and tough guys, duh! Yeah right! And last, having sex with the two women (especailly Ellen who is painted as an introverted motherly type) was ridiculous and not necessary to a plot that was drawn out.Shame on you Robt Crais."},{"rating":"2","title":"First book I read of Robert Crais","review":"I am a devoted Elvis and Joe fan. I read this book based on reviews of others. I liked the book but I LOVE LA Requiem. That is RC's best book, in my opinion. However I would encourage his fans to read this if they have not."},{"rating":"2","title":"An above average private eye","review":"I discovered Crais by accident. He's not John D. MacDonald, and the lead character is a sort of rip-off of Travis McGee and Spenser, but this book was good enough to get me to buy the (used) paperbacks in this series, of which this is the first. Good plots, snappy dialogue, what one expects these days of good private ey novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent dialogue, weak plot","review":"This book was a bit of a disappointment to me, since I read it on the recommendation of numerous amazon.com reviewers who thought that Elvis Cole was a better character than Harlan Coben's sports agent/investigator Myron Bolitar. The dialogue is very good and quite humorous, but the plot is paper-thin and parts of the book (especially towards the end) had me laughing out loud in disbelief at their ridiculousness. The entire mystery was revealed about half-way through the book and I kept waiting for some sort of twist at the end, but there was none at all. I really wouldn't recommend this novel at all, as its good points are overshadowed by its weaknesses."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great mystery read!","review":"Robert Crais sure can write. This is a great mystery read. His protagonist, Elvis Cole, is funny, sexy, and thinks on his feet. Quick words fly from his mouth and the pages fly with him. This book is non-stop action. I consider it a great find and highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pretentious comic book","review":"This reads like a pretentious comic book laid out in prose. The characters are cardboard cutouts and the dialog is full of slang and innuendo. For the right audience but not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"This made for an exciting first novel for Mr. Crais. Excellent. The period in a book where the author must establish the characters is quite often boring. But not for this author - the characters and plotline was laid out in a very slick format. The story was edgy and exciting. I can't wait for the next in the series!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A traditional beginning to an ever-maturing P.I. series...","review":"Robert Crais dresses up his first entry in the Elvis Cole series with all of the traditional P.I. trimmings: 1)The lost, lonely, yet attractive, perpetual victim; 2)The strong-willed, brash, yet attractive, best friend of perpetual victim; 3)The solid-as-a-rock, faithful sidekick; 4)The sometimes volatile relationship with local law enforcement. It's the humor and upbeat attitude that separates this novel from the cookie-cutter PI novels. Crais takes the traditional down-trodden detective and infuses him with a contagious optimism. I enjoyed every moment. As for his \\"relations\\" with the two female leads, I say this: It's a detective novel. He's supposed to get all the chicks."},{"rating":"2","title":"An entertaining page turner","review":"This was a fun book to read. It was humorous and suspenseful; Elvis is an original and memorable character.I thought the end was too over the top with the violence. But overall it was enjoyable and I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one that makes me want to read more","review":"This was a book club selection, and like most of the book club selections, I wasn't overly enamored with it. It was less of a mystery and more of a suspense novel. My biggest problem was, again, not liking the characters. The main character slept with every girl in the book and it just jarred with not only the characters, but the plot. It seemed that the author tried to cram too much into a single storyline, and came out with something jumbled, confused, and messy. It's also a little dated at this point, but that wasn't too bad. I did see shades of Miami Vice in the clothing, though... This book did not make me want to read further in the series, and I probably won't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed It","review":"The Monkey's Raincoat by Robert Crais is the first Elvis Cole novel, and it was a treat to read the early days of the Elvis Cole/Joe Pike partnership. I have read many of the later books in the series so I really enjoyed this one. Elvis is called in to look for a missing husband and son and before the case is over, he has left a trail of dead and battered bodies and outwitted some mobsters. Crais did a good job of setting up his two characters, as well as recurring character of police detective Lou Poitras. I could have done without Elvis hopping into bed with two of the female characters, but that's a minor quibble. This was a fast paced, enjoyable read and a good start to what has become one of my favorite series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Favorite","review":"Crais is very popular, and this is the first book of his that I've read. He seems to be trying to out \\"smart ass\\" DeMille's John Corey, or the late Robert Parker's Spenser. Unfortunately, in my opinion he doesn't quite get there. The plot and characters are OK, the book just didn't have that much appeal for me. I'll pass on his other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book That Is Neither Good Or Bad","review":"I don't understand all the hype to this. It wasn't that great. It wasn't a bad read, it was just mediocre. It was a bit boring and cliche. I don't know. I guess I feel like this because I have read the better books out there. Maybe I am trying to compare this one with the better ones. There are moments throughout the book that makes it worth the price though. There are many more books that are much better, so I would pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was Pike?","review":"When I bought this book I really wanted to read about Pike so my question is where was he?

So my lesson is not to read old books from RC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good book","review":"I only read a few chapters of this book and therefore the review based only on that, but I decided that it was not worth reading any further. This is unusual for me, as I always try to read every book that I start through to the end. However, I didn't like the writing style, felt that it was somewhat juvenile and crass.

What other Jane WAS there?! He repeatedly used the last names of characters to the point where I wondered if HE couldn't remember which Jane was involved just two paragrahs ago. Was the book written by different people? at different times? and then put together without an editor? My mother simply looked at it and said \\"Bad writing is bad writing.\\" She couldn't get past a few chapters.

I really looked forward to this trilogy and I was equally pleased. Ms Canavan does not write books where you see the ending coming from about the middle of the second book of a trilogy. Neither does she pad a series out. This book was an excellent conclusion, and the ending left me wanting a sequel.

Since my grade depended on me completing the book and weekly reports, I continued to read. I'm extremely glad that I did, after the first few chapters the character development begin to take off and I got into the story. I had emotional ups and downs with the plot and characters.

As a white female, I was blasted by Campbell with another point of view - one which at times made me feel as nave and oblivious as Mallory. One of my favorite characters was vivacious Vanessa, who offers some striking words of wisdom about tolerance and harmony, both towards others and for oneself. This work goes beyond the currently relevant social themes of race and gender inequity: in the internal monologues of each character we study - from the wealthy and privileged white male bank president to the poor and struggling black female bank teller - we are shown the transcending motif of basic humanity: the fears, insecurities, jealousies, loves, and other fundamentals which link us all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Everyone should read this book.

More evidence of the Exploding Hindenburg that is contemporary Western Esotericism.

Would have been nice if he just kept to mountaineering and buggering North African young boys, but, alas, or perhaps \\"Aiwass\\", he decided he was the Master Therion announcing the Age of The Conquering Child.

I own the printing in his 'Liber Aba' as well, but this copy also holds Crowley's commentary and introduction. This, I believe, holds the key to fully understanding the text, giving insight to what Crowley interpreted at the time. It also enlightened me to the fact that not all occultists (at least in Crowley's day) were associated with this or that left-wing movement. The end of the intro. makes it clear: socialism in any form is inherently evil and unlawful, since 'do what thou wilt' is just not part of its creed.

It is a declaration of war upon any who would seek to enslave the creative spirit of humankind. 'There is no god but man'- is a sophisticated yet simple philosophy which few are selfpossesed enough to accept! I cannot wait for it to be translated into Arabic!

Even so, there is little doubt that Crowley beleived that this was an important event in his life; he subsequently based his entire existence upon the premise of the book. Apparently even he was not aware of the place where he had nicked the \\"do what thou wilt\\" philosophy. The books use of imagery and the overall style are quiet striking, and do make for interesting speculation.

And it's all written in the 'Swinburnian' that A.C. was fond of in his Cambridge days. It also has a Freudian feel to it. I don't know who or what Aiwass was, but it seems he or it had a very limited education. Thelemites might try reading some critical biography of Crowley. (p.s.

I would not go so far as to call the book \\"evil\\", but it is definitely not for the casual or unprepared reader and the warning is no joke.

Liber AL vel Legis contains no new religious or spiritual revelations to guide the human species out of it's \\"dark night of the soul.\\" The formulas contained therein are of a Gnostic flavour, Crowley & the Thelemic cult is best digested by studying his works as if studying results from lab rats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kinda Awkward","review":"I really like this version, however, as already stated, the paper is way too glossy for my taste and makes it feel more like a textbook or pamphlet.The size of the book is ok, but having it be perfectly square is kinda awkward for my hands, especially with the binding being so tight, you have to work to keep it open. If you are looking for a Liber AL to use continuously or to travel, I wouldn't recommend this one. However, this is a nice version for ritual or private study.As for the contents of the book, I should expect every Thelemite to heed The comment, especially in a public forum like this, \\"convert not\\" let the \\"centres of pestilence\\" be not of us. If the followers of dying Gods wish to judge and fear what they don't understand, let them and laugh at their ignorance."},{"rating":"1","title":"PURPLE PROSE FROM A PSEUDO SUMERIAN DEMON","review":"Aiwass sounds rather like the bad poet Crowley was. Also, the \\"Do what thou wilt\\" was done better by Rabelais in Gargantua and Pantagruel. Nothing really original here, but it never hurts to take strange drugs and drink wines that foam, and all of the other stuff Crowley did without having to become logos of the aeon. Crowley was a massive failure in three dimensions, so he cooked up some \\"credentials\\" for the credulous in the fourth dimension with the Book of the Law. Strange that this Sumerian demon just happens to speak English, with some Latin thrown in, and does it in the purple prose of the demon poet Crowley.Every man and woman is a star?

What I really like about the way it's put together is, the first part is all printed and very legible on really nice paper. It has the silk page finder like you would find in a bible. The second half of the book is the writing of what you just read in the author's own handwriting. Now his handwriting for me was hard to read, but with a little effort and comparing his own writing with the first part of the book you can make it out.

Now that I have been practicing for a few years, and taken a few more glances at this book....hrmmm, trouble. Crowley is a VERY powerful magician, albeit not to clean. This book is magic in itself. It lays down laws and guidelines for a new age, with beings Crowley tapped into which told him they were the heralds for the golden times...those will come.

And it is dangerous to those who know not what they will or do, which is a vast majority of people.There are certain sancrosanct laws that govern this Universe.

The mesh fabric meant to keep bugs out is like a thin porous fabric, I found myself breathing very heavily when using it.

I was using a net that had eyes cut out before and the mosquitoes were biting my forehead and temples. Just know that you are going to be looking through a net. The holes are extremely small. I can't imagine anything is going to get through.On a better note the camo pattern is decent. Its BDU style and it conceals your face really well. When I look in the mirror while wearing it I can't even see my face, just camo pattern.Overall it's a pretty good buy. The price is decent and I didnt even have shipping costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful","review":"This hat is perfect insect, rain and sun protection all in one.

But that is as far as the similarity goes. The science in the book is more than plausible, and the characters are realistic and multi-dimensional. The story itself is exciting and keeps moving with a strong story line and plot. The SIMS themselves are sympathetic characters with a good dose of special ops action mixed in to the novel.

Relies a great deal on modern critical methods with little discernment. The result is that very little is taken concretely and non-allegorically.

We park our bikes inside and this doesn't fit through a normal door so we had to take it off the bike each time and turn it on it's side to fit it through the door frame. Also, the security straps are useless and totally flimsy. Our daughter, who is 17 months, on a 1-hr bike ride was basically lying on her side from the slouchy seat and lack of firm harness to support her upright. The \\"jogger handle\\" is kind of weird and just clamps onto the outside of the fabric around the back bars but I guess it would work if we found the whole in-and-out-of-the-house effort to be worthwhile. Lastly, don't plan on taking it anywhere with you! It's a HUGE hassle to fold down and VERY heavy. Not what we were hoping for and not worth paying over two hundred dollars for. -but it does work fine as a trailer and our daughter was pretty happy in it if none of the other things bother you."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont purchase not worth the money","review":"I purchesed this product and returned it back. The bike trailer not comfortable for kids at all. The worst thing of it is the bar from the jogger folds underneath the seat were the child is sitting, so when you hit a bump they bounce on a bar.

I think the problem may be in what people are looking for in a survival knife. This is a survival knife in every sense of the word. It is not a hunting knife. It is not a multi-purpose camping knife. It is not an every-day carry knife. It is a \\"survival\\" knife. It is for your bug-out bag or for that back-packing trip in which you carry along your survival gear in case of emergencies. Its purpose is to keep you alive or to save the life of someone else. It is a heavy-duty knife and I would give it 10 stars if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding Gerber?","review":"This knife is no longer made of Sandvik steel as advertised! Instead you now get a 420HC blend - essentially the same found in cheap Dollar Store knives....If you're looking for a backpacking/camping knife suitable for making feather sticks/bushcraft this knife is not it. With the blade being so thick, serrated, and made of such cheap steel, it's almost impossible to get long, consistent, curling, feather sticks that are thin enough to take a magnesium spark.This knife is essentially a sharpened crowbar.

Most of the songs have been given a hasty remix and production job, so it hardily represents Amon Duul II in their full glory. Also to include the live version of \\"Archangel Thunderbird\\" was a poor choice since it is the studio version for this band is best remembered. This is a compilation that no one, except it's remixer and producer would find entertaining. Those who know Amon Duul II would likely go for the original versions while this compilation would more than likely turn the uninitiated off to this great band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somebody please do this band justice!!!","review":"Yet another Amon Duul 2 rip-off.

So as an alternative I thought I would buy a file box that would look stylish and be in my price range as a temporary solution. The Cargo Naturals Dual file box is nothing more than a pretty cardboard box and it arrived with a dent in the side (showing how flimsy it is). I expected it to at least be coated with wax or something, but it's literally made of cardboard. For the quality of this product I would expect to pay about $10-15 not the $34 I paid. It does hold hanging file folders nicely and does look attractive, however I feel I paid 3 times more than what it's worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only the lid fit better","review":"For those who don't want of need a regular file cabinet but need to store files that occasionally are accessed it works well.

The book starts out on the couple's wedding night so that much is a given. But they married for practical reasons, not love. The book is about falling in love (and a little spy business).It's interesting that one critical review disliked Lucy and another disliked Simon. Neither one of them was perfect -- they both made mistakes. Simon left with no explanation and conducted an apparent affair right in front of Lucy. Lucy was more angry that Simon didn't tell her he was a spy than when she thought he was having an affair. I could understand both positions and really enjoyed the process of Simon and Lucy finding love in their marriage. I hope Ms. Mullins continues with Foxworth and Gin's story and another spy adventure in which Lucy and Gin can work with Simon and Fox."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disspointing book - for such a talented writer....","review":"I was very disappointed in this latest installment by Ms. Mullins. I have been a tried and true fan of all her previous books and I must say that I really found this lacking, even though I persevered in finishing it to see if there were any redeeming qualities. Unfortunately, I will have to agree with what some of the other reviewers have mentioned. The book stared well and it fizzled out.Lucy was somewhat of a whiner and some of her actions were rather idiotic.

This book successfully brings all the story threads from the previous books to a conclusion, though not necessarily a happy-ever-after situation for all the characters involved, but it also leaves some new threads untied, enough for another story in the same world in the future. In the end I'd have to say I'm glad I stuck with this series with its unusual fantasy combination of European influenced countries as its background."},{"rating":"1","title":"Controller does not work","review":"I was very excited to receive this toy, when it arrived batteries were placed and the controller which is seperate in the packaging was put in place.

Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed. This didn't keep the attention of my daughter or my 5 year old son. I even found it boring. Most of the songs have only one set of feet dancing to them. I thought there would be several pairs of feet dancing to each song which I believe would have kept us all a little more entertained - sort of like \\"Riverdance\\" only without the upper body. This was definitely a waste of money.

This swell collection captures him at his best, tilting towards his novelty material, all of which is quite good. It fills a real gap, though, since other CD-edition best-ofs skip over rollicking gems such as \\"Sorrow On The Rocks\\" and his fab, cheerfully cornball gospel recitation, \\"What Would You Do If Jesus Came To Your House...\\" There's no one else like Porter, and this is a mighty fine introduction to his work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Resource For Patients","review":"Dr. Savard has put together a simple binder-formatted book that makes it easy to get organized when it comes to your health records.As someone with hypothyroidism, a chronic illness that requires frequent blood tests, it's really critical for me to stay organized.

After reviewing it, I had to tell my myself honestly that I would not take the time to complete all of the information that is required both for the initial pass and to keep it updated. Perhaps if I had a chronic medical condition or did not trust my physician I'd find it more useful, unfortunately I'm afraid that this will find a dust-collecting space on my bookshelf, until I toss it--uncompleted.There is some good information here, but nothing that I have not gotten from my own physicians. My health records have followed me consistently and reliably throughout my many moves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I missing something?","review":"My physician gave me something like this several years ago when I asked him to outline what tests I should have and at what intervals, etc. I used it for a while but eventually realized that I was, and still am, getting good care from the physician I trust. I guess I don't get the point of this self-help book.Another question I asked myself as I was going through it was, if this is so important why are there no endorsements by HMOs, other physicians, or patient groups. It seems that if this is so critical to my present and future well-being why haven't I heard about it before today and why isn't it endorsed by the medical community, or at least some kind of health services agency."},{"rating":"2","title":"# 5 Is The Weakest Forbidden Hollywood Collection","review":"Volume 5 has no extras, & the films are the weakest in the series. The best film in the collection & worth the price is \\"Ladies They Talk About\\" with a great cast: Barbara Stanwyck, Lillian Roth, Preston Foster, & Lyle Talbot. A woman-in-prison film. The scene where Roth shows Stanwyck around the jail is a pip!James Cagney is the star of \\"Hard To Handle\\" but it is lesser Cagney & he is not his usual dynamic self. (Why Warner's chose this over \\"Blonde Crazy\\" is unfathomable.).\\"The Mind Reader\\" is a good Warren William film in a usual part as a swindler.\\"Miss Pinkerton\\" has Joan Blondell as a mystery solving nurse in a film that's just OK.I am a big Pre-code fan & the only film on this I would watch again is \\"Ladies They Talk About\\", which is also the only film in the set that was previously available on home video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good pre-code films.","review":"I have so far purchased all of the Forbidden Hollywood pre-code sets. The first three sets are great, while set four is mediocre. Set Five falls somewhere in between with the best two films being \\"Hard to Handle\\" and the really good \\"Ladies they talk about\\". Nobody did Pre-code better than Barbara Stanwyck and this is her show. It does make me wonder where these sets will go in the future as the best films already seem to be represented.

It also scratches easily, so don't think about putting this on your keychain. The lens has a tendency to pop off. Obviously the pictures are low res, but that's to be expected at this price point.The battery contacts are flimsy, and bouncing around in your pocket causes the battery to lose it's connection. The camera resets randomly and you lose all your pictures.

There are so many songs with killer riffs and leads on this album. There's also a lot of contrast and powerful transitions within songs, with many songs having lots of cranked-up riffs intertwined with acoustic guitar parts, displaying Steve Blaze's mastery of meoldic metal and classical guitar, along with his songwriting. He always does what is best for the song as his solos are songs in and of themselves. Of course, there's also great vocals and drums. The production on Ron's vocals is great here, very natural sounding, with a touch of reverb seeming to be the only noticible effect. Drums are clear, with great snap. The guitar tone is awesome, sounding like a Marshall in your room.

Along the way they pick up Jane Russell, who falls in love with Gable, but wants the rich lifestyle that Ryan can provide.The story is hardly short on action. There's blizzards, Indian attacks, cattle drives, and plenty of male/female friction. But it doesn't add up to anything particularly exciting or even interesting. It was a surprise to me, given not only the cast, but also the director Raoul Walsh, who certainly knew his way around action and adventure, not to mention how to pace a film. There are a few good moments, especially the final drive with the cattle, but not enough to sustain any interest in the characters or the story. The actors are fine, but the missing energy really hurts the film. It's a large scale Western, but the scale doesn't impress."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bloated western","review":"I really wonder what the other reviewers saw in this picture. Jane Russell with her unruffled skirts and coiffures belongs to an another film. She was O.K. with Bob Hope, but not with Gable and Ryan. This is one of the worst films made with a lot of money. The story is full of cliches. Brian Garfield wrote very harshly about it in his excellent guide about western films. The Tall Men is a \\"disappointingly hackneyed and mediocre, bloated far beyond its proper scale: overlong, underscripted, flabbily directed and downwright silly\\". I agree with his opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clark Gable and Jane Russell at their Best!!!","review":"This is definitely one of the best Westerns of the Fifties--great acting, great scenery, and a great story. Gable is great here, trying to hide his love for the woman played by Russell, who also sings a couple of tunes and sounds great. This is not a musical--its a western filled with everything--a big cattle and horse drive, Indian fights, and land stealers. The scenery is great color and the way they show a pack horse getting lost in the river is something else-hope that horse was not really drowned. It has some scenes in it that you would not think would be a movie this old--which makes it very entertaining. As for Gable--what an actor in his time-that smooth grin and laughter-the mysterious character he always seems to play--Awesome!!! If you love this era of Western movies I suggest you buy this one when you find it--its very rare!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gable Rules Once Again with his Charm and Masculinity","review":"THE TALL MEN is a very entertaining Western primarily set on a cattle drive with Clark Gable and Cameron Mitchell signing on with boss Robert Ryan. They must contend not only with the natural elements and marauding Indians but also with their conflicting unbridled emotions for Jane Russell. Director Raoul Walsh this time out seems to display a keen sense of droll humor taking advantage of his three male stars vying for the attention of Russell. Clark Gable as usual turns in a fine performance with his carefree charm and looks and predictably steals this film once again from an accomplished veteran cast."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE TALL MEN","review":"CLARK GABLE WAS,WHAT A COWBOY IS SUPPOSE TO BE.

This is really useful when you are travelling (in a car) around as opposed to just staying in one city or two. I agree with another reveiwer that the hotels/inns/palaces with pictures are generally better than entries without a picture. Sometimes the website for the establishment will be listed.

Strange graphs replace the intuitive and comprehensive tables used in the earlier edition.

The areas that summarize a particular category are well laid out. The graphics in the Climate section are helpful, although I did notice a significant mistake (I think)... Those of you looking at the two Charlestons ( SC and WV), it looks like the Climatic graphics and statistics were switched for these two cities. Quite a shocker to see that Charleston, SC gets 32 inches of snow a year! If anyone connected to the publisher can confirm that with me, it would be appreciated. It is also very helpful to have previous editions so that you can compare changes in a locations scores for the 1997 edition vs. the 1993 or 1989 edition. I have collected all 3.

It is an excellent book for comparison and contrast among U.S. cities. However, the most recent edition I could find was 2007. I'm certain that some of the primary data has been negatively affected by the recession. It would be helpful to compare the 2007 edition to a more recent edition that would incorporate the effects of the economic recession.For example, I live in Phoenix, Arizona, a capital city in a state that endured and continues to endure grave consequences resulting from its economic situation. In spite of some recent improvement, I think I would have attributed less generous scores in several categories.

Throughout the book we get summaries of Kafka's important works and we get to see Crumb's visual interpretation of these stories. That is the best part of the book for me. The biographical side is also very good, explaining a bit of why Kafka wrote like that.While reading the book, I felt like it is hard to call most of it a comic book, because it has a lot of prose. The parts of the book where we get to see Crumb interpret Kafka's stories definitely feel like a comic book, but the biography section doesn't. However, I thinks this works very well in the book, it makes the stories more alive when the images tell more than just being a drawing.I enjoyed the book, it is worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating and funny","review":"I read \\"The Metamorphosis\\" in high school, and found Kafka too weird.

The wool has become stiffer but is still strong, quite comfortable and not scratchy. They are well cushioned when new. I'm on the northern CA coast where it gets below freezing on a only a few days of the year. In those conditions, these are warm socks. I can wear them in warmer weather (65F) too.

However, in less than a year and very minimal use (once a week or less since I still have my 10-year old Japanese Santoku knife), I start noticing my henckles having brown spots / discoloration on one side of the knife. This is very shocking as I was expecting a very long lasting high quality product from Zwilling. I think my less than a year, minimally used Henckels santoku knife is starting to rust!! My 10-year-old knife has newer steel than this product. The only problem I have with my old knife is the wooden handle that is falling apart.

It's very much an off-brand item that is not made by Apple.I bought this figuring it would be a replacement for my Apple brand remote. It's most certainly not the same thing as the Apple product and you should think twice before buying. The Apple remote plugs into the dock port and then you plug the headphones into the remote. This product requires you to plug the remote into the dock port--but the headphones must be plugged into the iPod's headphone jack! That means you cannot drop the iPod into a pocket because there are wires and such sticking out of both ends. Just a terrible solution. I had no trouble getting the remote to function as it should, but the remote and headphones are visibly cheap and of inferior quality manufacture (it's hard to make plastic look this cheap). I strongly recommend you get the Apple brand remote."},{"rating":"1","title":"Earbuds fall out if you move","review":"The remote control is OK.But the earbuds are horrible! They are very sensitive to your particular \\"ear anatomy\\". I suppose they fit for some people, but for me they are useless.

The wire is too long and the remote control is too heavy for the jack to hold. After a month of the remote and wire hanging and swinging about, the wire where it's connected at the jack gave out making this remote unuseable; I have to jiggle and find the sweet spot now just to make the remote work.Long wires plus a remote adds considerable stress and weight on the jack...a serious design flaw.

It deformed into a twisted shape within a few weeks of use. In addition, the cord tip of the remote control fell apart, revealing inner cords of the earphone. Since it was in the way, I put it away.

My only complaint is that the book is very Washington-centric and somewhat biased by omission of other points of view. Japan is barely mentioned and there is little coverage of the point of view from the European side. There is very little about the negotiations between White and Keynes which perhaps has been covered elsewhere but would have added useful context. Even though US policy makers worried incessantly about the gold outflows, they never actually *did* much about it, and the reasons for that remain obscure after reading the book.In short, there is much interesting historical context here, but none of the big \\"why\\" questions are answered.

In \\"Flim Flam\\", Randi takes on all sorts of topics, from Kirllian photography to elves in the garden to water dowsing to spirit rappers. He doesn't just say \\"this is likely fake\\". Instead, he gives concrete reasons, proof, and photographs showing the people faking the effect. He is also very upfront. He doesn't spare people their thoughts or their reputations. You can find the information in this book other places, but nowhere else will you see it laid out in such detail to prove his case.Go Randi!!! Help educate the rest of the populace, and keep the perpetators of fraud in their place!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"An excellent book that should be read by everyone. This book is a couple of decades old, but I think it's just as important today; as a reminder of how easily we are deceived by quack artists. James Randi carefully dissects all these paranormal claims, before he systematically debunks them all. He also performs a knockout on several representatives of the parapsychology community that truly whistles in the sails. And his chapter on Uri Geller is mercyless! To the reviewer from Illinois: Your cliam concerning the existence of telepathy have absolutely no legs to stand on from a scientific point of view. Your ridiculous statement that people who doesn't experience telepathy lack something in mental capacity is even wilder! There are no parts of the brain that has been identified as a center for telepathy, or any other form for psi, so that is a completely worthless statement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Randi missed the mark","review":"After reading this book, it becomes very clear the Randi has already made up his mind on the vast amount of material he tries to debunk. Instead of taking a skeptical approach, he appears to just use material that would support his own belief system. Even if it is misrepresented or twisted to support those points he makes. Randi also writes this book in a way that most people would find insulating. This book leave much to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beliefs Are NOT Delusions!","review":"While I respect the writing style and the author(s) opinions, you cannot simply \\"dismiss\\" as delusions, various cultures beliefs and experience with the paranormal.I myself have used various psychic services, including a psychic who accurately told me my past - and foretold my future!

Modern readers may not much be interested in Uri Geller, Doug Henning, or alleged UFO sightings that were barely news thirty years ago. Even were the book more current, I doubt I would have read much more than the 100 or so pages I struggled through. Mr Randi is a little full of himself and his sarcastic tone and attempts at witticisms got old quite quickly. The book suggests that the author himself is investigating and debunking various frauds and fallacies but instead he just addresses certain topics (the Bermuda Triangle, for example) and then just quotes from the research of others. Very poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry James","review":"While I am a long-time fan of James Randi, this book was tedious (at best). Unfortunately the author goes on and on ad infinitum about subjects that really don't hold the readers interest. While it is very demonstrative of factual evidence, the chapters drag on as though the reader needs to be convinced and then reconvinced of the evidence. Each chapter seemed devoted to proving the obvious frauds (over and over) to the point where I was exclaiming \\"Alright...I get it...now let's get on with it!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent reading","review":"All of you who wonder is there something elseread this before you visit the local prophet."},{"rating":"1","title":"debunking gets boring very quickly","review":"I started to read the book but I am unable to finish it.

The fact that he had to do a detailed analysis of the Cottingley fairies photos and similarly terrible hoaxes shows how badly needed this book had been at the time. His long history as a stage magician and professional puller-of-wool-over-eyes put him in a unique position of being about to understand and explain how the fakes and frauds used similar tricks to bilk their audiences. This book belong on the bookshelf of anyone of a skeptical or inquisitive nature who wants to arm themselves against charlatans making dodgy claims."},{"rating":"1","title":"Randi's Writing style weak","review":"Somewhat disappointed by the hackneyed content of this early Randi book.

I couldn't help thinking what a great present this book is for his family. By the same token, this oral history doesn't contain a story that will knock the reader out. This criticism comes in spite of the facts that I can't help liking his parents and it was presented coherently. Predictably, the author's family background pales significantly to his characters'. That I should have counted on.Alternately, Kevin Kearns' often hilarious oral history series on pre-WWII inner-Dublin is definitely worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"They are just not that interesting","review":"Rory and Ita strike me as nice people who have worked hard; I just wish I could say they led lives that I found interesting. I admire Doyle for honoring his parents this way, but to put it bluntly, this was boring. Growing up, finding work, finding each other, a story that's been told a million times and most of the time in more interesting ways than can be found in this book. After 338 pages, Rory and Ita still remain ciphers, there's no real emotional depth on display; it's just the story of two people who led ordinary lives. That concept can often lead to a wondrous work of art, just not this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good kit but a few things to keep in mind","review":"The main problem it seems is the rod is a tight fit with the patches. The rod WILL fit if you cut the patches small enough. Better yet use an old cotton undershirt and make patches the size of stamps and it'll work fine. Also be careful when using the cleaning tips as they tend to bend easily. Feed them carefully into the barrel. Just your basic cleaning kit. I ordered the 250 pack of Outers patches and everything works fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Close","review":"First of all, the packaging states it's a clamshell design. I thought that meant the package would be reclosable. Not exactly. You have to cut the plastic cover to get in. Not what I was hoping for in a storage container.Have a Bushmaster .223 rifle. The cleaning rod provided in the kit barely fits in the bore. The rod is an extremely tight fit. If you try to use a cleaning pad on the end of the rod, there is no way it fits at all.That having been said, I gave the kit four stars because you do get the solvent, the oil, a brush (that fits), the pad holder, the cleaning rod, and the cleaning pads.

I have always been a fan of the Sandpipers, who sounded like a vaguely psychedelic Lettermen. \\"Come Saturday Morning,\\" a hit for the band, came from this film.The song is so good most of the score is variations on the theme. The album--which only veers once for the mandatory 1969 party scene fuzz guitar track--holds together much better than most non-rock scores of the period.You can also getThe Sandpipers Come Saturday Morning.

Paul Johnson's Birth of the Modern is another good example of macro-history, though I have only referenced the same.Reading macro-histories, cover to cover, does give one a birds-eye view that allows you to think widely, laterally, before jumping headlong into profound ideas.

The scenes of her visiting family members while they sleep, laying her hands upon them, are especially eerie.

I doubt anyone is deceived that \\"Introduction to Post-Tonal Theory\\" is intended as other than a college textbook. The question is whether it succeeds. In my opinion it does not. In my opinion, it fails to come to grips with--and is curiously oblivious of--the body of music it purports to explain. In my opinion, it perpetuates, in a patronizing manner, a number of logical errors, misconceptions, and abuses of terminology. (For a \\"technical\\" work it is fairly lightweight, a sort of musical \\"set theory\\" Cliff Notes. Don't let this circumstance encourage you.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book - But expensive","review":"I used this book in school to get a better grasp on atonal theory, Although most of my initial confusion came from teachers using different methods of computing pitch class sets... see other reviews for arguments based on the \\"Rahn\\" Method and the \\"Forte\\" method.If your knowledge of basic western harmony is lacking, this book isn't for you yet. But after you have a good handle on your I's IV's and V/iii's and whatnot, you'll find this book helpful and extremely approachable.

Certainly that book is \\"not practical\\", but neither is it \\"theoretical\\" if we insist that music theory must say something about music. The practical alternative to reading Allen Forte's book is not to read a patronizing adulterated version of it such as \\"Introduction to Post-Tonal Theory\\", but to read a book that really knows and understands music, to read, for example, George Perle's \\"Serialism and Atonality\\" (as a reviewer below recommends)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Camera Assistant's Manual is a great tool to have.","review":"The Camera Assistant's Manual, 4th edition is packed with a wealth of valuable tips, tricks, explanations, illustrations, and suggestions for the modern-day camera assistant.

Instead of going the short route, Sherwood Smith beats around the bush, making your curiousity increase, trying to find if her \\"enemy\\" really is her enemy, and why he keeps on saving her if he is her enemy. The first of the duets is mostly packed with saving Meliara and her conflicts with the enemy, Vidanric, aka the Marquis of Shevraeth. All this leads up to an extensive conclusion in the following book: Court Duel. If you read Crown Duel, you have to buy Court Duel to find out the conclusion to their relationship. Both are v.v. good, both are worth the hardcover edition's price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book!!!!","review":"I loved this book so much that after I finished it I read it again (same with the second book).

I was interested in what would happen to her and I found all of her experiences to be unique and intriguing.I wanted more details about the relationship between the Marquise and Meliara - I felt confused by it., maybe that was done purposely, I have no idea why. Other than that, very enjoyable book which made us care about the colorful characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"LIQUID POETRY!!","review":"This book is AMAZING! Never have I read a book that FLOWED as smooth as this one!! Kuddos to Sherwood Smith on her novel.

The basis for the plot, the laws governing those with a fair amount of wood, are most intriguing. The characters are so realistic. This is the first book I have read from Smith (based on the fab. reviews) and it's definately not the last!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very entertaining story with strongly developed characters","review":"I've been a fan of Sherwood Smith for some time, and she just keeps getting better. The story of Meliara in several places really adds color and makes the book impossible to put down. It's a story full of magic, danger, romance and excitement to please even the daintiest of palates. If you read it, you'll be hard-pressed to wait for the next one in the series! Also, if you enjoyed this novel, you might try Wren's Quest, also by Sherwood Smith. It's a bit less developed, and obviously an earlier work, but just as entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall I really liked this book and the writer's style","review":"I really liked this book and the way in which it was written. I thought that the plot was well developed and that it had a very different air about it. I also thought that Meliara was an intriguing character and was well developed.This srory was a page turner and always kept you on your feet. This was one of my favorite books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great realism....for a fantasy novel","review":"It really interests me that people are writing about the wide diversity of characters. I think that this is very refreshing in a book.Everyone needs to try to remember that this is a fantasy book, however, Smith does an excellent job of insuring tons of reality throughout the story. Yes, people we least suspect may be the one at the front of the line. Like in here, Shevraeth regarding Meliara."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love THE CHARACTERS","review":"I must say, Duke Roger might have been mysterious, but the Marquise Shevraeth mayhaps be the sexiest male character I've yet to come across. So dark and mysterious, cultivated and witty, no one can cross him...well....maybe Meliara Astair.Meliara is the spunky, wild, teenage countess, a hell of a character to read. Thank goodness in the end she develops into a more reasonable person to deal with. Maybe it's just Shevraeth that makes her lash out the way she does, but it was very interesting to read about.Read this book, or you'll be missing out on this piece of entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"CROWN & COURT DUET - Fabulous Series","review":"The CROWN & COURT DUET are two books of which may be too difficult for adolescents, more for mature teenagers. Yes, there are some sexual tones in this book, but they are so subtle that they are sexier, and younger readers won't be offended of.Simple enough for young adults to fall in love with, advanced and sly enough for adults to cherish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow- Whatta book!","review":"This is one of the finest sci-fi/fantasy books I've read in recent memory. The story is intense and well paced, with characters who are so well rendered that they could be people I already know, or maybe people I wish I knew. I couldn't put it down. The author, Smith is a master of her art, and is destined for literary imortality.Philosophical, action-packed (the scene between Meliara and Vidanric in his room had me holding my breath!) and intriguing, this little gem of a novel is distinct and refreshing in a genre full of macho males with zinging one-liners. I'll definitley be ordering Smith's sequel novel, Court Duel."},{"rating":"2","title":"SHE was Stubborn, HE was Sexy","review":"This book was a wonderful story, tying the characters together in one way or another. I have to admit that the male characters were extremely...uh....appealing....sexy.The description of the gowns in the book were very detailed -- even those readers with no imagination should have no problem visualizing the beauty of the clothing, the hustle bustle of the environment, the atmosphere at the parties. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't want it to end, so I read slowly . . .","review":"I absolutely loved this book. The characters were so interesting and the story was just as compelling. I had no idea how the book would end and was totally surprised. My friend read it and recommended I read it - I've now told anyone I can think of to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An engaging book, hard to put down, very detail oriented","review":"I found this book engaging from the very beginning. The author puts you back in the past and into the shoes of the characters in the book. I wondered briefly if Meliara had certain feelings for Marquise, and he unto her. I would definately recommend this book to others, whether for a reading group or just for the pleasure of reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Differnt Level of Meanings in this complicated story","review":"This is one of the few books that I would read a second time immediately after finishing. It is rare to find contemporary fiction with the levels of meaning that Smith packs in this book. While the story is captivating on its own, one must pay close attention to the social critique being offered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensitive, complex, gentle,caring, worthwhile, evolving.....","review":"Crown Duel is a excellent high quality novel written by a great author. The book does a good job in painting a picture of a new fantasy world. The author does a fine work creating wonderful characters who seem stuck in an ever complex world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary story of courage of a Countess","review":"On the surface, you feel as though this whole book is going to be about politics (boring) and war, well..you're wrong. This book was more of a.....sly romance I would say. Countess is kidnapped by the bad guys, is dragged on horse back for days. Yeah there's war, but not as strong as the sly romance. One of the finest fantasy books I have ever read; I generally reread it every month or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"A TRADITIONAL FANTASY NOT TO BE MISSED","review":"God, I fell in love with these characters instantly. Meliara was constantly the haught countess who wants this and that with demand, Branaric was a quite little soul. And Shevraeth, HE is perhaps the most attractive male character in history! Okay, maybe not next to Rhett Butler, but around there. Crown Duel is great, you HAVE to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Believable characters and fast paced action","review":"Even though this book is supposedly aimed at a much younger age group (I'm in my mid-30's), I picked it up about a week ago and thoroughly enjoyed reading both it and its sequel, COURT DUEL. Sherwood Smith has the rare ability to write fully realized characters, flaws and all, and interesting action sequences. I wish more authors and screenwriters would acquire this talent. Usually, when I read a book written for this age group, I find myself skimming sections of description or dialogue. That didn't happen with either book. If you enjoy reading fast-paced action and characters who actually develop and grow over the course of a story, get both books. My mother, who is well into her 60's, also enjoyed them very much. I would recommend them for most age groups who enjoy fantasy and action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional fiction","review":"As much as I hate to jump on the bandwagon, I have to admit that this book was surprisingly original and very well written. Having read the jacket cover synopsis, I did not believe the story would be very compelling. In fact, I had put off reading this book for several years for that very reason. How very wrong I was. Like the best science fiction/fantasy writers, Smith strips away modern day biases by setting the story in a fictional future and examining a very human condition. The protagonist is identifiable and engaging, and the prose is brisk and entertaining. Smith has a well thought out agenda that is satisfying. Although I tend to prefer science fiction to fantasy, I would have to rate this book as one of the ten best of either genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than JUST A BOOK","review":"It blows my mind that this novel hasn't achieved the popularity and commonality it deserves. Although I have only finished the novel this morning, I intend to head directly to my former school to see that this book is used readings. The character development, complexity of the plot, and use (and seeming misuse) of faults and virtues of humanity ought to make this book a favorite. I will do my part to see that it is viewed as one."},{"rating":"2","title":"DESERVES MORE THAN 5 STARS","review":"This is such a good book, i really like how the charecters are so different from one another and so varied.if you like fantasy then get this book!I want to start reading the rest of the series so bad!

No mater what the other reviews say, GET THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This book was so bad that I actually keep it on the shelf so that I wont forget the author's name or the writing style. Nothing seemed coherent in this novel and the dialogue was awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Magical","review":"Wonderful! Absolutely amazing. I have read this story more than 5 times, without even feeling bored. There's something magical about this story and I assure you that it has- and will never- not lost it's magic. Of course, my favourite character is the one, the only, Vidanric (devious clean and cool headed Marquis) - mystery, eye brow raising, witty, charm... a wonderful combination for a young man.Pay close attention to what he does, what apprehents him, what excites him, where he looks, what little tid things he does, it'll give you the clues you need to solve his personal emotional situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book. It takes me to a place no other book can.","review":"This book is amazing. It is such a powerful story. everytime I read it I can see, almost feel, it happen.

I also read the next in the series and it is just as good!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Crown Duel is a rare jewel of a novel","review":"Crown Duel is a rare jewel of a novel -- the sort that only comes along every few years. Meliara's struggles become SOMEONE resonates perfectly with Vidanrics's desperate and baffled struggle for love. The echoes between the stories are subtle and deft, and the characters exemplify courage and grace under pressure. And isn't that why we all read fiction? Take the challenge. Buy Crown Duel."},{"rating":"2","title":"If only this woman could write a book a day!","review":"Wonderful! Excellent! Delightful! Magnificent! Darn-near perfect!

And read her other book \\"Court Duel.\\" And prepare to be blown away..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Hated This Girl","review":"Boy, did I hate this girl. The whole middle half of the book is about what an immature, whiny, thoughless, coarse child she is. There's a whole section of her fleeing where she CONTINUALLY gives up her location just to attempt to make a lame \\"gesture\\" against her pursuers. Towards the end of the pursuit, I was hoping she'd 'try to stick it to the Man' again and finally impale herself on a sword accidentally and DIE! She's like a textbook for doing everything *WRONG*.She also wallows in her educational ignorance and her desire not to grow up and take real responsibility.It's not until the epilogue that I have any good opinion of her and I'm getting the sequel solely to find out how things go for Shevraeth and Bran. Maybe, if things progress as they started in the Epilogue, I'll stop wishing she'd die a horrible death."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're really board.......","review":"This book was alright, it had a pretty cool story, but she spent all of the book bumbling around half dead, or stealing meat pies. This story line is really good but I don't think the author really pulled it out to its full potential. The heroine messed up so many times, it was a real drag. I felt like instead of a hero we had this insane flake. Well it isn't bad if you're super board, but wait till it comes out on paperback so it's cheaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Profoudly riveting writing style, in a tale for all time.","review":"Sherwood Smith's writing style is so wonderful, different and refreshing. Her descriptions are so vivid, I can see why this book is so popular! This book is definately different from all the other thousands of fantasy books out in print now, this is a wonder among all.This novel is honest, compelling and Countess Meliara the Countess is way ahead of her time, even though she just learned to write and writes horribly, she's a quicker learner and deep thinker with a complex mind; not to mention her confusion when it comes to the opposite sex.This has sparked me to dive headfirst into more fantasies by Sherwood Smith. I would really recommend this for summer vacation at the beach, or curled up in a storm."},{"rating":"2","title":"A main character with power, determination, and strength","review":"What kind of attitude should we hold to face the events in our lives. Meliara is a teenage girl with determination. She hold the steel wheel of her boat firmly while sailing on the turbulent sea of life. She knows where her port is. Nothing can beat her or change her direction.I applaud her for her great courage, and her captivator for having been able to handle her determination so well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heroine of the YEAR","review":"Meliara is such a new and fresh female to read about. We meet Meliara at the beginning of this tale as a teenage Countess who doesn't know how to act proper (because her father didn't want her to reach the same fate as her late mother did). Meliara knows very little of embroidery, dancing, and flirting with flirts, but has more knowledge in handling swords and reading long old scriptures. I can't wait to see how Meliara develops as a teenager into a young lady. If you have not read this book, but you decide you're going to, you're in for a real treat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A FUN RIDE INTO THE MEDIEVAL LIFE","review":"Crown Duel 's title character, Meliara, is a haughty countess with a mind of her own. Her late father made her promise to keep the land of Tlanth in their hands.Unfortunately, the land is highly prized and a war goes on to claim it. There, Meliara meets the Marquise of Shevraeth, one cool headed young man with queer ways, which becomes her enemy.There are also many other fun characters, which makes for a fun ride. Very enchanting and romantic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good as far as it goes","review":"I'm writing this with Amazon saying the book is out of print. But I do have a copy sitting at home. This is a very nice piece of work. There is a lot of detail in every aspect of the series. From uniforms of the First Family to the flags of the different Iron Masters.The book is full color on gloss pages. The artwork is of very high quality and I found it great for helping me to understnad some of the scenes from the books. For example we know the land is red tinged now. But can you really picture that. I didn't until I saw a picture of some of the Amtrak Federation soldiers in the red camo uniforms.Unfortunately it only covers the first three books. That's when it was published and a follow up volume or an updated one would have been nice. So I guess the demand for the new volume wasn't there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not touch this one with a barge pole","review":"Sound from this unit is fair...nothing to call home about.

The story did not disappoint. Ron Shade's a believable hero. A man's man. He solves the death of the illegal with good pacing and plenty of action. Never a dull moment. Enjoyed the kickboxing. Interesting characters. I'll pick up the next Ron Shade when it comes out. Good writing. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great First Novel","review":"\\"A Killing Frost\\" is a fun read. If you don't want anything to heavy and are into the Robert B. Parker style of gumshoe, you will definitely enjoy Michael Blacks' introdcution to Ron Shade, detective and martial artist.The story, like all good detective novels, is written in the first person. Ron Shade is a former SWAT team member and martial artist, currently attempting to win the world heavyweight kickboxing title. The story is simple and fairly straight forward (Really just a missing person case) and therefore highly believable. Black's understanding of police procedure and his in depth knowledge of the feelings that a fighter has while he trains are very entertaining. There is a nice romance underlying the main story that keeps the reader caring about the characters. Also, the descriptions of Chicago and the surrounding suburbs are right on the nut.This book was definitely worth the money spent. Hopefully we haven't seen the last of Michael Black."},{"rating":"2","title":"The stage doesn't get any better than this!!!","review":"E.B.'s Performance Is so great. It takes you into the world that he has created without you even knowing it. You can just listen and be entertained, or take it a little deeper and explore it to new levels. I can't say enough about this video. I have both the Video and the audio cassette. I would Love to see it re-released on CD. It would do it honors."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is as funny as any I have ever read.","review":"When I bought this book my intention was to casually read some of it on the subway ride home. I could not put it down.\\"Dumb, Dumber and Dumbest\\" is a \\"laugh out loud\\", drop dead funny book that left me in tears. What is most amazing is the breadth of material which the authors draw upon going to every corner of the globe to find truly exotic stupidity that no one could make up. It only gets 4 stars because it wasn't long enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best so far","review":"This book has by far the best story line of all the books i have read so far. It might not be the same for most but i can bet that the majority who reads this classic alien story will absolutely love it and look upon the writer and story in awe and wonder. An excellent read with great written action sequences accompanied by good character use. I am not giving away any of the story and will only tell you that this book will surely get you expecting the unexpected. Read it if you will!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good enough, following the same conspiracy genre as usual.","review":"On the space station the Innominata, ilegal experiments are being carried out; with humans as the subject. The breeding of Xenomorphs is taking place, and unsuspescting marines are disappearing as a result of this. Eventually one marine, Anthony Crespi is sent into a manufactured labrynth of aliens with only his wits to assist him.I thought this, although similar to the usual conspiracy idea was an exellant book, the crisp art making it an even greater enjoyment to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Piece of [junk]","review":"After reading this book, I thought it was the worst Aliens novel ever written. From beggining to end it was boring. There was one pretty disgusting part in the book which made it a little more interesting, but for the most part I would not recommend this book to anyone. Oh and the ending is sooo bad. I just wanted to burn it after I finished. I highly recommend overlooking this book. If you want a good Aliens novel to read, try out Aliens: Rogue. Trust me, you won't be happy with your wasted time spent reading Aliens: Labrinth.\\"DON'T READ IT\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Schlock falls off","review":"Previous reviewer makes an excellent point: the aliens have got boring because they are nothing but schlock machines, the plots nothing but grunge-generation. Once shock and disgust wears off, nothing is really left. By contrast, Larry Niven's \\"The Man-Kzin Wars\\" have aliens - intelligent tiger-like creatures, who have a taste for human flesh but are much more than grunge-generators. They can actually interact with humans, think, and have complex characters of their own. The result is something a good deal more lastingly interesting. A Man-Kzin story, with Kzin characters like Scarface, Chuut-Riit, Traat-Admiral, the Vaughn Tiger and the Gutting Claw's Telepath, is a story you can go back to (also the science is better and the humans are a lot more interesting, too). Nobody wants to read an \\"Aliens\\" more than once unless they are a really dumb sicko."},{"rating":"2","title":"Searcher for Truth in Tacoma","review":"This morning in front of a warm fire on the first day of 2003 while rain pelted down outside, I read this book from cover to cover. Professor Geering has given us a page-turner as he step-by-step builds his case for why Christianity must take leave of God in order to be suitable for the global age we are entering. With just enough explanation for the average lay person he describes the progression from the belief in a personal, all-powerful God to the need for humans to take leave of that God so they can take full responsibility for their lives. In showing how Christianity has been changing through the ages to arrive at this point, Geering references many theologians. One I would especially like to read more about is Ludwig Feuerbach who is quoted as saying, \\"The real essence of Christianity.. is not that Jesus became God but that God became human.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value for price","review":"Another reviewer said this is the same as what's made for humans. Well, not quite. it's not a powder like I've bought before but more like fine flaky snow and it is a lot cheaper. Since it's 100% MSM I wasn't concerned. But just a note that it has a bitter taste so if you're a human considering taking this you might want to put it in juice or some other flavored liquid (though not hot). Since I'm taking it with some awful tasting enzymes and DE - those hide the taste pretty well."},{"rating":"2","title":"MSM","review":"If you take MSM, this is best way to buy it. I ordered it, they shipped it. No problemo. Same stuff you buy in capsules but way cheaper. The only thing I would suggest is to have another container to store it in, like tupperware or something like that.

Clark Terry's flugal sounds muted all the time like it has a rag in it. The overall mix is terrible -- you can barely hear the horns when they are playing together. When a soloist begins, it takes a while before they turn up the microphone. Definitely not of the quality of some of my other favorite DVD's --- Diana Krall live in Paris or Count Basie & Diane Shure.

Some were scratched so deeply that you could feel the groove of the scratch. Others had a ridge like effect at the base. I'm not a glass expert, but I would guess that that would happen by getting left in the mold a little too long or maybe not quite long enough. There were also some small air bubbles, but that was more acceptable to me than the scratches and the ridges. This product did not look like it was first quality.

ALL intelligence agencies use cults and 'religions' as cover, as an espionage device, and as weapons. They use magical belief systems because a true believer is easy to manipulate. They also employee magicians for various reasons, but one use was to teach the production of 'miracles', e.g. Jim Jones, to convince followers of a leader's powers, and modern technology is making that task easier. The Manson debacle was just one of the finales for the CIA's 'OPERATION CHAOS', their very successful attempt to subvert the radical left-wing youth movement, and what they perceived to be the unseen hand of a foreign power.If you really want to blow your mind, Google: 'The Seven Degrees of Charles Milles Manson', and you'll see the effects of this branch of OPERATION CHAOS.I cannot wait to get my hands on this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Shadow over Santa Susana","review":"Great book about a interesting case.

She should get back together with B.E.P. and start to make the music she sounds good doing. In her first ever solo album, she has made herself sound terrible.First off, most of the songs on the album aren't even sung very well. Her voice isn't made for belting out the high notes like a Christina Agulara or Miriah Carrie. She just can't pull it off. Also, most of the songs are about completely nothing. They are a bunch of girly pop fluff songs with no deep insightful meaning to them at all. Don't get me wrong, I liked a few of them, but it's just not my style.I think if she ever does another solo album, which is most likely a garuntee because of the success of the first one, she should write songs from her heart, not songs like Fergalicious and Glamourous. Give us someting with true feeling and not some cheesey pop stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creativity Sucking Vampire","review":"For anyone who has heard Fergie's single, London Bridge...you may be interested in knowing that she \\"emulates\\" the style of an underground hip hoptress M.I.A. -who hails from London coincidentally. Is this style snatching the highest form of flattery? When I heard London Bridge it made me sick...At any rate, I highly recommend that you give credit to where credit is due and give M.I.A. a listen. You may have heard her song, Galang...but the rest of her cd is worthy of your attention as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"For me it wasn't that good.","review":"I remember when this album came out, Fergie was practically the biggest pop star for a while. I never was a huge of the black eyed peas. The overplay their crap way too much. So when Fergie came out as a solo act,and I wasn't execpting her to be huge. Boy was I wrong. There were several hit singles, and Fergie seemed like she was everywhere(as far as music goes...). I mean let's face it,she can sing, She's hot, and she had good producers for this album. I thought Fergilicous was awful! London Brdige wasn't too bad, but got really old after a while. Clumsy had to be my favorite track because it has great beats, and her voice doesn't annoy me. Big Girls Don't Cry seemed as if it were missing something. Like it needed an extra kick to it, if it did then it would have been as good as Irreplaceble by Beyonce for me. The beginning of Glamourous was funny,but the song sucked. Overall, if you like hiphop pop then you should buy this cd, if not then dont waste your money or time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shes Fergalicious","review":"Fergie's album was good. It was quite different from what I expected, but I liked it. She had some quality beats and she switched up her styles a bit. She sampled from all aspects of her career, which is what made her album interesting. She also had nice lyrics and good deliveries. My favorite style on the album is her singing though. She has really nice vocals and its what Im used to most b/c she sings with the Black Eyed Peas. Overall, Id say if you like BEP and your looking for something different, check out the album.

Ok some of the songs get stuck in your head, I am not saying that's a good thing but to me the only song from The Dutchess that has depth is Big Girls Don't Cry. Fergie is one of those artist you just don't take seriously, her songs drip with silliness like Fergalicious and Glamourous. She does have a decent voice but the songwriting is messy and seems awkward on many verses. Songs like Finally, Here I Come, and London Bridge are fun to listen to but this album isn't gonna be a legendary album in the next 20 or even 10 years. Fergie is nice to look at but her music won't hold up, but hell anything is better than that Black Eyed Peas, easily one of the worst groups ever!

The Final Third of the album has some soulful ballads..My only disappointment is the sond GLAMOROUS , I am totally confused if you have heard the remix to GWEN STEFANI'S LUXURIOUS it has the same exact Rap provided by LUDACRIS other than that FERGIE DELIVERS."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love this album but...","review":"never thought i would say this but i wish i had gotten the \\"dirty version\\"insteadsome of the songs dont sound rightespecially glamoroustake your broke broke home instead of broke a++ homeit did sound wrongi normally dont mind clean versionsthis time i didi may get the dirty version just to hear it in its original contextoverall its a great cd"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD and kid friendly version","review":"This is a great CD.

Fergalicious, a disappointing start for Fergie","review":"Fergie has great pipes, it is a shame they were wasted on this album.

I expected better.Advice: Don't waste your money...buy the singles!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fergie's first album EXPLODES on the music scene - and right into the dumpster","review":"I really wanted this CD cuz I love Fergie's singles. So I bought it. I listened to it. I hated half the tracks. Then slowly, i started hating all of them except her singles. So really it's not worth buying the album, you might as well download the singles. She has talent, but her voice sounds bad in every song except the singles! I give it 2 stars, one cuz she has talent and one cuz the singles are good. That's it. On the upside, the CD makes a GREAT frisbee for my dog :]don't buy this - save urself 18 dollars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Guilty Pleasure","review":"Fergie could have been just some great eye candy and no substance artist, but she is far from getting that label.If you are the person who turns your nose up at tracks like Fergalicious and London Bridge then you don't deserve this outstanding album. This album is solid from top to bottom, and beginning to end.First, Fergie really can sing. She moves from rap to ballards with a smooth ease that makes we want to see what she does next. Second, Ms. Stacy Ferguson doesn't lip sync when on TV shows, and the confidence she has in her voice is displayed in the album. Finally, in my opinion this is the MUST HAVE pop record for 2006/2007."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointing....","review":"Perhaps I was expecting too much, but after listening through this CD a couple times I was a little disppointed.

I don't know what point she is trying to get across in all the other stuff that she is rapping and yelling about but I think if she would do more singing instead of yelling, the cd would be 5 stars. the make up song proves that she has a voice. I absolutely hate that she gets more credit for \\"london bridge\\"! It just goes to show what kind of listeners we have in this day and age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ferga-nasty!","review":"We all thought that Gwen Stefani was the queen at making aneurysm-inducing music, but let me tell you something...there is a new queen (or maybe Dutchess) in town and her name is Fergie.

Please stop the insanity!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"since britney...Fergie is the new Scorge of the musical world!","review":"Meet the new scorge of the musical world. Crappy music that is.

I absolutely LOVE that song, \\"Big Girl's Don't Cry\\".. That is my FAVORITE song and I know I will love it for years to come (if they don't play it out on the radio). I saw a tribute to someone with it playing in the background on youtube.com---and was shocked to see it was Fergie--so I thought perhaps this CD might be worth something--purchased it & was EXTREMELY disappointed.I had to give it one star-- although \\"Big Girl's Don't Cry\\" is AMAZING... it doesn't make up for her other songs or the juvenile lyrics (she is freakin 31 and my 12 yr old nephew could write more sophisticated lyrics!)..Download the one or two songs you like and don't waste your money on the rest of this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"this album","review":"i didn't buy it but i've heard most of the songs and she comes off really conceited on this album. i wouldn't buy it"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a @#$%#","review":"How ANYONE can listen to this stuff is beyond me.

She is a dynamic performer and I recommend this cd to all."},{"rating":"1","title":"The rise and fall of Western Civilization","review":"There's not much I can say about this woman and her album, seeing as how it is probably the most appalling excuse for \\"music\\" this writer has ever heard. This woman is an example of what many people have been saying about the music industry for years - cheap, shallow, brainless and soulless, designed to appeal to the lowest common denominator.This woman's \\"music\\" is the penultimate example of this. Nasty, atonal, idiotic, appealing to brain dead adolescents and \\"Tweens\\". Anyone who buys/listens to this music should be very ashamed of themselves. America was once the greatest country in the World but no more, and the presence of this woman and her popularity is one of the final nails in the coffin on American and Western Civilization. Have fun wasting your time listening to this horror while the East is ascendant. Goodbye American Empire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fergie - the Dutchess","review":"the cd was in excellent condition but the music sucked.....i threw it awaytrashy language & boring"},{"rating":"1","title":"what the....?","review":"To start off, her lyrics are terrible. Going beyond that is the trashiness of her songs and her videos. What is going on with the music industry these days? Is excessive plastic surgery all you need to make it? What about actual TALENT??By the way, what the heck is wrong with her face??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!!!!!!","review":"Disappointing!!!!!!I wonder if Fergie has any say in if a re-release of her 1st debut album is necessary or not. She probably does, i mean she isn't recording new songs for her health. Anyways artist these days really ruin things with their re-releases. It is such a double dip effort. She could have just released the 4 songs as an EP or recorded a whole new album. It has been 2 years since the Dutchess was released so maybe it was time 4 a new album. I am so disappointed by this. The funny thing is i don't know 1 person who owns the Fergie CD. So was it that big of a success in terms of album sales that it garners a re-release with extra tracks? Most likely not and if that's the case why not just release a new album. Only get this if you haven't already picked up the 1st release.I can't believe Beyonce & Justin did this as well. Only Mariah's re-release was worth it because it came with a DVD. Don't re-release unless your gonna offer something spectacular."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fergie-Ferg","review":"This album killed the Pop and Hot 100 Billboard charts, but what did you expect? I think the production on this great, and her lyrics are out of the norm. My favorite track on the entire album is \\"London Bridge\\". She totally does the unexpected, her lyrics being the opposite of what you would typically expect from a 'pop' artist. I recommend this album to all Black Eyed Peas fans; however if you don't like that group, you most likely won't like this album.---Pryncez"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Stars","review":"Might as well throw 16 bucks into a dumpster. A dozen or so tracks featuring a 31-year old singer talking about how good-looking she is. And, oh yeah like we don't get the double-meaning with the title of the CD and the lyrics to the opening track \\"London Bridge.\\" Even Britney Spears has more taste than that, and the sad thing is that Paris put more emotion into her CD than there is on this one. Fergie is just cashing in on the popularity of the talented Black Eyed Peas. Difference is that the Black Eyed Peas have a clearly defined sound and it all flows like colors on a canvas. All the colors on this record run together and form one - a greenish brown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I thought that London Bridge and Fergilicious were fun little tunes, so I decided to check out the entire CD. I really wanted to like this, but I couldn't do it. Fergie has a lovely voice and is a lovely lady, but 90% of the songs on this CD were awful to the point that I couldn't listen to them all the way through even once. And what is up with the need to spell everything ad nauseum? I kept the 2 songs that I liked originally - not that they are masterpieces of any consequence, but because they are fun and catchy - and relieved myself of the rest of the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"This cd sort of sucks. I bought it on a whim and probably shouldn't have. I don't know what I was expecting, but it wasn't this.I'm not really a fan of hers, so maybe this cd is great for her and I just wouldn't know it. Perhaps only purchase this if you are already a fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a surprise...","review":"Okay, so I admit to being a bit naive when it comes to buying music. I saw the explicit lyrics warning but couldn't figure out why it was there, I'd heard the CD and it seemed okay to me. I looked through all the reviews, no one said there was a \\"clean\\" version. Well, now I have a CD that I can't really listen to with kids around and will probably have to list it on eBay to get rid of it.When there are 2 versions of a CD (explicit vs. clean) it should be listed somewhere that there are 2. I like the CD. The music is upbeat and Fergie has a terrific voice but unless I'm by myself there is no way I can play this with a carfull of kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"I'll give props where props is due. I certainly wasn't a fan of London Bridges and it wasn't until Fergalicious and Glamorous that I decided to give the CD a go. And surprisingly I found this CD highly entertaining and allows my morning workouts to be less arduous. Still LB, IMHO, was a mistake to be a first single release-which is why I think it took so long for this CD to reach platinum status. Overall, I don't think you will be disappointed with this purchase, however, I think her true muse is with BEP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why can't I put a rating of 0?","review":"Seriously, I don't know what I was even doing touching the case in the first place. My friend played it for me and made me suffer through it. Good thing I didn't hear it all. Seriously now, this has to be the worst album ever! It sounds like a 14 year old singing really high and playing with her keyboard. LONDON BRIDGE? Gwen ripoff! FERGALICIOUS? Fergalicious should be a word to describe something that tastes bad. So if you're a retard, buy this album. If you are not, the buy Gwen Stefani's new CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Fergie...","review":"I liked her when I thought that she mixed cheesy tongue in cheek phrases and purposely over the top statements about how sexy she is just for a laugh, while mixing it with fun and entertainment. But then, the more i listen to her music and the more that i read her interviews, she's damn right serious. Fergie is beyond self-centered, narcissistic, and cocky. I don't know where all that comes from, there's absolutely nothing attractive about Fergie physically (she looks like a dragqueen, seriously), and even though her music can be fun at times, its downright annoying and she's not sexy by being so dirty with her lyrics. I'm all for dirty lyrics, mind you, its just that they aren't good dirty lyrics, just silly and pointless."},{"rating":"1","title":"She is such a Gwen-a-be","review":"How does Fergie keep changing her voice? The person who sang on \\"Shut Up\\" with the Black Eyed Peas could not possibly be the person vocalizing on \\"Fergilicious.\\" Her music is horrible, lacks originality, and sounds as if she is trying to hop on the Gwen Stefani train. Fergie, you will never be as good as Gwen. (And that is saying a lot, because I think Gwen's solo album stinks, too.) Please, Fergie, stop! You're horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"The quality is evident","review":"I've always felt that you can tell the quality of the music by how little the singer is wearing on the cover of the album. Fergie has shown her obvious talents with the black eyed peas by wearing midriff bearing tops and inserting \\"yo's\\" into the songs. If the first single is any indication of the rest of the album then we're in for a real treat. She has taken a very old and not very popular children's rhyme (very clever as she won't have to pay residuals as it is public domain) and repeats \\"london bridge\\" about 8,000 times. Well done Fergie! You've got crazy mad talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fergie - The Dutchess CD","review":"Other than the single \\"Big Girls Don't Cry\\" the CD was a bit of a letdown.

I'd suggest buying just the known songs, the other songs sound like filler for space. She is a great performer but I don't think she is a good song writer. She is beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way off the mark","review":"Songs 3 & 13 only good songs on this whole cd. Rest of Cd is worth forgetting. She should record love ballads & some smooth jazz songs on her next cd if she records a new anytime soon. George"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah...not so much","review":"While I feel that Fergie has some real vocal talent, I'm not digging this album. I bought it hoping for an up-beat, workout type album, but I was sadly disappointed. I like the reggae-type beat of Mary Jane Shoes,the fun beat of Fergalicious, and the realness of Losing My Ground and Finally. In the end, though, I can't help but shake the idea Fergie thinks she's a little hotter than she really is."},{"rating":"2","title":"schizophrenic","review":"Most tracks are good, some great, but it goes from pop to jazz, to rock to rap...she pulls it all off well and I'm glad I bought the album, but the first time I listened to the whole thing I wasn't sure how I felt about it because I was so confused!I recommend it, but I wish they'd made a more consistent album by picking ONE idea to weave into it instead of six."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess I don't \\"get\\" Fergie","review":"I'm constantly amazed at the kind of garbage that will top the pop charts. I'm well aware of the fact that not every album need be political or some sort of self-revelation (although it would be nice if people only made albums when they had something actually worth saying). But let's not pretend that Fergie is trying to \\"establish herself as an artist\\". If she's just making music to have fun, fine. But putting out a CD doesn't make you an \\"artist\\" (Exhibit 1: William Hung, the tone deaf guy from American Idol). If anything, she's a performer, but what she's performing, I'm not quite sure. And I'm certainly not buying.

A work that they couldn't match with anything in their boring lives.Yes, you can find something \\"wrong\\" in any work of art or science.

Percy B. Shelley's critique of the book, published after he died, was interesting. I liked the Criticisms in the back of the book. Most of all, I loved the Being Frankenstein created. This is the saddest, most thought provoking, book I've read in recent times (even though it's old)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic in tragic horror","review":"I have a fetish for classic novels and have read just about everything from Pride and Prejudice to The Three Musketeers to Brom Stoker's Dracula, so naturally when I found a copy of Frankenstein at Barnes and Noble I bought it and was not disapointed. Written in that wonderfully poetic and intelectual style of the old masters of liturature it is a tale of Ambition, forbidden practices, horror, madness, anguish, and retribution. If you are the kind of person who expects a classic horror film type story full of gore and violence then you will be in for a disapointment. The real focus of the story is within the mind of good Doctor Frankenstien himself (who was actually quite young) and the monster he created. Also, if you only like happy endings, this book is not for you. If not, this is a great book only dampened by the fact that it is not longer. Fans of Dracula will love this story and thank God for the 'Little Ice Age' that brought this book into being."},{"rating":"2","title":"Before you write a _review_...","review":"I'd just like to respond to the fellow from Minnesota who submitted a response.

Completely different than RP's earlier albums such as \\"EP's of RP\\" or \\"Cacophony.\\" It's slower and much heavier than their previous works. I'd say an average of 12 words repeated in each song (not the most profound lyrics)If you have taken a listen to the sound previews, pretty much all the songs sound the same... and they are pretty much are. Also, none of Blinko's amazing artwork will be coming with the lyrics booklet. Just white lyrics written on a black page. But hey, RP's a little bit older, little bit more tamed.

Not a bad song on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Amazing","review":"This Cd is one of the best CD's i've ever heard. the lyrics are related to life, and the vocals are fantastic. if you are a fan of live, i strongly reccomend you buy this CD. it is well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saving the 1990's","review":"My criteria for buying a disc is that at least half of the songs on it must be good. Needless to say throughout the 90's I haven't bought many discs. This decade has broght us a plethora of heartless, non melodic, soul draining trash with little to no musical integrity. It has also seen the decline of bands that are actually a compilation of good musicians( Dave Mathews Band notwithstanding). Then I bought \\"Throwing Copper\\" A solid disc from start to finish.\\" I Alone\\" has tremendous power without sacrificing the melodies, but I could say that for every song on this disc. Although \\"Lightening Crashes\\" is overplayed, it is still a fantastic song. The music is good, the musicianship is excellent and the overall product is fantastic. A refreshing gem in a decade of sludge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome music","review":"As solid a CD as I've ever heard. Throw away two duds on this 13+1 song CD and you've got probably one of the top 10 CDs ever produced. Selling the Drama, I Alone, Iris, Lightning Crashes, All Over You, White Discussion...when have you heard this many GREAT songs on one CD before (greatest hits albums don't count)? Kowalczyk's vocals are perfect, shifting from harsh to somber to passioned, not only from song to song, but sometimes in the same song. The perscussion and bass are well done, driving when they need to be and subtle during the quieter moments. The guitar work is excellent, too. The album has a touch of profanity (primarily in the two dud songs) that might bother some listeners...but if you can get by that, you will simply be amazed at what Live has done on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Throwing LIVE!!","review":"This album was one of my favorites back in the 90's.This band was different from Pearl Jam or SoundGarden.They had their own sound, they were more alternative rock than grunge.But like most 90's rock groups where are they today I don't know.I rate this CD a 5 of 5 stars!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An alternative foundation for Rock and Roll.","review":"If there is only one alternative band that has the intelligence to be called sound-experts, Live has to be the band. I alone will thrill you, Selling The Drama will make you think, Lightning Crashes will embrace your inner rage while Pilar of Davidson leaves you to the sound Gods!"},{"rating":"2","title":"why don't they play the good stuff??","review":"well, after hearing the popular songs on the radio,(Lightning Crashes, I Alone etc.), I didn't give this group much other thought. After hearing Throwing Copper at my friend's house the other day, I found that the other songs are simply wonderful! Iris, Top and Shit Towne should have been the radio singles! These are the tracks that I think define Live's sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly my favorite CD","review":"What else can I say? The emotionally potent instumental style and the wrenching intensity of the vocals easily overcome any weakness in the lyrical content. This is one album you will listen to again and again. I can't recommend it enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"Throwing Copper is the best album ever written, by anyone. There's not a single track that isn't fantastic. Kowalcyk's melodies are amazing, and his lyrics are deep and meaningful, but not too preachy. Songs range from the slow and thoughtful \\"Pillars of Davidson\\", to the hard, fast paced \\"Stage\\". And of course this albums delivers classics like \\"Lightning Crashes\\", \\"I Alone\\", \\"Selling The Drama\\", and \\"All Over You\\". A must have for any music fan"},{"rating":"2","title":"OH WOW","review":"Live is the best band of the 20th and (hopefully)21st Centuary. And Throwing Copper is my favorite of their albums. Not only does Ed's voice melt your heart or rock your seat but their musical talent is awsome. This album is a balance between Music and voice. \\"Selling the Drama\\" is testement to that as every Live fan will sing it to you by starting with \\"duw-na-nuw-na-na and to love...\\" the music sticks in your head. all i can say is OH WOW."},{"rating":"2","title":"live's best","review":"This is their best album. This has to go down as one of the best album's of all time. I alone makes me go crazy."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you are reading this...","review":"If you are reading this, then I'm sure that you are going to purchase this album. I don't disagree with the praise that many other reviewers have bestowed upon, in my opinion, the greatest hard rock album of the 90s. This music is real and true, bittersweet and aggressive without being intimidating, and contains songs of everyday experience, as well as spiritual expansion. Ed Kowalczyk and Live are extremely intelligent people and amazing, although it is not untrue that they basically expended all of their musical prowess on this one album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their Greatest Album","review":"I bought this album after hearing Lightning Crashes and I Alone hundreds of times over the radio for two years. Why buy the album then? Because I wanted to see if I liked their other songs as much as those two. As it turned out, I recognized several other tracks. And, I liked the unfamiliar ones too. This album definitely has an attitude, which I like in Rock. There's plenty of hard-driving pieces as well as soft, ominous beats. This still remains one of my favorite CDs in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"mesmerizing album! you must buy this cd!","review":"Live's new ''Throwing Copper'' is an album you don't want to miss.Live's Ed Kowalczyk sings unlike another other singer, to get you singing these songs all day any day no matter what mood you are in.Other than the obvious great songs on the album played on the radio/Mtv, i think all the songs on the album are great.5 of my fovorite songs ever are on this album, and the other songs on it are just about up there.Kowalczyk's mesmerizing voice will make you cry.This is no doubt my favorite album, i suggest that you buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fine Album...","review":"Not to be overlooked. BUT, whatever possessed Live NOT to have Hold Me Up included I will never understand. This awesome, missing track could have carried it all on its own."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY VERY AWESOME","review":"For any of you who have never heard this cd, i suggest you either borrow a friends or get it yourself. This cd is one of the best i've ever heard. For example, i bought a couple of weeks ago because i finally figured out who played the song i had been hearing. Then when i listened to the whole cd i found that i had heard most of the songs before and loved them. The others were just as awesome too. Lightening Crashes is still one of my favorite songs ever, and if you have never read the words you will probably be surprised. Really. The only thing about this cd that can kind of get on your nerves is the fact all their lyrics are kind of depressing, but that in itself isnt bad. Their music definitly makes it worthwhile. Its great. You'll like it. I guarantee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live at it's best.","review":"I love this CD. It is Live at it's best, and I can't get enough of it. Even after listening to so, so, SO many times it still sounds great. Anybody who likes alternitive rock needs to buy it. It is well worth the money. The best songs are \\"I Alone\\" and \\"Lightning Crashes\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too overrated","review":"Live used to be one of my favorite bands, and then I REALLY listened to them. \\"Throwing Copper\\" is not the great album everyone says it is. First of all, not only do most of the songs painfully drag on (Pillar of Davidson and White, Discussion are both over 6 minutes of torture!) but most of the songs sound nearly the same. Live has publicly discussed the fact that they are rather unschooled musicians, and it shows. Live has said in interviews that they just learned their instruments by the seat of their pants. If you are a person that has any ear for the technical aspects of music at all, you will realize that this album sounds almost like one big, giagantic song. I think this album does not live up to the hype at all. And what was so great about the song \\"Lightning Crashes?\\" That song is 3 chords repeated over and over for five minutes! You call that genius? I think not! Check out their first album, \\"Mental Jewelry\\" It's SO much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"phony & pretentious","review":"I agree with the other negative reviewer here that \\"Throwing Copper\\" is full of \\"fake emotion.\\" I used to like this CD, especially of course \\"Lightning Crashes,\\" but the pretentious melodrama in every song makes some of them almost unbearable. There is also an unfortunate tendency for the signal to blur into what could be aptly termed white noise, especially on the opening track, at the most \\"dramatic\\" and \\"emotional\\" moments. In fact, the sound isn't that good, period (just listen to \\"White, Discussion\\" - ugh), and combined with the irritating vocals, there's nothing to recommend this album for any serious music fan, even \\"Lightning Crashes.\\" BTW, the mediocrity of that song is exposed when you hear a live version of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too bad but doesn't catch my fancy","review":"I got this CD for Christmas one year and I thought it was a damn good one. But when I started buying heavier albums from other groups I lost interest in it. It's not a bad album but it's not something I would listen to a million times since I like a lot of the heavier metal. The reason why i don't like it that much is because compared to all my other thrash and death metal albums I have it softens it. It just doesn't cater to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uggh!","review":"I bought this album after liking the singles\\"iris\\" and \\"lightning crashes.\\" Talk about misleading. They are the only good cuts. Don't pay full price for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"short and simple","review":"This album is not worth buying compared to any other albums that were made near the same time. it has 2 good songs lighting strikes and selling the drama. Definatly do not buy, pick up some pearl jam or even candlebox, just basically anything is better. should actully be 1 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Enjoyable Album","review":"There are some great songs on this album. Only complaint is that the lead singer continually verges on pretentious whining. The lyrics aren't particularly impressive, some of which are nonsensical. But I've consistently enjoyed this album since first purchasing it over 10 years ago, definitely worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"JUST READ THIS. THEN GO BUY IT!","review":"I just love those CD's where you can listen to the whole thing without worrying about a song you won't like."},{"rating":"2","title":"aLIVE and kicking","review":"This album has got to be the blast from the past as a young girl with purple hair and tartan tights worried if she will get in to the over 18's concert. Certainly an album to treasure and most recently resolve arguments over. LIVE have done so well and deserve better british credit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"90's alt-rock at its best.","review":"Even though many of their albums are good, I'm sure everyone can agree this is the best. It's the album that put them up there with the other top acts of the mid-90's. This includes the hits \\"Selling The Drama\\", \\"I Alone\\", \\"All Over You\\", and the huge \\"Lightning Crashes\\". But the best thing is that every non-single is just as good. \\"Top\\", \\"T.B.D.\\", and \\"Waitress\\" are all amazing as well. I actually think my favorite song, that some dislike, is the hidden track called \\"Horse\\". That song is excellent, and I always look forward to the end of the album because of it. I can't comment on the bonus tracks, because I have the original copy of this cd. Overall just a great disc, and probably just as good as their eventual \\"Greatest Hits\\" will be."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Live Album By A Mile","review":"If Live had of kept up with this style they would be one of the greatest rock bands ever. Instead they went stupid and are now no more than Limp Bizkit tryhards. The Distance To Here is good but this is their best easily. Go out and get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No other like it","review":"This is not the kind of CD where you buy it & only listen to one song. This is the kind where you buy it for \\"Lightning Crashes\\" then you realize you really like \\"Stage\\" and then you realize you like \\"All Over You.\\" Your favorite song on this CD changes all the time...because all the songs are so good...how many other CD's can you say that of?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed So Far","review":"Extremely disappointed with this purchase so far. I bought it for my son's first birthday party. Set up in the backyard, it looks great. Watching toddlers play on it, shows its flaws. The bottom base is extremely flimsy. The upper platform is just as flimsy. No more than two toddlers should be on top or else the platform will bow. I realize it is a plastic playset. I just expected it to be stronger than it is. The directions were a bit confusing at times. Please note that Step 20 calls for bolt KK. This bolt is not long enough and you will have to go to a home improvement store and buy a longer one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy - Defective Rope Ladder","review":"Bought this swingset a few years back. While my kids have fun on it, one has to be very careful. The rope ladder is not made to withstand weather. Every year I have to replace the ladder, as it seems to break where the ropes slide through the wood. This creates an unsafe condition, as any children climbing can be hurt. This will also result in you having to spend $60 every year for a new rope ladder. This is not a part that one can easily take off and store away. When reported this defective condition to Little Tikes, they did not care as the rope ladder is not warrantied. My advice to all is to stay away from this product and buy one that will last more than one year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent quality","review":"While the directions were a bit challenging to follow (suggestion-have a consumer, not the tech geek, write them), the playset was assembled in a relatively short time.

The selections on the CD are few in number and shallow in depth. One would have thought that with four very long days of music to choose from, they could have come up with more tracks and better choices. The DVD has better music and as a bonus you get to sit right in front of these great musicians as they play and get a real feel for the wonderful personalities behind the music. Better yet....make the pilgrimage to Telluride and endure the hail and rain and brutal sun. It's worth it every year!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong item","review":"This item was for rotary tool.

This is not what is seems...","review":"Unfortunately the DVD although seemingly filled with information is a tool for a self proclaimed evangelic. The information is not very interesting, is not very accurate and a lot of the footage is simply still photos. I am sorry I bought the DVD, it was not what I thought it would be. I was looking for information concerning the Ark of the Covenant. Instead what I received was a man giving a lecture about his work as an archeologist. But no real footage.

I wanted to learn about the many religions in our country and neighborhoods, hoping for a montage of videos and dialouges of cultures, places and people. Instead, the 4 disc DVD is primarily a lecture from one man in front of a chalk board, outling aspects of each religion. That was dissapointing enough. Another dissapointment, was that the Adventist Mission had motives to build bridges, and that was to convert the very peoples of other religions! It was my mistake to purchase this product produced from the Adventist Mission.org. I'll search better in the future.

But, it needs some re-writing to be more readable. The first chapter in particular is poorly done. Chapters 2-4 are better, and again 5 is poorly done. The authors attempt to explain the role of gender during the 1990 gubernatorial elections in Texas. At many times, they sound just as confused as the elections were that year. Their general conclusion is that Ann Richards won because Claytie lost! That is probably an accurate conclusion, but their material that attempts to show the role of gender rambles, and does not just get to the point.

I would describe Mostly Autumn as neo-prog with some British folk elements thrown in the mix.

However, within probably 20 minutes, my aim had improved to better than it was prior to using the caliper and I got back up to speed with the knocking.

Anyone who wrote (or writes) in Latin is well aware that the ending -orum is genitive plural, not singular.

In effect, the translator says that he changed this, because it doesn't accord with modern mathematics. That is, the plural term 'infinities' is archaic. All current mathematicians (who have looked into the matter) accept that not all infinities are the same size. The implication of this is that there exists more than one 'infinity' (if we're going to talk about 'infinity').Mathematics are similar in all languages, so the book is still decent (though not as good as it could be)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Received Damaged","review":"This DVD skips and Pops it's way through the story.

Checked out the tracks that were on the player and saw some weird scribbling (listed as a track) which I could not delete. And then, again, could not turn off the player.

This player has lots of memory and can hold 2 whole books and more. I had visions of going on vacation without the stack of books - just the Rio 900. It installed easily. I was able to download books with Audible Manager and listened for about 2 weeks. I did not use the Rio 900 for 2 days. When I picked it up again, it said \\"No Tracks\\" as if it had spontaneously erased everything. I thought I could just redownload the books, but Audible Manager will not add new content because the Rio 900 is full. Apparently, the index was erased but not the actual files. Attempts at formating the player or erasing all files have not changed the situation. SonicBlue does not answer email support inquiries and telephone support is a very long wait. Once they did answer,they didn't know how to solve the problem.

They were very nice in advising me that the 900 had been discontinued but would be replaced with a comparable model. So after I sent the unit to them in Arizona at my expense they promptly replaced the unit with a (refurbished) Rio S50.When I contacted them to advise that the S50 DOES NOT support the audible format that I had initially bought the unit for, I was politely told that they were sorry but they had no plans support any players using the audible format in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think the Rio 900 is great!!","review":"I bought the Rio 900 as a replacement for the Rio 500.My main purpose is to listen to books from Audible.com. The first advantage is not having to constantly be buying AA batteries, because it has an attached rechargeable battery. The second advantage is that it has 192 mb of memory, where the Rio 500 has 64 mb of memory. I just downloaded 5 books onto the player with alot of memory to spare. The sound is also awesome. Music as well as the spoken word comes through loud and clear. You can also adjust the audio depending on what you are listening to...jazz, rap, classic, books, etc. I listen to books most of the time and this player is compatible with the Audible.com formats and the Audible Manager.

The filter's identification is no longer molded into the rubber; but is now painted on. The fit is the same as the original. Performance is expected to be good, as was the original. The boxes were stained a bit from the filter's rubber, but the filters appeared to be in excellent condition. The filter's rubber is black, as was the original.

The author has captured the speech patterns of a young woman very well. There is some interesting background stuff that's not in the film and that adds to our understanding of Amidala's character. I enjoyed reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best journal","review":"Whereas Anakin's journal was kind of lacking any depth and was really just another novelization of the movie, this book really gets into Amidala's character, her motivations, and what makes her tick. It clears up all the questions about when she's the queen and when she's Padme, and she lets us into her past a little. The reason this only gets four stars, though, is that I still don't understand the whole \\"Journal\\" premise -- why write a series of books from the viewpoint of a character whose story we already know well? Additionally, I feel that the author, while she has a very firm grasp of the Star Wars characters, lacks an understanding of the way the SW universe works. She keeps referring to \\"the galaxies,\\" though last time I checked SW only takes place in one.Overall this is a well-written book for those that want to get to know the queen better, but it is still just another retelling of TPM."},{"rating":"2","title":"fast delivery","review":"This book came right on time, just when i started to be concern it was sitting on my porch.Thank you for helping this semester go smooth.

They split right by the terminal block posts. Now they have wide splits across and visible on the white ring on the ceiling. As they are now installed I am going to have to fill these wide cracks. I put it down to tight manufacturing tolerances of just plain bad quality plastic. I also bought 2 in wall speakers and these had no problems.

Sam Bush, Bela Fleck, Jerry Douglas, and Tim O'Brien are clearly at the top of their game. But, other than the one Hot Rize performance, this is not bluegrass in any traditional sense of the genre. It does present some really great extended jam band music, often with acoustic instruments commonly associated with bluegrass. A quick check of the credits at the end of the film suggests that there were, indeed, some true bluegrass artists at the concert, but they were clearly left out of the DVD lineup. If you like the Sam & Bela show, this DVD is for you. If you are looking for a bluegrass video, keep looking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not Bluegrass","review":"This may be \\"New\\" grass but it is not Bluegrass.

It gives a much more balanced look at history and helps students gain an insightful appreciation of many cultures, not just the usual emphasis on Middle Eastern, Mediterranean and Euro-american.

The fue playing is beautiful and melodic, and from hearing it I learned how to embellish my own playing on other songs.

He's obviously dropped his standards to an all time low. This movie was filmed the majority of the time in a strip club, with several side shows of people doing the deed (couples, threesomes, in the bathroom & anywhere else they can find). Oh, and lets not forget the Virgin Mary that is INSIDE the CHURCH weeping and the members think it's a miracle from God... actually it's because she's full of cocaine! Then the Priest (Christian Slater) agrees to participate in a plot to kill the drug dealers, & allows it to take place INSIDE the CHURCH!!! There's a big shootout scene where the priest is actually chasing the bad guys between the pews, shooting & killing them.

The main character is pathetic (who cares?). What's with all the homosexual garbage? I could care less about young men spanking each other.

Mr Feintuch, I get your point: the kid is spoiled, please continue developing your plot. I hoped that after Roddy had his epiphany (you knew it was coming) things would get better, but they really didn't.For those who say this is the best book you have ever read, you truly have my pity.

If I'd known what was between about page 75 and 250 I'd have just skipped it (Just a VERY spoilt teenage winging/complaining/being a complete A**hole!) - I nearly threw the book in the garbage! The last hundred or so pages were OK, but the ending just kind of trails off to a vague sort of ?now he's started... maybe he'll prevail? thing!

This book is an orgy of more of the same. What is redeeming about that, at least in his other books, is that we are a society much in need of lesson learning about bad behavior. To the extent that a book can provide insight into our lives, Mr. Feintuch's work is admirable.Problem. As noted, the idea that virginity would be necessary for 'power' is an interesting concept for this genre. Allowing homosexual activities as an 'out' (no pun intended) is an idiotic plot device, however, not the least because it wasn't integral to the story. It also does not make sense, since as someone else put it so delicately, 'penetration is penetration'.Some will say criticism of this is homophobic. Maybe so. Maybe not. Nonetheless, that part of the story will quite likely put off readers on the whole book, for whatever reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"In my opinion, if you like a snail-paced plot, characters that have no redeeming qualities or entertainment value, and a stunning lack of originality, then this is the book for you.

I know that this book is in limited supply so if you get the opportunity take it.As with most books on betting none ever seem to be truly complete but the author has addressed many important issues.I also recommend Greyhound Racing To Win by Victor Knight (another English book) and Winners Guide to Greyhound Racing by Prof Jones"},{"rating":"2","title":"A informative guide for the new NT Administrator.","review":"This book takes you from installing an NT Server to setting up MS Backoffice, including MS SQL Server, MS Exchange, MS SMS, and MS SNA Server.

I was able to have a set of wheels no one had around here at the time and I knew they were strong. I built up four more wheelsets after, but I always use this book because I'm know building wheels all the time.

While I like the Brandt book, I think this one is my favorite. Brandt's book is full of engineering explanation of how wheels work. I think that is important to know, but I want to know more about wheel building, not just the science behind wheels. Schraner's book concentrates more on actually building wheels and the sport of cycling. Also, the books physical form is easier to lay on a bench and use while actually building a wheel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite there...","review":"I'm not sure if this book was translated from German (my guess), but the grammar leaves much to be desired.

He also seems to have held back what he actually knows, a real wheel tech should be able to inundate the home mechanic with information.

This is not the case. All students benefit from teaching methods directed at effective use of a textbook. The book does share a number of techniques for helping students better read and make sense of textbooks. While some of the examples are interesting, these are taken from books by experts which are far better prepared for helping students with reading. Textbooks are only one reference in a good educational setting. However, the author inappropriately spends much time addressing textbook layout as a major piece ignoring the control and expertise that is possessed by the teacher.

But don't get me wrong, Leppard has a few number one hits on here. It is the best rock album released yet this year in the music industry and Def Leppard will hopefully not wait more than 2 years to release another album to capitalize off this future Platinum album.

Songs like \\"Goodbye\\", \\"Paper Sun\\" and \\"Day After Day\\", should have made this album a classic, but like most rock albums these days it was ignored, just like \\"Blender\\" from Collective Soul, but the song that should have helped this album out is \\"21st Century Sha La La La Girl\\", I absoultely love this song, but it never became a hit, these good rock albums keep getting ignored(like \\"Euphoria\\") and that's really bad because we are not giving these albums the attention they deserve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Euphoria, killer album,killer band","review":"Euphoria is a great album.

It's an odd hybrid between \\"High N' Dry\\", \\"Pyromania\\", and a more contemporary sound. Paper Sun reflects Leppard straight out of the mid 80's but with a relevance in today's market. Kings of Oblivion is another similar song. You have the classic Lep ballads with Goodbye and It's Only Love. Another gem on this album is Disintegrate, it's the first instrumental by the band since Switch 625 on the \\"High N' Dry\\" album and it rocks--finally we get to hear guitar players who have some skill and aren't afraid to show it again.

Every song on this album is great. One reason it's so good is that it is a complete departure from the Slang record. Slang was okay, but Euphoria sounds more like Leppard. When you hear Def Leppard, you want to hear catchy songs with a terrific beat and Euphoria is just that. Demolition Man gets the album off to a blistering start with loud guitar riffs and wonderful beat. Promises, which was number 1 on the rock charts for 3 weeks, is their best single since Pour Some Sugar On me. Back In Your Face is a great crowd-thumping song with a stadium beat. Paper Sun, the other single that was released, is the perfect rock song as Goodbye is the perfect ballad. If you love 80's rock or just love rock period, this album is the one for you.

This CD brings back memories of \\"Pyromania\\" and \\"Hysteria\\". I feel it is the best album to hit the racks this year, and I can't wait to see them in concert this summer based on what this album has to say about the mood of the band at this time, that is, upbeat, on a roll, and \\"Back In Your Face\\" so to speak. Jim J, Massena NY"},{"rating":"2","title":"Back on the right track","review":"Since becoming a fan of Def Leppard back in the summer of 84', I've always looked forward to any new release the band unleashed on the world. As most people, I was EXTREMELY disappointed in 'Slang', but the boys learned their lesson and headed back to the sound that made them great. Although it doesn't match the quality of 'Pyromania' or 'Hysteria', it is worth listening to. Some of the songs sound like tracks left off of 'Hysteria' or 'Adrenalize', but they are still worth a listen. Paper Sun and Demolition Man are probably the best tracks on the CD, but that's just my opinion. Although it's not the best album in their career, it is worth owning even if you're not a fan of Def Leppard. If they continue in this direction, they will reclaim their rightful place in the hallowed halls of Rock and Roll greatness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right up there with Pyromania and Hysteria!","review":"Wow... what else can I say. Being a huge Lep fan since the 80's, I was a little disappointed with Slang. While some songs were well done, it did not sound like the Def Leppard I fell in love with. They returned to their roots with this one, and the change back was a wise decision. A definate must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"true hard-rock survivors...","review":"Even through the bad times, you will never hear the Leps whine.

This album the Leps try to please too many people make their songs so pop and polished they are devoid ofany emotion. If you want to hear great 80's rock inthe 90's buy the new RATT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Def Leppard-Lite!","review":"Listening to the opening track, Demolition Man, I had high hopes for \\"Euphoria\\". However, my hopes were dashed after listening to one sappy ballad after another. The few real rockers like 21st Century Sha La La Girl and Back In Your Face keep this from being a total disaster. Those hoping for a revival of the Leppards of \\"Pyromania\\" and \\"Hysteria\\" will be sorely disappointed. The loss of Steve Clark has left a void from which they will apparently never recover. If you like Def Leppard-Lite, you'll love this CD. If you want to rock as with the Def Leppard of old, save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Going back to their roots","review":"The sad thing is was when I heard this album, I only liked GOODBYE and PAPER SUN to start off with. Then I finally sat myself down and said 'Look, you can't just like two tracks from an entire album, for God's sake.' So I sat... and liked it a whole lot more.However, not much of this stuff's good, but I shan't spoil it for you just yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"A big step backwards after the vastly underrated 'Slang'. Mutt Lange returned to the fold and that is why this album suffers. Overproduced and poor writting. Ranks right at the top with Adrenalize as Leppard's weakest effort. Although this album does have to bright spots, the epic rocker 'Paper Sun' and the very strong 'Day After Day'. The rest is terribly cheesy 80's sounding garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"As bad as Adrenalize","review":"I reviewed this title a few yrs back and gave it 1 star and thought about it again today and I'm bumping it up to 2 stars. Its still nowhere as good as the 4 earlier efforts (on through the night through to Hysteria). To me this sounds too much like Adrenalize with 2 guitarists (this time round) from what I can recall paper sun was the only decent song. I no longer own this (sold it after a week). Def Leppard have been suffering from 3 things since Hysteria 1.The death of Steve Clark 2.the absence of producer Mutt Lange and third writer's block (big time). I think they have forgotten their roots they have been coasting it ever since and playing ballads and pop songs (in an attempt to get on the radio and score a hit again). Overall this is a subpar release from a top band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"I love Def Leppard. I HATE this album.

Many bands say \\"our new album will be more like our roots\\" like Candlebox did with happy pills, but most of the time they're lying just to make good sales on the first week. I was expecting another Slang with this album, and thank God, didn't get it. I like the rocking of \\"Demolition Man\\", the \\"Too late for love\\"-esque vocals of \\"Paper Sun\\", the melodicness of \\"Goodbye\\", and the instrumental. Elliot's vocals are sounding fine again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST HAVE CD!!!","review":"This CD is one of Def leppards best albums I have ever heard...they prove with this album alone how talented they truly are.

About 2/3 of this album really delivers to the fans of \\"Hysteria\\" and \\"Adrenalize\\", but it suffers from the Aerosmith-Nine-Lives syndrome of watering down a great hard rock album with way too many mediocre ballads. The 8 rockin' songs are fine examples of Def Leppard's lush signature pop-metal sound, with plenty of energy and fun, while several of the 5 slower songs are more a modern alternopop that I don't care for. \\"Promises\\" is a decent ballad - it could have come off of \\"Adrenalize\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A definite return to the glory days of Def Lepard.","review":"Though I haven't listened to the entire CD yet, the first two singles, Promises and Paper Sun, sound like an enthusiastic return to the glory days of Def Lepard. Dare I say that Paper Sun might even be the best Def Lepard song of all time. Looking forward to hearing the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit disappointed ... or a big disappointment ?","review":"That album ain't bad, it simply lack of that magic touch. There's good songs ('Promises', 'Paper Sun' or 'All Night' are above the rest) but very average mix and production : a bit of the problem lies here (where's Mutt ?). Better luck next time, guys. Instead, listen to another brilliant UK act nammed THUNDER.

They played three songs from Euphoria when I saw them in concert: Goodbye, Promises, and Paper Sun. In my opinion, those are the best three songs and they are great. Day after Day is getting radio play here now and I'm starting to like that one also. 80's fans and rock n roll fans in general should pick this up. Hey, if an 80's band can take a new album all the way to No. 11 on the charts, you know it's got to be good."},{"rating":"1","title":"The band out to make a buck","review":"I was very disappointed when I heard it, I really thought I would hear the maturity of this band but instead got a feeling that this band put this out to make a quick buck and run.

Since then, their attemps at new music could only be described as mediocre. Euphoria is no different. 2 songs - Promises and Guilty are the only two worth listening to. I was wondering why the local Rock Stations weren't playing more songs off this CD, now I know why. Skip this CD and wait for the greatest hits..."},{"rating":"1","title":"you can't be serious","review":"Have you noticed that Joe can't shout no more? He hasn't been able to since \\"Slang\\", but that album had some different music, which I thought was a sign of maturity for these former poster boys who perhaps just happened to seriously ROCK on 2 amazing albums (\\"Pyromania\\" and \\"Hysteria\\"). So I was fully expecting the Lepps to continue in that new-found grown-up direction and break more new ground; instead I get this half-baked bunch of shallow teeny-bopper cheesecake. C'mon people, you know they can do better than this. Fans will be fans even the Lepps put out an album's worth of fart sounds; who cares if you're a true fan or not? Just put out a good album and I'm listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very surprised at all the good ratings","review":"Dissapointing. Bought it out of sheer loyalty to the band (I was an ABSOLUTE DIE HARD 'Lep fan in the '80s), after lukewarm Adrenalize and Slang (but LOVED the hard ones on Retroactive, I guess that should have warned me). I'm afraid the days of Hysteria and Pyromania are past, never to return again. Maybe I haven't matured as the band has, but that's what I was hoping to hear and didn't. Very tame, very 'pop' ballad-y performanaces. 'Paper Sun' is the only cut with any edge. Really hate to say it, but save your money (or buy the new Alice Cooper box set)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing!","review":"Boy, talk about selling out! There in it for the money.

Older, and looking very pathetic in clothes clearly designed for a younger, hipper crowd, Def Leppard attempts to sway the listener with the inane lyrics and shallow musical riffs that wooed us as teenagers. It doesn't work. In a very weak effort to regain some of their lost glory, they've only accomplished further burying their legacy. I, for one, am sad to see some of my most pleasant memories tarnished by this sad offering from Elliot and crew."},{"rating":"1","title":"YOU MUST READ BEFORE YOU MUST BUY!","review":"This is the WORST Albuum you'll ever buy from this group! This is coming from a long-time fan!!! What was promised to be harkening back to their 'Pyromania' and 'Hysteria' days, this cd sounds like the poppy direction they went with 'Adrenalize'-BUT EVEN WORSE! 'Slang' tried to capitalize on the Alternative era of Rock, 'Euphoria' tries to capitalize on the current trend like Backstreet Boys, In Sync, Etc. I'd give this 0 stars if Amazon would allow!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!","review":"If you're looking for an honest review of EUPHORIA, here it is: This record is nothing but a crappy sequel to Adrenalize! It's doesn't sound anything like High & Dry, Pyromania, and/or Hysteria like it was advertised! Def Leppard died with Steve Clark!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OVER RATED!","review":"I can't believe that even the hard-core Leppard fans would think that this album is talent? and sounds different? Give me a break! Do you really want the same sound and \\"BUBBLE GUM\\" rock from a band who's capable of producing some of the worlds best music? Keep searching folks, this Leppard fan says way way way \\"OVER RATED\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good 80's Style Effort","review":"So after putting out an interesting and diverse album such as \\"Slang\\" during the tail end of the Grunge movement the boys figured it was safe enough in the late 90's to recapture some of their 80's fans with a full-out 80's rock album. Well, they pretty much succeeded. There are some great rock songs like \\"Demolition Man\\", \\"Promises\\", \\"Paper Sun\\", \\"Guilty\\", \\"Day After Day\\", and \\"Kings of Oblivion\\" but then there are weird tunes that don't quite find the mark such as \\"Back In Your Face\\" and \\"All Night\\". Unfortunately they throw a couple \\"Adrenalize\\" style ballads on here as well which really drag down the album. However, if you're quick on the skip button this is a very enjoyable Def Leppard album and falls in line nicely with their 80's material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Return to the '80s","review":"A total 1980's sounding album (with a splash of modernness) released in 1999. This would've been a better follow-up to Hysteria than Adrenalize was. Much more energy. If fact this is probably their most energy filled album since High N Dry! Not too bad for these 40-something guys. I was very surprised. \\"Promises\\" is the best track and is basically \\"Photograph II\\", but still a great and distinguished song at the same time. The whole album's great. A must have if you liked Pyromania, Hysteria, and/or Adrenalize."},{"rating":"2","title":"Def Leppard still rocks our world!!!!!!!","review":"This album is by far the return of what I still feel is the best rock band for all others to be judged by. Def Leppard will always be the best for one reason, They Kick A--. Always have, always will. Joe and the boys should be especially proud of this album. From Demolition Man to Kings of Oblivion, Rock never sounded so good. Such a fresh sound, while still staying true to their roots. Rock and Roll is back!!!!! From the first track to the last I can honestly say that this is their best work to date. I felt like my ears opened again, after being closed for so long. Music these days seems to have lost all the flavor of yesteryear when Def Leppard ruled the charts. Likewise with this record I believe that there is some hope that maybe someday music will be something other than the music of the nineties. Buy this record, any TRUE FAN will love this record as much as I already do. {PEACE)"},{"rating":"2","title":"It makes me feel like I am 18 again...","review":"But when I was 18 my taste in music was not what I would consider refined or good. But Def Leppard is the only band I listen to from that time. Euphoria takes us back, but not too far back.I can not disagree more when people say it is a follow-up to Hysteria or Pyromania. It really has a sound much more akin to Adrenalize, leaving Slang somewhere in the failed experiment pile.(Revier's note I accually like Slang more than Euphoria, FYI)It is a predictable sounding album, but delivers the goods none the less. Probably only a Def Leppard fan would probably really enjoy this album, it lacks the mass appeal Pyromania or Hysteria had."},{"rating":"1","title":"amazing, the boys are back","review":"well, it's about time we heard something good from somebody. the hard rock with the power ballads make euphoria a treat to listen to. don't compare it to hysteria though or you might get disappointed. once again the leps come through when rock was dying. hopefully the radio will play it this time and let the new generation enjoy what we have all come to enjoy and that is good consistent music from the worlds number #1 band"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWSOME","review":"Sounds like evey Lep record in one, from start to finish.

I was led to believe by the pre-release interviews, this was going to be an album that approached the style of Hysteria and Adrenalize.We'll in the sense that Def Leppard recorded it, yes it was..The production sound was very Def Leppard, the stylized backing vocals,layered guitars and electronic drums. But the songwriting was just down right poor.The single, Promises had me very excited for my shipment to arrive. The first listen and each subsequent was a real let down. Paper Sun and Promises are the only two songs that I could really identify with the Def Leppard that I remember and liked. The rest seem like a continuation of the experiment on Slang. (Which I liked by the way )"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a hard to watch your favorite band fall...but they have","review":"I'm not sure if you will find a larger Def Leppard fan than I am, and it is with GREAT disapointment that I write these words. WHAT HAPPENED?!? Def Leppard used to fuse rock rhythms and melody seamlessly, allowing you to connect with each song on an emotional level. The only two songs that even approach that level of quality on this album are \\"Promises\\" and \\"Paper Sun\\". The rest of them, I'm afraid, truly are Bludgeon Riffola- seemingly random and inconsistent melodies interspersed with forced, stiff lyrics. I saw all the rave reviews and was foaming at the mouth to listen to this CD. Alas, it seems my favorite band has lost its musical soul and does not know where to find it. Very sad indeed-for they were a GREAT Band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great album","review":"I hear people complain that Slang wasn't anything like their old stuff. Then I hear the same people complain that Euphoria sounds just like the old stuff. Why is it that we allow performers to have such a short shelf life? Sure music trends change, but that doesn't mean the performer(s) become any less talented. The opening track on Euphoria is \\"Demolition Man\\", it's fast paced, and your sure to pull out the air guitar no matter what the age. \\"Paper Sun\\" reminds me a little of their Pyromania days, as does \\"Day After Day\\", but just a little bit. \\"21st Century Sha La La La girl\\" would be a radio hit if it weren't coming from a band who is associated with the 80's. I also listened to this CD everyday for almost a year straight, and it's been in the Wall Unit since. I read another review that said readers should be more honest about the album and admit Def Leppard was washed up. I'll be honest: Buy the album and have fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of both worlds","review":"Short and sweet? Their best album in years. Stands easily in the class of 'Hysteria' in my mind as yet another peak of the band's career.Def Leppard didn't follow the fate of many other 80's rock bands, resting on their laurels and simply re-hashing all the old tunes. DL is still alive and growing, as this album in addition to Slang prove so well. Slang was a step too-far-too-fast: the band lost their identity in the experimentation (although it was a great album by and of itself). Euphoria is maturity: a nearly perfect blend of innovation and pure Def Leppard rock 'n roll. A real joy and a must-have for any fan's collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please bring back Mutt Lange","review":"Def Leppard needs their old producer back, badly. I bought this album when it came out and thought it was ok, but looking back on it, it's not very good. The production is WAY polished, even for these guys. No evidence of any dirty rock sound here, just clean clean clean..come on guys, throw some feeling in the mix, this thing sounds like it was performed and produced by a robot. it's not a terrible record, in fact if it was some new band rather than Def Lep, I'd think it was pretty damned good. But I can't even recall one song on this album..they've kind of gone in one ear, out the other. I don't think I've played this cd since last year, in fact it looks prime for selling to disc-go-round maybe. Die hard Lep fans will hate this review, but admit it guys, this is like listening to a Lep cover band or something. N'Sync sounds rawer than the songs on Euphoria. I'm sure they'll eventually put out another great record but Euphoria sure as hell isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"As weak as it gets","review":"I'm glad somebody out there likes this CD, because Def Leppard is one of the greatest rock bands of all time. But seriously folks, it's just plain bad. There's nothing exciting, fresh, or even interesting to offer. One track is okay... \\"Back in your face\\" because it's at least fun, but the rest are really boring. \\"Promises\\" starts off 'promising' but the lyrics fall flat and the song never really leaves the ground. This is the only Def Leppard album I've ever given thumbs down to, but the band seems to be out of ideas and Mutt is sorely missed in the control room. Even as bad as Adrenalize was (\\"Let's Get Rocked\\" was the tackiest rock song ever, only second to \\"Cherry Pie\\" by Warrant.) But even Adrenalize had it's moments. Here's a tip guys, if you aren't writing great songs, collaborate with fresh new writers. It works for Kiss and Aerosmith and dozens of other groups who stay on top."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just not very talented","review":"Lets face it this record wasn't the creativity of DL, it sounded to me like what the record label wanted them to put out. I bet you if you had a conversation with the guys they would be the first privately to tell you that if was up to them the record would sound a lot different.What this CD lacks is the cohesiveness and the talent that these guys once had; sure it sounds nice and predictable, but is it talent?In this reviewers opinion it's just not worth the wait, try again and this time on YOUR OWN."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened to the Rock?","review":"This band was a great rock band once. They say Hysteria superrocketed them to stardom, but I say it was the momentum from the truly good rock albums of Pyromania, High & Dry, and On Through The Night. This band made intelligent rock with songs like Die Hard the Hunter, Billy's Got a Gun, Bringing on the Heartbreak. They went totally into cheese with Hysteria, became hugely commercially successful, and abandoned the rock. They need to go back to their roots and put something out for the rockers, not the teeny-boppers that love cheese."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the singles","review":"Let me sum up: 1. Excellent 2.

Every single song is great (yes, even \\"All Night\\", and I absolutely hated it the first time I heard it). I just hope that the record company supports this album, and the critics and fans too. Again, if you buy it and did't like it at first, give it a chance... with songs like \\"Demolition man\\", \\"Guilty\\", \\"Paper Sun\\", \\"Disintegrate\\", \\"To Be Alive\\", etc.. this album is worth every cent... way to go Leps!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the wait","review":"I've been a Def Lep fan since the tender age of six (or in other words for 12 years) when I first heard \\"Photograph\\".

I was struck at the similarities I heard that reminded me of other Def Lep songs, but 'Euphoria' is its own album. Great album and well worth the wait (even though the wait nearly drove me insane).

Some very catchy tunes this time around, like \\"Back In Your Face\\", \\"Paper Sun\\", and \\"Demolition Man\\". Unfortunately, like on every cd by every other band, there is that 1 or 2 songs that should have just been left off. \\"All Night\\" is a perfect example of that. Unless you really like George Michael or the Backstreet Boys, you might want to skip that one. Most of the other songs on this cd is Def Leppard at it's best.

I must say when I first heard it I was sort of excited, but as the CD went on and the songs begin to sound a little shallow I became very disappointed. I expected DL to show us a little more talent and to enter into 1999 with a sound of maturity, what we got was a band out to make some money for the record companies. Is this really DL at there best or is it DL at a point of desperation?In my book it's a point of desperation from a band that once had the potential to go down with the best of them in rock and roll history. It's probably not all their fault; we should blame the record companies for putting out a sound that dates back ten to fifteen years.Try again.... 1 Star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Therey not back!","review":"At least the talent, yes the sound is what the record company wanted it to be but the talent is lacking.

The best songs on this album in order are Paper Sun, Promises, Demolition Man,and Day after day. Oh yeah, dont forget Disintegrate is an amazing instramental.

This is the first Case novel I have read but he has a habit of telegraphing his next move and gives hints which allowed me to figure this out halfway through. It might have been a little better if he developed his characters fully. Adrienne is especially dry and I found it hard to believe how she could be so businesslike in dealing with the death of her sister then witnessing the brutal murder of her friend. The ending was anticlimactic and not very satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great premise, silly book","review":"Truly a wildly silly tome. It starts off well and rapidly degenerates, not even bothering to prep the reader for the next round of ridiculousness. I love thrillers, and understand about the necessary suspension of belief for almost all of them, but The Syndrome requires far too much from its readers: total brain disengagement. The dialogue is stilted, the characters are cutters, and if you don't laugh out loud when you discover the final nefarious plot, well...Whatever you do, don't spend the money on the hardcover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"I enjoyed two of John Case's other novels, but this one was a big let down for me. Case spends way too much time describing minutia and details that aren't relevant to the story line, and it makes the book a chore to pour through. The dialogue isn't very believable. i was looking forward to this book, but it will keep me from reading any more Case material."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a thriller!!","review":"The Syndrome is an excellent novel, full of thrills and chills! I spent one whole day (and into the night) reading this novel, I couldn't put it down. John Case has written an exciting story, part spy thriller, part mystery, part romance, all the elements necessary for a spell-binding, edge-of-your-seat, nail-biting read. It is obvious that Mr. Case's considerable knowledge of his chosen topic (also clearly demonstrated in The Genesis Code and The First Horseman) has allowed him to once again write a very realistic and \\"scary\\" novel. I highly recommend The Syndrome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Case Ever","review":"Totally intrigued by page 7. I didn't think John Case could get any better. However, this novel became my favorite of his.The main character is off to a think tank and leaves without his face. Now mind-control sets in as he becomes a psychiatrist whodelves into the problems of a woman whose sister has died, afteran assassination on her part...an old wheel-chair bound man. Yes, it's bizarre and quite unbelievable, but it makes for anexciting read. I thouroughly enjoyed it. John Case, give us more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very average book","review":"This is a horrible book and took me forever to read, so unfortunately I've probably forgotten a lot of the reasons why I didn't like it. The beginning shows promise, with the kidnapping and mystery surgery on Lou McBride. Then Nicco Cope for no apparent reason assasinates a terminally ill old man. Both are obviously being manipulated by an evil organization.But then the next 400 pages or so switch gears and follow the plight of Dr. Jeffery Duran, Nicco's pshychologist, and Adrienne, her sister. Duran has also been affected by this evil organization, and the reader knows it from the beginning. But it takes 400 pages for Jeffery and Addrienne to figure out. Then in the last few pages or so, Case tells us what the \\"Syndrome\\" is all about, then throws in some action in the climax.Case's novels are getting progressivley worse. It'll be awhile before I try his new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment!","review":"After reading The Genesis Code and thouroughly enjoying it, this book is a complete disappointment. I could not believe how messy and poorly developed the plot was. This book read as a weak attempt of amateur writers to write about profound matters.I guess, no more John Case for me: the duo is degenerating fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get out!","review":"The first half is not so bad. After that \\"John Case\\" obviously lost all interest in this ... and so did I. Besides: An author who does not care about details is not to be trusted in general. You can't buy an assault rifle just like that in Switzerland! John Paul I was certainly not killed because of Vatican II. \\"Case\\" does not know anything - and did no research - about radiology (especially CAT scans) and he certainly does not speak German: A \\"hunter store\\" is no \\"Speicher fuer Jaeger\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"READ the book; SKIP the audio version","review":"The advantage of audio books is that characters, setting, etc. generally are presented to the reader exactly as the author intends. I doubt, however, that the authors of The Syndrome intended for their female characters to sound so absolutely silly. With due respect for Mr. Hill's talents, he is clearly lost when trying to imitate female voices. The voice of the protagonist Adrienne, in particuar, teeters between that of a grown man mimicking a 4-year-old child and the authentic voice of a 90-year-old woman. I was never able to visualize with any credibility what certainly was intended to be a strong, independent, and sexy 20-or-30-something lawyer. Mr. Hill, on the other hand, does an outstanding job with with the male voices and the narration. So, I'm wondering: Since it took a man and a woman to write this thrilling story, perhaps a man AND a woman should have been hired to read the audio version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable and disappointing :-(","review":"John Case, the pseudonym for a husband and wife writing team that has turned out such incredible thrillers as \\"The First Horseman\\" and \\"The Genesis Code\\" have stumbled with their latest offering, \\"The Syndrome\\". Taking a viable scientific premise, implanted/recovered memory, and giving it a nasty twist, they create an incredibly promising start to a novel that spins its wheels and goes absolutely nowhere. And unfortunately, it takes a long time to get there. The characters are one-dimensional, and the way in which the story revolves around them seems lifeless, without any passion whatsoever. I had a very hard time caring about anything that happened to them, and wished they would just shut up and go away.

Pregnant wife. Overwhelmed mayor. Heroic young protesters, debating over who is more courageous and idealistic.I did enjoy the way they edited in some actual historic footage.

The subplot with the pregnant woman was not mentioned as I recall in the book, so I guess they just felt they needed to add this. Lots of fu-- swear words didn't make the movie any more appealing and I don't remember any swear words in the book.

True, you can pull it up out the unopened top of the case and push the buttons, but I'm the kind of person who likes to jump around songs and albums.

The lady of the title is a mysterious women who lives all by herself in a huge house. She befriends a neighborhood boy and we see the story through his eyes and narration. It started out OK but soon got tedious and dull. The author goes into detail about events that (as far as I could tell) had little to do with the main story. The mystery about the woman is bought up occasionally but most of the book just drags on and on and ON about the kid and his family life and friends.

The characters were all angry, and bitter, moving from apathetic to rageful to plain mean, and were never fleshed out into people the reader can care about.The concept is fascinating, but never really explored except briefly through a mad scientist searching for the soul. There are passages that hint of a deeper meaning, but they're never developed and that left me disappointed.This could've been a great novel if more time had been put into developing the characters and the premise.

The Author furthers states the book includes \\"access and location\\" of the dive sites. Wrong and wrong. It's a good book for general information of the Bahamas and has some nice pictures but worthless as a guide to the dive sites. It is very safe to assume a purchaser of the book is a scuba diver and has plans to use it for that purpose. The advertising for this book should include a statement \\"Coordinates Not Included\\". While this book has some nice pictures and good general information about the Bahamas, most of the information is freely available on the internet. I purchased the book for the detail. Location of a dive site to me means how to get there and that would include GPS coordinates, at least. There are no compass bearings either. \\"East Of Treasure Reef\\", or \\"The Next Mooring East From Site 3 Along The Inner Reef System\\" doesn't cut it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No GPS coordinates = no good.","review":"Any avid diver has heard of the wonderful diving just 2 miles off the south tip of the west end. And then you go driving around in your boat forever looking for it, stopping occasionally to stick your face in the water. 2 hours later and plenty pissed, you give up.GPS does away with all this. Dive bouy or no, you hit your spot first time every time. In fact with WAAS you can easily come within 15 feet of the mark with no problem. It borders on criminal to put out a dive book that has no GPS coordinates, and my printing of this book has none.

The vocalist is actually Danny McCulloch, the one time bass player of Eric Burdon & The Animals. This collection has appeared on at least four other minor labels always disguised as The Animals. Danny McCulloch did resurface in 1991 as The New Animals with original members of the second Animals band i.e. Eric Burdon & The Animals. This group included guiterist Vic Briggs and drummer Barry Jenkins who actually replaced John Steele in the original Animals. I know at least some of these cuts are from this line-up. Despite the connection, it is a shameful attempt to cash in on the fame and sound of the original recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"I know it isn't Eric Burdon","review":"But I really did like this CD.

No way to know unless you read the fine print that this is a re-do of the major hits, complete with a 90s electronics and occasional disco beat.

Our son says it feels soft and warm on him...no more bright red cheeks. He doesn't mind putting it on because he feels like a super spy with it. He wore it almost every day in the winter (October - April this year, unfrotunately) and it never smelled bad, so maybe others had a defective one. I washed it a few times each month with natural detergent. I suppose, if you sweat in it, you'd need to wash it every few uses.

The mistress of Miss Julia's deceased husband and her child fathered by him live with Miss Julia. This book has Miss Julia planning a wedding for a couple who would just as soon elope.

The music, especially the Lamentations, is somber and haunting, with some arresting (and forward-looking) chromaticisms. I wanted to like this CD, but unfortunately this ensemble is plagued throughout by noticeably sour intonation, especially the baritone (Billingsley). This has the effect of making one extremely uneasy and edgy while listening: the sublime harmonic progressions that are the core of this music miss their mark and never quite jell. That's really too bad, because Moll's reading is largely competent and emotive. Wait for another recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superb la Rue Mass fails to communicate","review":"It is unfortunate that the present recording is the only one available of this beautiful and highly approachable Mass by the still under-rated Pierre de la Rue.

There seemed to be too many characters and too little driving action for me to latch onto. The central characters seemed dreadfully stereotyped, particularly the baddies.However, I have read the blurb for Volume Two, FOOL'S GOLD, which seems to pick up the pace a little, particularly by concentrating on the enigmatic Rosa Eldi, the seductive amnesiac femme fatale featured in Whelan's painting. I have also been reading encouraging reviews from other readers here which suggest that the series is worth hanging in there for. Maybe other discouraged readers of this promising novel will do what I am doing - reserving final judgement until all three volumes are out and reading them together.

I really loved DMC and DMC 2 and this is so much like them that i would re-name it DMC 3, but i guess it is a bit different.Graphics 4.5/5Gameplay 4.5/5Plot 5.0/5Controls 3.5/5...very confusing at firstOverall 5.0/5P.S. If you did not like DMC or DMC 2 i would recamend renting this game before you buy it or at least let the price cool off a bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"How is this like DMC?","review":"Ok the only thing that is similar to DMC is the fact that it was made by capcom. This game is horrible it has terrible graphics that are worse than DMC and the game play is monotonous. The whole game you run forward and get locked into a small space then swamped with enemies and you kill them all easily and move on to the next area. The game was just terrible I can't see how they made the connection with DMC at least DMC had some variety and had different enemies to fight in the game. I don't recommend anyone play this game even with the legions there's very little varriety in this game and not enough for anyone to stay focused long enough to want to play for more than an hour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun But ....","review":"It's brilliant game and fabulous ideas were it's only action fight game similar to devil may cry but bad graphics and design though besides no story line at all. The more you push buttons the more you will be winning. once you unlock the 14 levels, the game becomes invincible were all your power you got by playing will be nothing and it's just like starting all over were the new enemies really makes a HUGE damage and it's impossible to beat. In this point it becomes boring and you'll be starting to find cheats. I used to LOVE this game and I've played it long time back but didn't reach this point but now I felt it was a complete waste of time. See it on youtube and find out if it worth buying it. To me no."},{"rating":"1","title":"Devil may cry copycats?","review":"Wow. is there anyhting good about this game? The fighting is awful, so is the plot, graphics, sound, voice acting, duration.

The worst level design!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Devil May Cry\\" meets \\"Final Fantasy\\"","review":"While not the best game for the PS2 in the Graphics or Story departments, you'll still find this game oddly addicting. It is a compelling play, though you'll probably only have patience for a single playthrough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short But Beautiful","review":"An absolutely beautiful, beautiful game. The graphics are mindblowing, almost to the point of being able to compete with Final Fantasy X and X-2. The backgrounds are incredibly realistic, the characters were rendered wonderfully. For video game fans who are familiar with Final Fantasy, the fighting system is much like that of Kingdom Hearts.. this game is essentially an all-out, beat-em-up game, and while creating a rather confusing storyline at first, it's worth every minute of your time.The game was rather short, it only took me a few days to beat it. However, being able to unlock the movies and re-watch them later is a good reward for defeating it. It takes a lot of tactiful manuevers and strategy to defeat the bosses, an aspect which I very much enjoyed. It's one of those games that's simple enough to learn, but somewhat difficult to play. I highly recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of dissapointed","review":"I am not a huge game buff by any means, but I know what I like. I like adventure role-playing games where there is an itellectual challange at some point. This game doesn't seem to offer that. Its more of a run around-smash-the-buttons type game. There is no exploration. No substanace. I'm glad I didn't pay too much for it, it's too bad though, I was really looking forward to getting into another really cool game. Too bad for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five stars for the film, but, oh, the DVD...ugh!!!","review":"This film is also released under the cheesily named title of \\"Revenge of the Dead,\\" and the quality of that DVD release is apparently just as lousy.This is a wondeful film by Pupi Avati. Apparently there is a crystal clear copy available in Europe in the PAL format, Region 2, letterboxed, uncut, and all.What needs to happen is someone with brains needs to release this film in its proper format on DVD in the States. Yes, \\"Pet Semetary\\" is very similar and was perhaps inspired by \\"Zeder,\\" but otherwise, this is a truly original film.Addendum (August 21, 2004): Get a region free DVD player...The only solution to some of these terribly important problems!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzeder","review":"Zeder is a huge snore-fest.

I probably had an edited copy. There is little to no gore, bad bad BAD acting and the soundtrack. That soundtrack, yikes!

The Polar B3 does the basic stuff (watch, stop watch and heart rate monitor) and am quite pleased. The only negative is the battery of the watch went dead after about 18 months of using it in 1-2 spinning classes per week. Polar wants you to send the watch in for battery replacement for around $13 + shipping, but my local watch repair shop did it for $7. I have not had to replace the battery in the chest band transmitter, which I read gives you about 2500 hours of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I get a heart beat?","review":"This worked wonderful for the first 2 weeks, but into my third week, the heart beat monitor was having a hard time keeping my pulse.

I have this same bike - different brand name but the EXACT same model(which make one wonder...). I kept hearing a scraping sound when I used it. I realize that is was the belt rubbing against the edge of the spoke. It eventually came off all together. The design makes it impossible to open it up and fix it (it's bolted together, literally). To top it off, there's no way to contact the manufacturer at all - no phone number, just a P.O. Box to order more stuff. Fortunely, I didn't pay SRP for it as I bought it new at an online auction. I'm now going to buy a real stationary bike. I don't have room for it but a least I know it tried and true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy piece of equipment","review":"I was excited to finally find this type of bike at a reasonable price.

I also like the blue color."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANOTHER GREAT LEATHERMAN","review":"Well Leatherman did it again with the Juice series. I actually was not going to buy any of the Juice series multitools as I did not like the look and thought they would be to small for any sort of real use. Boy was I wrong. I initially bought the Juice S2 than the C2 and now the CS4. I absolutely love them all and ended up carrying the CS4 as it has the most tools. I was worried about buying the CS4 as the weight might of been to much for a pocket EDC (Every Day Carry) but I do not even feel it in my pocket. It feels very well made and sturdy and all the tools can actually do some work. Don't go thinking your going to change the world with this thing but it will accomplish most small to medium tasks you throw at it. I would highly suggest anyone looking for a pocket multitool to buy one of the juice series tools. I could not imagine a day without having my CS4 with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leatherman Juice CS4 Pocket Multi-Tool, Glacier Blue","review":"Great product - About the size of a std pocket knife, but heavier. It is robust, hard wearing and packed with useful tools.Neat features include the ability to use knife, scissors, bottle opener and saw with out having to fully open the tool.The 3 flat blade screw drivers and the X point driver make you feel as though you are using a normal screw driver, rather than a \\"pocket knife\\".The scissors design is very good. They are very easy to use single handedly and can cut through more than you might expect.I lost my previous Juice when traveling with work, and after about a week, I new I needed to replace it - nothing else I had was as compact and useful this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice EDC Multitool!","review":"I purchased the CS4 as an EDC MT. The fit and finishing is typical of what one would expect of a Leatherman. Like what some others had mentioned, it would be a challenge to open one of those 3 screw drivers without cutting yourself. Fortunately, I read those reviews beforehand and saved myself some nicks. Another item I hadn't been able to open is the lanyard ring. Can anyone enlighten me how to open that?Other than the few cons I mentioned above, this is a superb EDC MT. First thing I used is the can opener. Contrary to popular belief, it works very well.

Two criteria of my search for a multi-tool were a corkscrew and scissors, of the features that are not common with smaller-sized tools, both of which seem to work pretty well so far.However, I can completely understand how some users are not confident of the strength of the corkscrew. The user must be very careful to keep the tool straight when using the corkscrew so as not to snap it off (which seems to be fairly easy to happen)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent leatherman","review":"bought this for my little bro and he loves it. has lots of tools and is well made"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unacceptable","review":"The blade has an EXCESSIVE amount of wobble, and the handle scale on the blade side is loose. The flathead screwdrivers are ridiculously hard to deploy. It appears that the rivet that secures the screwdrivers is too tight and the one for the blade too loose. Of course, you can't adjust this because the idiot designers used rivets in the first place instead of screws. I got one, and thought it was a fluke, so I exchanged it. The second one was the same garbage. Lest you think I am a malcontent, I am satisfied with my Juice S2. The pliers are good, but overall, the CS4 is not worthy to be on my belt or yours if you plan to use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just got mine an hour ago from Amazon","review":"Started off with a positive attitude until I got to the screwdrivers. After breaking my thumbnail in a couple places I finally gave up and got a small screwdriver in order to pry up any of the 3 blades. I've worked them back and forth and still the same. The smallest is the worst, no way to flip it up with a fingernail. The Phillips head on the other end is just fine. Guess I'll Email Leatherman tomorrow, if possible, and see what they say.

I am impressed at how Ms. Persia Wooley made Gwen a believable narrator that readers can connect with, for I found this Gwen a sincere young woman who is, at first, reluctant to leave her life for the ways of the court. Gwen is the modest little tomboy who eventually grows up and weds who will be the greatest king of all Britain. The reader can laugh, cry, and smile with Gwen (who, in this book, is not an arrogant prick like most people picture Guinevere) all throughout the book as she meets characters like an Irish lad Kevin, the powerful Lady Morgan, and the stately Queen Igraine. I am impressed by Wooley's first book in the trilogy, and I am looking forward to reading the others!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great retelling!","review":"This is a great Arthurian retelling, from Guinever's point of view, and with more of her back-story.

Among the plethora of feminine centric Arthur retellings, I thought this trilogy was second only to The Mists of Avalon, which is the best Arthurian novel I've read, period. Neither a simpering bauble like Marion Zimmer Bradley's queen, nor a bitter shrew, as she is depicted in Rosalind Miles' trilogy, the High Queen in this series is a strong woman, bold, intelligent, compassionate, and well worth the love of two legendary heros. My only complaint with the character is this: Woolley saw fit to make her Guenevere homely, not the great beauty of legend, and Guenevere is supposed to be the fairest of the fair. Otherwise, this trilogy gets my highest recommendation. It is much better than the other Guenevere trilogies out there (by Miles and Newman). If you like this one, you might also enjoy Queen of Camelot by Nancy McKenzie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Child of the Northern Spring","review":"Too much detail of locations and trivial facts with not enough substance of plot or story line.

Having just completed the first book in this trilogy, I look forward to two more great \\"reads.\\" In a famous story we all know, Woolley created interest and excitment. The descriptions of 6th century Britain were fascinating, so real that I could feel the green grass beneath my feet and smell the sweat from the horses. The interplay of relationships, how they managed their world, the politics, and the fun were elegantly written about. I liked that there were not unrealistic castles and finery, but day to day struggles and yes, some fur coats and rugs thrown in. Guinevere was a determined young lady. I liked her and wanted a Camelot that would last forever. Gee, hope I won't be disappointed.

I can hardly wait to continue reading the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poster is awesome; packaging, not so much","review":"Since there was no option to track my package, I was pleasantly surprised to receive my poster just 4ish days after placing the order. What I didn't expect was how much I would have to struggle to open my new poster. It was so tightly wound, and the plastic cap was completely sealed that I was afraid of damaging the contents just by wrestling with the tube. Literally 15 minutes later, I gingerly pulled the poster out unharmed. However, it was impossible to keep the poster smoothed out as it kept snapping back into it's tightly coiled position. I had to wrap it the other way around the tube and weight it with books for a whole week to undo the curling! Even now that I've put in on my wall, the edges are still curling up. Despite the higher than normal price and having to struggle with getting my poster wall-ready, I am still very satisfied with Chino's IDGAF sneer and sweet pin striped background."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome movie and CD!!!","review":"I thought the movie was incredible and Kevin Spacey deserved much more credit than he has received.

John Wilson and the Orchestra is absolutely amazing at taking these charts and playing them perfectly. Secondly, Spacey has an amazing voice. I wish he did more cd's, cause I'd buy them. He's got a great voice. I'd honestly rather listen to him than Harry Connick Jr. He's that good. So please buy this. You'll love it.

Amazing reproduction of Bobby Darin but still has special Kevin Spacey personality."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's 'Out of the Park' fabulous!","review":"Kevin Spacey not only re-captured the essence of Bobby Darin, I believe he became a singing sensation of his own in the process. I was listening to it just last night and everytime I do, I get goosebumps. They have managed to re-create the sound and feel of recordings from that era, but with all the fidelity that today's technology affords. The recording is 'flawless' and Spacey's stellar performance would make Bobby Darin both jealous and proud. My kids even commented on just how much they enjoyed the music while watching the movie- and they generally don't like any of that 'old music'. If you haven't seen the movie- see it.

When he sang he absolutely abandoned himself to the music and his joy in singing shined through in every song he sang. Kevin Spacey can carry a tune but as a singer he just isn't on the same level of artistry. That said, I am interested in seeing the movie, because I'm interested in the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond the sea - Kevin Spacey","review":"Stick to acting Kevin because you cannot sing in tune. Only 20 seconds went by the first track and I was flicking through the tracks. I have to say the cover was really stylish but that is all. To any one that is a fan of Bobby Darrin, DON'T BOTHER. This is a great American tragedy. If you have no ear for music and are a kevin Spacey fan, buy it for the curiousity value. I am really disappointed that this CD was unavailable in New Zealand so I could have listened to it before I purchased it.

That being said, Spacey extremely surprised me. He retained the essence of Darin while giving himself a great image as a singer.

While this is a nice and handy product made by apple, the price is to big to make it worth it. If you're buying a 15, 20, or 40 gb, you get a dock already included, along with a remote, a carrying case, and more hardrive space. But buying a dock separately is a waste of money. It does include an audio out jack, but the headphone out is just as goodI made my own dock for myself out of wood and painted it. It looks nice or nicer than the Apple dock and is just slightly less functional. All the dock does is make the iPod stand up instead of lying there.If you want a dock, I'd suggest making your own or buying a 15, 20 or 40 gb iPod with the dock included as well as many other goodies that make it worth spending $100 extra."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably not worth it, but handy","review":"The iPod dock may not be worth the price - but it *is* handy if you are into convenience. My iPod came with a bundled dock and I keep in on my desk for charging/syncing.The dock is well designed - seems solidly built and is nice and small. It's also nice how it doesn't have any cables hanging out of it like most docks seem to - you just plug in the regular iPod cable to the back and that's it.I've seen people who have two iPods leave one dock in the living room by the stereo equipment. The audio out jack on the back of the dock allows you to hook it up to your stereo and you can use the dock cable to plug in to the AC charger. This lets you quickly snap the iPod into its dock to charge and listen to music - however, if you only have one iPod, you'll want to buy an additional cable along with the extra dock so you don't always have to unplug it to sync with your computer.If you're not feeling cheap, I guess it's handy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Other functionality","review":"The iPod dock does more than just make the iPod &quot;stand up.&quot; It also provides a line-out which is a much better way of connecting it to a steroeo sytem than going through the headphone jack.

However, this book demonstrates- without actually stating it- how little control this offers the photographer. (Umbrellas are still useful, but they are not always the best solution.)The technique of varying not only the source to subject distance but also the origin to source distance is worth the time and money I invested. (The source is your light modifier. The origin is the light itself.)This is not for beginner photographers or even those new to studio lighting. The author assumes a good knowledge of photography and a basic knowledge of studio lighting. In fact, I feel the need to read it again.I give four stars and not five because I felt that there could have been a few more chapters.Note: the title is NOT \\"How to Choose and Purchase Photographic Lighting\\". The book is about how to USE Photographic Lighting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Making simple lighting overly complicated","review":"Good thing I got this book from my local library and didn't pay for it. The book is heavily worded and makes simple lighting setups that are easily learned in the classroom rather confusing. When you're lighting, you shouldn't be doing complicated math or referring to the inverse square law to realize your lighting is too close or two far or not modified correctly. (Not to mention I've caught a small handful of grammatical errors.)This book is good if you're a techie photog, but in my opinion, you're going to miss out on a heck of a lot of shots and really suck the fun out of photography and experimenting with lighting.To be fair, there are a lot of helpful lighting maps and some good basic advice for those who are completely new to lighting in this book. So.. if you don't have a clue.. don't start with this book or make it your bible, but definitely take a look and get the general idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Not quite what I expected.... There's too much blah blah and not so much actual lighting outlines. They did a good job in offering pictures along with camera/lights setup maps, but not enough. Too many words, not too much actual material to work with. Surely re-sell this book. Brand new."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not for the Faint of Heart","review":"This book may be great, that is if, you are into the technical jargons of photography. I would not suggest this book for a novice, amateur or even semi pro. This book gives me the feeling that the author knew what he was talking about but he just could not but it into Layman's term for you the grasp the idea behind lighting for different projects. I also thought it lacked a great amount of information and studio problem solving techniques."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Musician -- DO NOT MISS!","review":"I don't usually care to share my opinions, but I have to break my normal silence and rave about this musician. I'll agree with a previous reviewer that the album \\"Ghost Repeater\\" is a little more polished than his earlier two albums, and that it makes for a slightly weaker finished product. But this young musician is absolutely astonishing. His lyrics are beautiful and thought provoking, and his haunting music gets you in the ears and in the gut. I don't know what genre you'd consider his work -- Folk? Blues? Bluegrass? Americana? Country?

His songwriting is in top form here but he's also backed by a full band that includes the distinctive, haunting, moody and soulful electric guitar work of Bo Ramsey, and this is what makes it so special for me.This is a must have if you already know you're a fan of Foucault, but it'll probably also appeal to any fans of the more general genre - excellent, authentic Mid-Western folk/blues/Americana."},{"rating":"1","title":"working so hard at going nowhere","review":"mopey white boy blues and standardized aor muppetry.blech...john mayer and hootie fans rejoice foucault is your man!pithy choruses repeated ad nauseum... for all of it's excessivedetermination at middle of the road mind numbing dull stuck in themud normalcy it sure does have it's fair share of champions...eitherhe's doing something right or you aren't really paying any attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!!!","review":"I love watching this DVD.

The leading lady, Amber, is so obsessed with him, not only does she beg him not to leave her- ugh! - she lets him have sex with her even after he has virtually left her.

The box had visible dents on the bottom corner and along the top. I was concerned that it had been dropped. I purchased the item for my daughter as a Christmas gift so when she opened it, I told her to examine it closely for damage. The packaging appeared to have protected the mixer from direct damage but there were marks on the Artisan band, a mark in the mixer bowl and what appeared to be dried batter all along the top of the mixing wisk. My daughter remarked it appeared used and I had to agree. Was also missing the splash guard. We now have to ship it back and my daughter is without a gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kitchenaid artasian mixer","review":"[...]I qualify my review with four stars because the product is new and so far has had little use.

Jenna immediately thinks of her sister-in-law Sue who (a) could use a break from a rough couple of years and (b) can actually cook. Despite different personalities and approaches to travel, these sisters of the heart lean on each other while God does an amazing work in each of their lives.While I am not new to books by Robin Jones Gunn, this was my first Sisterchicks novel. It was charming and a lot of fun to read. It is just a good reminder that no matter what your stage in life is, God isn't done with us and has plans to use us if we let Him.

The characters are completely uninspired and even when they learn that they will die if it goes dark, they dont take even the most basic steps to survive (candles? gas lamps?). Frustrating, as this could have been an interesting movie, even scary, but its as if the writer & director had an idea for a piece of a movie, but never developed the plot.

First, we are rushed into the heart of the story, without any background or character development. Then, within twenty minutes, we're thrown ahead three days, leaving us with many questions that are never answered. Finally, after an hour of typical frantic people stuck in an impossible situation, we get an ending that just doesn't fit. I was attracted to this film by its clever title and by Hayden Christensen, who I believe to be a very underrated actor, but I was highly disappointed. Vanishing On 7th Street is rushed, sloppy, predictable, and full of plot holes.

I highly suggest getting a GunCon2 if you buy it though cause I don't think it would be half the experiance without it. Just wait till you're playing and the switch over to the gun and just start blasting zombies in the dome. You'll feel cooler than ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"your aim must be dead on","review":"ok here goes avid fan and player here and own all the games in this series.graphics are great sound is great feel of the game is great story line so/so.if you like a shooter game or should i say you like the old resident evil game survivor then this will be the game for you.i bought the game due to collecting anything that deals with resident evil.my biggest complaint is the mechanics of this game it took awhile to get used to and the switching back and forth gives me a headache.that was the biggest down fall to the game as well as a so/so story line.but the graphics thats what made the game also the sound to it gives the creepinss to the game and they did a great job just like the others in the series.if you like shooters then this game is for you but if your like me and enjoy the old fashion resident evil games then it is not for you.if you are collecting like me well then it is a must have for your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!!!!!","review":"I bought this game because I am a HUGE fan of Resident Evil-I was disappointed however because it was so easy I beat this game on the hard setting in less than an hour-if you want my advice, buy one of the other RE games, but as for this one, leave it on the store shelf-it is not worth the 40.00 it costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"done already?","review":"Great game, but way, way, WAY too short.

I am really upset with you about RE Dead aim and RE Outbreak. I think you are just getting lazy. I loved resident evil 2, 3, and code veronica, but the latest RE releases have been greatly disapointing. This game has too many problems (ie: length, blandness). Don't buy it, rent it first and then decide. I am not buying any more games produced by Capcom until they realease Resident Evil 4 for the Playstation2 as well as the Gamecube. For those of you who don't know, Capcom has announced that it will only be realeasing RE 4 for the GameCube and not the PS2 because of a contact they have with Nintendo. It is just plain wrong.

If you spend the amount of time on video games as I do, the replay factor of a game has to be good, with dead aim it just isn't.The graphics, armory, story line are all top notch. However, the fact that I beat this game in two days, on normal difficulty, ruins it all. The bosses need to be a little more difficult or simply more of them. Now that I have beat it I can't bring myself to sit down and waste any more time on such a short game.My suggestion for improving this game would be to add at least three more levels, maybe in the sequel.However this would be an excellent game for renting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"wack to the third power","review":"man if you buy this wack game something is wrong with you mentally. i want to write capcom a hate letter for this game. i dont know what they were thinking makin this crap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Operational Platitudes - All Flash and No Substance","review":"Overall, I was very disappointed with this book. I agree with the general concept of Costanza's philosophy, but he left out the chapter on how to actually deploy his methodology. Platitude after platitude, I read about the results I could expect, but was left empty handed when it came to implementation. In addition, I felt that I have already read about this concept while reading about the Toyota Production System and Goldratt's Theory of Constraints among other mathematically based technologies. It appears that all Costanza has done is packaged and marketed existing manufacturing methodologies into a \\"new\\" technology."},{"rating":"1","title":"perhaps a starting point","review":"Flow technology was once used at our organization but has been replaced by the traditional Lean and Six-Sigma tools and initiatives.

It is my opinion that this is just \\"new\\" marketing of an old good idea.As for the book itself -- is primitively written, fails to explore notions that need exploring and, at the same time, wastes pages explaining simplest things, including even formulas (something like \\"... quantity would be 120 times 17 times 2 divided by 7.5...\\" -- you got the picture).Overall, very dissatisfied with the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Defines the ultimate business strategy for the new millenium","review":"A clear and concise look at why manufacturing companies must change (or die) in our competitive marketplaces.

Since we had the rare opportunity to produce the American premiere of \\"Kevin's Bed\\" from the Abbey Theatre last season (and will also be doing the American premiere of \\"Stella By Starlight\\" from the Abbey this season), I needed accurate information on contemporary Irish home interiors; not easy to find on this side of the Atlantic! This book has an interesting architectural mix from restored 18th century mansions to rural cottages with richly detailed large color photographs packed with just the kind of information that I was looking for. I would recommend this as a reference book for interior designers, Irish enthusiasts or anyone needing this kind of unique visual material."},{"rating":"2","title":"The homes - grand and small - of the Emerald Isle","review":"This book provides an illustrated tour of Ireland's homes. It doesn't shy away from the colonial past and even foregrounds how the grand country homes of the Anglo-Irish were an example of militant grandeur, the title of the first chapter. On p. 61, there's an extraordinary traveling shrine hung with 15th and 16th century Russian icons now found in Bantry House.At the end of the book there are cottages and buildings repurposed as houses. The photography is excellent. I've given it four stars because there's not an overall sense of Irish history but rather a series of different houses.

Such is the case with this title in the new \\"Universal Classics\\" series featuring Berg and Schoenberg Concertos, originally made in the early 1970s for Deutsche Grammophon. I fell in love with conductor Rafael Kubelik years ago after being introduced to his recordings of Dvorak, and he produces the same glowing results here. Of course performing with first rate soloists and orchestras is also key -- Szeryng and the Berlin Philharmonic on the Berg VC, Brendel and the Bavarian RSO on the Schoenberg PC, and Zeitlin and the Berliners once more on the Schoenberg VC. With budget lines being aimed at classical beginners, I'm not sure how many of them will opt to buy these 20th Century masterpieces, often wrongly maligned as dissonant and unlistenable.

It is just nuts to think about how attached to the character, Meliara, I was. Romance between Meliara and her arch-rival Vidanric blossoms and enhances in this book. I just loved the part where Vidanric starts twirling Meliara's ring around his finger under his gloves, with Meliara, as stubborn as she is, refuses to think about what that is under his gloves. Smith has created a wonderfully intelligent, funny, and smitten character who is unafraid to voice her opinion, a bad thing in the days this book takes place. But Meliara's loud mouth and rude unthought of comments to Vidanric only leads their relationship in the direction it should uncontiously go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ya' can't find another book better to read.","review":"Court Duel is the BEST book I have ever read. It is the kind of book that you could read over and over again, and never get sick of it- or its characters. Meliara is opinionated and smart, Bran. is totally clueless, Sheverath aka Vidanric is mysterious and witty. These characters along with all of the others make Court Duel interesting, funny, exciting, and just great all at once. You've got everything in this book. Buy this book! Its is SO worth your money!Oh- and another reviewer wrote about Smith's website- what is it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, too good to be just 'Fantasy'","review":"Superb book, Meliara is a truly brilliant character who develops smoothly throughout the novel, she makes mistakes as she goes through but learns from them.

All the other humorous side characters, the detailed societies and cultures.One thing I particularly loved was the subplots....It just WORKED really, really well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative and Well Written Story","review":"I loved this book, and I loved reading about the land of Remalna.

So many fantasy books out there are filled with the same dragons and dull female heroines who try to be male but don't pass. As for Meliara in this tale, she's as true as you can get. She's feminine but also manages to pull of a few sword tricks and saddle races quite well.Action and Adventure, and some soul searching too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Among My Favorites","review":"It's hard to find a book that can keep its pace quick and interesting, delve deeply into human behavior -- in this case, court behavior -- and still give you enough information that you don't miss the first book at all. That is, I read this book without reading Crown Duel and I didn't regret it -- it gave me enough information that I didn't need to read the first book. It's also usual that a sequel will just recap everything from the first book in a rush of summary that leaves the reader's head spinning. Here, everything is gradual and well-explained, and old characters are not thrown at you as if you know them. It's ... fresh, young, and moves fast enough to keep the reader wanting more.All around, there are few books I have enjoyed as sincerely or thoroughly as this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CRAZY URGE TO WEAR GOWNS","review":"I've never noticed before.

This duo was interesting in a few places, enough to keep me going till the end, but the characters were not very consistent or well developed in my view. Bran I found very annoying, Mel's character seemed to change completely from the spunky hill girl to court wanna-be to lovesick girl. The secret letters were intriguing very briefly but the way he was revealed was unsatisfactory how Mel just fell in love with him like that. The letters were only about how to handle politics!

I enjoyed \\"Crown Duel\\" and wanted to follow our feisty Countess on her adventure, but alas, she turned out to be a one-trick pony. By which I mean that all the drama is based on her persistently being suspicious of the man she was obviously destined to fall in love with. (These are books in the Romance genre so that was evident from the start.)Even so, I read and read, and then scanned and scanned, and finally just blew off a few pages here, and there, until I jumped to end and said... fine, back to the library with you.My advice: if you AREN'T an old lady, like me, that's more demanding of a book .AND. you enjoyed \\"Crown Duel\\" a lot, then give this one a try.

The only reason it's a 2 instead of a 1 is because i like the road track style racing it has. (on only two different road tracks, and like 5 different total tracks) But It isn't good enough to even be called a rip-off of gran turismo. they have kind-of simlar tracks. but not near as many. and on a rating of 1-10 for graphics auto modellista gets a 1. the cars look like they were drawn for a comic book or something. they don't even look real. you have a career but you don't have to buy cars. you have to earn like 10 if that and most of them aren't even that great. you can have any car you want and any number of cars you want for no cost. the game is not even a challenge. it sucks. i totally regret buying this game. its a waste of money. this game isn't even a fraction of the game that gran tuismo is...

This was old cheezy concrete that should have been drilled into like a hot poker going into butter.

Not a single serious historic account of such an idiotic claim yet it continues to persist in the Western discourse. Why? Well, it feels better when the only true country of the people and for the people is painted all black. And whenever people in this country try to even think of uniting for the better living and greater fairness in distribution of wealth, they are immediately checked by images of \\"evil Stalin\\" and \\"20 million dead\\". But why the heck it is only 20 million? Amis's rival in anti-Sovetizm Mr. Solzhenitsyn claimed it was 60 million! Come on, Amis, don't be shy! If you are writing a lie, make it audacious, loud!

Apparently for such a literary person Amis never bothered to pick up even one book by Alexander Solzhenitsyn or other critics of the Soviet Union. Plenty of people were quite aware of the atrocities occurring in the Soviet Union *as they were occurring* and it was common knowledge in the 1950s in the West of the pogroms, jailings and killings. Read some Solzhenitsyn if you want a true study of the mindset that created the horrors of Russian communism."},{"rating":"1","title":"The truth in an unreadable form","review":"This book is a failure if its purpose is to document Stalin's murders. Solzhenitsyn and Anne Applebaum have done it more than adequately. Amis has a lot of baggage concerning fellow-travelling family and friends which intrude here and is the real subject of this book. His personal concerns spoil his discussion of Stalin's crimes and the horrendous apparatus of death which the Bolsheviks created.I cannot see the point of this book at all.

I actually had to stifle the impulse to yell at them out loud - LOOK OUT!I've read the book four or five times since then and it gets better with each reading. Scott's ability to transport you into his character's world is second to none.

Carroll's descriptions of living death -- of the experience of death itself -- is as haunting as the story itself is touchingly humane. It's ultimately a love story, a love story that makes a very real, human, even flawed love shared by real, human, flawed characters a love that's stronger than death or the impulse to control. In this novel, like others, Carroll stretches our conceptions of reality so that we can properly see the mundane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Except the animals at the zoo","review":"The story is merely a vehicle for ideas which don't hold up to analysis.

Actually, I did not put this one down, I threw it across the room after reading a scene where the leading couple is in the elephant cage at the zoo and a group of children take the trunk of the baby elephant and pull it through the bars until its head pops and the elephant dies. The book does not have this violent tone up until this point (which is about 3/4ths of the way through), and this scene seems to pop up out of nowhere. I was slogging along trying to involve myself in the plot (which is weak), and I just couldn't take any more. I do not recommend this book, even as a loaner from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enjoyable for me","review":"A friend who thoroughly enjoyed this book sent me a copy.

It seems like she just did a computer search for matching names. I gave up reading anything but the recipes when I got the Passover song that went to the tune --'There's no business like show business'.In conclusion the recipes are OK but if you don't have any books go for some real gems like the healthy Life Kitchen, the 30 day one or THM or even get 'Dairy Free Cooking' all have great recipes without the junk.

Unfortunately, the writer presents the popular view that Satanic abuse is strictly psychologically based, done by people who are mentally ill. It is not possible to be satanically abused if Satan is not the cause of the abuse. Satan is not a mental illness. Satan is a very real devil who uses real people to torture and mutilate people's minds and bodies, especially children. After deliverance from Satan (typically by a Catholic priest) then the person needs help because his psyche has been warped. But as long as the existence of Satan is denied then those who have been abused in Satanic rituals will not be helped.

It seems like the blade width should taper, and the widest part should be close to the center; this one does not taper at all. Also, the volume is two cups (not three) with the blade in.Today the food processor finally stopped working, after about 40 uses. I was trying to mash some very well-cooked potatoes, about 3/4 cups at a time, cubed into 1/2-square inch pieces, and the thing began smoking and smelling of burning electronics.

Because the only thing I found that it did well was to chop olives. Everything else needed to be cut into little tiny pieces (including the soft bananas and fresh strawberries I tried to puree in juice to make smoothies) before processing. Even then this machine didn't do a complete/consistent job. Yes - the blades are VERY sharp - which is good - but the ring they are mounted on is small and it's hard to handle without getting cut - I suggest using gloves.

I begged him for a food processor for my birthday after seeing his mom's (she has the gigantic 14 cup cuisinart from the 80's and I swear that thing runs like a truck). I was so excited to have a little one to help me with batches of pesto.However, this thing really doesn't do much. It tends to shove everything up above the blade, and I spend more time taking the lid off and stirring stuff around than I do actually getting anything done with it. It's quicker for me to chop by hand and as for purees, it's easier to use a blender than to bother with this. I'm hoping to get a larger cuisinart soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work!","review":"I bought this item since it has a very good review by costumers, however, the processor I received does not turn on.

So - not a replacement but I'll still review it objectively. It is inexpensive so it's components reflect the price point: lighter and flimsier. The base is not heavy and feels somewhat unstable. The bowl is difficult to line up and click into place, the blades's anchor is light cheap plastic and if I let it run for even an extremely short amount of time (say, to chop a few nuts) it starts overheating and a burning smell ensues. I would say that it's only use would be for extremely light chopping jobs or perhaps making mayonaise or salad dressings. That's not enough utility for me, so I will replace with a more expensive model that I hope will last like my original 20+year-old one which I've bequeathed to my son."},{"rating":"2","title":"small compact","review":"the product is great for what i needed. i am tight for room because i am deployed to afghanistan, it took a little longer to get here then i thought but i really have no complaints about the product. it works amazing for what i needed it for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I hoped for","review":"This was just not what I hoped for.

You have to have Superman reflexes to slow this thing down, but it does a great job. There is a dull and a sharp side to the blade, but won't matter....both sides will make mush out of an onion in no time flat. But, for me, just so I don't have to chop the onion by hand is a blessing. I guess once you get the hang of it, you can get it to just chop in larger pieces, but so far, it has been juice city for me. But, this little devil has plenty of power and is great looking and super easy to clean. I would give it an A minus.

I bought this item in hopes of having a smaller version to use for smaller jobs like dressings, etc., which wouldn't take up as much space in the dishwasher.

I decided to treat myself to a up-scale chopper that looked nice on my counter. I have had a large Cuisinart for years and have never regretted that choice. I read the reviews and although I saw a somewhat positive overall score, I failed to realize that the only people who liked this machine were those who puree things or make smoothies. For the rest of us, this appliance is useless. It does a terrible job of chopping onions, carrots, herbs, nuts and just about anything at all. Pieces are unevenly chopped. When chopping onions, you end up with a soupy puree with a few large chunks floating in it. Sounds unappetizing doesn't it. Actually I never realized how great my cheap little B&D chopper was. So I am giving this away to the Salvation Army and returning to my un-sexy but ever so effective old chopper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should come with a disclaimer","review":"Same thing happened to me as to another reviewer. I was mixing a small amount of aleady grated Parmesan cheese with breadcrumbs I had just made in the processor, and the blade must have hit a small chunk of cheese and went right through the side of the bowl, putting a hole in it and breaking in half. Scared the heck out of me, breadcrumbs all over the place, and a broken blade and bowl. Would cost me $24 to replace both, so I might as well buy a new one (a different brand, of course!). I'm mostly just glad I didn't get hurt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very limited use","review":"I have had this model for about 2 years and I found it very disappointing. In order for it chop up an onion, for example, you need to hand cut the onion into several *very small* pieces -- otherwise the blades chop some of the onion and leave other parts unchopped. It's good for items that are already small --like nuts, but it's a nusiance for chopping vegetables. Another issue: the plastic lid is of poor quality -- the lid has developed a small hole on top and now I have to keep my finger over the top to prevent liquid from spraying out. This mini chopper is a good idea with poor execution. I am surprised these are still being made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I received the Mini-prep as a wedding gift and have used it 10-15 times. It did a good job chopping nuts, onions etc. Unfortunately, the motor died this morning. I didn't expect this from such a well-known and respected company.

For the small stuff, I'll stick to a knife and a cutting board."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dosen't Chop","review":"This machine looks nice, but it dosen't chop very nice. It just turns my vegetables in a mashy, ground-up mess! You should get one of the manual ones with the rotating blades. I'm back to the old knife and cutting board method. It's a heck of a lot easier! I like the design and appearence of this machine. Only if it worked as good as it looks it would be perfect! You can't put ice or thick things in this or it will wreck it. My friend had a similar one and they busted the hell out of it after putting ice in it.

It's cute on the outside, but it's good for nothing but taking up counter space. The first one worked for about 5 seconds. The second one NEVER came on at ALL. It is beyond frustrating.

I'm sure there are things that this does that I can't do or faster than I can do it, like grinding spices or coffee, but I already had a coffee grinder.In summary, I'd still give it a 4 because it is made well, and is versitle, and finely minces things faster than I can with a knife, without losing fingertips:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"yeah i had one, it was a pain in the ass!","review":"i'll make this short and simple. it mashes. it dosent chop. it is supposed to mince and chop vegetables not destroy them, which it most certainly does.

When we went to replace the blade and bowl we discovered that we'd end up paying more than we originally paid for the whole unit. Under the circumstances, we've decided not to replace it. And the item was advertised as being able to grate small amounts of cheese. This is the second item by Cuisinart that we've purchased that has proven disappointing for the money invested.

By processing in small batches and pulsing on low, you can get acceptable chopping for salsa ingredients, etc. The one thing I do stay away from is grating cheese. I tried it once and thought I was going to kill my mini-prep, I grate by hand. As far as clean-up goes, you need to use a glove, dish rag, or (my personal favorite) sponge to remove the blade from the shaft so you don't get cut by the blade.As long as you don't try to make it do the work of a machine 2 or 3 times it's size the mini-prep is a great little processor. You wouldn't try to tow a house trailer with a Mini Cooper would you?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!!!!","review":"I can't believe some people would give this a bad review. Mushy vegetables? No way. You have to pulse the buttons (the manual says do not press the button for longer than one minute--I pulse every 10-15 seconds). I have a big cuisinart that I also love. The chopper gets used about 5 nights a week. I made tabbouleh in about 10 minutes using the mini-chopper. It is so awesome, my sister was visiting when it arrived and is also going to get one.

After entering frozen state, unit would be unresponsive, no buttons worked. From time to time it would go into \\"debug mode\\" for no apparent reason.

(Sometimes the kid doesn't even give you any real attack weapons) After you use them, you lose them until you \\"sign out\\" it took me three days to beat the first \\"boss\\".I don't know what the creators were thinking when they made this game... It is a big turn down for hardcore fans.I don't mind a challenging game, but this game has a stupid plot, and a harder control.

He's got everything money can buy so he only has one dream left to achieve: immortality. He employs a Yugoslavian doctor to help him. That's the main plot of \\"Descent from Xanadu\\", and it's not enough to fill a 400 page novel. Hence, most of the novel consists of various subplots, none of which are the least interesting. It's endless descriptions of plane flights and business meetings, and of course, sex. All of the sex scenes are very short, but always very imaginative (\\"Her buttocks began to roll in orgiastic frenzy. \\"Master! Master!\\" she screamed. \\"Make me a baby! Please, make me a baby!\\").I really don't mind trash, but it has to be entertaining. \\"Descent from Xanadu\\" is just boring.

The first and last paragraphs in the book are as well crafted as anything this writer has ever done. I congratulate him for them.Unfortunately the 309 pages poured in between (hardcover edition) bespoke more the juvenile fantasies of Mr Robbins' possibly \\"chemically enhanced\\" lifestyle than of any kind of cogent narrative. Puerile sexual encounters more suitable for a school-boy's wet dreams and pathetic attempts at drama interspersed with one dimentional characters make this trivial book worthy of zero stars, except Amazon doed not allow for that.A narrative, like a movie, should encourage us to suspend our disbelief and become engaged in the lives and trials of the characters.

This book doesn't ever stop inspiring me every time I read her words and look at her images."},{"rating":"2","title":"So beautiful","review":"The pictures in Annie Leibovitz's most recent work: A Photographer's Life: 1990-2005 are intensely personal and arresting. Annie Leibovitz is my favorite photographer and this most recent work is a testiment to her vision and talent. The pictures are a collection of her professional life and her personal life, with many pictures of her parents, children, deceased partner and other family members. Every time I open the book, I see something new that I missed upon the previous viewing. Her pictures make you feel akin to the subjects that are in them. She shows the beauty in what most would feel was mundane matter. She is, simply put, the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and Surprisingly Enjoyable","review":"As a novice in the arts world, I can honelsty say I was plesantely surprised with the work of Annie Leibovitz. As a gift for the wife, she was taken back by beauty of the numerous shots of celebrities and even Annie's own family. A great piece of art to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"scrapboook","review":"I expected samples of her best photos. It really is documentary of Annie's life. As such it is of interest - I hope her next book will be examples of future work. She is a fabulous photographer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, a real DOWNER","review":"This book was given to me, via an Amazon.com gift certificate, by a friend. I enjoy photography and thought that this book would be an great addition to my collection of photography books. Annie Leibovitz... WOW!!! I couldn't wait until the book arrived. Unfortunately, I didn't take the title of this book literally. My mistake. The abundant collection of photographs did include beautiful and inspiring shots, but there were an overwhelming number of photos which depicted the deteriorating illness of her life partner and many photos of her aging parents. The book also included photos of hospital beds, funeral shots, and grave sites. All a bit much for me and a real downer. I should have previewed the book in a local book store before purchasing it online."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoot t the graphic design team","review":"After seeing the exhibition (which was fantastic) the book was a sad let down for me and I returned it. Photos were cropped detroying the ambiance or the layout Leibovitz captured and aparently intended in her prints - photos were designed across a spread in such a way as interfered with the photo's integrity (one photo in particular has the page split running through the subject of the photo!). The personal photos of Sonatag in the show were very small and suggested a particular delicacy and intimacy which was lost in the book due to the relative sizing of those prints with all the others. It is a poor accompaniment to an excellent and important show of her work. If you never saw the show - you could propably let it slide - after seeing the show myself, I prefer not to have my memory tainted by an inferior product serving as representation."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the Gutter!","review":"GREAT PHOTOS BUT ANNOYING TO LOOK AT!!!! Visually this book is claustrophobic. The images seem forced to fit into a book that is too small to hold them. And probably half of the pictures are across the gutter--very annoying. Sometimes the most important part of the picture is in the gutter. My personal favorite is Michael Jordan with his nose in the gutter. Random House, if you are going to do a book on a great photographer like Annie Liebovitz, do a better job than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annie Liebowitz' photography book","review":"What a waste of my money... the entire book is of her and her family, and not the type of book I expected it too be. Its filled with lots of self expression naked photos of her that are not attractive even as art work.If I could I would send it back for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland and boring","review":"I don't really know any of the author's work. This was my first exposure to her and I had a hard time seeing what is so great about it. 3/4 of the book is full of b/w pictures of people lounging around at their worst. Anyone could have taken many of the pictures.There are some decent portraits but nothing that you can't find in three dozen other books from a lot of authors.I have heard her referred to as the greatest American photographer of the 20th century, maybe there are things she did a long time ago somewhere that prove it but this book just can't be a showcase of why she is so great..."},{"rating":"1","title":"great if you're her cousin...","review":"she is one of the great portrait photographers. her work is intelligent and her images approach iconic in status. that said, this book is not what you want to see. it is primarily about her private life and the photos just are not interesting unless perhaps you're her cousin or something. any of her other books blow this one away and wll contain the amazing work you associate with her name. this should have been entitled: \\"300 boring pictures of susan sontag\\". should be remaindered in a couple of months. save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Establishment Hack","review":"Annie Lebowitz was what was happening in photography twenty or thirty years ago. Now she is a pseudo establishment hack (see her recent collaberation with Disney if you doubt this).She is paid to produce commercial photos with an Annie Lebowitz patina which apparently still has some commercial cache with Vogue and other dying retail print platforms.This collection of photos have a emotional range that starts with the incredibly self-indulgent and tapers off into her now hackneyed commercial style.If you want to see some photography with artistic integrity I would suggest a copy of Apeture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed after all","review":"I was very excited to win this book as a prize for a photo contest tied to the Annie Liebowitz exhibit in SF, CA. My photo was related to families. I acknowledge the other reviewers. The graphic layout of the photos reduced the value of her beautiful work. This book is important. It's production should have accorded it the same treatment. Who was in charge of its publication? Was Annie consulted? I can't imagine it. Actually it would make me feel better to think that she wasn't included in the approval cycle; how could you do this to yourself?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Photographer's Life 1990-2005","review":"What a privilege to own this book. Annie Liebovitz has a special eye for the profound and exceptional picture. This is like a glimpse into her most personal life as well as her career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Swing and a miss","review":"As a professional photographer I've been a fan of Annie for a long time and she's on the top of my list of those who've influnced my work. However, in this effort it strikes me as a vanity piece. Her family photos are interesting to her family and maybe someone else but I'm not sure who that might be. Her landscapes are marginal at best. She even states that she was provided a helicopter to shoot some landscapes and they came out blurry but the magazine used them anyway. I'd recommend she stick to what she does so well: hoopla. Stick to the celebrity stuff Annie. Access is 90% of your success. Anybody want to buy a copy? Viewed only once and in perfect condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"pleased with book and speed of delivery","review":"I was delighted with the price of $45. The book was like new. I ordered it late on Thursday the 12th of January. It was delivered to me on Wednesday the 18th. Monday was Martin Luther king day . (no postal delivery)I had no complaints and can whole heartedly recommend the seller."},{"rating":"2","title":"great deal","review":"Great price compared to stores! Tons of beautiful photos by this famous lady - very good ideas for photography too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revealing, interesting, and impressive","review":"Leibovitz reveals a lot about herself in this massive volume. I was expecially taken with the Susan Sontag photos: in good health, sick, and finally dead. Her opening essay gives insight into how this book was constructed and explains the logic for the order.This is more than a coffee-table book and I can guarantee you will go through it many times as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!","review":"This book is the perfect coffee table book for everyone. Whether one is familiar with Annie Liebovitz or not, her pictures quickly draw the viewer into the pages. Once opened it is hard to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Photograhers Life 1990 - 2005 by Annie Leibovitz","review":"I found the volume too personal to enjoy.I enjoyed the PBS special so much more. It gave me the insight that I wanted into the personality and approach to photography that is unique to Ms Leibovitz.I did read many reviews prior to purchasing the book, and I still had to buy it and form my own opinion. Without a doubt Annie Leibovitz is a master photographer, and this book would probably appeal to many. But I find family and death a bit to personal for me to share with strangers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great a family photo album","review":"As a somewhat serious hobbyist photographer, I suspected, when I read the negative \\"family photo album\\" review, that that person was insensitive to such qualities as fine composition that might distinguish these photos. Leibovitz is a great photographer. I decided to look at the book before purchasing such an expensive book. There is, I am afraid, some merit in the negative comments. Many of the personal life photos do in fact come across as snapshots of no particular distinction. Obviously these photos have great personal meaning for Leibovitz. Some of the reviewers seem to be able to emphathize with that meaning. Perhaps these photos will help some feel better about the quality of their own family snapshots. I would advise people to examine this book before buying, as I did. I chose not to invest in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Conant is back with a worthy new addition to the series","review":"Being a big fan of this series, I naturally looked forward to this newest edition, but with some trepidation because Conant's last book was a bit of a disappointment to me. But Holly Winter, Rowdy and Kimi are back in true form in \\"The Barker Street Regulars\\". It is fast paced, involving, and touching, one of my favorites. This book is intelligent, and not just for the dog-lover (although I think someone with no interest in dogs would not get as much out of this series, as, say, someone who is a dog nut like myself)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barker street regulars","review":"good read. If you ever read any sherlock holmes stories the references in this book will keep your mind searching. Just like a sherlockian mystery you will be kept guessing to the out come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I received this book for my birthday, being someone who shows dogs, and I've read it four times since. The storyline is original without being too weird and the characters evoke many emotions. Susan Conant writes as though the main character is actually talking to you, not just normal first person, which is refreshing. Although I was sometimes confused by the hints to Sherlock Holmes, I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to dog lovers. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Conant does it again","review":"As a long standing Conant fan, I can proudly say The dog owning methods of holly winter trained me how to raise my own dog. I picked up the later, Black Ribbon over two years ago, and deciede I too wanted a dog. personally i don't condone that type of influencial and spontanious pet buying. but that same summer I adopted my Golden, Murray from a local shelter. ILP'd him, earned a CGC, and so far have a leg torwards our CD. He eats Eukanuba, sleeps with me on a king sized bed, and lives the sweet life. thanks to Conants great books, murray isn't euthanized, I've got a great hobby, and lots of new friends, and learned to love the modern day mystery. Kudos, Mrs. Conant-whereever you are!"},{"rating":"1","title":"one I never reread","review":"I'm sure sherlock holmes fans will love it. But if you read this series for the dog trivia, what you get in this one is tons of Holmes trivia. If you know nothing about Sherlock Holmes, you'll be bored through most of it. Either Conant was getting bored with dogs, or she decided to try and garner more readers through a little expansion. The ploy didn't work well with me. I also found the new characters in this book, Althea and Cici, tiresome and wordy. More dogs, please. Stay with dog clubs or an obedience trial and leave Holmes to non dog mysteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Conant Book!","review":"What's not to love about this book? Malamutes, a strong female character, therapy dogs and corrupt animal communicators all contribute to a fun, fast moving mystery. As usual, Conant communicates through Holly wonderful dog training tips and great information on responsibility to our Canine companions. I was very pleased that this book had more Kimi in it as she is one of my favorite characters. I'm certain I have Rowdy and Kimi's alter egos living in my house (except they are two Samoyeds).I eagerly look forward to Ms. Conant's coming novels.

I had a very difficult time playing this album, much less converting it to mp3 files. Out of three computer cd players, the disc only played in one, a Toshiba that came with my office Dell. It didn't work on my Plextor or Sony players at home. Of three stereo cd players, it only played on one. When I was able to use the cd burner, I burned a new disc, which played just fine in all players. I don't know if this is because the disc is Dual Disc or what.My point is that if you have problems, keep on trying.

Instructions for assembly were ok except that the pieces did not fit together well or securely. Very many times during building, one part would knock off another part even when I did it.

The text is both lyrical and telling, and written in a way that celebrates both An Mei's Chinese birth mother and her American adoptive parents. Because it is written in the child's voice, my adopted Korean daughter found it easy to express her feelings about her own adoption story and to find comfort in knowing that other kids have similar questions and feelings.As important as the text, the illustrations in this book are incrediably beautiful and soothing. They tell the story of abandoment and new-found love in an honest but non-threatening way.We continue to enjoy this book at home and I have given it as a gift to a number of friends who have Chinese-born daughters.I highly recommend An Mei's Journey for both children and adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BOTHER","review":"DO NOT BOTHER to buy this .

The sound transfer is not very good, not horrible, but the very first chords are attenuated and it sounds like someone upped the volume than and was too lazy to do it over. It is filmed on a huge stage, so the dancers are given lots of room to strut their stuff, but a filming of a live performance might have been, well, livlier. There is an emotional flatness about the whole endeavor, though Act Two emerges more effectively in that regard than Act One.

Lots of games can be player in 360 even if they are just XboxI was wrong..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Camera Crisis 3","review":"To put it simple: this is five star action/horror game that is drastically degraded by the worst camera system I have ever seen in my life. The camera systems should never be the most challenging part in a game. lol. I died more times from the silly camera than anything else. If you believe you can get over the flawed camera system in the game, this game is for you. I highly suggest watching some videos on youtube of gameplay so you get an idea what the camera system is like. I seriously almost stopped playing the game due to the frustration, but I'm a pretty hardcore gamer. So I sucked it up and fought my way to the end. In conclusion, if you are easily frustrated by terrible camera systems this game is not for you, but if you love for action/horror, space, or dinosaurs is greater than your hatred for bad camera systems this game is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"another dinosour crisis","review":"Ok bottom line,worst game ever. nice graphics but blended with boring gameplay,bad mix.Some of the puzzles are fun in their own stupid way.but other than that, this crisis can only be salveged as another whipty ding dong button masher(and thats putting it so mild its funny!)so take this from me steer clear of this abomination because the way this thing plays I wouid dare not to think this game was created and made in the prehistoric days!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"me again","review":"I personly think that the camara angles aren't that bad, yes they can be frusterating when your fighting a boss and you cant see it. But it adds suspence not seeing what your shooting. And the game has an auto aim so if your shooting an enemy off screen you'll still be hiting it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Capcom's first real flop. :(","review":"I have played DC, DC2, and DC3. The first 2 games were great, but DC3 is the worst Capcom title ever. My main reason for this is the horrable camra angles, most of the time you are forced to shoot off screen. Sometimes right in the middle of a fight the CA will change several times head aches are common. To top that off the story line makes no sense at all. This is very disappointing as I am a die hard Capcom fan. I hope that they would remake DC3 for Xbox 360 or PS3 because if they don't this is a sad ending to the first two great games... all it did was leave most people confused and upset."},{"rating":"2","title":"This game is wonderful!","review":"I've been hearing a lot of folks talk about how horrid thecamera angles are. DO NOT expect the same out of this gameas a 3rd person game!! Once I accepted this game for what itwas, I began to realize this game is refreshingly different andhad a TON of fun! The graphics are amazing and the cut scenesare top quality and VERY entertaining. I did, however, takeissue to the direction they went with the surviver in the story-line. In the end I was sad that the game was over. Hats off toCapcom! I really hope the franchise stays alive and maintainsthis level of excellence."},{"rating":"1","title":"3,2,1... Throw Controller!","review":"Something bad happened during playtesting for this title. To be precise, it seems like nobody was playtesting it. A 3rd person camera flicks maddeningly from one bad location to another, constantly leaving your enemies off-camera, making dodging and aiming (not to mention *crate jumping puzzles!*) a complete and utter joke. No surprise the original Dino Crisis development team had nothing to do with this visually beautiful yet disastrous title (Yes, the spaceship is beautiful).To say the gameplay is bad would be doing a disservice: it just doesn't WORK.A big WT_? for Capcom on this unfinished bow-wow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely a Must have","review":"This book is essential for anyone who lives life. Great for a salesman or anyone who faces defeat on a regular basis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last of the Aliens Series","review":"And no wonder. This book is probably to blame for the lack of anymore Aliens novels to be written. Out of all of the Aliens vs. Predator & Aliens novels this one was the worst.Music of the Spears has the concept of a composer on the brink of insanity that needs the screams of a live alien to complete his latest masterpiece, however,It by far goes into too much detail in areas that have no impact on the story. The characters are bland and uninteresting with too many paragraphs, if not chapters, being devoted to bringing us into the minds of these characters.Stay away from this stinker unless you have a case of insomnia as I've found myself falling asleep while reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 books for my Sunday school class for 2 year olds.","review":"Bought God Knows My Name, Jesus Loves Me, and Jesus Loves The Little Children.

Right out of the factory sealed package 10 out of the 12 plates I ordered were scratched or had defeats. Plus they were packed very poorly by the company and about 7 out of the 12 were either chipped or damaged. These plates are very very poor quality and I would recommend NOT BUYING THESE PLATES. I have never been so disappointed in a purchase quite like this. I received a refund within 48 hours and if I could give it a zero star, I would. Don't waste your time or money... go with something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the kind of landscape design book I expected.","review":"This book has plenty of ideas for backyards, but they're all sketches, not photographs. Plus, you have to order the blueprints to find out what plants they're talking about in the book. This book was not very helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"seems great, but it is junk","review":"It looks like a great sharpener for the classroom, but I have gone through 2 in year.

I recommend the book, but not the seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very positive - not terribly original","review":"The positive tone of this book should be of great value to many BBWs, though the fashion recommendations, which tend towards the conservative, are not likely to appeal to those whose tastes are more Paris than Board Room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"Gave me great ideas to improve my look.

I finally picked it up this past fall when I decided to do a wardrobe overhaul. I am SO glad I did.This book isn't just for and about plus-sizes, it's for every woman who wants to make her clothes work for her, regardless of budget. I have spent over $100 on a sweater that I feel more frumpy in than when I wear my $11 sweater I bought off of Ebay.It's so good, I loaned it to two friends who are not plus sizes. It took me days of begging just to get it back. One friend even told me she was getting compliments on her commuter train on how \\"different\\" she looked. Why? She followed Suzan's advice on how a bra should fit. And I admit, my friend DOES look 100% better with a good fitting bra."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great resource for plus size women that want style tips","review":"This is a very complete book on all aspects of us plus sized women--clothing, style and fit, accessories, makeup, etc. I highly recommend it if you tend to need occasional assistance in fit and style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great hit like the original Vac Man...Great Toy!!","review":"Like I said in the other review, I bought all three for my son.

I am used to victorinox quality and tought this one would be as good as the victorinox, after all, it's very expensive.Not only this piece of crap is chinese made but it also fells and looks like some chinese copy!! And it costs 60 bucks plus shipping!!!!!Many tools you can't open without opening other tools. The awl is blunt and you can't sharpen it because it will cut you even if it's closed. The saw fells like it's going to break just by looking at it.The main blade looks like a toy blade. The material does not look good.The only good thing is the pouch. Great for holding a small can of pepper spray.Overrall a piece of junk I am selling right away and getting another SwissTool.Sorry leatherman, you did very bad this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect ...","review":"I was searching for a, as far as possible, complete multitools and I find it :-)I am just a little bit deceived from the corkscrew ...

Firstly, the \\"bottle/can opener\\" is really just a bottle opener because the front bit is blunt (I suppose you could have it sharpened if you wanted to). The awl is similarly rather blunt; not as sharp or solid as the ones on Swiss Army Knives. The flat-head screwdrivers have a tendency to nick your thumb if you're not careful when prying them out. The fingernail slot for the wood saw is difficult to reach unless you unfold the scissors first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite nice, but missed opportunities","review":"I like it -- a lot -- but the company missed some very easy opportunities. E.g., either, or both, of the straight edges on the handles (when extended) should have had inch/cm markings. Obvious, and no apparent reason why markings weren't included. Also: tweezers would've been nice, and easy to include. And lots of other features. That said, great hand feel -- solid weight and heft -- and useful. But this could have been the ultimate pocket multi-tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I have always heard good things about Leatherman and my last multitool was greatHowever I have already had to return my multitool for repair after only 2 weeks! and won't get it back for a month!I think the quality of their multitools has gone downhill"},{"rating":"1","title":"Got burned, literally","review":"I purchased it, then read the instructions carefully before using it.

Just wonder why it is not discontinued."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned to the store","review":"I had high hopes for this steamer after reading the many reviews, however i recently returned it to the store. It is cumbersome, sporadic heat/steam and doesnt work on heavier garments so I had to iron things anyway! It sat in the corner for most of the time simply taking up space and gathering dust. I am going to look at the portable jiffy steamers after a travelling friend raved about hers."},{"rating":"1","title":"I ended up in the ER...","review":"I put up with the spits and spurts as I enjoyed the large capacity water tank. My first Rowenta quit after only two years and I was foolish enough to buy another one. I always followed directions as steam can be dangerous. The pedal and light stopped working on the second machine. I ended up getting a deep second degree burn. This is an awful machine and trying to work with the company was even worse. I will never buy another Rowenta product. I bought a much less expensive steamer at a department store(on sale). I have to fill it more often, though it has never spit nor spurt. It works better than the Rowenta."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I have four teenagers who love to wear clothes that need to be pressed.

If I had just read the online reviews I would of thought twice about purchasing this book. The short story about the girl who can hear dragons was great but as I proceed to the next chapter I was confused. I was flipping through the front and back of the book wondering if I missed something and why I was reading about some planet being colonized. It was a major let down. The publishers really need to address this because I was so disappointed. I was even more disappointed because I just finished reading another book of short stories (this one was clearly marked on the cover) and was looking forward to something a little more involved or so I thought"},{"rating":"1","title":"What????","review":"I was so utterly confused! I loved the first story and I was really looking forward to hearing more about Aramina, but the next chapter was about some outer space colony! Then, the third was about someone interviewing an opera singer! I thought it was a misprint!

I remember reading The Girl Who Heard Dragons in High School and having the whole book be about Aramina. I loved that one.

If the orginal is somewhere still in print please let me know."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Girl Who Heard Dragons","review":"I was disappointed. I was looking forward to learning more about Armina............. I read a hint in one of Anne McCaffrey's books, that they should be read in the order they came out. This had worked for me.

I was expecting a really good read and i had read a few of the first pages that looked really good! But then this book turned into a technical computer outerspace sort of book.

It was a little too technical and if you enjoy that sorta of stuff, this is probably a very good book for you! overall though, after reading reviews of other anne mccaffery books, i think that her first books were probably the better of the books she has written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"I started reading this book and loved the 1st story but then I got really confused, all of a sudden it totally changed plot. I was expecting the whole book to be about Aramina. It was a real let down because the blurb suggested nothing of the sort.

Had I known this was a collection of short stories, I probably would not have bought this book in the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes!","review":"I really do love Anne McCaffrey's writing and the stories in this book are great. What I didn't like is that it's a collaboration of short stories, but nowhere on the cover does it tell you it's going to be that way!

The documentary on disc two is less like a documentary and more like a long interview, so you don't really feel like you're getting to know the band or get that behind the scenes stuff.This DVD set is very good, but a few little things kind of annoyed me.

But her methods are quite nasty, involving a game of murder and competition.While the script tries for an inventive approach, it still manages to utilize many of the standard cliches: the sleazy motel manager, the corrupt redneck sheriff, the 40ish spinster villain, the retarded son, etc.Tabrett Bethell does a good job as Beth but the late Andy Whitfield as her fiance Cameron, who plays a pivotal role in the first half of the movie, is suddenly removed from the film in an unsatisfying manner.THE CLINIC is set in 1979 for some inexplicable reason purportedly something to do with pre-DNA testing. Ultimately, it's merely an unpleasant film with little redeeming qualities."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING -very disappointed","review":"I watched the entire movie which was a waste. I rented it because of Andy. It is a shame that he lost his life before he had a chance to bring his talent to the world. He will be always be remembered for Spartacus first season.

They cant climb this fence or dig under it, yet wild dogs hang out in this desolate area of course. One of them is stalking the others, trying to rip out the bands in their stomachs...you see, this is what indicates whose baby is whose. Why she doesnt think to ask the other women instead of killing them, is beyond me. Ohhh...and in 1978, early 20 year old pregnant girl have fake breasts, of course! I was kinda hoping to see lactating marks on their gowns to highlight the blood slits. Yeah....and the main actor (stud) simply dies from a flat tire....useless. The \\"twist\\" at the ending attempted to make this a decent movie, but the horrible acting and completely awful plot destroyed this movie, putting it in my Top 10 worst horror movies of all time. One good thing...the main actress is really hot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Visually impressive","review":"Glass Fleet is the story Michel and Cleo trying to free the galaxy from the tyranny of the empire. It's kinda like star wars. If Darth Vader were gay and had braids there wouldn't be much difference. There a lot of interesting characters in this anime. There is a good mix of action and drama. The most impressive aspects of this anime are the animation quality and the space battles. It's a unique anime series and there aren't too many other series that are all that similar. I really enjoyed watching this anime. As I said the characters are the best part of Glass Fleet. The bad guy is so bad that you'll wanna fight him yourself, and the heroes will make you wanna strap up and go to bat with them. Overall Glass Fleet is a solid anime. I'd say that my only complaint is the sick little pervert that always follows Vetti, the bad guy, around everywhere. He's pretty sickening. Glass Fleet will probably be a good addition to your collection. It's not a bad price either."},{"rating":"2","title":"great toy for my neice","review":"This toy was a present for my neice and from all Ive heard its a wonderfull toy.

Corley's writing is fragmented, contradictory, and frustrating. This book has a whopping 64 pages of footnotes, yet there are places where information seems incomplete.

I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"techno tentacles","review":"This CD is a compilation of techno remixes of classic Ozric Tentacles tunes. Most Ozric fans will probably not like it as the first thing to go is the guitar. None of Ed's excellent leads remain on any of these remixes, it's all synth drums and keyboards.

I recommend this album to anyone who loves death metal"},{"rating":"2","title":"More Groove than Earlier Releases","review":"Though I have to disagree with a previous reviewer: There's strong hints of Sabbath in many of these songs, and they ARE a mainstream band; they lose nothing here. The most noticeable difference with most of their previous releases is a concentration on groove as well as melody. There's a bit of downtuned-churning on this one, but I'm one of those guys that loves that. (Terminus is an example)Many of the riffs display with a great attitude, and groove like a slower version of Fear Factory's Demanufacture. It's closest brother for comparison is Character, and it is amazingly eclipsed. The keyboards are allowed to take over large swaths of songs, and they provide that level of depth that only electronics can provide to an already great song. (Icipher, and Empty Me for that example.)The album's overall atmospheric piece is \\"Inside the Particle Storm.\\"If you were to blend Character and Projector together, this is the album you would get."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite CD (out of a 500 CD collection)","review":"This CD is made of songs taken from the hit anime, \\"Samurai Champloo\\". The opening and closing tracks are the opening theme and closing themes, respectively. My favorites are: \\"Shika no Uta (Song of the Seasons)\\", \\"Tubed (Drum Please!!)\\", \\"Sneak Chamber\\", and \\"Dry\\". All the songs are worthy of a five star review. This CD is not only for fans, but any one who enjoys hip-hop beats or urban jazz. The arrangements are worthy of a ghetto Mozart and everytime I listen to a song, I get a visualization of Mugen and Jin beating the crap out of some random guys... It's great! ^_^ But my grandparents can listen to it and just hear the music, as do my parents. Great CD, well worth the money it costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can you say, \\"groovey\\"","review":"After watching the anime, I had to track this soundtrack down. It took some doing, and I thought everyone had bought them all. Being in my car, most of the day, I had time to listen and enjoyed it so much, that all the crazy road rage folks didn't bother me. I knew I wanted it for the theme songs, but found myself liking the beats and feeling where it belongs in the anime. The album is a nice groove, just remember the show, soundtrack and you won't be looking for a regualr movie soundtrack. Go catch the groove of Samauri Champloo, and relax to the sounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Solid Album but......","review":"Like a previous review mentioned, this CD is more like a sampler of the other Original Soundtracks for Samurai Champloo such as the Departure or Masta OSTs which feature more and better tracks from the series. Not to say this release is completely shot as it still provides a good taste or tease of what's better available on the other OSTs. Definitely hip-hop oriented with some great beats, a couple of which I actually sampled for a class audio production project and it worked out great. I also find some of the beats great inspiration for my own work. I gave 2 Stars even though I still enjoy what's on this album, but since there are better OSTs for this great Anime I had to go for a lower rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tracks","review":"To be honest, I didn't care too much for the anime itself, but it has one of the best OST's from an anime I've ever heard; definitely in my top 5. If you like original hip hop and R&B type music, or just the instrumentals, you should be highly satisfied with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great set list.","review":"I've been a fan of Samurai Champloo for a while now, so I kinda knew what to expect from the soundtrack. It's great to hear the full length songs, when on the show, you only get a 10- 15 sec. snippet. I do live sound in a Jazz club, and play the soundtrack during set breaks, and all the time people are asking me what I'm playing. If you like \\"chill out\\" or downtempo I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music froma great show","review":"I LOVE the anime series 'Samurai Champloo\\". Finding a non-import, 'greatest hits' CD of the music from this series has made my entire holiday season! While there's nothing very Yule seasonish about the 17 tracks on this CD, each is an audiophile's pleasant company - from the funk-laced lyrics of 'Battlecry' to the smooth NuFunk of the show's closing theme, this CD is a delight for the ears. All in all, a great album for the fan of the show or just the audiophile on your gift list!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good beats, but they can't stand alone","review":"For the most part, the Samurai Champloo soundtrack plays like the instrumental cuts hip hop artists sometimes release alongside EPs - it's a collection of beats in want of a rapper. They're great beats, and with vocals to complement them they would make great songs, but they are too repetitive to stand alone. Hopefully some aspiring rapper will make use of these, or a grey-album style mix will find its way onto the internet, but the album itself is not recommendable.(That said, the music works very well in Samurai Champloo, and is one of the reasons the show is worth seeing)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have seen the first 4 episodes of Samurai Champloo, and I'm a big fan of the show so far. I love the music and I think it works wonderfully within the show. However, with the exception of 2 tracks (Battlecry and Shiki no Uta), the whole CD is very repetitive and uninspiring. Maybe I've been spoiled by Yoko Kanno scores, but this one just didn't seem to have a lot of life in it. If it had not been included for free with the DVD, I probably would not have gone to the trouble of purchasing it. I'd recommend saving your money for something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"This game....","review":"Rocks! You can grind on rocks! You can grind on rocks...and branches, and dominos.

I wish it were still available - I rented it from the NYPL dance collection once and have not been able to get it again. It consists of Alica Alonso, Carla Fracci, Ghislane Thesmar and Eva Evdokimova dancing reconstructed pieces from the romantic era, which is when ballerinas first started dancing on point - the time of Taglioni, Grisi, Grahn, Cerrito and Essler. I recall that Alonso danced a solo from Roberto the devil and all 4 of them danced the famous \\"Pas de Quatre\\", but I don't remember which solos the other 3 performed. They also discuss elements of the romantic style, and how they approach the ballets. Alonso & Fracci do most of the talking (esp Alonso), but then - they have the most to tell us!

Used it primarily for drinks, smoothies, etc. Used it approximately 2 times a month. Motor quit in the 3rd year. Called KitchenAid and was told that was not abnormal. Highly disappointed in the quality. I thought I was buying top of the line quality. Will not make that mistake again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Died After Minimal Use","review":"I have had this blender for three years and during that time we have only used it to make smoothies. I never thought it was that powerful so perhaps I got a lemon but after the third or fourth use it would only run for a few seconds and then it seemed to bog down and the blades wouldn't turn. So I was stuck with shutting it off, turning it back on, to get the smoothie made. Well, today it finally died a long awaited death. I have always been a big fan of KA products but I will not be replacing this over-expensive model.Buyer beware. If you purchase this yourself I would be sure to use the heck out of it during the warranty period so you can send it back for a replacement should you get a dud like I did. Amazon only replaces within 30 days of purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Blender -- Powerful, Though Sometime Too Powerful","review":"I have owned one of these blenders for more than two years now and love it. That said, don't ever take the top off while you're blending or you'll end up with a kitchen full of wet mess. The blender is so powerful that you can't sneak in more ice, etc. without stopping it. Other than that, I have no complaints. It's powerful and efficient and easy to clean. And I have had no problems with any part breaking or malfunctioning."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"When the plastic jar of my trusty Hamilton Beach blender cracked, I decided to buy a nicer blender, i.e., one with a glass jar, more powerful motor, etc. I went to the store and looked at the selection of Kitchen Aid, Cuisinart, Osterizer and Hamilton Beach models. After taking the jars apart and comparing features, I decided on this Kitchen Aid model. There is no doubt that the blender is composed of high-quality materials. The problem is that it doesn't do as good of a job as my old $30 Hamilton Beach blender. I could blend fruit smoothies with my Hamilton Beach, and NEVER find chunks of fruit in the bottom; with the Kitchen Aid, I find myself pouring the chunky concoction back into the jar for more work. For a blender this expensive, I shouldn't have to blend my smoothie for five minutes in order to ensure that I'm not chewing fruit chunks. Buy a Hamilton Beach and save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blenders should be able to blend!","review":"This blender has a lot of power and I emphasize a lot of power. But this is not the blender for you, if like me, you make shakes, smoothies, and health drinks on a daily basis. This blender does not blend. No matter what the ingredients, no matter how long I blended, there was always unblended bits stuck at the bottom; bits of banana, ice, or protein powder. And because this blender is sooo powerful, there is no way you can even take off the 2-ounce cup to add ingredients. The blender splashes everything to top, so if you want to add anything you have to stop the blender. Plus, you lose a lot of your drink to the very strange plastic lid. I'm returning mine. I've had better performance from less expensive blenders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blender Blow-up!","review":"This blender has a very powerful motor and I've been impressed with it's longevity...I've had it for nearly 10 years! BUT...the design of this model is awful. There have been MANY times when I've lifted the glass jar off the base only to have the entire contents (red tomato sauce, brown chocolate mousse, green pea soup...etc!) drop like a bomb on my kitchen floor and SPLATTER everywhere! Absolutely a party spoiler just before numerous parties I've given! I curse this blender every time I use it and just yesterday, it finally died for good and I am happily shopping for a new and better designed blender. Beware of this blender especially with children. My three kids love to make smoothies but they ALWAYS have this bottom-dropping-out problem with this blender. They cheered when the motor burned up yesterday! Trust me - stay away from this design!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"First of all let me say I have KitchenAid everything- fridge, dishwasher, mixer, coffeemaker, toaster, you name it. I usually love their products. This blender, therefore, was a HUGE disappointment. It died after a year of ownership. Probably only used it about a dozen times, total. It was my first bad experience with KA customer service, which tells me they know something's wrong with the design. They refused to do anything since it was a year old. I won't be replacing it with another KitchenAid, that's for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubber teeth interface to Jar break","review":"I really like this Blender, but the interface to the jar is a series of rubber teeth that tear off at a fairly rapid rate. There is no replacement part and the blender is out of warranty. Doing some research online I found lots of other people with this issue(google: KSB5 rubber teeth) .. I'd choose a blender that has a better interface to the jar."},{"rating":"1","title":"get a fire extinguisher","review":"I have had 2 of these and they work great at first but after awhile of making ice type bar drinks it will smoke and or the electronics wear out.

Shortly after my warranty expired one of the teeth on top of the motor broke when I was trying to make a smoothy. I called Kitchenaid to see what it would take to get repaired and was told $55 plus parts! My previous blender lasted 24 years, worked great, and in that time never needed a repair. So my next blender will NOT be a Kitchenaid as I have no desire to repair or replace such an expensive blender frequently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced and under-quality","review":"This is a cheap, over-priced product. Don't waste you money! I used my blender to make ice and fruit drinks, which were never blended fully.

The entire rubber coupling ground off for no reason all of a sudden one day. I don't use it that often so it wasn't abused. The only time we even crush ice in it is when they are here (once a year). I had an Osterizer for years and never had problems with it. I guess our friends just didn't like the avocado green. Glad I didn't get rid of the Oster. I don't recommned this one. I think Kitchenaid is going downhill. I've had a 5 QT mixer for years and loved it. Then bought the 6QT that has since died after one year.

The viol da gamba, for instance, hadn't even been invented in the lifetime of Dufay. Aside from such purisms, however, this is an out-of-date amateurish version of Dufay -- \\"early\\" Early Music, around 1974. It should be retired. If you want to hear where the art has arrived in the meantime, choose any disk by The Orlando Consort, Ensemble Organum, Ensemble Officium, The Clerks' Group, Capella Alamire, Ensemble Clement Janequin. There are NO well-done CDs of Dufay era masses with instruments; I say this with utmost sadness, since I am an instrumentalist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of pricey.","review":"I have a \\"universal cover\\" from a kitchen store that works just fine and for a lot less money!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"kitchenaid standing mixer cover","review":"Due to lack of space in our kitchen, the kitchen aid standing mixer sits on the couunter.

Well, not perfectly, at least. I have a 5-quart lift-bowl mixer and, while the overall fit is very good, there is a one-inch gap between the bottom and counter.

The trim is black no matter what color you order.Considering the price of the KitchenAid mixer, the price of a good cover is not a big deal.

I'm a fan of RahXephon, my number one reason for picking up this CD, so I obviously love this soundtrack. But it had to grow on me.The first track, Hemisphere, may be the selling point for this CD being as it's the opening track to the series and a good one at that. But the rest of the tracks are very different. Taken from the series, most of the songs are jazz, very dissonant, but enjoyable if you're into it and if you let it grow on you.The best advice I can give you is to listen to the sample songs before you buy it (or find it on [...]). You will know if it's for you when you listen to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful CD","review":"This is a wonderful CD. The words (although not English) and music are very comforting.

I never had general biology before taking the exam. For best use, I read \\"Biology: Life on Earth\\" to give an overview of the topic and the major mechanisms behind it. Then, I used other textbooks which had much more details on the subject. This method worked well, for example, for DNA replication and Protein Synthesis on which \\"Biology: Life on Earth\\" seems to have left out some information. So this is a great biology \\"starter\\" and if you decide/need to know more, other in-depth textbooks will be helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to comprehend, good textbook.","review":"This textbook is a little easier to read than say Raven's Biology. Evolution, the cell and origin of life was explained with a lot of clarity. Although Raven's Biology is a very good book also, I found this book easier to comprehend. However, if you really want excellent test preparation questions get---The Ultimate Study Guide for Biology: Key Review Questions and Answers with Explanations by Patrick Leonardi. It comes in three volumes.

The action is great, the graphics are amazing, and the fact that there are both \\"kids\\" and \\"adults\\" modes makes it even more appropriate for all kids. It is about a comic book/old Japanese movie junkie whose girlfriend is kidnapped by the villains of just such a movie. Joe must step up to become \\"Viewtiful Joe\\", his super-hero alter ego, to save her.Joe's powers include speeding up and slowing down time, as well as zooming in on the action. Each is earned over time, as are additional tricks that you can buy using points you collect by defeating monsters. Speaking of which, the \\"monsters\\" in this game are primarily cartoon robots, which is a pleasant change from the usual drug kingpin/zombie/turtle choices.I like this game a lot, and it is one of my favorite releases of the year, for any platform."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best games this year. A must buy.","review":"Viewtiful Joe is one of the best and most creative games out on the market today. It stars an average Joe sucked into a movie world and given powers to control time, among other things. Joe can slow and speed up time, which are both effects done much bettter than in the mediocre Enter the Matrix game. He can also zoom in the camera to make Joe more powerful. The game serves up a challenge that really is not offered much these days, which could be a good or bad thing depending on what you think. The levels are very well designed, and the bosses are awesome. A must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than\\" Enter The Matrix\\"","review":"I love this game.

What I didn't like about this game is the \\"showoffy\\" main character, and the cliche plot. These 2 things alone add up to a sucky game. The only thing I liked about it are the controls. They're easy to memorize. This game is only worth renting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Beyond Belief","review":"I heard good reviews about this game and decided to buy it. At first I thought it was pretty fun, but after the third boss or so, I became tired of it. I don't know what it was that finally made me realized that this game sucks, but it did it well. Here is what I think it might have been:-The fighting (became trite)-Special effects (weren't good)-Story line (cliched)-Voices (horrendously inane)-Graphics (nice, but the comic-book drawings were kind of dumb)Methinks that what I hate about the game is excatly what people love about it. I lost the game so I didn't try finishing it, which doesn't really bother me. I suggest renting the game before buying.

Only buy this if you get lost easy, can't follow instructions, have both console and pc versions, and you get a discount on it. The details on where to go are not really descriptive because the game is so simple. It points out the obvious and in some parts it doesn't even tell you where to go next. The guide is extremely short, also. Yes, it does look like a solid book but only half of it is on the console version of the game. The other half of the book is on the pc version.

The video is really beautiful, very colorful. The sound quality is good, however, the volume is a little low. I don't need headphones unless I'm in a room with people talking.

Repair was free through the Archos Guarantee, but it was very painful and included hours on the phone, the first hour usually until they answered the phone.Their website is hardly functional (always asking you for your country, even when you are logged on with your address etc.) and doesn't provide any troubleshooting or other helpful info.

I knew based on the price it would most likley not be the best, and most of the time I do have to buy things on a budget so I tend to try to save money on things like this. This time- EPIC FAIL. It is advertised as a strop but the leather is too tough even if this was to be used as a whip. it is poorly made with cheap parts. The leather looks like they got it from an animal that sat dead in the desert for 50 years, the leather is so tough that it could almost be used as a hone rather than a strop.

I knew the quality would be poor, but I was surprised how completely unusable this product was even for just practicing. The strop arrived in expert amazon packaging but with a huge deep bend in the center of the leather (see picture attached to item). The bend caused deep bumps and ridges in the leather which makes this just unusable. The fabric side doesn't have this problem, but it is of very low quality.

But when I got this frame and turned it on, I understood why it was so inexpensive. Display quality is very poor, I could not get it to work right out of the box - usb connector was loose, display would not turn on - it would light up and nothing would show.To make a long story short - I sent it back. I have give credit to Amazon. Fantastic customer service, got return labels in minutes, refund was issued within days.Then I bought a frame made by Philips. What a difference in picture quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Purchase..Great Gift!!","review":"I just bought this as a birthday present and my friend loved it.The set-up was pretty easy. I uploaded pics and mp3 music file from my laptop to the SD drive and it immediately worked on plugging in.Resolution is a bit on the downside but for the price..must say the colors and pics are quite decent and it looks good too.The only issue is the pics get cropped but probably by choosing the ratio setting that can be resolved..I did not try that out. Overall a great buy for gifting somebody and good value for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product at a great price.","review":"This digital frame is great and we usually only have it on when guests over at the house. The great thing about this frame was that there was a bonus offer from Shutterfly which was really great. I would recommend as a first digital frame for your household.

You are not going to get the original hits. This is a \\"bargain\\" CD made in Israel of new recordings of Petula's hits. They don't sound anything like the originals. Rather, they are \\"discofied\\" remakes with an annoying backup chorus and what sounds like a Casio-tone keyboard for accompaniment. VERY dissapointed, I wish I had bought the \\"real\\" greatest hits instead of trying to save a buck or two. This purchase will make me much more cautious of any affordable greatest hits CD's I see for sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"This album is proof of the maxim, \\"You get what you pay for.\\" These are not the original hits.

Sure, it's Petula Clark singing, but the arrangements are slightly different, so the songs won't sound as good as the original hit recordings. I bought it, listened to it, but I don't plan to keep it in my collection. Instead, I plan to wrap it and use it in a White Elephant Christmas Gift Exchange, where we give away stuff we don't want anymore, but don't want to discard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her soft voice and the music arrangements are just fantastic","review":"I have been Pet's fan for many years, considering her one of the top singers of the 60's.

But otherwise it was very entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"I've bought and listened to other Roy Rogers and Sons of the Pioneers cds, this rates at the lowest. Sorry to say, I found the music to be too polished and very bland. I only liked a few songs of this collection. Most songs don't have the old time sound that to me make the sons of the pioneers who they were. Save yourself some money and the pain of having to listen to every track hoping somehow, somewhere you'll like a song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deplorable Quality","review":"I bought these headphones for my little brother, who is 9, for Christmas. I noticed that within 15 minutes of him using them that one of the speakers was falling off. A day later the other one was falling off too. I've secured them with tape so that they don't totally fall off. He also mentions that they are uncomfortable, which I can also attest to. They can get uncomfortable after using them for a while. I am very disappointed of my purchase and I wish that Nintendo didn't make the headphones proprietary (although there's nothing I can do about that). It was a big waste of $15."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortabe and good sound clarity","review":"I had one problem with these and Im going to get it out of the way first. The black lining on the earphones just kinda fell to pieces. I think it was because of the age of the product itself. I pulled it off and no big deal.

Probably not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review for the Kindle Fire readers","review":"I loved Scarry's books as a child. So, I was excited to see this advertised as one of the \\"Kindle Fire Books for Children.\\" I am very disappointed on the formatting of the ebook. The pictures are tiny. In addition, there are some pages that are only text, that correspond to the picture-only page before it. My 2.5 year old son wants to turn the page to the next picture before I'm done with the text. Stick to buying the real book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply awful.","review":"Ralph Bakshi's ill-fated 1978 animated version of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" is univerally loathed by Tolkien fans and non-fans alike. Sadly, its soundtrack by Leonard \\"Star Trek IV\\" Rosenman is a part of the problem. While it's been praised as superior to Howard Shore's compostion due to its \\"character themes\\" and \\"avant-garde style\\", I wasn't able to percieve any coherent themes at all, and \\"avant-garde\\" just means \\"dissonance\\" in this case. It's too loud, too bold. The orc-song at the end is simply ridiculous, much like the badly rotoscoped orcs that sing it.Bottom line: this is a worthy companion to Bakshi's film. See Peter Jackson's version instead, and buy Howard Shore's soundtrack--both are infinitely better than the version represented here."},{"rating":"1","title":"read carefully","review":"While this looks like the \\"original soundtrack\\", Read carefully and note that this is a Japanese reissue and doesn't sound anything like the soundtrack I was anticipating from the movie. My error in not reading the details, but the CD cover and wording of the page are somewhat misleading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid, clear, explanation of compressible flow theory with emphasis on application to solution of engineering problems","review":"This text is an excellent supplement to a course in compressible flows. It is a bit simplistic with respect to the example problems given; the text itself is a VERY easy read. The concepts are clearly explained, and the material is divided in a very logical, straightforward manner. Would definitely recommend as a first text in compressible flows. For a more advanced treatment, see the book by Anderson."},{"rating":"1","title":"This broke immediately","review":"This cracked within a few months of use. Not from dropping it, just from use.

I read \\"Jackson Rules\\" and enjoyed it. \\"The Survivors\\" was a little bit over the top for me but I still kept the faith. Now after reading (not the whole book) what I could stand from \\"The Perfect Lie\\" well, frankly, I will not be reading any more Dinah McCall/Sharon Sala books again. Why? Because I am tired of the moral preaching and the weak or careless characters. An example of the first point: in McCall's world, if you even CONSIDER having an abortion, you'll get your head blown off. And for the second point; weeping and nagging are the way to a man's heart. Really. OK so this is not a great review, I'm simply trying to save you some time and money. Nomaste.:-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointed!","review":"I expected the author, at the very least, to be consistent about how smart the hero was. If his experience, gut and survival instincts allow him to conclude that a drug dealer (that fooled the entire staff of a federal prison) was faking his death, then I'm sure he would be smart enough to think twice about anyone working in the government (since he knows there is a mole.) I am extremely disappointed when I figure something out at the beginning of the book (the identity of the mysterious traitor known as the Snowman) that I hope will twist in the end but doesn't. Is it too much to ask that one of the best CIA agents (with the paranoid survival skills I don't have) is smarter about his own safety (as well as that of those he loves) than I am?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Read","review":"A book that is shocking, thrilling and spell binding. I loved this one. Not often anymore can I read a book that holds my attention the way this one did. I just couldn't put it down.

It is on that level, with action, suspense and romance all rolled into one, I wish they had more books like this out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Easy Read!","review":"Although some of the action is a bit far fetched, this novel is a very enjoyable read. McCall has written a simple easy to read plot with interesting characters. Jonah Slade is approached by a woman named Macie, who is the sister of a woman who chose her inheritance over him because her father gave her the ultimatum. Unbeknownst to him he has a son named Evan and even more shocking, Evan has been kidnapped and Jonah's ex murdered with her father in critical condition in the hospital. Being a CIA agent, Jonah chose a line of work which he never would if he knew he had a family.

In plain language, Roche seeks to educate you (and your child), by demystifying much of the Internet's mystique.Clearly, Roche is aiming this at an audience that is itself only slightly experienced in such matters. By and large, his advice is sound. As an added bonus, space is also given to talking about using a mobile phone.

On \\"Blue Drops of Rain\\" he did some cover songs better than the original musician did them. COREY wrote 5 of the songs on this CD. I've had \\"Blue Drops of Rain\\" for 3 years & never get tired of listening to it. I'm sure this CD will be a \\"RARE FIND\\" for most anyone.

I had a hard time relating to many aspects of the main character as he just didn't feel \\"real\\" to me. I also had a hard time with the way he rushed to finish the book and tidy up his life in a nice little package.Perhaps if you grew up gay in the midwest during the 70s/80s you can relate to this book but the only decent part was his description of his relationship to his relatives.

For the first 20 or so pages I thought I was going to really enjoy this book but after that each page got harder and harder to turn.I can usually find merit in any book - making it worth reading for some reason - but I would have to search far and wide to suggest reading this book.

This knife we both love. Fit, finish, and balance all would make you swear that this is a high grade tool. Although priced nearer the cheapened up versions of Chicago Cutlery found in the Marts this is a knife that feels like it is a high grade piece.

The audio dialogue is at a very low volume and yet the music drowns out any dialogue. There is even a scene between Newman and Woodward where the dialogue is drowned out by a fountain. It might be tolerable IF there were subtitles...but there are NO subtitles! Paramount has leased several of its titles to Olive Films. That would be great if the quality stood up to Paramount's. But in this case, it doesn't. Olive did not do it right...in my opinion.

While the author is a superb academic historian, the book is not written for an academic audience (e.g., essentially no footnotes, no references - this is an advantage but a limit as well). It reads very well, even though the book is long and intense. The key to understand the postwar history of Europe (west AND east), the author seems to argues, is the understanding of the mechanisms that govern the formation of collective memory; in particular with regards to Nazis' crimes.The last chapter, The Epilogue, is really illuminating as well as fascinating on this respect."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's textbook at the ANU for a reason","review":"This is an amazing text not only for its breadth and compressive assessment of European History over 60 years but for its clarity.

Add to this the fact that there is NO English to Egyptian cross-reference. You have to buy the supplemental reference at additional cost (review on that coming soon).An Egyptian hieroglyphic dictionary is the single most important tool a student can possess. Either the publishers have some specific copyright that prevents someone else from writing a similar dictionary, or there is simply no market for one because professors receive a kickback for requiring Faulkner's book.

Other characters are Morgan Le Fey, half sister to Arthur, and Morgause who is full sister of Arthur. The Celtic tribes of Britain in this time frame were a very diverse people, each fighting to gain control of Britain.

I am one of those readers, and I was very excited about this book. The Trials are such an interesting time in our early American history, mainly because of its mysteries. This book does not solve any mysteries, but helps us understand what a bystander felt like - a bystander who did not believe the outcries of witches. Included in this story are sibling love (and hatred, at times), money worries, friendships, courtships, and farm life. You'll never want to put the book down, and it's a very satisfying read.

It was.I've been studying about the Salem Witch Trials for awhile now, and this was a neat addition to the collection of info.It's very realistic, there's only a few things made up, and it hits pretty close to home.For instance, a close friend of the family is being accused of being a witch, her sister's best friend is having the fits that inevitably send someone else to jail, and the author even managed to sneak in a bit of romance.It's very interesting and I'm giving it a 5 star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Start to Learning About the Salem Witch Trials","review":"When I first bought this book, it was because it was the bookstore's most recent release.

Until they either give me the product that I actually PAID for I am not spending another dime within Amazon which is unfortunate because most vendors here do indeed have great products and morals as to NOT pull the old bait and switch.

A Yale-educated DA running for office, of course. It seems that Barry Reed is more concerned with looks and education rather than plot and dialogue. In this novel where everyone seemed to have \\"fresh, Nordic features,\\" Reed focused more on the characters than the story. The only bright spot was attorney Dan Sheridan, who is a down-to-earth, broken-nose kind of player. With each description (which could have been stolen from a soap-opera script) was the educational background of each character. Character description is important, mind you, but not the solitary component of the work. I don't believe that a woman who has been lying face down dead in a marshy area for hours is the most beautiful woman the medical examiner had ever seen. It just doesn't happen.

In order to get any chalk out, I have to unscrew the tip and then poke the back end with something thin to get chalk out. Just unscrewing it and shaking the thing doesn't cause chalk to come out. This happens with the chalk included in the holder, so I'm not using incompatible chalk or anything.Unfortunately the back hole is too small for a standard pencil or anything, so I don't really see this being practical if one's intention is to carry the chalk holder around (as the pocket clip suggests) and thus needs to retract the chalk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chalk Holder","review":"This product was unusable...the chalk was not able to be forwarded in the holder.

I have repeatedly tried Skin Shield and it doesn't work for finger dry skin cracks. It might work for other uses but definitely not for this problem. And it stings when you apply it. And it tends to peel off like it is clear paint.If you are looking for a product to seal dry skin cracks then skip Skin Shield as it will not help."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"Worked in the air conditioning profession for over 33 years, small cuts because of metal. Skin Shield worked as I wanted it to, and did not have to reapply as others I tried. Small nicks most of the time you only had to apply once by thattime wound was healed enough to go without bandage. Wounds healed faster versuscovering with a bandage. I looked forward to the reasuring sting knowing too the next day, a wound would be on its way to healing, instead of redness and slight infection. Trying others made me go back to skin Skin Shield."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hurts like Hell!","review":"Just bought this hoping I could use it on my grandkids. No way.

This is the perfect set for yourself, the experienced chef, or as a gift. The etched ends provide easy identification of tools in the knife block. It would have been great for Calphalon to provide the other 3 knives that would best complete fill the knife block as 3 slots are empty since the 6 bonus steak knives do not fit within. Perhaps they were giving the buyer an opportunity to select the completer knives. My suggestion: the tomato/bagel knife, the bird's beak, and a boning knife."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rust spots after less than 2 months","review":"I just bought these knives two months ago and they are already showing rust spots.

After using for a couple months they started staining. I had cheaper sets of knives that didn't stain at all. They do hold a nice edge, but everytime you go to use them you have to clean real well so the people you have over don't think your giving them dirty knives. Upon contacting the company they say it is normal for them to stain and you have to dry them right away, removing any water on them. seems like good knives shouldn't stain at all . I will probally throw them out and purchase another set from another company. The price may be right but the aggravation isn't worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great knives...still, 5 years later","review":"The etched name on each knife is as helpful as I thought it would be.I have never had knives that require me to sharpen them so it took some getting use to. But the \\"new\\" edge is always nice and makes cooking easier.I like the handles and balance as well. The steak knives are the only negative. They are not very \\"weighty\\" or sturdy. It would also be nice if they came with their own small block. The other knives and the shears are all good quality.Also, you will have 3 empty slots in the block. I bought more knives to match (3.5-inch a paring knife, 5.5-inch bagel knife, and a 5-inch boning knife). They cost me another $60 but, since I cook a lot, they are very useful in the kitchen.MAY 2007 UPDATE: The Steak knives are spot rusting, but the large knives are as good as new. Would buy again.DEC 2008 UPDATE: All of the large knives have held up. The spot rusting is minimal and has not gotten any worse than a year ago; their serated edges aer still good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great variety and quality of knives for the money....","review":"I have this set for about a month now and I am very happy with it. The set contains a good variety of knives that are well made and seem to hold their edge. I understand that they need a bit more care because of the type of steel used, but I prefer the extra care over using a poor quality knife. I wash and dry them individually and I haven't noticed any staining.I think for the money the block could be made bigger to hold all the knives. I also think the steak knives are not quite as sturdy as the other knives in the set. However, these are the only shortcomings I've noticed. I also like that the set includes a bread knife. I find this very useful and a lot of inexpensive sets leave one out.This is a good value for the price. I also like the labelled handles, it's a very nice touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Set For the $$$","review":"I just bought my first set of Calphalon Contemporary cutlery and wow what a difference between this set and some other sets I've owned. The edges are incredibly sharp and the labeling concept is truly an ingenious idea. Not to mention the overall design of the product is fantastic. Design, balance, comfort, and a lifetime warranty for half the cost, how can you go wrong? I've owned lesser sets of cutlery before that have cost me far more money. I'm sold on Calphalon's latest line of cutlery and I know I'll never buy any other brand again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Way to have German steel without the german price","review":"I have had these knives for 2 weeks now. They are a truly impressive set of knives. They remind me of my grandmothers 3 Wusthof knives that we could never touch. They are well made and balanced. The most impressive thing is they are made with the care you'd expect from the finest German or Japanese knive makers. I will also agree these knives are SHARP and hold there edge impressively. The sharpening steel is also very well made, it's been the only thing that has restored the edge on my Henckels Santoku. The only thing that would have made it perfect is 3 more slots on the knife block. This set is well worth $300, it's a great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great set of knives, especially for the price","review":"I shopped around for several months and checked out lots of knives (including Henckels and Wusthof) and finally decided on these. I've only had this set for about a month, but I couldn't be more pleased. All of the knives (except the steak knives) are made of forged steel. The knives were sharp out of the box, and have great balance and weight. These are by far the best knives that I've ever used. If you're considering buying a good set of knives, keep these in mind. This set offers very good quality at an unbelievably low price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great set","review":"I recieved a set of these knives for Christmas this year, and they're a real joy to work with. After working with a set of ill suited cheap Farberware knives that never cut well to begin with and couldn't be sharpened, I was (and still am) amazed how quickly these can get any task done, and how easy it is to make accurate cuts. The curving of the handle seen in the large knife in photo (on all handles too!) is a great feature to make grip easier, and they have a good weight to them without being too heavy and cumbersome. Just be sure you hand wash these to keep them in top condition :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stuffed Totoro!","review":"My 2-year old son is obsessed with My Neighbor Totoro and I got this toy for his birthday.

Its body is pretty tightly stuffed, so the toy is solid and not very soft, but it's nice quality and cute and he has certainly been enjoying it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This stuffed Totoro is absolutely amazing. The tags on Totoro are even in Japanese which makes it even more authentic. The only problem I see is that the gray spots on his stomach is painted on and not actual fur that is inserted. Other than that it's amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great gift for Totoro fans","review":"Unlike other plush toys I've seen, this one really captures the likeness of Totoro (and is an officially licensed Studio Ghibli product). It seems sturdily made, and I expect will wear well through years of play and hugging. After all, what fan of the film wouldn't like to snuggle up and sleep on Totoro's belly?My first impression was that it would be nice if he were a little bit larger, but at 12\\" high he is perfect for little arms to hold and easily portable for trips. He is quite firmly stuffed, but I've found plush like that often wears better over time (and becomes softer with use). I would not hesitate to recommend this adorable toy to Totoro fans of any age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"My mother and I used this tape when I was a child every evening after dinner.

Steer clear!!","review":"I have about 5 friends who have this stroller and love it. I recently got one and absolutely hate it. It's impossible to push and turn. Too bad because it's lightweight and easy to fold, but what's the point when you can't push it? I called the company and they were not helpful or kind. I thought I must have a defective stroller. All they could offer was for us to try a silicon lubricant on the wheels. They should replace the stroller. I will never buy another product from this company again. Clearly you are paying for the name, not quality. Save your money and DO NOT buy this stroller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very overpriced for what you get","review":"I bought this stroller for when we had our second child. My children are 19 mo. apart. I had the Aria single stroller for my first and loved it. This one is definitely not the same. For one thing, it is very hard to steer and get over bumps. The wheels are always getting stuck. Second, it is hard to close. The most frustrating part is the steering issue. Also, my Aria decal fell off as well many months ago. I've only had the stroller for nine months. One more thing, the canopy to block out the sun is basically worthless since it offers very little protection from the sun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I purchased this when I was due to have my second baby. I thought Peg Perego products were supposed to be so great - and they are always so much more expensive. I don't mind spending the $$$ if you get better, but this is just a horrible stroller. It doesn't turn easily at all, the wheels constantly get stuck. There is one cup holder that is soooo small and doesn't stay upright. There is no room for any storage: bags, pocket book, keys, phone, snack. They trays for the kids in front are so small and narrow. the seats are too tight and small- they are not comfortable for the children whether they are awake or asleep. There is nothing I like about this at all, it makes going out where ever not easy at all. For the amounnt of money theu have the nerve to charge for this, they should be ashamed. I actually use my orignal \\"cheap\\" single stroller, instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"works only for light weights","review":"I bought this double stroller a few years ago when I had my second child. I used it a few times at the beginning, and it was very irritating the way the wheels dug in so I could not maneuver the stroller at all. TERRIBLE for shopping or anywhere you will be stop and go, also TERRIBLE if you will be going over any cracks or bumps at all on the road. So basically terrible. It's actually easier to chase my kids around than to try to use the stroller.As my child grew bigger the problem got worse and it is totally unusable.it can't handle weight beyond newborns? Come on, Peg Perego.Now I'm about to have my third child. I was expecting this stroller to last. knowing how terrible it is I can not in good conscience sell this stroller to make money and buy a new one. I am in an extremely tight financial situation and I can not buy another double stroller, even a cheaper one used.Thanks a lot, Peg Perego."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST STROLLER!!! Pretty but Useless","review":"SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! Do not buy this!!!! I hope you listen because you will be very very very sorry. I was attracted to it because it is sleek and cooler looking that the bulky frumpy Gracos, but once it arrived I was sorry I bought it. The cupholder broke the first week and is long gone. The fold up and stand option never works. It falls over everytime. However, the worst and most annoying part about this thing is that the stroller has absolutely NO manuverability. The wheels constantly get stuck. The plastic is so flimpsy and they used such cheapo materials. Peg Perego should be ashamed they are charging so much for such a junky stroller. I am tossing it and buying a different one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth The Money Spent","review":"This stroller is made of very cheap material. Merely after a few months of light use, the stroller is already hard to push, and wheels are easily stuck whenever I try to make a turn. Even for a less than half-an-inch road bump, I have to physically get in front of the stroller and lift the front wheels in order to get pass. The shopping basket touches the ground whenever the road is a little uneven, and the outside fabrics is already worn out.Not to mention, the sun shades are no use at all because they are too small. Without buying an extention shade, they are practically just some decoration to make this product more look like a stroller. It is definitely not worth the price. BTW, their customer service is terrible as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money - buy the Maclaren!!","review":"If you are looking for a side by side double stroller I recommend the Maclaren over the Aria. I am not happy with my stroller at all. Although it is much lighter than the Maclaren, the product is not as durable. I have a 2 yr old and a 4 month old, and the stroller clearly pulls to the heaver side. What I am really dissapointed about is that Peg Perago does not stand behind their product. 2 months into using my stroller the clip that holds the seat broke. I was unable to recline or secure one side of the stroller. (The Aria decale on the side of the stroller also came apart). I called customer service for a new clip and was charged $7.95 for \\"shipping and handling\\". I have friends who have the Maclaren stroller, and it is very durable.

I had the single stroller when I only had one daughter, and it was wonderful, so I thought I would buy the double, but I am very sorry. I called the company and they were NO help. They did not stand behind their product. For this kind of money, I would expect this stroller to last until my children were out of strollers. I do not recommend that ANYONE buy this stroller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"I bought this particular stroller because of it's name (thinking quality), because it is so light weight, and lastly because of the snack trays(it's hard to find a light-weight double with snack trays). However, it is so not worth it. It digs in whenever I am pushing it due to the weight??? or poor design, but it also slides around and kills my back because I can't get the wheels to go where I am headed as they are constantly spinning. The snack tray is a joke because you can't even fit a cup in in. The shades about don't cover anything and the kids are constantly in the sun. On the plus side, the bottom has room for my purse and it's only 14 lbs so it is easy and small to get in and out of my Toyota Corolla."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't purchase this stroller!","review":"This stroller is very poorly designed and constructed. The small wheels make it very difficult to maneuver, the seats are hard to adjust, and the carrier drags on the ground. It also started to fall apart soon after we purchased it. The cupholder broke immediately even though it had never been used, the carrier fabric tore with very little stress, and numerous screws and tabs fell out. Not only do these missing parts make the stroller nearly impossible to open and close, they create safety issues as well. All of this happened with light to normal use. I paid $330 for this stroller, and a year later, it's nearly unusable. (By contrast, my Graco single stroller, which is much older and more heavily used, is in perfect condition.) Peg Perego customer service is absolutely terrible -- worse than any I've experienced. I'd never purchase a Peg Perego product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"okay","review":"Boought this stoller for my 18 month old twins. It is easy to steer and really lightweight. My twins have cerebral palsy and my son has a really high tone. Have special strollers but needed one for when I have both of them with me. This serves the purpose for taking both of them to the doctor by myself.Super easy to fold and handle.Kinda seems a little cheaply made and the basket underneath does not hold anything hardly.The 5 point harness system could really use improvement. The top of the harness is plastic and slips into a sewed on strap. Comes out very easy. That is my only biggest complaint.Would not recomment on gravel or on grass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Stroller","review":"We bought the Aria Twin Stroller because it seemed the best that was out there and the Peg Perego name. What a waste of time this thing was. We took it back to the store after about 30 days because the wheels were sticking and making it difficult to steer. We stupidly took a replacement Aria and after only 2 more weeks took that one back for the same problem. We have an 18 month and a 7 month old, so we needed a stroller that was manueverable and reliable.We ended up getting a BOB double stroller with a swivel front wheel. If you have a chance to read up and research BOB it's well worth it. What a great buy that was. We were lucky though, we got our money back for the Aria stoller. We should have just spend a few more bucks and got the BOB to begin with."},{"rating":"1","title":"I recommend you do not buy this stroller","review":"We have had this stroller for about 1.5 years and finally decided we could not live with it any longer. Given the lack of wheels in the middle it is very difficult to turn and maneuver. Trying to line up the wheels to get through a set of doors is very frustrating.We went out and bought the Combi Twin Savvy and love it. Because it is has the third set of wheels in the middle it handles like a dream. It also folds more compactly and it costs less!Salesperson at the store told us that many customers have complained about the Aria Twin and Peg Perego has delayed the 2007 model as they realize they need to redesign it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Alert - Don't waste your money. This stroller is terrible. It is very hard to use and the wheels are a nightmare. The only good thing I can say is that it folds up nicely and is fairly light weight, but the less expensive competition has started to buy into this trend. I have found Gracco to be the way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mom of 3 - loves this stroller","review":"I went through 2 HEAVY double strollers with my 1st 2 kids age 3 and 5 now. I purchased the Aria 4 months ago when my son (3rd kid) was 4 months old. I LOVE it! It is so lightweight and it can hold either the 3 or 5 year old alongside the baby. This stroller works for us because we are in and out of the car all day long and it is quick to collapse and doesn't weigh a ton."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so Great","review":"I got this stroller when my daughter was 2 and my son was a newborn and I have been trying to use it for a year now. It is VERY difficult to use. When there was a weight difference in my children it would always pull to the side of the heavier child. The wheels do not work well at all. We recently took it to Disney World with us and used it only one day at the park and it was so hard for me to get around with it that I ended up paying $18.00 per day for the remainder of our trip to rent one of their strollers. The positives are that it is lightweight and folds up flatly, though it is difficult to open at times. I would not recommend this product. The cost definately does not equal the value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Reproduction and Limited Usefulness","review":"It is just a compilation of advertising and period reviews for consumer hi-fi from the period listed.

I have a problem with a book when the main character just annoys me. Between Holly's utter disregard for the humans in her life and her looking at the entire world as being all about malamutes, I couldn't take it.

If I want that kind of horror, there is plenty of it in the real world. I was given several of Susan Conant's earlier books, and found they had far too much of this type of information, meaning I stopped reading at a certain point, and passed the books on to others less squeamish. I always approached them like a hand grenade with the pin pulled, never knowing when it might explode. Her talent is terrific, her dogs wonderful, but I can't, and don't want to, become hardened enough to enjoy these books.

I could not follow the story line, the dog training or any dog topics were almost non-existent, and what type of character Holly is becoming is getting stranger and stranger. The publishers really need to give this author a good editor.

Disgraceful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hack, hack!!!","review":"This series is getting worse and worse! Holly is becoming so obsessive and one-dimensional... In Barker Street Regulars, she was absolutely so obsessed with Sherlock Holmes that, even though she professed to know little about him, she was spitting off quotes here, there, and everywhere. In this book, she rants and raves constantly about Geraldine Dodge this, Geraldine Dodge that. Conant needs to clean up Holly's character and make her a little more realistic and more... I don't even know how to say it. Plausible? The melodramatic spittle and long passages of babbling on and on are horrible. I couldn't even finish this book, and I have a Malamute and love mysteries!!

The book does offer many examples, and the pseudocode is very helpful in implementing these methods. The real problem with this book is that many of the explanations of the methods are written in pseudocode. This makes learning the concepts extremely confusing and difficult, as they are written in code. The proofs are helpful, but with the confusing notation in iterative methods, there is no way near enough information to correctly learn what is going on.

Swirling around the country estate are characters who reflect Konstantin's pain and suffering in their own harshly realistic ways. In this famed play, Chekov introduces a brand new form of literature as to emphasize characters other than plot. Instead of placing characters beneath a steady frame, Chekov lets his characters guide the subtle movement of the sad tale of devastated dreams and hopes. The dying sea gull symbolizes the emptiness of defeat and further stressing the beauty of life.

I picked up this CD from Undercurrent, and I have to say, I am very impressed. These guys don't stick to one particular sound, but show thier range of musical styles/talents throughout the album. It flows perfectly from start to finish. Rockers like \\"Falling Awake\\", \\"Enemy\\" and \\"Become What You Hate\\" lead in to emotional ballads such as \\"Again\\" and \\"Sitting Outside\\". This one is in my stereo for a long, long time. Great Job Undercurrent!

Rjd2 does what DJ Shadow did wth The Outsider: goes out into relatively new territory, but the worst kind of it. There is a track, \\"Making Days Longer,\\" on Since We Last Spoke that is similar to The Third Hand, but it's the worst song on that album. If you like that song, you'll love The Third Hand.

He played most of all the instruments on the album and that is commendable. I saw The Third Hand live and he did it all. Other than that I can't stand this album. It's whiny, I can't relate with the lyrics one bit, I have no idea what he's trying to say. I'd rather listen to Brittany Spears latest album then this. I love all RJ's other work. I think he's a genius. I'm sure he was attempting to put out a brilliant album but everything went horribly awry. I feel bad for anyone who paid good money for this record, myself included.

When is \\"Dark Night of the Pumpkinman 2\\" coming out??? Witty and sly in the screenplay, the film comes across as a who done it. Thus not quite convincing of who the Pumpkinman is, director Britton Stebbins has a very keen suspect towards the end. Some may already know, while others may assume, with the rest asking the same old question 'who exactly is behind the pumpkin mask?' That's the power of mystery suspense, not all the strings are tied during the end of the movie. There isn't a dull moment in the film and the color of Halloween was captured beautifully. A movie leaving the audience that a sequel has to be made in the near future. Not exactly Hollywood type of material, very independent...however very entertaining. You do not have to be a horror fan to watch this one. An instant Halloween classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"trail vs treadmill","review":"I got this to watch while running on the treadmill and it inspired me to run on trails.

The dvd uses the same running scenes over and over. I was really looking forward to some really helpful tips for \\"normal\\" runners. I do not see myself flying down the trails at the speed of the \\"actor.\\" It would have been cool to show some scenes of him flying down the hill but then show techniques of running down the hill - for normal people. It reminded my a lot of a Monte Python movie, the scene where they keep running up the same hill.

Of course, there are one or two tracks they could have done without (Closing the Club & What the Hell Do You Want) but overall, this CD is quickly becoming one of my favorites although I'm not surprised. My three favorites on this CD are:14: That's How Close We Are13. Why Can't We Get Along2. Let This GoI am happy that I purchased this CD and I recommend others to do the same! Way to go fellas!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS 112!!!!!","review":"I don't know about the other reviewers, but I like to pretend that \\"Hot and Wet\\" never happened. When I heard that the title was \\"Pleasure and Pain\\" I immediately got excited because I knew that meant they were taking it back. This is 112!! This is the 112 that I know and LOVE! They are definitely the best of all the male R&B; groups out there (except Dru Hill). Even Slim is doing his thing on this album. These are true RnB jams.

I think that after the disappointing sales of their last album (due to not that good of material) they are sure to be a hit with this album. I think every song has its own flava and it reminds me of the first 112 album (which came out back in 1996). I think that since they left Bad Boy, they have been able to have more creative control and they don't have P.Diddy breathing down their necks. Also he's not on every track screaming \\"BAD BOY\\" or \\"WE PROCEED TO GIVE YOU WHAT YOU NEED\\" (C'mon Puff, I have mad respect for you but don't you think that catch phrase is a little played out, you've been saying it since '94). You have a quality 112 album that you can listen to all the way thru, no skippers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More Pleasure than Pain","review":"112 more than made up for their last album \\"Hot & Wet\\", which completely choked. Even though they didn't have more TIGHT interludes (like their first three albums), this CD got heavy rotation in my house, car, job, etc. \\"U Already Know\\" is a favorite by many, including myself, but I'm disappointed that some of the other singles weren't released. \\"What If\\" got some play for a bit, then disappeared. My other favorites are:2. Let This Go9. My Mistakes10. If I Hit11. The Way14. That's How Close We Are15.

But since they left Bad Bay, they have fallen apart. This last CD is worst than the previous one. They are too old to sing about sex in the manner that they do. They sound like Camron and 13 year old boys. I was appalled by \\"If I Hit\\" and \\"Closing the Club\\". NO wonder this had a parental advisory sticker. But beyond the crazy sex stuff, this CD just sucks. The lyrics are bad, the production goes from cast-off Boyz II Men ballads to Casio beats.

The drummer is terrible, he cant even get simple loops right, not to mention there are maybe two fills on the whole damn album. DONT waste your money. If you want to hear classic rock-revival music, listen to silvertide. The absolutley disgusting dispicable crap \\"the living things\\" puts out isnt worth the plastic its burned into. The sad thing is MTV will probably give this terrible band hours of airplay."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit of disappointment","review":"I read about this band and was intrigued enough to pick up their CD. I like straight ahead bar room/garage rock and was interested to hear their supposedly political lyrics. Unfortunately, I found their music very pedestrian and cliched. The songwriting is rather trite... the guitar riffs and chord progressions sound like something a second year guitar student would rip out practicing in their bedroom. The singer is decent but none of the songs stand out as anything more than standard garage rock. There are probably hundreds of unsigned bands out there with more original music than this. But, if you like grinding bar rock then this might satisfy. It's not terrible, just terribly average."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Excellent take on the great Lon Chaney (even though not 100% accurate).

Unlike so many hollywood bios of the time this move tends to steer away from the usual sanitization of a character and instead confronts the darker side of Chaney, a man beset by torments. Poignant, powerful in it's day with the head on look at how deaf people were treated, and indeed with the tragic aspects of Chayney's first marriage. For me this movie stands the test of time exceptionally well, thanks in no small measure to the performances, notably the conflict between Chaney and his first wife wonderfully played by Dorothy Malone. This is one of the great ones!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Strangely miscast Cagney delivers top notch performance!","review":"A melodramatic depiction of a high-glossy soap opera version on the life of the incredibly gifted Lon Chaney features corny dialogue, mediocre production values and a distinctly B-list stable of actors. HOWEVER, the offbeat casting of the marvelously talented and committed James Cagney elevates this picture to a five star rating!He is both tough and touching...and while bearing no real physical resemblance to the legend he portrays, gives a multilayered and thoroughly captivating performance. It's interesting to learn some background on Chaney but the real amazement is in watching Cagney give it his all and \\"tell\\" the story.Would make a great DVD feature for a Chaney collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"what chaney might have been like","review":"This is what I imagine Lon Chaney's life would have been like if he had been James Cagney. Unfortunately I wondered what the \\"man of mystery\\" himself was really like, and care little for another soap-opera twisting of reality by Hollywood script-writers.Yes, there are people out here who are actually looking to learn something about the subjects of biopics and, once more, we have an example of the fictionalisation of fact Hollywood-style.

From the very first sentence, Robert Humphrey grabs your attention and keeps you turning pages... exactly what makes a book worth reading. I kept waiting for it to slow down, but it rarely did. Nick Hoskins, as an investigative reporter, is a completely believable character. I expected another story about cloning to be filled with the usual science fiction razzmatazz, but instead, I kept finding circumstances that are already leaping off the news headlines daily.

But I can't imagine who wouldn't take offense at this book. High ranking Catholic cardinals are depicted as scheming power mongers, the one black person mentioned is murderous, all of the seemingly intelligent women are doomed to impossible relationships with men, the Germans are conscienceless mercenaries, and the only Muslim is a fanatic. And this is all in addition to the concern anyone might have about an author just making up an account of Jesus' childhood and his post-resurrection relationship with Mary. I kept thinking things had to get better but they never did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Catholic","review":"I took great offense at this book. The author obviously has a very negative view of the Catholic Church and tried to impart his outlook on the unfortunate readers of this book.

HOWEVER after lengthy communication with Amazon about whether or not it was machine washable, they finally said it was.

Maybe the characters are somewhat one-dimensional, but that dimension is a hoot. As several of the characters point out in the book, only a true enthusiast of the art form would see the value of a lost manuscript by Caroline Furness Jayne as worthy of crime. These characters display all the necessary obsessions to make the plot work.The plot may not have been highly intricate--certainly not nearly as intricate as the Inuit figure \\"Polar Bear Caught in a Fisherman's Net,\\" which I have yet to master. Nonetheless, it was engaging enough to string me along, and though I'd had my guesses about the identity of the murderer, that really isn't the point. This book is a fine example of the adage, \\"It's not the destination, but the journey that matters.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit loud","review":"This Kurt Kinetic is a very well made piece of equipment. It is very sturdy and was easy to put together. You may ask why I gave it two stars, I have one word for you \\"noise\\".I read reviews that the wind trainers get loud if you pedal fast. Unfortunately, mine was loud even at very low speeds. It was loud enough that I can not get a workout on the bike and listen to the radio or watch a show on my computer.The bottom line is if a very loud wooshing noise like driving a car with your windows open at moderate to high speeds does not bother you, this trainer could be what you want at a decent price. If you are like me and the noise bothers you so much you don't use the trainer, buy a fluid or magnetic model."},{"rating":"1","title":"noise in kinetic","review":"This was a Christmas present to me from my husband who knows I love to ride and want to stay in shape during the cold winter months.

As brilliant as this teacher may have been, he was not \\"true to his own voice.\\" Before considering the purchase of this DVD, customers should know that Meisner has to \\"burp\\" his words since he has literally destroyed his throat through a lifetime of smoking and from several operations for throat cancer. Thus he sounds like a frog throughout, and only the most dedicated will be able to sit through the croaking. Definitely not for younger audiences. Despite the tragedy, he and many of his students continue to smoke heavily throughout the program. If it had been recorder when he could speak normally, it probably would have been a treasure, but at least for me, it was unbearable to watch and ruined the lessons which might at one time have been worth learning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I found that I just really didn't care about any of these people.

Instead, it was a narrative \\"yearbook\\" for Thomas Jefferson students only. I should have paid attention when all of the reviews on Amazon were by the people written about in the book, but I wasted my money anyway. It would have been nice to have a document that told the story of the dot com youth, the gen xers, the whatever you want to call us, but these descriptions felt more like an introduction to the new cast of MTV's the Real World, a representative of every social clique. Here's the gay one, here's the conservative, here's the wild one. Boring. Sensationalized. Please do not waste your money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply awful; a weak attempt at meaningfulness.","review":"What Really Happened is a poor attempt at conjuring up powerful memories of high school. The main reason for this is a format issue, I think. Had the author only written about a few people more in depth, I think the book would have been a much more interesting read. Instead, Chris Colin has broken his whole high school class down into different stereotypes and them summed up their lives in two sentences. Garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, incomplete, and exploitative.","review":"Disclaimer: I was the in the TJ class of '94.Colin tries to argue that the class of '93 had hope, and then lost it, and is kind of lost trying to find it again. He uses learning about LGBT rights as a metaphor for the social consciousness of '93, so a substantive discussion about the ongoing study of race (or class!) has no place in his story.I do think he has a rough sense that something is wrong with this picture, and that's why he repeatedly and awkwardly returns to the issue of race. I wish he had been less defensive and made more of an effort to engage those issues.And as a friend of Sean Bryant's, I think making his story the last chapter is inappropriate and exploitative. All of the other stuff aside, that alone makes me feel uncomfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspensful!","review":"I found this to be a suspensful read. It involves two widows in a retirement village where their members are being murdered alphabetically. Due to an inexperienced shariff the two women decide to try to solve the murders themselves. The characters are charming! In addition to the suspense is a slight hint of humor. But you will not be laughing long as the suspense builds up to a breathtaking pace as the story progresses to a surprising climax. This is a keeper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Passion and rhythm: A powerful synthesis","review":"SECURITY takes the listener deep into the heart of Gabriel's passion for the music of the world. Finally escaping from the restraints of his Genesis years, Gabriel unleashes an emotional torrent here; listen to the pain and courage of the warrior of \\"San Jacinto\\" and you realize Gabriel is entering a new musical place. \\"I Have The Touch\\" and \\"Lay Your Hands on Me\\" both take the distance that was often found in Gabriel's previous work and removes it totally; laying bare a desperation and emotional resonance that will leave you with a longing to give the guy a hug. Haunting vocals, driving rhythms, and a musical purity all unite on this one making it one of Gabriel's finest works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Securing his place in rock and roll history","review":"Along with David Bowie, Peter Gabriel is one of the most influential artists in music, at least to me. Security is a great album. I like his solo albums so much better than his early work with Genesis (I know some will burn me at the stake for this comment). To me, the rhythms and the textures are so much more alive and different than anyone else's.This was the album that really started mainstream rock n roll radio to play him, deservedly so. This is my second favorite album of his: PG 3 ( the \\"melting face\\" album) is my all-time favorite.It's the rawness of his voice, the percussion, the textures of the sound, the lyrics, and the energy of this album that captivate me. His view is that of the intelligent outsider; clinical yet full of passion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Also available as \\"Deutsches Album\\"","review":"The music on Security is great, but the lyrics aren't up to the standards on Mercury (aka Gabriel #3). I personally prefer Security in German (sold here as \\"Deutsches Album\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"You have never heard anything like this....","review":"...and you never will again. \\"Shock the Monkey,\\" a great song to be sure, is dwarfed by most of the songs on this album, none of which are anything similar to it. This album was far ahead of its time, and would still be groundbreaking if released today. \\"The Rhythm of the Heat,\\" \\"San Jacinto,\\" and \\"Wallflower\\" raise the bar to a whole new level. Some have made the horrible mistake of giving up on this album after one or two listens, because it is so different from anything anyone has ever heard. Don't expect \\"Sledgehammer,\\" \\"Games Without Frontiers,\\" or \\"Big Time\\" at all. This is a genius at his very best, making an album on his own terms. If the sonic experience of \\"The Rhythm of the Heat\\" doesn't capture and keep your attention, I don't know what to tell you. A must for true audiophiles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Starting to seem a little insecure....","review":"I have always been a hesitant Peter Gabriel fan as I have always felt he was easy given to loss of focus and could sound either pretencious or overly-commercial..sometimes both.I still think PG3:MELT is where he found his voice and is his greatest achievement...yet the personal darkness and psychosis of that record seemed to scare him and he veered into mood, world music and commercial success(by accident and design) to make up.Security happens to be his greatest \\"commercial\\" album.It can meander at times but the mood pieces are compelling and the \\"hits\\" I HAVE THE TOUCH and SHOCK THE MONKEY are still great and have an intensity and appeal that he would water down in his later solo albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full Security","review":"After his superb third album, Peter Gabriel decided to dive into more diverse world music sounds on his fourth album, Security. The pulsating \\"The Rhythm Of The Heat\\" is a great example of how he is able to marry world sounds with his own prog rock leanings. \\"Shock The Monkey\\" was his first \\"big hit\\" thanks to the highly creative and inventive video. The album's best song is the stirring \\"San Jacinto\\" which is a compelling listen. Security doesn't quite match up to his third album, but it is a strong piece of music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get ripped off!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is just a re-hash of the stereo CD, it's not \\"re-mastered\\" for multi-channel playback. You'd be much happier with Pink Floyd's 30th Anniversary Edition of the album \\"Dark SIde Of The Moon\\" or the Eagles \\"Hotel California\\" or Elton John's \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\"; these artists took the time and spent the money to do SACD right. Peter Gabriel is just trying to suck more money out of your pocket without any value added in return. Sure it's a slightly better recording than the original CD but certainly not worth buying again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blahhhh","review":"This book is so bad I couldn't get past the first could pages much less a full chapter.

I've looked at the HLT5676S in big box stores and never noticed this \\"Silk Screen Effect\\", but at home it was unbearable. I'm not sure if it was my viewing conditions or just this particular TV.

Clearly, a lemon. Called Amazon - they were terrific and replaced it. Second one arrived. Same problem. Another lemon? Or is there something not right with this TV? I'm going with the slim one now.

I just can't justify spending this much money on a television and having everything look like I'm watching it through a piece of silk that covers the screen. 1080P and my Blu Rays don't look nearly as crisp when the screen has a visual distraction.I'm not saying the tv is awful, but for my money plasma is 10x better...even if I have to buy a 50 inch for the same price.(Check out the Panny 50PX77U. It has an AMAZING PICTURE.)Don't let the Big Box stores fool you with this tv. This Samsung looks GREAT at BB. No Silk Screen at all.Imagine your disappointment when you get it hooked up...No more DLP for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS TV!!","review":"I had this TV. Twice. Both times the cabinet was so flimsy that it couldn't hold the screen flat enough to get a true picture. On both models I had the screen was extremely bowed. I've heard it called the Samsung Smiley face effect. Samsung made the TV out of really cheap materials to make it light enough to mount on a wall, but who would mount their DLP on a wall anyway? I think they made it cheap, then noticed it was light and used that as an excuse. Either way, its a shame becuase the picture was simply amazing, you know, aside from being intolerably skewed. Don't take your chances on this TV. Your money would be much better spent on a slightly smaller LCD, like the LN-T4665 or the 4661."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont buy","review":"This TV gave me white spots of death, do not purchase Samsung DLPs!

Even the owner's manual acknowledges this, as did a Samsung tech rep I talked with. (He was as mystified by the lack of this feature with the HDMI hookup as I am.) With most DVD and BluRay movies this is no big deal. However, with one DVD I watched today it was, and I had to watch it on my secondary, non BluRay player that is hooked up with the component connection. Without the HDMI hookup I could not take advantage of the upconvert feature my BluRay player offers with standard DVD movies.Otherwise, this is a fine set."},{"rating":"2","title":"the medias love afaiir with obama","review":"this film documents the media love affair with obama . i highly recommend this move to anyone . it shows with out a doubt the journalism has died in our country . & the out right lies and deception that some of the media reported.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful skewed partisan stance","review":"To use Sarah Palin as the advocate for what is right, which Ziegler later went against, seems fitting enough as an endorsement or lack thereof for this terribly skewed partisan piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultra One CD","review":"I'm giving this cd four stars because you get plenty of great mixes on here, just keep in mind that most of them are less than 5 minutes long, except for the Pump-kin Remix of \\"No Air\\".

It does not \\"drain CPU power,\\" damage your computer, or any of that nonsense. The people who hate Starforce are either ignorant, responding in knee-jerk fashion to issues they don't understand, or pirates who'd rather not have to purchase the game. Rush for Berlin is an incredibly well-done game with great graphics and fun gameplay.

King Death is well-written (no academic baffle-gab), well-illustrated, and well-designed. It is a joy to handle and read.The subject of this book is the long-term consequences for English society of the Black Death. (If you are looking for an account of the plague itself, you should probably go elsewhere.) Colin Platt works his way through the effects on religion, economy, marriage and family in topical chapters.The general reader will get a lot out of it -- will come away with a much greater knowledge of later medieval England and of the effects of population trends on society. I suspect many scholars will find this a useful book, too. This is not a rehash of long-known material, but a study that's as up-to-date as it is accessible."},{"rating":"2","title":"a history book for those serious about history","review":"Colin Platt gives an excellent, IN-DEPTH review of scholarship surrounding the impact of the Black Death on late-medieval England, full of original contributions to the field. His chapters are well thought-out and well documented. Some, especially the chapters on church art, are very moving; others, such as the chapter on widows made wealthy by the plague, will force the reader to reconsider their views on literature contemporary to the plague (and here I am thinking of Chaucer's \\"Wife of Bath's Tale\\" in particular). If you're looking for stories of gruesome death, well, perhaps this is not the first place to look (although there's still plenty of that here). If, on the other hand, you're looking for a more in-depth look at the plague and what it did to the societies it infected, here's the place to come when you've tired of the gruesome bits."},{"rating":"1","title":"More for British Historians...","review":"This piece came to my attention while conducting research for a thesis on the Black Death. Unfortunately, Platt's work is really only designed for British Historians. While he does recount how resurgence of bubonic plague in late-medieval England affected the country's economic and labor systems, he does so without consistancy. The bulk of this text provides overly detailed examinations of how the plague spread between specific towns and counties, with only minimal, and rather sporadic, discussion of how society as a whole reacted to the epidemic. Again, this work will not give you a holistic viewpoint of how the plague interacted with social, cultural, medical, etc factors of the day. Its only use is to those who wish to understand, in depth, how the labor system of late-medieval England changed due to the fluctuating mortality rates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you think!","review":"This book is indeed scholarly but to whom? Much of the data is concerning useless facts. It is not intended to inform of the Black Death as I thought it would.

A clip of nude men player on the beach can be followed by a clip of clothed men kayaking. This ruins the erotic potential of the clips.There are four sections. First is water: swimming, kayaking, hiking on the beach, playing in the surf, etc. Second is air: gymnastics, diving, etc. all mixed together. Third is sand: beach volleyball, beach running, etc. Last is a miscellaneous section that is mostly wrestling.The only thing this title is good for is previewing other titles in the collection (if you can figure out which clips come from which title)."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected","review":"its not the type of music I expected... , boring . it may be just good music to listen while doing something else sorry"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect show.","review":"That's one of the best things I've got lately.

The music is everything. People get all their emotions from movies from the music. Obviously, if the acting is good, as the actors in the movie are, it sure helps, but the music needs to be good. The music is wonderful, as I have already stated. Since the movie has both sad and happy times, the music matches. It brings everything to life. I hope people listen to this soundtrack.

I admit that Lukes vocals and his guitarplaying is great as always and songs such as It looks like rain, Fall into velvet and the very poppy Lonely beat of my heart are very good listenable songs. But apart from the fact that I find many of the songs to be very uninspiring, the sound is just plain annoying. Man, the whole record seems \\"drowned\\" in reverb, and furthermore, Lukes guitar is terribly overeffected, which he himself also admitted through some interviews in the 90es.If you feel the same way I do, I highly recommend spending your money on his 1997-album \\"Luke\\", which has great, raw, fantastic sound, honest lyrics and wonderful harmonies and vocals!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Toto's gone over the edge!

It's an outstanding disc.Lukather gets to really shine and show off his outstanding guitar playing.

I must say I found this to be an accurate assessment of a beautifully written but ultimately disturbing book about Nazi Germany. It has a deceptively simple style and its starkness is wholly appropriate to the subject material. The book is in three distinct parts. The middle section is a harrowing read which I found profoundly moving. The vivid images haunted me long after I had finished this book and I commend it to anyone interested in the ravages of war from \`the other side'. Pain, degradation, misery, shame, outrage, cruelty, courage - all these are universal. And universal is the endurance of the human spirit with its capacity for transcending all adversity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Fun","review":"This is a fun game and with the multi-player action, even the parents can join in or the siblings.

She is having problems in her marriage due to lack of communication between her and her husband. This I feel stems from her childhood. So many secrets hidden from her make her unable to communicate effectively in her marriage. Although infidelity on her husband's part makes it even harder for Tandi.This story is set in Jamaica,Queens where I was raised. I could relate to the streets where everything was taking place. Although Mallette has a way of writing about places that I have never been but she still takes me there in her writings.

I think she should have left well enough alone, but things between her and her husband may have not improved if she didn't do what she did. That's a plus. Sometimes you have to rattles the chains to get some action. This was my first read by Gloria Mallette and it was truly a good one.

I decided to return the book five minutes after I start my initial glance. The design, style, format, and writting syntex of those job descriptions is kind of outdated that in my point of view warrant major overhaul. The 10 pages job description writting guide is so simple that they provide common intuitive knowledge. The ADA part initially seems somewhat like a selling point. However, I also find it disappointing as it is again very general & simple. They are many public sources available for such kind of general information that I don't need turning to this book for solution. I bought this book with the intention of shelfing it in my HR department's toolbook collection. After reviewing it, however, I believe it does not serve the purpose as it won't help our HR practitioner much. To conclude, It is poorly written and edited that definitely not worth the extraordinary high price of ()."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swings hard--what's more you can hear the rhythm section!","review":"Unlike almost every other record available of the Fletcher Henderson Orchestra, this recording of an NBC Radio broadcast manages to capture the full sound of the rhythm section. In particular, the drums can be heard and the drummer is swinging very very hard. For rhythm players it is an important album because it was recorded at a point in the evolution of Fletcher's band when the rhythm section was beginning to play licks and figures that became common-place in the hipper bands of the 1940s. If you want to hear the entire orchestra, and not just the front line, this is the one Fletcher recording I would buy. If you are a rhythm player, it is also an incredible source of ideas and licks from this important era. The players in the \\"nouveau\\" swing groups could learn a lot from this album about how to truly swing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick, but not enough content","review":"Don't think that you are getting 8 different lessons.

The first disc, the one with all of Denver's hits, doesn't have the original recordings on it. No, it's another one of those pitiful later rerecordings he did, in the mid '90s. Horrible.I've learned to stay away from anything with \\"Medacy\\" on the label. But even that name is so tiny that it's hardly noticeable. Buyer beware. You may think you're getting a deal on this 2-disc package, but nearly all of it is garbage on disc 1, and mostly forgetable junk on the disc 2, with the exception of \\"Calypso.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"warning 3- not original","review":"I got this CD at a used record store, not realizing they weren't the original recordings. Very disappointing. He sounds like a tired middle-aged man trying to hold on to his glory days. His voice didn't hit the high notes very well on this recording, and in those parts it sounds gravelly. The originals were much better, even on my crappy computer speakers - John sounded happier and full of energy. I will get the original greatest hits vol 1&2 and hope to get rid of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting approach to Afro-Puerto Rican music","review":"On this CD, you will hear Willie Colon's powerful band, backed up by Rub��n Blades and H��ctor Lavoe on chorus, exploring the two main Afro-Puerto Rican genres: \\"bomba\\" & \\"plena\\", with the master plenero Mon Rivera on vocals. Also, featuring on timbales and \\"quinto\\" is \\"Kako\\" Bastar. So, in terms of the sound, is as powerful as it gets.My only complaint is that Willie didn't risk much on this one: he didn't take the Afro-Boricua rhythms to new grounds; he stuck pretty much to the traditional sound (with Afro-Cuban instrumentation, of course). He did come up with interesting stuff (listen to Mosaico #2), but apart of that, he didn't give his imagination room on this one.Still, this is a must have if you are into Salsa or Afro-Caribbean music, as I am. \\"Pena de amor\\" and \\"Ya lleg��\\" are classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"This product arrived very quickly and it did what it was suppose to do.

As a lover of cannibal films this is far from one. Even the description on the back is misleading. He works at a meat plant where he makes soup, wow how convenient on disposing of bodies. He does kill some people, but the scenes where people die arent that graphic so that wasnt worth my time and my friends who were there with me watching it. What is with his neighbor, the homosexual inuendos were there, and well really upfront and unnecessary. I do not recommend this film to anyone that likes cannibal films, or horror films. It sucked"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for playing sports","review":"I was never one for thongs, g-strings or jocks because they never felt comfortable and gave me the coverage I like.

The songs are infinately complex and tweaked to perfection......unfortunately, this CD is severely lacking in the lyrics department. The lyrics are very repetetive, predictable, and \\"generic\\" NIN. It is nothing like the lyrical masterpice, \\"The Downward Spiral\\" (my favorite NIN album).Musically, however, it remains great with tracks like \\"Even Deeper\\", and \\"I'm Looking forward to Joining you Finally\\", a song that paints a beautiful, icy landscape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music for the dark corners of your soul","review":"Trent and co. will wring melody from your muted cacophony. He will make grossly audible your simmering anguish. From your gut-wrenching agony he will rend headphones and speakers and piss off happy yippy-dogged minivanned neighbors. He will take the destroyed junkyard of your soul and from it fashion an unstoppable japanese mecha-godzilla. And finally, after the journey through your private darkness is complete, he will bow his head and point you at the glimmer of light at the end.Welcome to NIN. I love all his stuff, but this is his best, darkest, deepest, most musically interesting. If you ever find yourself in a very dark place, catharsis is at hand. This is the hair tonic for your balding soul. Best played loud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trent does it again...","review":"For all you people who live through a hell like Trent's(and who doesn't) there is always The Fragile to help you deal with it. Although not as emotionally struggling as the Downward Spiral, it still offers a good follow up. My favorite song on here was the first single, The Day the World Went Away, I think he did great on that song, even though I didn't like it when I first heard it. But now I listen to it all the time. Although, I am kind of disappointed that Trent and Manson are friends again, cuz Manson=sellout."},{"rating":"2","title":"...after five years...","review":"...for five years the question was \\"how can Trent Reznor top The Downward Spiral, one of the best and most popular albums of the 90's?\\" That question has been answered, and the new question is \\"how can Trent Reznor top The Fragile?\\" and if i must wait another four years to find out i will. As it is, i've been listening to The Fragile for the year since i bought it, with brief intermissions for downloaded MP3s, but mostly The Fragile. These two CDs refuse to get old.

NIN is NOT prog rock and they don't compare to pink floyd. do waste your money on this album if you're \\"trying\\" them for the first time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Trent - this is a big disappointment","review":"I have loved everything NIN has put out since day one, but after listening to The Fragile I was very disappointed. He seems to have run out of the awesome songs that were on his previous releases. The songs are cheesy and unimaginative. Releasing a double album is always great when there are lots of good songs, but most of this seems like filler material...Better luck next time I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing and self important","review":"This is perhaps the most emotionally monochromatic collection of pop songs I have ever heard. This is really just bad 70s Art Rock with explicit lyrical content. If this album sells because people really feel this way about life, then I feel sorry for them. Probably the worst thing in the world for someone in that state however, would be to listen to this \\"masterpiece.\\" I have no interest in anything Trent Reznor has to say. Further, he isn't terribly clever or even musically expressive in the way he says it. The 2 stars in my rating are due to the fact that occasionally the album is sonically interesting, but aside from that, spend your precious listening time on something emotionally and musically honest. This is contrived drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Te Deum","review":"One of the most hotly anticipated releases of the last five years turns out to be one of the biggest ripoffs of the last five years. This is NIN's \\"Use Your Illusion\\" -- so much time wasted recording so much absolutely forgettable material. Not even half an album's worth of good songs are scattered across two discs of glum meandering that is the musical equivalent of chewing on cardboard. Reznor's music is now so horribly earnest and blandly sincere that it winds up repelling rather than seducing. In another ten years, this'll be filling cut-out bins everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's the Beef?","review":"This album sounds great, but it's too tame for us hardcore fans. I'm happy for Trent if this kinder, gentler NIN is a sign that he's feeling a bit better. Although still pretty messed up, this can't compare to TDS. I knew that this could never top TDS, but I thought it would at least be close. There are some really good songs here, but after a while it gets kind of formulaic. I find that the second disc is better than the first; a little more disjointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five stars in the level of wondering, \\"What happened...?\\"","review":"I listened to the openings of each song, impressed with the diversitile positions his music had developed. I felt a mellow influence that carried the strong presence of his energy found in his better works of the past.As I heard his voice, it was gone. His own energy that gave power to songs like \\"something I can never have\\", and \\"Hurt\\", seemed to have vanished. No emotion. No strength. Words coming out of a void was all they seemed to be. If I were in relation to him, as a friend, or family member, I'd be doing all I could to discover what happened to him.. What caused such an absense of thespirit I used to see.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reznor's \\"White Album\\"","review":"What the \\"White Album\\" was to the Beatles, \\"The Fragile\\" is to the Nine Inch Nails. A scattershot landscape dotted with craggy mountains, smooth vistas and unseen forces, the music dares you to dislike it -- then gives you a thousand reasons to doubt your doubts. Intricate, loud, rollicking, mellow and downright supifying all at once, \\"The Fragile\\" is ultimately a rewarding if somewhat challenging trip to a musical mecca that Trent Reznor has yet to explore. Hit single shoppers need not apply -- \\"The Fragile\\" demands that the listener delve into the music, not just react to it. The intricacies (some hidden at first listen) are the rewards. Reznor has arrived. \\"The Fragile\\" could well be the album of the year."},{"rating":"1","title":"SIGH....","review":"(All spoken very calmly)No no no boys and girls. Do not be misled. Mr. Reznor and all the pretty people would love for you to swoon and think to yourselves \\"Trent Reznor is a brilliant genious. Trent Reznor is so very cool. Trent Reznor is so deep. Who can compare...?\\" Listen, they said the same thing about Bob Dylan and he never wrote a single note of valuable music...just ...).Trent Reznor is no musical genious. Trent Reznor is a pampered, wealthy ... who has you by the ... every time you spend money on his arrogant, self absorbed tripe. He is no genious. He is no visionary. He is a basher and no more. This is folly at it's grandest. There is nothing of value here. He is laughing all the way to the bank selling you this ...

However, after disappearing from the rock scene for several years, Trent popped out of his grave and distributed a new album, just in time for Christmas, named The Fragile. The album should have been called The Junk. Every song is non-creative and has a clearance-marked Radio Shack keyboard sound. Bad follow-up to The Downward Spiral. Trent: Go back to your grave and save people their cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Define melodramatic, adolescent pretentiousness","review":"Answer: Nine Inch Nails.

But \\"disappointing\\" would be the single word to descbribe my reaction after enduring the 120 minutes of The Fragile... The lyrics are so repetative, never quite inflicting any great degree of emotion, and the vocals are dry, unimpassioned, and lacking in melody. There are a few-earcatching songs, (Especially \\"Somewhat Damaged\\" and \\"We're in this Together\\"), but the rest just aren't very impressive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old . . .","review":"Sorry NIN faithful, but Trent doesn't pull through on this one. One of the greatest things about Reznor was always his originality and innovation ('The Downward Spiral' being, in my opinion, one of the greatest, and definitely the most artistic and original, album of the '90's). Don't get me wrong- this album IS good, however, when put up against his other groundbreaking work, there's just nothing NEW here. The guitar is exceptional, the lyrics, as always, whiny, overdramatic and dull. I've always liked NIN's noise-rock, and, even better, when he layered it over dance hooks (check out the 'Fixed' EP), but what we have here only seems like throw-away tracks from 'The Downward Spiral': aggressive, loud, explosive, but just not as catchy (with a couple exceptions: Starfuckers, Inc., Into the Void, We're in this together).

Now I know this CD is true. Been an admirer since prehistoric Pretty Hate Machine.

I think it's a masterpiece; anyone who liked the downward spiral's lesser known tracks (the becoming, ruiner, eraser, a warm place, big man) will most likely like this albumn. There aren't any really fast and heavy tracks ala wish or march of the pigs here (except Starf__ers and a few of the instrumentals), but the album definately rocks. As should be expected from NIN and Trent, a masterpiece!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The most ambiance out of any NIN!!!","review":"With the Fragil Trent Reznor has pushed the industrial envelope one step farther with great compositions. The man is truly the most creative producer in the 90's. Some day music scholars will look back and rate this musical genius among Beethoven and Bach. The tracks seem to melt into one another and create an ethreal sound more sonic than Pink Floyd could have ever dreamed of. Be sure to check out the song \\"Into the Void,\\" and also the musical masterpiece \\"Pilgrimage.\\" Don't expect the rawness and bludgeon of previous Nails releases. This album is much more sentimental and from the heart rather than from the pants. Trent at his most soulful. Much of the music seems to be similar to \\"A Warm Place\\" from the downward spiral.

It's less electronic and industrial, more diverse also. It's overall not as heavy as TDS but it has some songs like Somewhat Damaged that are also heavier than anything on TDS and almost metal.

Not likely, but it's still a good record.","review":"I have mixed feelings about this album. I got it the year it came out, at the time I was 17... I thought it was nothing short of genius. Now, I look at it a bit differently. This album, is FULL of instrumentals, and the songs that do have lyrics, for the most part are sparse and vague. Unless you know Trent Reznor (and trust me, you probably don't) you would have absolutely no idea what the hell he's talking about, aside from just generally being angry, or sad, or whatever... I'll let you in on a little secret, this album is all about the aesthetic, not the content. It sounds great, but that's about it. I'll listen to it for background music, and i'll say it's just about the best damn background music I have in my collection. Buy this album now, if you love music... any kind of music.

Every album Trent Reznor has put out, has been flawless, hardcore, and just simply my favourite thing to listen to.Starting with \\"Somewhat Damaged\\", on Disc1, the album starts off with a heavy-hitting drum sequence, along with a very tone-rich and hardcore guitar riff.. going into \\"The Day The World Went Away\\", which takes you by surprise.I'll leave the rest up to you to decide. This album is sure to please any Nine Inch Nails fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Cd","review":"Amazing..........I borrowed this cd from my older brother and I simply cannot really express how wonderful this cd...the songs The Fragile and Were In This Together i can't get enough of! The musical tracks are just great and Tren Reznors voice can soothe any worried mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"In a word: ART","review":"Reznor skillfully crafts chaos into something beautiful. Songs like \\"La Mer\\" and \\"Just Like You Imagined\\" are good examples of this. It's more of a quilt than an album, with each song woven together in some way. It's truly a wonderful work of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Art & emotion","review":"Music today (pop, rap, and even most rock) is a product. A product of your money. Not trent(ARTIST OF \\"THE FRAGILE\\".) This is real art. True emtion, NIN is not just another screaming guitar band. There is true substance in this album, the lyrics are amazing and reveal deep emotion and fear and happiness. pop (bacstreet, n'synk britany,) are degrating musc. This is (in my opinion) the greatest piece of art recorded. Buy It. Listen to it fully. You could spend hours thinking about the meaning of one song. I have converted many of my friends to deeper music that goes beyond the surface, I hope to do the same for you. -a million starsdrop me a line if your a true fragile freak like me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Art & emotion","review":"Music today (pop, rap, and even most rock) is a product.

I was a tad disappointed with his newest, \\"With Teeth\\", so for vintage Reznor get this one instead. But everything this guy touches is wonderful.. and since this is probably the last album he might have made while he was still getting intoxicated.. get it! There are hundreds and hundreds of reviews praising this album... for a good reason. It's great."},{"rating":"2","title":"not an album... an experience.","review":"wow. definetly not something i have heard, ever. this album is unlike anything made by any artist, even NIN. It's more of a progressive album with longer songs that seem to blur together. If you have the musical patience to let things build, climax, and resolve, you will be rewarded greatly. To get the total picture on how good this album is, you must listen to it in it's entirety. You will then see what true art is.Some of the stand out tracks on this album are: the hard hitting \\"Somewhat Damaged\\" , the powerful \\"We're In This Together\\", everyone's beloved \\"Starf***ers Inc.\\", and the epic ending to an epic album \\"Ripe (with decay).all the songs on The Fragile are a beautiful example of a blending of many different types of instruments, electronics, distortion, being blended to make such wonderous music.emotion, art, meaning. nine inch nails music is defintly The Fragile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely great!","review":"I first bought \\"Downward Spiral\\" and I loved it, but then I got this... really astounding, a masterpiece! From beginning to end, Trent and his friends do a great job crafting moods, athmospheres, rhythm patterns and melodies (very soft and very hard), you'll ve surprised for all the creativity contained into this album.For all of you that always are crashing your head against the wall, please broaden your sight! Not all NIN's music can be like \\"Broken\\" or \\"Downward\\", please accept Trent's evolution, and if not, I'll respect it, but you're missing the chance of get somethig really majestic, with all the rage you like but also with feelings and grooves you can discover here in \\"The Fragile\\". I'm sure, if you want, you'll ultimately enjoy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fragile is without a doubt a masterpiece","review":"I have never been a fan of Nine Inch Nails, but as soon as a I heard this, I fell in love with it. I don't care too much for the other NIN albums, but this one struck a cord with me. The sounds are blended together to form an amazing rock opera. Trent is truly a genious. He shows his emotions in the lyrics and flow of the music. It flows together to create an awe inspiring album. I have still to get sick of this album. Every song has it's own unique touch and melody. He seems to have a beat repeat but knows just when you have had enough and switches to something else. This Album covers violent, to the calm, to the depressing. Everyone will find some meaning to his words, but I don't concentrate on that. I simply absorb the amazing melody and simple genious which is the Fragile. The best album ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALBUM OF THE YEAR","review":"Out of all the cds released this year, NIN's \\"The Fragile\\" is by far the best. It dosn't matter if you're into rock or pop, just go to the store and pick up a copy of it. No one does a better job of mixing the kind of emotions Reznor does. Everything is presented on this package. Pure rage (\\"Somewhat Damaged\\" \\"No You Dont\\") to moving slow songs (\\"The Great Below\\"). This year was a very sad year for pop and rock music (boybands, rap/rock hybrids, Britney lookalikes) and it was very refreshing to hear Trent come back with \\"The Fragile\\". My suggestion: Go buy it today. It might set you back a bit on money, but I think its worth double the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for NIN fans!","review":"This album was a long time coming, but certainly excellent, and, despite all the cliches, worth the wait. Over the years we've seen evolution in Reznor's music, with Pretty Hate Machine differing from the Broken and Downward Spiral Eras, and The Fragile also takes a step further in his styles. But throughout the whole thing, there's been one thing that's never changed: the intense power in the raw emotions conveyed in his music. This is true achievement, worthy of its predecessors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nuttin' like new NIN","review":"Many have already said that downward spiral or pretty hate was trent's best, but I disagree. Granted, his past works were jaggedly delightful, but his new stuff is evolutionary. Evolutionary in the sense that he's moving on in his life, and with it, the transformation of his thoughts with his music. Fragile almost seems too soft at times, but I believe it a great mix of harsh versus sweet melody. Ol' trent is simmering down, his mind probably aging along with his body. But, he's NIN, and he needs to keep us salivating with more of the original Industrial. Another great work from reznor-mon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the variety . . .","review":"This is the first NIN album I have ever purchased. The first time I heard Trents works was on the Quake soundtrack. So, no, I am not familiar with his earlier Album work. I was really impressed with all the different styles Trent draws from. La Mer (Track 11 - Disc 1) is a really nice dark jazzy sounding piece. He integrates hip-hop and drum 'n bass beats in other tracks as well which was really suprising, but with very dark and industrial overtones. I love the variety available on both cds. Overall a very atmospheric piece of work. Fast paced beats, beautifully orchestrated instrumental tracks, straitforward industrial rock . . . it's all there and all really well done. My opinion of-course. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Guess what you don't know?","review":"Hey this CD Is even Better if you Play Both discs at the Same time...I found this out from experience I had from another Techno CD set we had at the radio station."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two words - A Masterpiece","review":"I walked over a mile at nearly midnight to buy this cd the day it was released. I would walk ten times that knowing now as I do how wonderful the Fragile is. \\"Somewhat Damaged\\", the first track on disc one, is full of anger and rage and a masterfully arranged song. \\"The Great Below\\" is astonishing in its beauty, both in its lyrics and its sound. I could keep going, but since I LOVE every song on both discs, I would be here for a while. I highly recommend this, even for first time NIN listeners."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best cd of the 90s","review":"The first few times I listened to \\"the Fragile\\", I just couldn't get used to it. It sounded really different from what Trent was doing before with TDS and PHM and Broken. But after the second listen or so, it just dawned on me all of a sudden that it was a mixture of his old style and a lot of cool new stuff. This cd is great! It has a beauty of its own and is totally worth your money! The best songs off it are \\"the Wretched\\", \\"The Fragile\\", #7, \\"Into the Void\\" and \\"where is everybody\\"... I just can't stop listening to it ever since I bought it. It is definetely the best cd I own."},{"rating":"1","title":"THis blows","review":"Trent Reznor wants to be Kurt Cobain so bad. The songs on this album are too repetitive. If u want to hear REAL music, listen to Nirvana, Metallica, or AC/DC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even one star is pushing it...","review":"I can't in good conscience recommend this album to anybody--it's complete and utter garbage, but then again, I expect nothing less from Trent. For my money, he'll never be able to top 'Broken', and 'Fragile's excessive length doesn't redeem anything. Expect to find lots of copies of this album in the used bins in no time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reznor has become a parody of himself.","review":"Reznor used to be innovative. This cd is very weak. Now he just blends in with all the other lame artists that get played on the radio. There is nothing groundbreaking about this cd.
