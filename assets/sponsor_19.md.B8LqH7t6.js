It is well constructed, it is sturdy and essentially unmovable. The tables are easy to align with the sanding surfaces. It has loads of power and can remove stock amazingly fast. However, to rate the dust collection system as poor gives it a compliment. It is abyssmal. You need to be outdoors or wear a dust mask when using the disc sander for any heavy sanding. The only place on the disc that collects any dust is when you sand on the outer 1 inch of the disc. Any further in than that and most of the dust come out the other side of the disc. A little detective work showed that there is only a small vacuum inlet (about 1 1/2 by 3 inches). Any dust that escapes this vent is blown back into the shop. The belt sander is only marginally better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Built, Durable, Highly Functional","review":"I bought one of these sanders in 2004 or 2005 through a dealer in Syracuse, New York when they first came out and have found over the years that this machine is better than I expected. It has been trouble free the day I bought it. It is well constructed, accurate and the fit and finish is very good. Adjustments are easily accessable. Its greatest asset is the large tables. They are easy to adjust and their size makes them easier to design and attach jigs and fixtures to. The machine is very heavy and stable in operation, no vibration. I have had no problems with belt tracking or tension. I find a slight disadvantage in the verticle height of the belt platen, but you can't have everything. The dust pickup is not very good at the disc side of the machine, but I have never seen one that was since the old Powermatic sanders from the 1980's. If I were to buy belt/disc sander today, it would probably be this make and model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but not American Delta","review":"It's still heavy duty and it works fine but everything seems a little cheaper than the real thing American Delta version.

These books run like movies in your head. Don't stop with these three - find Death in the Andamans, Death in Berlin, Death in Kashmir. And if you enjoy Death in Zanzibar and want to know what happened 100 years earlier, go read Kaye's Trade Wind too- an historical novel set in Zanzibar - you'll be annoyed with the heroine til she finally wizes up (but that's the point), but you'll love the story, the intrigue, and the magnetic hero."},{"rating":"2","title":"MM Kaye trio","review":"For years, I have enjoyed MM Kaye's books.

Following the six pages of general information, the book contains another thirty or so pages of stencil patterns. The pattern pages are only printed on one side so while the book has 60 or so pages there are are about 24 blank pages within that 60. The patterns are old school and reflect Dover's practice of using old material that has no copyright on it.

But also sometimes it's the little things about a tool that make it a pleasure to use, like the ball drain valve that will empty the compressor in less than five seconds, a lot less noisy than my old pancake unit and a quality soft rubber cord. Sure a cord is a very small part of the overall tool, but i can't stand it when i spend hundreds of dollars of a tool and it comes with a cord that's impossible to wrap up when it's 30 degrees ( makes me wonder what other cheap parts are inside )One final thing i would like to add is this unit produces far less moisture than most similar units!!!

Very 'tinny' sound from the speaker, even adjusting the volumes and such did not improve the sound.Certainly recommend the BlueAnt for ease of use, great sound, and hardly noticeable on the visor."},{"rating":"1","title":"BlueAnt Supertooth Light","review":"After receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke.

I could hear the person clearly with no problems but the everyone on the other end said they could either hear themselves echo or I sounded like I was standing in in a windstorm/hurricane. I tried turning off the a/c, made sure the windown were up and I even tested it without the car moving and they still said the same thing. The return process was great though. Got my refund within a few days, no questions asked."},{"rating":"2","title":"My ear no longer hurts!","review":"I have a one-hour plus commute to work (each way) and have many occasions to make or receive business or personal calls during that commute. My hands-free earpiece (+ my sunglasses) would dig into the top of my ear. Also, due to road noise and wind noise in the car, it was often hard to hear calls over the earpiece. The Blue Ant solves both of those problems, as I mounted it on my sunshade, where it is out of the way but convenient to access. It is also loud and clear enough to hear and be heard, over the road noise and air/wind noise in my car. Even when leaving Voice Mail messages, your voice can be heard clearly and with sufficient volume. This is a very useful product, even if you don't live/drive where a \\"hands-free law\\" exists."},{"rating":"1","title":"BlueAnt","review":"Easy to set up, no noise when using.

I wasn't thrilled with possibly having to buy a Bluetooth earpiece or headseat as I don't find them comfortable or attractive.

I had the VBT3000 (from Costco) for about a year, and the biggest problem was the lack of full duplex (difficult to have a conversation if each party doesn't wait to speak). Although sound quality wasn't as good as this BlueAnt Supertooth Light (BSLT). I have now been using the BSLT for about 3 weeks and I travel quite a bit (I'm in sales). The quality of sound on both sides is excellent, the full duplex makes this a joy to use, and the battery life has also been excellent.

I contacted the company and they told me that, although the unit was still under warranty, if I couldn't produce my receipt I was out of luck. Who keeps a sales slip for nine months? Felix Unger? Needless to say, they didn't offer online warranty registration when I bought it. I've heard the Supertooth 3 is better, but who needs this kind of customer service? I'd stay away from these guys.

Much more satisfactory than the Motorola bluetooth ear piece I previously had. To turn it off, you have to depress the microphone arm. It just keeps springing back out and therefore turns back on. This means I cannot transfer a call to my cell phone when I arrive at my destination. The battery won't stay charged as long either.

I have less-than-perfect hearing and the speaker is plenty loud for me. The noise-cancelling feature makes for good conversations, the people I speak with cannot tell I am on a bluetooth device. I work in a mobile lab in the oil fields of west Texas and east New Mexico and I set it next to my work station. I no longer wear that very annoying earbud bluetooth device.This particular model doesn't have a screen or keys or anything like that. It is just a (truly) handsfree bluetooth device that works exactly as I desire -- high-volume speaker and easy on-off while in the vehicle.The one caveat to this 5-star review is the visor clip. It really needs to be stronger or they need to add a second clip.

The only thing to remember you must reconnect to it if you were not the last user, and if you and anyone driving with you are the users of it you have to designate who will be connected while in the car at the same time as it can only handle one phone.

The small downside to this is that sometimes, the person on the other end of the line will get an echo of their own voice. BlueAnt tech support (they were quite responsive, btw) suggested that I adjust the volume of the speaker. I had to play with it to find the right balance so that I could hear the other person without them hearing an echo.

When I called support, they asked me if I live in a cold climate, \\"yes, Vermont\\", I stated. They told me to bring it inside to warm up, which didn't work. And, what's the point of having a visor blue-tooth if you've got to bring it inside every day? I ended up buying one of those JawBone things, which works nicely, but I've got to put it on my ear!

Since she primarily uses her cell phone while she's in her Jeep I looked into the BlueAnt Supertooth Light (which I had considered when I first chose the Jawbone). To make the story a bit shorter, the BlueAnt is exactly what she/I was hoping for. Reception, voice quality (both inbound and outbound) is superb) and pairing, using, etc. is simple.I now am the owner of the Jawbone :s Works great, but can't get it to fit comfortably or sercurely.

I then tried calling support and got a recorded message but was unable to leave a message. Tried emailing support 4 times and got their automated response message. Never did get a response from a human. I even found an email address of someone in marketing - sent them a request to have someone in support call me. No response.

Because I'm too cheap to throw away something that's so good in all other respects, I decided to buy a big bag of rubber bands and I keep that microphone pushed in with a good strong rubber band when I'm not using it. After several weeks of use, that rubber band gets weak from use and the heat of the car, so I just grab a fresh new rubber band from the bag and I'm good to go again.

Glad I was able to return it and not have an expensive brick on my hands. Pick up by the mic was not like others stated. You could not talk at normal level and always be heard. It worked, but not as well as I was lead to believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"BlueAnt Supertooth Bluetooth Handsfree speaker","review":"Excellent bluetooth device for answering cell phones in the car; great reception and very clear; highly recommended"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Connectivity","review":"This was my second attempt with a bluetooth speakphone for my car. My first one was the unit sold @Costco that had a terrible speaker and good connectivity. I bought the Blueant model based upon customer reviews. The speaker performed very well. However, the connectivity sucked. When I spoke, it was loaded with static and was intermitent aka breaking up."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much echo","review":"Would not recommend.

Amazing battery life, just charge 1 every 2 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"We bought ten of these for our office. Everyone, and some are technically challenged, was able to complete the set-up with no help beyond what is in the user manual. They are being used with a variety of phones and we have had no problems. Sound quality on both ends has been great. It would be nice if it had a caller ID display, but this is a great product for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well as advertized.","review":"Well, as the coming law will be here by summer in California forbidding drivers to use their mobile phone unless they have wireless options, I decided to buy and try the BlueAnt Supertooth Light Bluetooth Hansfree Speakerphone. I read many of the reviews and decided to try it for myself. My experience with it has been very good. It was easy to pair my mobile phone with it and it works very well. I don't have any issues hearing or be heard even though I drive a convertible. I haven't tried it yet with the top down though I don't expect it to work any better or worse than when I use the phone itself with my top down. I would recommend this product for its simplicity of configuration and use. And it is very affordable also. I had read some reviews about the magnets and my experience is they provide a strong support and haven't caused me any problems or concerns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Try it, you'll like it","review":"I didn't want a Bluetooth stuck in my ear for the few times in my car I might need to talk on the phone. The Blueant Supertooth was the answer. I have no problem hearing the callers or them hearing me. The ease of use is great. It took no time at all to have our two phones \\"talk\\" to the Supertooth.I read some of the negatives and quite honestly don't agree. The flashing blue light is so small it doesn't bother me (not to mention you can simply adjust your visor if it should bother you). The magnets that hold the Supertooth to the visor clip are quite strong and I have not had any problem with it slipping or falling off.It will be easy to move from one car to another if we decide not to buy another one for the second car."},{"rating":"2","title":"BlueAnt Supertooth Light handsfree","review":"This product was easy to set up. Many options for placement in car.

SO NOW I AM BUYING ONE FOR MY CAR.WORKS GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"People Couldn't Hear Me","review":"I bought this for my wife. She tried it for a couple of weeks but switched to a blue tooth headset. I then tried it for a few weeks. It was too large to fit on the driver's side visor and permit me to flip the visor all the way down to block the sun. I then moved it to the passenger's side visor where it was excellent for listening to calls but the people with whom I was speaking said they could not hear me. Also, the noise of the air conditioner (even on low) made it so the person with whom I was speaking could not hear me at all. I then started holding it in my hand when I was using it -- which completely defeats the unit's hands-free purpose. Finally, I gave up. It is now sitting in a rummage box heading for Goodwill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good hands-free for the price","review":"I bought this for my mom, who, while in the car, often leaves her phone at the bottom of her purse. This speakerphone is easy to pair, and with only two buttons, very easy for my mom to receive and end a call. While talking to her on the speaker, there is very little echo and I can barely tell that she's not speaking directly through her phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"almost perfect","review":"This is the best bluetooth speakerphone I ever had. Loud enough to use in a convertible (city limits). And finally I have found one that picks up the GPS-directions from my Blackberry and amplifies those, so that I can listen to the radio while driving in un-known territories.I only wish the buttons were backlit for driving in the dark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked Well - High Volume is not saved","review":"In a convertible you have to set the volume very high. Unfortunatly the high volume setting is not saved for the next call. You have to increase to volume on every call.

It's easy to use. It's inexpensive relative to some of its competitors. So far it tolerates the heat inside a parked car. I recommend it highly.

I have come to find out from other reviews that this problem is too common. Having said that, I love the way it works - enough to ask for a replacement rather than a refund - but am holding my breath that this one will be more durable. I had a Motorola visor-clip bluetooth speakerphone prior to the BlueAnt. While it did not have any moving parts that can break, the sound quality using the BlueAnt is far superior on both ends. I feel I made a smart, informed choice with the BlueAnt, and that I got a good deal at the Amazon price of $69."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"This product is great! Outstanding audio quality, battery life for talk time are the best I have seen. It is great to be able to pair the device to more then one phone. I put one in each of our cars. It's great to just jump in turn the unit on and it pairs to whatever phone you have in the car."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound, bad design","review":"The speaker is remarkably good on this unit, providing clear full sound. The microphone is adequate, requiring you to speak strongly (like you were in a play) to be heard well, but generally performs well. The part that I didn't like was the part that retains the microphone when you turn it off. It acts a bit like a ball point pen, you push the microphone in and it stays, turning the unit off. You push on it again and it pops out, turning the unit on. The problem is that when my car get hot, something inside warps and causes the unit to stick and not release the microphone to turn it on. If you tap it hard, the microphone will pop out, but then the mechanism will not hold when you try to push the microphone back in again to turn it off. I was able to successfully open the unit and remount the retainer mechanism back into place and it would work until it got hot again. Again, this is a good unit providing your car doesn't get too hot inside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy with BlueAnt...","review":"I ordered the BlueAnt Supertooth Light(blah blah blah) because the law changed in California to require handsfree phone use in cars. It is super easy to use and to set up. I'm told the sound quality is fine at the other end of the call - sometimes at my end things sound a little garbled (although that may be my cell carrier). My only \\"complaint\\" is that the visor clip is fairly narrow (tight) so it doesn't seem to fit well on my visor - my visor isn't terribly fat so this seems like a small flaw. Otherwise I'm very happy with the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"blue ant","review":"antenna ceased to go in after one week's use.

I tried a few of the Jabra speakers for the car and they were all horrible. I decided to get this from Amazon. It came in two days. I paired it with my cell phone in 20 seconds. I charged it up for the night. I put it in my car to give a try on the way to work. It was so clear on both ends. I felt like a can talk all day. I have used it now for a week and no problems at all. It works so well. I even bring it in the house and use it. I saw some reviews about the mic being constructed bad. I am just careful when opening it and closing it. I also love when phone rings it beeps throught the speaker. All you do is hit the green button. It looks like a garage door opener. GREAT PRODUCT..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great, until it broke","review":"This product worked just great for a few months, then the phone part that you have to push back in to turn it off, would not latch back in. So, I couldn't turn it off. It is a good product, but they should not have made it so that you have to push in something to turn it on or off...that is always something that breaks! If they had this with a normal on/off switch, I would buy it again in a heartbeat, but as is, no thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"I was looking for something like this since I hate the bluetooth ear pieces. Everyone that I ask on the other side of the call says it sounds clear and on my side it's clear also. I haven't used it while on the highway yet, just in the city so far. I would buy it again and would recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Produce and Extra Cost to Fix","review":"I've used another Supertooth Light for a couple of years and liked it, which is why I bought this one.However, I was sent a defective product (the microphone didn't work)... and had to pay to ship it back to get it replaced by BlueAnt!!Based on this experience I will never buy another piece of electronics gear from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Blue Tooth accessory for my dustpile","review":"This works great when my car is stopped and the engine is shut off and the windows are rolled up. Even the most diehard people I talk to who are great \\"bluetooth interpreters\\" when quality gets sketchy say it sounds like crap. Again, if I'm stopped it's fine, but the microphone is VERY directional, in the end I was just holding it in my hand like a phone and asked myself why? Why am I even using it? Putting my Razor on speaker and sticking it up on the visor works better than this thing. One thing, I drive an Nissan Altima, and the highway noise in the cabin is fairly high. You might do better in a quieter car, but I'll take mine out of my desk and give it to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"The microphone does not retract anymore after less than a month","review":"I purchased this after reading the positive reviews. I should have paid more attention to some of the negative reviews that talked about the microphone wand that acts as an on/off switch.I used it a total of about 6 times and the \\"wand\\" refuses to go back. The mechanism that allows it to retract is not working and as a result its always on.When I went to Amazon to return it, it would not let me return saying the last date to return had just passed and there is some vague language about partial credit etc.So I opened a warranty ticket with BlueAnt. Let's see how that works.I am disappointed that Amazon does not clearly explain what to do with products that go defective after a month."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that great","review":"Although it was easy to set up, convenient to use and works fine with my phone, I think I will return it. If there is not a lot of outside noise, I can usually hear the person on the other end okay, but it is extremely hard for them to hear me. I have tried to speak up, but I shouldn't have to yell when I'm on the phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems like a GREAT product BUT.......","review":"From the description and the HIGH reviews, it seemed like a great product. However in this case, the LOW reviews seem to be the most correct.My problem with the unit was the person who I was talking to ALWAYS heard an echo. Even after repeated attempts to try and wait out a conversation for 15 minutes or more to see if voice cancellation would kick in, was unsuccessful.I did contact support and a few days after not hearing from them I went ahead and packed up the device and dropped it in the mail the day support wrote me back.Support said my phone was the problem and not the device. They also said they had numerous reports about my samsung phone not being supported. However, my motorla blue tooth phone did not work and better with the device. They also said it may have been due to excessive road noise from my vehicle.I drive a 2002 Lincoln LS and a 2005 Ford F-150 XLT. Both VERY Quiet vehicles.The echo even happened when sitting in the driveway with the car off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"The product is quite useless especially if you are driving on highways.The speakers are average and the microphone is pathetic.People hear mostly wind and garbled noise on the other end.....also the design of the mic looks stupid being on top...instead of facing you...The quality is fit for dollar store products....."},{"rating":"1","title":"missing parts","review":"No user manual in the package, which appeared to have been previously opened.

With war brewing close to the Barony, the Baron is keeping Lamirh as a trump card of sorts. There are other tensions developing within the small Barony, paticularly, the Baron's treatment of his subjects. The animation and music in this series are very well done.

Highly recommended and nicely layed out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete but confusing","review":"While this book covers a lot of material it is very confusing.

The tutorials that come with 3ds max are better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another example of bad how to books in computing","review":"This book suffers from the almost universal problem that most computer instructional guides do... lack of any educational theory in its writing. It does not guide the newcomer through the art of learning the software, but rather deals with issues as if one is going through the menu commands. The tutorials consistantly use elements and commands that one will not cover for another hundred por more pages, and the chapters are not designed to \\"build on the student's knowledge\\" but rather to give all information about a given cocept right from the beginning. Thus, I am taught how to personalise the user interface and use XREFs (external references) before I am told how to create even the simplest of objects.I am an experienced 3D analylist, with knowledge of CAD and GIS, so I am not the least experienced of readers on this topic.

I understand that theory also plays a large role here, but web-based training opportunities move at the pace of technology, particularly in the corporate world.

His view of war in Bosnia is so one-sided and really insulting for the people who lived that war in real life.

Other thing, the Kosovo crisis - why did he put it in there, wasn't the war in Bosnia enough?? (I guess he needed 40-something pages to fill).

The paint has been rubbed off of the red wooden handles (this isnt a big deal to me, but if I am going to pay 300 bucks for something how about some thought into shipping). This has been a complaint for OVER A YEAR. There appeared to be some thought into the inside packaging. There were about 5 crumpled up brown shipping paper between the clamps.

The detail and description of Darth Vader's iconic suit and, his trouble with his new sith garb, was a new avenue of Star Wars. Plus the peek into the relationship between Master and apprentice in regards to Sith lords was worth the price of the book. Anyone who is a true Star wars fan will be pleased with the storyline. The introduction of many well known characters is interesting, and not corny. James Luceno is a great Star Wars writer, he deals with underlying issues of characters that can't be touched in the movies. I look forward to future books that deal with the early years of the Rebellion, and more rogue Jedi. This book is a must buy, and with it coming in paperback it's even more desirable. Star Wars fans sit back and enjoy this snipet of Star Wars lore brought to you by a masterful story teller, James Luceno. My only desire is to see this book become a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"great quick read Please make a movie or TV show of it","review":"Picks up just weeks after Ep 3. Was a bit nervous becaue the first two chapters were just about the ending moments of the the clone wars but Leceno pulls it off soon after. You get Vader action, Jedi action, tons of wookie action, The Emperor being the Emperor, and a visit for the droids. The exploration of Vaders \\"birth\\" to the Dark Side is handled well- not too detailed but enough to satisfy. Since it it is a bit short it doesnt get the full 5 stars but Luceno did nice work with Labyrinth of Evil (another must read Star Wars book) and does one better with this book. Must read for the fans- please someone tell Lucasfilms to include all or part of this in the upcoming TV show! May the Force be with you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I got this book because it was titled the Rise of Darth Vader. Instead what I got was The Flee of the Remaining Jedi. Darth Vader is in this book but a handfull of times. Since this book is entitled the Rise of Darth Vader one would expect the book to be about Darth vader and his Rise to power as the second in command in the whole galexy. But unfortunately it's not. Over all I was very disappointed in this book. The darth vader character has been my favorite character in the whole Star Wars saga. I hope that books about his life to follow have more to do with him than other characters. If you are interested in Reading this book, you won't learn anything about him that you don't already know. You get no new information about who he has become and what is now driving him. If you noticed in the second starwars movie how much of a baby Anikin is, nothing has changed. Save yourself the few hours of reading time and pick something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Darklord A Dark Disappointment","review":"Where Labyrinth captued the heart and sole of the characters, its plot racing us to the opening of Episode III as fast as I could turn the pages-Dark Lord was a huge disappointment- I had to make myself finish it and was left wondering why this book was such a stark contrast in writing and depth for Luceno."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm, Crap This Is...Good book, this is not.","review":"YAAWWWN..Oh man this boring! Based on the title and the cover art, I decided to buy this. I bought the audio version on CD because I thought it would be something exciting to listen to in the car. Unfortunately, the advertising was misleading and I found book has very little to do with Vader, his rise to power or any major events within the Empire. Instead the book is about 90% focused on some Jedi named Roan Shryne and his Padawan named Olee Starstone. It is filled with long winded, drawn out descriptions and week dialog (once I heard a character say \\"what the frizz\\", I hit the skip button on the CD player). There really were no exciting ship battles, lightsaber duels, or the usual things that make Star Wars fun. Also, I was hoping for juicy dialog between Vader and the Emperor. There are some conversations between them, but they are few and far between and never really develop into anything or lead anywhere. This was a big opportunity wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"This book's title is, in part, \\"The Rise of Darth Vader.\\" Little attention, however, is actually paid to that topic. The book is in some instances a quick review of what led Anakin to choose the path of the Dark Side of the Force, but provides nothing but primer in the way of Darth Vader becoming the feared being he is in Star Wars: ANH. Perhaps fine as a story in and of itself, but potential readers should not buy this book if their clear goal is learning anything new about our villain's history between Episodes III and IV."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good.","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book. Didn't know what to expect, but kind of was thinking along a bigger timeline. I did like the fact that Vader was still thinking and complining like Anakin while at the same time Vader was also growing.Didn't like the other characters in the book. The Jedi that survived and the smugglers that helped. I didn't really care what happened to them, who survivied or how who died. Very poor character development there.My other big gripe is that this book pretty much starts and ends within weeks of the end of the Clone Wars. Like I said earlier, I was expecting to cover more time wise."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best SW novels thus far...","review":"Forget what the negative reviewers say - who knows what they were thinking or what their motivation is...perhaps they've sold themselves to the Dark Side?Some of the SW books are really bad - the Courtship of Princess Leia comes to mind. But this is one of the best.Pay attention to the large number of reviewers and stars, trust in them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"There are several problems with this book beginning with the sad fact that there is no real story, just a loosely woven collection of vignettes featuring a collection of minor characters that are best forgotten. Vader never develops as a result of any of the events depicted between this book's covers, although the author claims that Vader makes a major breakthrough in understanding the darkside. Unfortunately, we're never shown why, how, or what that possibly means.Secondly, the book is populated with minor characters (Vader isn't introduced until nearly page 50) that are really nothing more than fodder for the Dark Lord, characters that are stood up only so they can be knocked down. Except for their names, they are indistinguishable.Which speaks to the major shortcoming of this book, the very poor writing. I was never once \\"drawn\\" into any of the scenes or the lives of the characters. The writing was flat, the characters d.o.a., and the story missing in action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible book","review":"Loved the book. Vader was always my favorite character. I just hope they make more books about him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for a diehard fan","review":"I am a die hard Star Wars fan, I have been one since Episode 4 in 1977, I had great hopes for this and there is so much that could Luceno could have done with this book.The plot is bland and not very interesting, when the action does get going Luceno switches to some character of not much interest or value.This book really is not about Vader but about some remaining Jedi and then a little bit of Vader mixed in.In all I was disappointed in this one,hopefully any other author who attempts to write about this crucial period in Star Wars history will get it right."},{"rating":"1","title":"the story does not match the title","review":"I feel the story should've dealt more with the title character, rathter than the title character being more a 2nd tier player in all of this.The story dealt more with the fleeing Jedi, their thoughts, motivations, fears, etc, rather than the Emperor's new apprentice.For my first Star Wars novel, I'm very disappointed, and unsure if I'll read further."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book. I'd recommend picking it up.","review":"Pretty good book. I was suprised that I enjoyed it to be honest. It picks up after revenge of the sith and shows anakin becoming vader in mind body and soul. The book would have been better if the characters he was fighting against were in any way interesting. They are just shallow characters to get pimped slaped by vader."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad book","review":"This was the second worst star Wars novel I have ever read, the only one worse was the Courtship of Princess Leia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This item looked, felt, and actually in fact is a book.

Super easy read, literally flew through this book and really enjoyed every minute of it. However it really left me wanting more. I'd like to crawl further still into the psyche of Vader. I really liked what the author did with him, I just really wish we could have seen more.I did get a bit emotionally involved in the book, but I think I'm a pretty easy sell. There was a chuckle or two to be had, and I even felt a lump in my throat in a couple of places.I hope that in taking on Darth Plagueis, Mr. Luceno goes deeper into the character, like Drew Karpyshyn in the Darth Bane series.I love the way Mr. Luceno writes, I just could have done with another 60 pages or so devoted solely to Vader. Felt like a lot was missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Geat book","review":"I read this book when it came out beacause I was intrested in what went on between episode 3 and 4. I loved how the athur showed rements of anikan. I found it quite enjoyable. I am also lokking forword to the dark times comics witch follow this book. Also I reccomend reading the last of the jedi series. Now lets get ready for the new tv series wich also takes place betweeen Episode 3 and 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written","review":"I am giving this 4 stars instead of 3 because it is clearly evident Mr. Luceno is a very good writer, but their is not much value added to the overall Star Wars Saga storyline and while the story wraps up with Vader most of the book offers little new insight to his character. Still it was a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing bridge for the Saga","review":"Maybe I expected too much, having enjoyed James Juceno's other works, or maybe I expected too much from such an well-titled novel set during the gap between the SW Saga's 2 film trilogies.Ultimately, I found this a weakly written story with no real contribution to the Star Wars film series continuity or to that of the books. Also the author/publisher's jacket color choices are too similar to the novelization of Episode 3, probably generating some confusion-based sales (leaving no doubt disappointed buyers)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great SW read","review":"I have read many SW books including the originals (splinter of the minds eye, Han Solo adventures, etc) and this by far is one of if not \\"the\\" best. I enjoyed reading about Anakin struggling with his new identity and dealing with the fact that Palpatine took away everything he cared about and manipulated him. Lots of actions too. It was a very quick read and I hope they release a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, could have been more focused on Vader though","review":"I've noticed that in the Clone Wars series the stories seem to focuse more on minor characters than the main ones. I was really looking forward to this book focusing on Vader. It seemed more about the Jedi that were not killed around the galaxy. With that being said, I still thought it was a great book with a great story. It should have been named \\"surviving order 66\\" or something like that rather than rise of darth vader. You still get a lot of good insight on Vader though and was worth listening to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent follow up to Episode III","review":"I just finished reading this and enjoyed it for the most part. Like many other Star Wars books this might not satisfy casual fans. However, it does go into detail about what happened four weeks after Episode III and Vader's experiences. The author did a good job showing him to be awkward at first but developing over time to at the end of the book showing the first hints of the classic cinematic villain he is in the original trilogy. The writing does lose its \\"Star Wars\\" feel in some places but not too many. This book also shows what is happening politically in the galaxy with most characters from Episode III shown. The relationship between Palpatine and Vader is explored and I found that too be very interesting as it shows both of their thoughts towards each other. I do hope that Luceno writes another book continuing the events in this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"good follow up to revenge of the sith","review":"i thought this book was a decent follow up to the last movie. it goes through the struggles of Darth Vader and how he becomes what we know him to be. it was kind of slow at points, and if he and sidious we so strong in the dark side they would have been able to hunt down the rest of the jedi, but it was over all a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"Don't bother to read this tome. James Luceno has transformed one of the most darkest and villainous bad-guy into a whimpering, whining cry-baby. I read the book praying that the story-line would get better; it doesn't. Not even worth while reading for diehard fan-atics."},{"rating":"2","title":"A psychological and emotional journey towards the Dark Side","review":"With the blessing of George Lucas, author James Luceno takes his readers through Vaders psychological and emotional journey towards the acceptance of his new persona as well as his place within the Dark Side of the Force. Luceno focuses on details such as the limitations of Vaders body suit, a necessity brought forth by his defeat at the hands of his brother and old Master Obi-Wan Kenobi on Mustafar.Other topics, such as the adjustment to his light saber technique to his very manner of walking are also discussed. Star Wars: Dark Lord - The Rise of Darth Vader is a tale of ascension wherein Darth Vader, consumed by anger and hate, regains his lost confidence as well as his resolve in the Dark Side.Star Wars: Dark Lord - The Rise of Darth Vader answers a lot of questions left behind by Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith. So what are you waiting for? Grab your copy today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging sequel","review":"The story line that this book presents is a very interesting look into the relationship of Darth Sidious and Darth Vader. It helps fill in the gap between \\"Revenge of the Sith\\" and \\"A New Hope.\\" I found it compelling at times and hard to put down. For all of those who are interested in the Star Wars saga, this is a must read to help answer those questions that have arisen from the birth of Darth Vader to his developed character in later novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story","review":"Unlike many of the other Star Wars titles, I really enjoyed this book. I felt that the author did a great job at keeping continuity in the story line with the movies unlike many of the other authors that attempt to write further stories.What I liked most about this book was reading how the Empire transitions the galaxy to their rule without showing it's true evil side... yet.

So then everything worked except the \\" light show\\" at the top still haven't figured that one out but if i do i will post again for future buyers. It's not broken ya just have to take the time to figure it out. Which you figure that you shouldn't have to do that with a new toy.

I would recommend to any one who wants to use Taguchi methods. Its especially suited for beginers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redundant and plodding","review":"I would NEVER recommend this book to anyone. I threw away my copy when I was through reading it so that I wouldn't be responsible for anyone else wasting their time with it. I found the book to be tedious, mind-numbingly redundant, misogynistic & racist. The main character whines about the state of society oblivous to the fact he is one of the horribly twisted reasons why society is the way it is. There were no surprises to be found anywhere in the book since the author apparently mistook foreshadowing for plot AND character, thus focusing mainly on foreshadowing. In case we readers are too thick to miss any of it, repetition pounds it into our heads. I found nothing new or noteworthy in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sour taste, unpleasant purpose","review":"A very unusual book. There are a number of stories that concern a main character whose personal troubles give him illumination into the larger troubles of society. This book is unusual in that:-- the main character is a sour, depressed member of an old local aristocracy that has lost its power and prestige-- in his opinion, the troubles with society are the lack of chivalrous values and a sense of mission.The book takes on the pompous and self-pitying tone of its main character, and the points it makes about society seem so... well, conservative, even fuddy-duddy and irrelevant... that it makes you wonder if the author really means it or if he's trying to portray something. If the author really does mean it, then I wish he had drawn a character I had a little sympathy for. The personal problems just don't have must drama, and Lancelot Lamar himself is just not... that... exciting..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping read!","review":"It's been over 20 years since I've read this book, but I still consider it one of the most enjoyable reading experiences I've ever had.

In the last 6 mos, I've read all his novels, this being the last. The best by far was the Thanatos Syndrome. This book is about a 35 yr old of the landed gentry of the Old South. He marries a lusty cracker, who has designs on becoming the same. For awhile she's satisfied w meticulously rehabbing their Civil War era plantation mansion. Then she befriends a local involved w making a film. Eventually the cast and crew end up shooting and living in the house and all hell breaks loose. I think all his novels are 4* to 5*. You won't regret reading him."},{"rating":"2","title":"A message we have continued to miss","review":"Lancelot is an engrossing book. Moral issues are batted around and the nature of an individual's frame of reality completely shifts. I recommend this book to everyone. Everyone should read it.

I subsequently embarked on a quest to read every word the man had written. Percy presents the ultimate choice to any moral person living in this age: It will be Lancelot's way or Percival's. Find out which suits you . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to read, difficult to digest ...","review":"I can overlook that Percy basically stole Machado De Assis' \\"Don Casmurro,\\" but only because the latter tackles such difficult issues, and is a VERY difficult read. And yet, Percy pulls it off. Just as we begin sympathizing with Lancelot, we're sprung forward again from our LAZ-E-BOY recliners and are reminded of the reality of his actions. I kinda wish Percy hadn't written the book in Second Person, as if WE were the therapist or something, but if THAT'S what it takes to reassure us that WE'RE not mad, so be it. A very uncomfortable, un-pretty, DISTURBING read -- worth the effort, but hard to recommend to anyone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of Valdez's best","review":"This movie is not only good because of the several funny gags but it is also because of the cast. A slim Tin-tan looks great as a Pachuco king with a double life: honest workman and gang leader. Silvia Pinal just looks gorgeous. Clearly at her prime. Maybe the acting is not the best one but it is well suited for this easy-going comedy. Director Gilberto Martinez-Solares brings some innovation into this movie involving the actors into a dialogue with the audience. I have never seen another movie of this time showing up this. Could it be said that this movie-audience interaction is an introduction of this director. Aside of technical details, this is a great comedy of the so-called 'Golden Age' of Mexican cinema. Something that should be in the collection of all those interested in the filming of that time in Latin America."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money;","review":"This is the worst product I have ever purchased.

I searched everywhere for trays that hold 24 eggs and then I finally found this one! Imagine my disappointment when I opened the box and guess what? There are only 15 slots for eggs. Now maybe they use a different counting system than I do...I'm not sure. Even if I cram eggs in the center where garnish or dip is supposed to go, there is no way you can cram 9 eggs in that small area. And to add insult to injury, the lid has one of those great big stickers in the middle that is attached with super glue (you know, the kind that no matter what you try, you always have that gluey, sticky residue on it, and if you scrub it off, you have scratches all over the plastic.) I definitely would not waste my money on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"fascinating nightmares","review":"I read this book many years ago when it was first published in paperback. I lost access to that copy and I am pleased that Nightmares has been reprinted. This is one of the most fascinating books that I have ever read. It is both thought-provoking and highly entertaining. The characterizations and settings are vivid. There are several long dreams, including one about competing cults that promise that either molybdenum or the magnetic pole will cure all ailments, and another about a resurgent Inca civilization dominating the earth.

Really enjoyed the premise. A very different take on the Atlantis myth. As usual, the editing on the Kindle version is not so well done, but doesn't really take away from the story.

My opinion, it then stalls and just kind of lingers around what you know is coming next, but it never seems to get there. This is why I gave it only two stars..

The story itself is good and the concept is very compelling. Unfortunately the numerous spelling, and grammar errors kept me from enjoying the over all \\"flow\\" of the story.

Despite its title, however, this book really doesn't have anything to do with Atlantis (or A51 or BT). Yeah, the island is mentioned here and there - but if you think you're going to read something that sheds any light on or even focuses on the subject, forget it. The title is really just a writer's hook. And it's not a particularly well written book at that. I don't think it's even worth the $.99 price!I bought the kindle version and it seemed to be well translated from its original form - that's worth 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story, horrible editing","review":"I bought the first three books in this series and thoroughly enjoyed it. It's a real page turner but would someoneplease please fix the editing. It's very distracting to read a good story when it's loaded with mistakes. In book one,the name Turcotte (from Area 51?) was used a few times as a character only to never be heard from again,. \\"MAGMA\\" is \\"MAGNA\\" etc etc.I bought the series through my Kindle app on my iPad. I'm quite sure it wasn't downloaded in the wrong format.Let's hope Amazon gets with the program and fixes the problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disappeared into this book","review":"I'm not a professional critic, I just like to read. As some other reviewers noted, there are mistakes in the Kindle edition that a human proofreader should have caught.The fast pace made the book hard to put down and I kept thinking about the story during breaks in reading. The plot drew me in at the beginning more than any attachment to the characters, which came later. Some of the events that happened reminded me of a horror novel. The story was interesting to me because it combined myths about the Bermuda Triangle, Atlantis, and ancient Cambodia with more modern events from the twentieth century.I liked Atlantis enough to want to read more of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tech tramples story","review":"Typical of Mayer books, there is more descriptions of guns weapons of mass destruction than story - and a weak story line at that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth paying for...","review":"Great book...left me wanting more for sure.

I'll be buying the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"fast moving fun","review":"\\"Atlantis\\" reads like it was meant to be an action/adventure movie. The story moves along quickly, brushing up against occult/paranormal elements at the same time as it relies heavily on science/technology, and finishes up with an apocalytic threat. Along the way you touch on the American military in Southeast Asia, global corporate rivalries, secret US government missions, disaster rescue operations, and \\"whew\\" it's all here in one whirlwind ride! Mayer does a good job telling enough to draw you in and make the characters real. Honestly, there has to be considerable suspension of disbelief, but Mayer spins the story in a way that you never notice how much you give up. This book may not appeal to everyone, but if you are partial to action/adventure, \\"Atlantis\\" is well written and entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly written","review":"This book reads like it was written by a 6th grader.\\"Sounds almost like someone's trying to contact us via sonar,\\" the captain of the Scorpion reported. \\"Pinging us.

No. I take that back. It was THE worst I have ever read. The plot was predictable, except for the addition of some random nonsense. I noticed numerous distracting errors while reading it, and while I am no English teacher, they were bothersome, and surprising for an apparently well-published book. The story was unengaging, and though the premise was good, and bore the makings of a great story, (Atlantis, Aliens, and Asia - how can it get better?) the author managed to slaughter it by turning the whole thing into an overly-dramatized, yet boring story. An unfortunate occurrence. The characters were inhuman, and their dialogue unreal. I would not under any circumstances recommend this book, and although the cover boasts a quote that says, \\"You'll wonder if it could be real,\\" I saw nothing realistic about the writing here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read something else instead.","review":"This book sounds fascinating from the jacket, however it reads like an inexpensive Saturday-night 1 hour TV thriller. The dialogue is familiar to me having viewed many \\"Rambo\\" films in the past. The plot would seem engaging if one were to read an outline of it, given the sum of the content alone. There is truly something for everyone, considering the catch-phrases and gratuitous violence combined with Tom Clancy-esque descriptions of military action on a global scale. The unsatisfying result leaves one feeling as though he should have abandoned this book after the first 50 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puts me to sleep every night","review":"Here I am, 2/3 of the way through this book, and the story is just starting to maybe get off the ground... Maybe! I can' t wait anymore for it to finally get going! I'm pulling my hair out and my mind is starting to daydream as I read! Most good books I've read have a setup of the story and then you're off! At this point in the book, I'm begging the characters to get moving and get on with it. This is NOT suspense, it's utter frustration!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall, a good story, but...","review":"My biggest complaint, and this applies to this book in particular, in addition to works by other authors, is: if you're going to write \\"military science fiction,\\" get the military details correct! Personally, I find it very distracting to the story when the details are incorrect.I think that most readers of military science fiction have some knowledge about weapons, etc. That's what makes this genre appeal to them. So, if you're going to have the characters using a very well-known weapon like the M-60, don't state that it's capable of firing \\"six thousand rounds per second,\\" when its actual rate of fire is 500-600 rounds per minute. Don't have F-16 fighters (a USAF aircraft) flying from aircraft carriers (another of this author's books -- \\"Area 51\\").Do a little basic research into what you're writing about, so as no to distract the reader from the overall story."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is one DAMN GOOD book!!!!!!","review":"I read this book in one night, I just couldn't put it down. Donegan put quite a twist on the whole \\"Atlantis\\" and \\"Bermuda Triangle\\" deal. But, what got me was the \\"special gift\\" that the lead character, Dane had. That was awesome. This is one of my all time favorite books by him, along with the Area 51 series(which was written under a different pen name, Robert Doherty). The only thing that I didn't like about the book was that it was too damn short. I can't wait for the sequel to come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Sci-Fi Action Adventure!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this new series from the author of \\"Area 51\\". He smoothly blends history's most intreguing true life mysteries adding his own immaginative twists. With the depth of detail Greg writes with, you feel you \\"know\\" the characters, without having to read a dozen paragraphs describing the buttons on a character's shirt. I was looking forward to this book's publishing, after reading his \\"Area 51\\" series, as Robert Doherty, and I wasn't disappointed. The only negative comment I can write is that the books are not going to come out as fast as I'd like, that goes for both \\"Atlantis\\" and \\"Area 51\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real nail-biter!","review":"You won't want to start reading this one unless you can do it in one sitting.

Donegan takes well known riddles and mysteries (such as the Bermuda Triangle) and puts in his own explanations to their occurences.

From the beginning to the end I found it hard to put the books down. The mix of history and fiction is what made this series appealing to me. I am glad that I started reading this series after all the books had been written. I would have gone nuts waiting for the next one.Yes there are typos throughout the Kindle version but that did not effect my opinion. I have recommended this series to many of my friends and family.

This one is still working just fine and it runs almost 24 hours a day! It's a bargain, and I'd recommend it to anybody looking for a fan to sleep with. I can't sleep without one! I love that I can point it up during the day while I'm awake if I'm in my room and can keep it on low with a bit of white noise as background noise (I hate silence) Then when I get hot while sleeping I can point it right at me if I want. (I always keep it on high while sleeping.) The remote is handy, but you definitely have to be pointing it directly at it in order for it to work. Who cares? It's a great fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lasko Wind Tunnel with remoteIs Great","review":"The Fan Has been doing a remarkable Job Thus far. I had the Wind machine Previously But it Konked out after so many years, So I had to replace with the same one but when I saw the remote I had to get it and everything works fine.Its not that noisey and the lowest setting would be just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived damaged & defective","review":"The title says it all. Arrived in a flimsy box which obviously didn't protect it from getting banged up during shipping. The face is way off-center, which doesn't allow the blades to move/circle properly, or sometimes at all. Am waiting until I get some power tools to take off the screws holding the frame together to see if I can reset the face & blades. I'm sure if I can ever fix the alignment it will be a great fan. But for now, pretty much useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"First order defective ...","review":"I was researching the best fan to replace one that abruptly stopped working last week and was excited to have stumbled upon this fan. I paid extra for one day shipping only to receive a defective fan. From reading other reviews, this is hopefully a fluke. Unless the fan is operating on high, the fan emits an extremely annoying clicking and high pitched squeal. However, the fan does push out a lot of air and can be felt across the room. In conclusion I am awaiting a replacement and will update this review upon receiving the second fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong - this will cool you off","review":"I have now had this fan for a couple of very hot summer months and I still love it. The fan features 3 speeds, a timer, and a remote control; it also has an adjustable tilt from top to bottom. It is loud and it lacks an oscillating mode, however, these are the ONLY faults I can find with this fan. It is powerful and a very effective and efficient cooler. On high, I can feel it from at least 25 feet. For the money, ($33 at Walmart), I could not find a better fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's named wind tunnel for a reason!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I read a few review on this fan and I have only had it for a few hours. Some people complain about the beep it makes when you change from Hi to Low. I don't know what they are complaining about. It makes a noise, but it's not irritating. Someone else said that it was loud. If it's on full blast. It's a little loud. Who cares! It rocks as far as power. Oh by the way the complains are not Necessarily on Amazon. I looked all over. With me this is the best fan I have ever owned and I do have one industrial one. This one has it beat. Plus the remote. Very sweet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged","review":"Received two of these from Amazon, both with the same condition. Both of them arrived only slightly banged up, but there was absolutely no packaging to protect the fan from getting damaged. Front plastic piece was rubbing on the fan blades, only allowing them to move on the high settings. Looks like another user had the same exact issue less than a month ago; and amazon stated they would remove the item until they could figure out the issue and never did. I'm sure it would work great if it wasn't damaged, but getting two in a row that had the same problem, I wouldn't feel to confident..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I ordered a dashmat for my father for Christmas for a '92 Chevy Blazer.

The tracks are well chosen and the arrangements are simply supremely crafted. Each song takes us to a different moment in Los Tres musical history and treats us with the musical prowess of Alvaro, Titae and Angel (and their guest). If you find it, buy it. You won}t regret it. Special attention to Primera Vez, a song talks about that Army General who made a whole country suffer under his boot for many years and now tries to avoid justice claiming insanity (yeah, shameful) there you'll find Los Tres' powerful jazz roots -very a la Django Reindhart-. This CD is a must!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ABURRIDO!!! - BORING!!!!","review":"The people that are willing to pay $50- for this CD would be wise to spend it on professional help instead. I had this CD once. I listened to it a couple of times, ut nothing in it made me think I'd ever want to hear it again. Los Tres is a truly boring band. It's even more boring on this CD as they attempt to tackle boleros, rockabilly, and cuecas to boot on the last 3 or 4 tracks. There are 2 guests on this CD, unknown to all but a small part of the Chilean population. And NO. Chile is NOT in Mexico, you ignorant gringo!...UPDATE - This CD is thankfully out of print, hopefully forever. But if you still want it, it is available through bit torrent downloads, for free. Not apenny should reach these roto chilenos for this piece of garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It","review":"My 5 year old can't get enough of this toy. He's going thru page by page of the puzzle book that comes with the set and makes each one. It sits out on the coffee table ready for him to play with when the mood strikes him so I haven't had an issue with durability. It seems sturdy enough.My 8 year old is not very patient with most things so she doesn't like this because she's having trouble figuring it out visually.

I should have looked closer at the page and read the reviews. Then, I might have noticed that this is a comic book. Forget the label \\"graphic novel\\". They only use that label to get the price up over $13. The plot is bare and predictable. The art is adequate comic book art. The story is poorly constructed and the characters lack the depth needed to keep my interest. If this was written to entice teenagers to develop an interest in the genre, then it might have some value; it had none for me. I was starting to really enjoy Martin's work, but between this and his wimpish political mutterings, I've just about given up on him.

I loved the instrument but hated its high maintenance needs. I gave it away. Several careers later I fell in love with and bought a new to the market digital harpsichord by Roland. The principle difference between then and now is the existence of this marvelous little book by Schott. It is particularly useful if you essay, as I have, to teach yourself to play the harpsichord. If you own an acoustic instrument it can serve as a valuable desk reference. If you own or plan to buy a digital then this book is a \\"must have\\" because it will show you how to begin filling the gaps in your knowledge.

A much better and more thoughtful read can be found elsewhere (I would suggest Richard Dawkins or Carl Sagan of course, but Gary Marcus's new book The Birth of the Mind is also spectacular not only in its new ideas, but in its summary of current biological science---something the \\"Search for God\\" sorely needs)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is no skeptic.","review":"As I try to make my own search for the existence of God, Mr. Muncaster's title seemed like a worthwhile exploration.

And he glosses over many Biblical mysteries which require exploration. Not the least of which is, \\"How do we even know Adam and Eve existed, much less that Adam named more than 1 million animals in a day, if nobody was there to witness it?\\" A far better book is \\"Finding Darwin's God,\\" which attempts to bridge the gap between creationists and evolutionists."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing fabrication","review":"The author must have gone to great length to ignore current evolutionary theory and come up this book.

I must admit I only read the first half of the book; however, by then I was just disgusted with his blatant dishonesty and gave it up.

Mostly because of it's size and convenience. It is so easy to just grap this thing to vac up those messes that previously would have \\"waited till later\\". The power of this thing isn't the same as a full size shopvac, but I never expected it to be. The only improvement I'd make to this item, and the reason I'm only giving it 4 stars instead of 5, is that it should have a built in charger for the battery. Seems like that would be simple enough to add."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good vac","review":"The dewalt vac is top notch compared to its competition, but still is not quite perfect. The suction is adequate for small jobs, dust, sand, screws, pet hair, but it won't replace a shop vac. The definite + for this vac, though, is the fact that you can utilize any of your dewalt batteries in it. I only have the 18v, but still a great option. I personally bought the vac to clean out my fireplace, and its works perfectly. Kudos to DeWalt!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"This vacuum is an absolute time saver. I can move the vac around without dragging out the LONG extension cord and the 18volt power supply does a nice job in powering this vac for 15 - 20minutes. I am giving this vac 5 stars even though DeWalt did not have the sense to build in a battery charger so the battery can stay charged while using the vac plug into an AC outlet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good first try","review":"I like this vacuum. It does what it says it does, and does it well. But. Like all my experience with Dewalt products, they are innovative and well built, but only 90% there as cutting a few corners makes it not as good as it could easily have been. The hose is great - flexible, extendable and light. But the two nozzles don't fit on it very well, and with a bit of pressure applied sideways (easy to do when cleaning up dust) they fall off. Annoying. Just poor quality control I guess. The motor is fine on battery (I use 14.4V) but on mains (when its sucks a bit harder) it screams - ear hurtingly loud when the nozzle sucks something across the tube and no air can get in. And why no built-in charger or extension tube? So four stars because it works well, its innovative - a good idea (well done Dewalt) and there's nothing else like it. But when there is, Dewalt better make some improvements or they'll lose the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gutless","review":"Do yourself a favor pass on this one.

Love it. Easy to carry, to the job has plenty of suction both pluged in or on battery. It's not a replacement for your big vac, but for small quick clean ups it suits the job. Cutting plaster walls and sheetrock can be messy. This little vac. is up to the job of keeping dirt and dust down. Don't expect hours of run time on batteries, but if you have several charged up you can clean for a while. Great for the car, and getting water out of a clogged sink (this is when the battery came in handy, no threat getting a 115v zap.)The Dewalt DC500 is a great addition to your portable tools. I goes where you go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great if you already use 18V Dewalt Tools","review":"Seeing as I just purchased my 2nd DC500 so I wouldn't forget to have one at my shop and at my house, I think I can whole-heartily recommend this to anyone who aleady has 18V dewalt stuff. As a bit of a dewalt junkie I already have 4 chargers and like 7 or 8 batteries, so the lack o' charger / battery thing didn't apply to me. Even so, I was bright enough to realize they weren't going to throw in a 40 dollar charger and a 60-90 dollar battery in on a 99 dollar machine. Those who would expect such haven't purchaed dewalts before. They are not cheap, but you can beat the crap out of them. The other argument of \\"lack of extension/nozzle/etc.\\" is simply idiotic. Why would dewalt manufacture/market/sell something that you can walk over two isles at home depot and purchase from this litle company shop-vac?? Just use your friggin brains, and purchase the 4 dollar extension from them."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love cordless!","review":"I have a 14.4 volt set of dewalts and saw this vacuum. I think the number 1 reason I purchased it was because it can run on corded or cordless. The best of both worlds.I have run it on 14.4 battery and it has great suction. It is a very compct unit and yet it holds 2 gallons. All the latches are heavy duty and should last a long time. This unit is built to job-site specifications instead of household.The hose and attachments included are very heavy duty and should last a long time.The second thing I like about it is the filter. All shop vacuums I have seen require the constant changing and purchase of relaceable filters. The dewalt used a filter that can be cleaned and reused many times.At Home Depot paper filters are 3 for 10 dollars. How much in a year?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"If you own 12V-18V DeWalt tools, this vacuum is great. I do a lot of woodworking and the thing is essential. Keeping my tools free of sawdust and wood chips has been made extremely easy. Keeping my table saw's miter gauge slot and rip fence free of the dust and chips has made my work much more efficient and accurate. Definately worth the $$$$.One caution... As I said if you already own 12V-18V DeWalt tools the vacuum is great. If you don't, I'm not sure that I'd buy the vacuum because it does not come with it's own batteries or a charger."},{"rating":"2","title":"DEWALT DC500","review":"This is a great vaccuum!

I already owned several cordless Dewalt tools, so I had the 18 volt batteries and chargers.I use it both in the shop and around the house for the immediate pick-up jobs, especially when I don't feel like dragging out the shop vac and cord.

BUT this vacuum couldn't pick up anything but drywall dust, and very little of that. When I got it out of the box I was very pleased with the quality of the appearance and the accessories, but then I tried to use it. What a disappointment. The attachments won't stay on the hose, and the vacuum power is so low my 20 year old Black & Decker with a clogged filter has 5 times the sucking power. The DW execs should be embarrassed to offer this next to their other tools. My advice: Don't waste your money. It's not even worth the cost of shipping to try it and return it to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dewalt Vac","review":"Just a short note I purchased one used for cleaning cars floormats for the family after the cars were washed. I have numerous Dewalt Products 18 volts over 20 different tools so I am very famaliar with correct use. Vac has average suction not real great. My only major complaint as I bought item NEW not a rebuild vac was that the vac lasted for a little over 18 months then quit functioning. Vac was never used for anything more than vaccumming small particles of dirt, lint and sand from vehicle floormats as I have two large shop vacs for other applications. The life of this tool is completely different and was extremely short compared to many other Dewalt tools I have. I replaced the first vac and purchased another New Dewalt vac and the same thing happened again only this vac lasted for a little less than one year. Took to Dewalt repair shop and the repair estimate was close to the cost of a replacement New vac."},{"rating":"1","title":"You call this a vacuum??

They aren't exactly doing us a favor, since I'm sure DeWalt's profit margin on batteries is high and this is a good way, in the long run, to sell more of them. I purchased one DC500 and it burned out after about two years of use, which is why I awarded four stars for what would otherwise be a solid 5. I immediately purchased another vacuum since it is used daily. We have twin 2 year old girls at home, and this vacuum is used not only for cleaning home projects and the car, but for cleaning up the high-chairs quickly and easily. The tool is available with a battery and charger, but the price then is high. If you have any DeWalt cordless tools and several batteries laying around, at $99.00 this tool is a bargain that will save a lot of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underpowered","review":"We purchased this to vacuum ash from around our wood stove. We did not expect it to pick up much else because of its size. If any of the attachements are used, the suction is diffused to the point of non-existance. Even without any attachments, the suction leaves a lot to be desired. The DeWalt leaves what the Hoover picks up without effort. We have used this only when plugged in. We did not yet test with the battery even though we are a DeWalt house so have a lot of 18v charged and available.We are going to invoke the 30 day satisfaction guaranty and return the vacuum. Its dissapointing since we are so happy with our other DeWalt tools."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent cordless vac!","review":"After 6 months of ownership I can say this is a great little vacuum! I think it now gets more use than my large ShopVac Pro Series. Being cordless makes it so easy to grab and go anywhere without worrying about plugging it in. Despite other reviews that say its underpowered, I've found that it has plenty of power for its size. I've used it for usual debris cleanup tasks in the garage, and for cleaning up after drilling and sawing jobs around the house. I also use it in our RV on camping trips.I have really tested its \\"wet\\" vac capabilities too. After draining our spa, I used this vac to get some water puddles out. Also when I had a sprinkler line fail, I used it vac out the water and dirt in the hole so I could quickly get to the broken line. It's a great tool and I highly recommend it.Only improvement would be if it could actually charge an inserted battery when it's plugged into AC power, otherwise I have no complaints about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry vac good, wet vac terrible!","review":"I have had mine for about 4 years. I'm only giving it 2 stars because it does not work like described. It is suppose to be a wet/dry vac. The problem is pretty simple. As soon as the filter gets wet, there is no more suction!

If you web search this problem, you will find many results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad this vac doesn't suck...","review":"The suction is miserable on this vacuum.

Adequate power for small jobs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"I expected a little more power out of this product, but it has enough to get the job done.

Even using the 18v so called long lasting $90 battery, it quits only after about 1,500 sq. ft of dusty floor space, about 15 minutes of use. Dewalt customer service said that it would pickup multiple bags of cement but it will NOT in my experience hardly do much dust off the floor. I spent $240 on the vacuum, charger, and best battery and feel this is too much for the results I got. The unit is light until the battery is put in then it is really heavy (I'm a 250lb man and think so). The body is wide bulky but should be narrow in format and longer since it bumps everything and bumps you in the side which is part of why it seems heavy."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Battery included and does Not charge batteries","review":"There are no batteries included and when you plug it in it doesn't charge the a battery you need to buy to run it.If you don't mind buying a charger and battery and removing the battery from the vacume to charge it every 10 min of use then its OK and you have alot of extra money and free time."},{"rating":"1","title":"CORDLESS VAC??????","review":"I'M DISAPPOINTED IN MY VAC, IT SAYS CORDLESS, BUT DID NOT COME WITH BATTERY BACK-UP, DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD TO ORDER THAT EXTRA.CORDLESS TOOLS SHOULD ALWAY COME WITH A BATTERY, THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT CORDLESS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great unit","review":"This mini shop vac works perfectly for vacuuming out the car and getting into places a full-sized unit won't fit.

Far too expensive for its performance. I had searched for a cordless shop-type vacuum, and bought this one. My mistake. Few other options are out there. My recommendation, if you are looking for strong vaccum, keep looking beyond this Dewalt.

Often, as I moved about during the installation the chips would get scattered off the sheet. Now I don't even bother with a bed sheet !

The author seems to be avoiding this kind of exposition in favor of fractions and many, many adjectives, which didn't work for me. At the same time, some concepts pop up in the book unexplained (a fourth is mentioned in passing for the first time on page 143, after we've been dragged through the ratios of octaves, fifths and thirds several times).

It's a marvel that the musical scale, which we now take for granted, came to represent the heart of conflict between science and religion in Europe. By reading Temperment, I saw Pythagorus, Galileo, and Newton struggle over the mathematics of creating the 12 tone musical scale; I saw composers martyred at the hands of tyrannical churches and governments; I saw churches and governments fail in their effort to quell the music within inspired souls; and in their understanding of music, I saw unknown lovers of music triumph where towers of intellect - i.e. Descartes - fell.In Temperment, history, music, science, art, and religion collide, resulting in the birth of the piano.

This is not it.Less than a quarter of the book is spent on tuning and temperament topics, and some of that is repeated. This text is not at a deep enough technical level to do justice to the topic however occasionally unexplained technical terms pop up. The rest of the book contains concurrent historical events that may be interesting but don't support or give a strong context to the main topic.

This is the worst sort of non-academic history, an author who's unable to keep the story on track and is more interested in proving that he's interesting than in providing anything of value to the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Like several others, I bought this book after reading a laudatory review in the Economist. I was very, very disappointed with the book. As a relatively new piano player, I had hoped to learn two things from the book -- (1) how pianos are tuned and why; and (2) some historical background on the development of the piano. The book delivers on neither. As several commentators have pointed out, the science of piano tuning is completely - and maddeningly -- ignored. To be sure, the author throws some fractions around in the book, but it is just about impossible for anyone but a professional piano tuner to make sense of the details. Finally, as a general introduction to the history of the piano, the work is a bust. Certainly, there are some interesting tidbits, but the organization is so poor, the argument so meandering, that it is hard to keep one's attention focused. I have to wonder: Are those laudatory reviews all from the author's friends?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over Blown and Out of Tune","review":"Too many sweeping claims unsubstantiated. Too much gushing and waxing poetical. A dissappointing romantic and culturally biased performance. If, however, you believe that all other music is inferior to Western musical culture because we have the tempered scale, and that Western music is the pinnacle of human accomplishment (and, yes, Martha, we can lump Wagner and Destiny's Child together for this one), you will find this book very comforting."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellant book!","review":"I had to have this book! My great-grandmother was born in Johnstown and was about 9 years old when the great flood of 1889 happened. Her family was one of the lucky few to survive. All they had left was one spoon. Mr. McCullough tells the story and all its tragedies extremely well. It is amazing to read that the owners of the fishing retreat were never held responsible for the dams failure or held financially accountable for the loss of life in Johnstown and the smaller towns wiped out in such a horrendous tragedy....the times of social injustice are well told. A great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A compelling story from the great storyteller!","review":"This story kept me glued to my seat and I could not put it down until the last page.

David McCullough. 1967. 304 Pages.This was a good book. I read it as a prelude to David McCullough's lecture on 21SEP2006 in Scranton. The book is 70% social history (it was written in 1967!). It is well written and the photos are interesting. About 15% is prelude to disaster, setting the scene. About 20% is post disaster, recovery. Some of that is quite interesting. Apparently the immigrant group moving in and taking cheap labor jobs were the Hungarians (Hunkies). Well, during the recovery there were reports in the press (vilifications really) of roving bands of looting, dead desecrating, raping, killing etc all done by these Hungarians. Except they were not called Hungarians, they were labeled the Huns. Though the drawings of them were stereotypical Hungarians with their big mustaches etc. The bulk then is on the disaster ... the big raging wall of water which passed through Johnstown in 10 minutes flat."},{"rating":"2","title":"gift","review":"This book was very much enjoyed by the recipient.

American innovation and rapid industrialization had generated an increasingly complex economy with its benefits and woes. Much of this story is about realization of the new phenomena of society's mega-rich and their interactions with the rest of society. This story is a graphic description of how weather, extreme wealth, industry, rapid social and human nature can be combined to yield all sorts of effects. It is by no means a must read but a remarkably bright piece of social history that exercises the imagination and diffuses many of history's more detailed lessons."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected more from David McCullough","review":"I was disappointed in this book. i've read other works of David McCullough and expected much more.

It could be the subject matter, more so than the writing, but it was boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling and Informative","review":"The Johnstown Flood was a compelling read. Prior to my reading this book, I knew very little about the flood that devastated this town in western PA over 100 years ago. Mr. McCullough provides the background to the factors that resulted in this devastating flood that killed over 2,000 individuals. The reader gets to know some of the people who lived in Johnstown and died on that fateful day. This intimacy is heart tugging at times particulaly when describing young children and their parents who were swept away or crushed to death from the debris that engulfed them. Mr. McCullough describes how railroad cars were bounced around which illustrates the magnitude and ferocity of this flood. I had been familar with Mr. McCullough's prowess as a writer having previously read John Adams and 1776, both of which were informative and interesting. The same can be said of The Johnstown Flood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting story","review":"Fascinating history. David McCullough tells the story in documentary style. Just the facts with little opinion or interpretation. I would have liked more info on the members of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, but spending most of the book in Johnstown is appropriate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Another exceptional book by this outstanding author. A real look at who was responsible for this historic tragedy. Loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"As floods go...","review":"My husband is the history buff in our family & I bought this book as a Christmas stocking stuffer. I began reading it because, well, just because. I'm glad I did. David McCullough's writing put you on a floating roof and carried you down the Little Conemaugh. His development of many of the minor characters was astounding, considering the fact there was not much anecdotal history to go on. Extremely informative, the evidence and roles played around the re-building of the South Fork dam & the rapid growth of Johnstown was eye-opening. An exciting ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"McMullough is a Master","review":"I admit to a total bias where McCullough's work is concerned. This account made be feel it, hear it, smell it.

One of McCullough's first books is The Johnstown Flood (1968). This short (for McCullough) history of 286 pages tells how, during terrific storms, an earthen dam above Johnstown, Pennsylvania burst, causing the death of more than 2,000. McCullough is superb both at analyzing why the dam collapse was preventable and in describing the course of the flood itself, including its wake of tragic deaths and amazing stories. This is not a happy read, because the tragedy was both so huge and so preventable (A sorry epilogue of the flood is that none of the several lawsuits was successful). It is, however, so spellbinding and well-told that it begs to be read in one sitting."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"This book places you in the middle of the flood.

A wonderful account of a tragic day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reliving a Flood","review":"DaidMcCullough is a wonderfull writer. His research adds many new vistas to any topic he chooses. I read the book because I wanted to check out some family stories about how my maternal grandfather went to Milwaukee,Wis. after he had lost his home in the Jehnstown flood.

Love and War is the second book of the series regarding the friendship between the Main family and the Hazard family. It tells the trials of having friends on opposite sides of the war. It details the tribulations of having married someone for the \\"wrong side of the war\\", and how love and friendship helps them to perservere through one of the toughest periods in American history. Insight given into the hardships and dangers that the freed men had to endure and how unprepared they were for freedom because of their slavery.

When I used it a week ago. I got it tracked but when I started using it the tracking changed and I ruined two belts. Since then I am careful to continue adjusting the tracking while it is under load (while sanding with it) to reach a point where it tracks. The problem is that you are always watching the belt edge to make sure it's OK. I am not satisfied with this situation and I don't understand why tracking is such a problem with this sander.

This sander is not fit to carry the Dewalt brand. The first time I used it, it kept heating up due to dust collection (i.e., the dust collector doesn't work well so dust builds up in the unit creating friction). I had to continually stop and blow out the unit with my compressor.

Period.This film seemed to have the intention and goal of making you feel sympathetic, but instead it was simply an annoying reminder of how soft and stupid we have become in this Western Society when it comes to creating Firm and Fair laws, and then enforcing them without fail.Now everything is an exception to the rule and slop prevails.An infuriating film that gets the blood boiling !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total waste of time with no plot whatsoever!","review":"This movie has no plot whatsoever. Harrison Ford's performance is bland like the entire movie. I think the idea behind this movie was to show the \\"injustices\\" in our immigration system. Example; \\"an adolescent Arab-American girl gives a cheeky speech at school that puts her family under suspicion as possible terrorists\\". The \\"cheeky\\" speech is actually a justification for the murder of thousands of innocent people on 9/11. The whole movie rants on like this and we fast forwarded through most of it. If you were expecting a detective/mystery/action movie, this is not it. My recommendation, don't waste your money. The movie's description on the jacket and on Amazon is way off what the movie is really about."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to this movie?","review":"What could have been a good movie, falls apart with the bizarre plot that tried to have too much in it. While that might works for such films as Shortcuts, Crash, or Traffic, it doesn't work here. The movie was also very choppy, I suspect there were some crazy choices made during editing. Perhaps the film in its original form would have been pretty good. Anyway, it just didn't work. Also, the soundtrack and background music is HORRIBLE and very distracting in several parts.

Diffuser should have a place in today's musical landscape because they are somewhat of a rarity amongst the current tops of rock (Korn, Limp Biz & Green Day etc.). You see, Diffuser simply provides straight-ahead, good ol' hard rock (70's style-Van Halen I, Deep Purple, Foghat and 70's Aerosmith). No Rap-Metal here, just very melodic vocals (King's Xish), creative guitar hooks (Robin Trower meets Jerry Cantrell), and strong song writing abilities. The song Karma is a great tune that should get plenty of airplay, but one of the main strengths of 'Injury' is that all 11 songs are very good. In today's music business that is a rarity (A complete album of songs). If you like Good hard rock, buy this CD, it's well worth the ear injury for the melodies that you'll soon grow to love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been great... but is not","review":"This CD only gets one star due to the quality of recording and has nothing to do with Bonnie Tyler or the song selections. I have all these songs on albums but some songs had minor occasional background noises that are very hard to remove after recording to hard drive. Thought I would replace them with ones from this CD but the sound quality is so poor that I prefer to listen to the album version even with the flaws. I am not an audio expert so I can't say what is wrong with this CD but it seems like it was tweaked to soften her voice some then recorded at too high a volume so the songs missing something.

If I watch the belt (not the project, which as lead to me over sanding and grooving the surface on occasion) and stop early I can prevent it from eating the belt. I have to stop every couple of minutes to readjust the belt. Some people do not have this problem...so maybe it is either user or specific machine issues. This is of great frustration to me. I am now looking for another model/brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Belt Eater","review":"Bought one on Sunday. Within 15 minutes of use it had eaten 4 belts. One jammed, took 30 minutes to clear.

I thought the DeWalt, being big and built like a tank would be more than up to the task.The tracking only works in one direction-- it pushes the belt out.. but over time-- waste that collects on the drum pushes the belt out-- and there's no way to correct. I always wind up shuffling the belt back on the drum.Trying to clean it-- the drum lock bolt broke off on first twist with a screwdriver.The dust collector-- it worked great at first with a festool collector attached. Then-- it must have gotten plugged up inside and I can't clear the tube. The drum can't come off because the bolt broke.Another dust annoyance-- the housing that connects to the vacuum pops off at the slightest jolt. A big powerful tool like this needs better attachments.There's a ton of power here- and with the right engineering-- this would be a winner. But I can't recommend with the flaws. Choose another."},{"rating":"1","title":"ultimately...a real disappointment","review":"First off, I am not a professional woodworker...one or two little projects a year. The sander has less than 1 hour of total run time in the several years of ownership.

I sold the 12.5 inch planer because it was extremely LOUD, sweekie, and a few screws came of during operation so OK fine. The belt sander smoked up and died while I was removing laminate from an old dresser. I was able to finish two drawer faces and half of the top and then it smoked and lost much of its power. I had it plugged directly in power outlet on 20 AMP breaker so using to thin of a power cord as the cause was out of the question. I will see what I can do about getting it fixed and then sell it as well. PLEASE take my adviceand avoid buying dewalt tools.

I like most of the Dewalt line of tools, but if they made the rest of their tools like this one, they would go out of business quick! The tracking was eratic,vacuum dust control doesn't work at all-(unless you hook a shop vac).And for the real clincher---the back drive wheel shaft started wobbling and vibrating after about three hours of total run time.I checked for a loose bearing or bolt but the wheel wouldn't move by hand, no play at all, which shows that the run-out was caused by the axle shaft bending-most probably due to poor metal quality.

The third and final one tracked so so, but it ended up not spinning (belt would not move) when you pressed the trigger.

This is a heavy sander and requires a bit of work to use (seems like I'm fighting with it). The top front wheel sets up frequent vibrations which cause the sander to do tiny hops which leaves marks in the work. The dust collection seems to work, but the cooling vents seem to blow dust all over the place (not good for working in the house). This sander seems to go through sanding belts with little to show for it (don't know why).I switched to a Bosch 3x21 inline sander and it is a world of difference. No great effort to use (less fatigue) no cooling ports to blow the dust around, seems is use less belts for the same job, a whole lot lighter and does a better sanding job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 2 seconds of use.","review":"I got this sander for my birthday and about 5 days later I used it for the first time.The project was removing some paint from a potato bin and smooth the surface.But when I put the sander on the bin the belt stopped moving. I didn't even apply pressure yet.The nut that holds the rear spindle on sheared off.Now I am a Makita guy and I was trying another brand for once.But I cannot only blame DeWalt, I am partially to blame too, I should have done more research on this sander.Back it goes and I will never buy any DeWalt tools again. I'll stick to Makita."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"I read reviews before purchasing and thought that the problems would be fixed by now. I used the sander to sand a medium-sized deck. Like previous reviewers said, it eats belts and blows dust everywhere. To empty the dust bag you need to unhook it from the sander, then pry open the dust bag clip. I accepted this process, but just could not deal with the dust blowing everywhere and the number of belts it eats. I heard that the belt problem was due to the newer roller design, which does not work. I returned the unit after about 3 hours of use and purchased a Makita."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than one hour total use","review":"I recieved one of these for Fathers Day two years ago. I didn't have a project to use it on until after the warranty expired, but being new I hadn't even thought about it not working. For some reason it would run great, then for no reason, quit. It didn't seem hot, but I tried it again a while later and it ran for a few minutes then quit again and never did work after that. Belts seemed to be a problem to, but never had a chance to really adjust them much before it quit. It sounds like other people have had the same problem with them quiting. If anybody knows what the cause is, please email me at crowpeak@hotmail to tell me what to try and fix. In the directions it shows how to change brushes, so I might try that and see if there are any loose wires or something. This sander never did get much of a workout. Worked great till it died! I will never buy another Dewalt tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good ergonomics, but the good ends there","review":"I bought this sander based on a Fine Woodworking review. Ususally they get it right, but not this time. I bought the sanding frame kit. The frame itself works well, but the stand can not be used with the dust collector and the frame doesn't fit in the stand well. The case that comes with the kit holds all of the pieces and is enormous and of little use to me because of its size.The sander is good ergonomically, I used it comfortably for about 6 hours straight while sanding a hardwood floor. However, the dust collection was poor to begin with and stopped working entirely after less than an hour. Apparently the plastic dust impeller broke, based on my visual inspection. I also knocked the dust bag off several times, as described by others. The design is just not up to snuff in my opinion.The other positive is that DeWalt will take it back for the first 90 days, so I'm sending mine back."},{"rating":"1","title":"got a lemon","review":"I was so excited about this sander. Unfortunately after using it for less than one day it was eating belts, the tracking adjustment did not work. It spewed dust despite frequently emptying the bag and was a huge disappointment. When I called Dewalt they had me take it to the local Dewalt store for return and said a new sander would be shipped to me. The service person said they would only repair it, not return it.

If you like time-travel romances into 16th century Scottish Highlands, you will enjoy Kiss of the Highlander. The author develops her characters and their relationships well. She also cleverly injects humor along the way. I, personally, appreciated not having to wade through endless historical data or long tedious descriptions. I understand that her 5th novel will continue with one of the characters in Kiss. If you haven't given any of Karen's novels a try, please do so, and I wager that you will want to read some of her previous work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amusing but terribly written","review":"I like lighter TT romances, really. I love Lynn Kurland. But this book has some problems, most of which have been mentioned by others here. It's full of anacronisms, which can be spotted almost every other page. The hero thinks in terms which are centuries from being invented. The heroine is very unreal, screwed up because her family are scientists (who are of course all unfeeling, all unemotional - where are these messed up freaks of nature - I'm a scientist and I've yet to meet any). She is also incredibly crude. Men and sex are described in the most vulgar terms (but of course the hero is a 90's kind of 16th c guy so he doesn't return the favor).And yet parts are funny in a screwball kind of way. This book reminds me of Dara Joy's High Energy in its humor, so people who liked that may like this. But fans of history and coherence beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't \\"Outlander!\\"","review":"I wanted to love this book.

I think that it is rather unfair to compare Miss Moning's works with that of Diana Gabaldon's. Miss Gabaldon's novels are for those who really love history and enjoy reading long and heavy stories--over 1000 pages each book and in smaller printing. Although the heroine in this book was not so lovable in the beginning and some of Moning's vocabularies are quite vulgar but on the whole, this time-travel story was rather absorbing and well-written. I bought this book based on the reviews I read on this website and I was very grateful for all those reviewers, especially those who gave low ratings to this book because then I know what kind of writing I will be getting myself into and I should not blame those high-rating ones if the book is not to my liking after all.

There was plenty of banter between the characters, which is always my favourite part. I enjoyed the whole book, but especially the ending. It was a happy ending, as it ought to be, but it followed the rules established through the book and involved some sacrifice - it was not simply everything works out for everyone. Gwen and physics was overplayed, but it was forgivable.If you are looking for an enjoyable romantic read, that will have you laughing out loud, definitely choose this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Her Best Yet","review":"Definetly the best one yet for Karen Marie Moning! It's a well written fantasy that will have you wishing for your own Highlander to kiss! Looking forward to her next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST TIME TRAVEL OUT THERE!!!!!","review":"I have been reading time travel for years and this one tops them all!I actually cried and my stomach got butterflies while reading the book. For a seasoned romace reader that is hard to do after reading thoudands of books! YOU MUST read this book. It is funny and sexy and DAMN, I want a Scottish Warrior bad!!I love the fact that the book is well written and all the details are tied at the end. You know how you read a book sometimes and its great but you have loose ends you wonder about? Not this one.The characters are soooo funny and loveable and what I really love is the time travel is soooo believeable, not hoaky like some.All in all I love all of Moning's book but this one is by far her best! Do yourself a favor and read this book!!!BUT be forewarned, there is another book coming out next year that comes after this one..and you will scream once you read what its about and know you have to wait till next SPRING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip-off of Outlander by Gabaldon","review":"The concept is the same but the characterization is flawed and the world is flat. And the ending is honestly ridiculous- \\"And then magic made everyone live happily ever after\\". Seriously. Read Outlander by Dianna Gabaldon instead. SO much better than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Erotic almost too erotic but a story that will leave you wanting it to never end. I can't wait to read their dark highlands with Dageous in it. A wonderful book to live through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"For casual reading, this book is excellent. And, as always, Amazon's service was first rate."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't wait for Karen's next one!!!","review":"For me, loving the time travel,and the knights in shining armour,and suprise...this book had it all, I laughed and cried, I smiled and groaned, and I truely loved every page!! Hurry up Karen!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"Just discovered Ms. Moning. Bought all 4 books in one shot. Great reading. All 4 were great, can't wait for more. Looking forward to it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a MUST read for ANY Romance Reader","review":"I like to think of myself as a romance reader who's been around the block a time or two. There aren't many stories that I've not read that haven't been a rehashing of something else. But this BOOK! WOW! I was captivated by the first page. You'll love the characters and actually fall in love WITH them! I stayed up way too late reading it, I couldn't put it down. The romance, the wit, the humor and oh yes..the love scenes. Oh MY! And the ending is one you won't see coming. You'll be tempted to flip to the back of the book to see how it all comes out. BUT DON'T!I've read all of Moning's works and I've loved them all but this one takes the cake. She's hinted to a sequel and now I just have to wait a year to read that one.A definate must read! You're going on a roller coaster ride of emotions and it's worth every single word!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smitten Kitten - Drustan MacKeltar I want you!","review":"Could NOT put this book down! Read Importal Highlander first, then Kiss of a Highlander, and OMG, LOVED KOTH even more!!! I sat there in the dark and LMAO... OUT LOUD! I cried my eyes out, loud, open weeping with full knot in my throat and huge tears, on two separate occassions in the book. My kids think I've lost it (but this book helped me find it). I am completely smitten with DRUSTAN MACKELTAR! The characters are so well written and fleshed out in this book. The banter and chaos between Gwen and Drustan was humorous, hearfelt, and touching. Wonderful read, great story, I'm order Dark Highlander right now to continue the story and would recommend the series to everyone! Oh, and the steamy sex is great too!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You need to read this book!","review":"Wow! I just finished reading \\"Kiss of the Highlander\\" and it is without a doubt one of the best romance books I have read. This is the first book by Karen Marie Moning that I have read, and I am so thankful that I have 2 more of her books on my nightstand to read. Don't try to read this book if you can't devote the day to finishing it. I found it was impossible to put it down. If you like romance books, you have got to read this one. The love described between Drustan and Gwen made me keep hugging my husband and telling him how much I love him. It's a keeper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored and Disgusted","review":"I Couldn't get past the first three chapters. Sorry people I was just so bored and turned off by the overt sexual references I put it down and deleted. There is so much better material out there that I didn't want to waste my time with this one. I'm writing because if I had seen a review like this I wouldn't have thrown away $7.00."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book","review":"Please, do not buy her books. Learn from my mistake. They are poorly written, have an underdeveloped plot and underdeveloped characters....infact, in the 2 books that I read of hers, the characters were pretty much the same in both books. I couldn't tell any difference between the people in the first book and the second.....other than their names and jobs. All were 2 dimensional and sorely lacking any personality. So please, do not buy her books. Send Karen Marie Moning a message that she needs to learn how to write first.If you want a fantastic series about Highlanders, read Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series. Now that's good writing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So Terrible I Could Not Finish It","review":"This book is so terrible, I vow to never read another of the author's books. No character development; the worst forced humor I have ever read; shallow, crude, vulgar. I am not a prude and read many romance novels but this is simply the worst. How funny is it for the heroine to be thinking he stuffed a sock in the crotch of his jeans?? That does not even merit junior high school humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pornography in book form","review":"This was a horrible book - no story, just mentioning the male's genitalia constantly. I put it in the trash and will never buy another book by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete rip-off","review":"This is a complete rip-off of Diana Gabaldon's Highlander series and does not deserve recognition let alone a review!"},{"rating":"2","title":"~Please Read~","review":"I absolutely LOVE all of Karen Marie Moning's Highlander books, especially this one! A++ But can anyone tell me which picture shows up on the kindle? The old cover it shows or the new cover with the sexy highlander? It would be weird if it showed the old cover for this book and the new covers for all the rest.Thank you!! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Engaging Read","review":"Karen Marie Moning wrote a great book that is magical, humorous, sensual, and romantic to boot.\\"Kiss of the Highlander.\\" Generally I am not a fan of either Time Travel books or of books about the Highlands but I couldn't find anything else that looked interesting and thought \`what the hey, I'll take a chance', and I wasn't disappointed.Gwen Cassidy and Drustan MacKeltar are both engaging and vulnerable without being whiney or arrogant. And Ms. Moning found a great way to inject tension into the plot, the whole time travel -- do we believe each other thing -- without having to make either of her main characters behave as jerks. When one or the other is suspicious of the other character it is for good reason rather than some terminal character flaw like extreme jealousy, insecurity or just plain stupidity.It was a great book that I devoured in one sitting and I look forward to reading all of her \\"Highland\\" books in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleeping Beauty in a Kilt","review":"The writer gives us a different twist on the Sleeping Beauty story, with the virginal though nicotine impaired heroine from our times actually falling through a rabbit hole into a real Adventure in Wonderland. Events conspire to span centuries of time for the gigantic and wickedly handsome god in a kilt to meet the beautifully petite, smart, lonely and misunderstood Gwen. Misunderstandings abound as the duo determine how to fix the future and the past, and the chemistry actually jumps off the pages as the pressure builds. Lusty (to say the very LEAST) but also cleverly written, excellent characterization and a wonderful sense of setting all come together for an excellent escape from reality.My only disappointment? The rather ginghamy looking \\"plaid\\" on the cover - obviously the cover art was not as well researched as the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick-paced but funny...","review":"This was the first book I've read by this author - I really enjoyed it. The main character, Gwen, is a strong female full of sass - she has no problem dealing with Druids, time travel, and a very sexy Scot. The issue of time travel was very well done - with a nice twist thrown in here and there (i.e. not the usual reincarnation plot). If you're looking for a quick read with some steamy sex and laughter, you'll enjoy this book. Be sure to check out the story about Durstan's brother - The Dark Highlander. I'm half-way through it now and it is just as good as the first story."},{"rating":"1","title":"There Must Be More Than Blond Virgins","review":"This is book 4 in a line of 7 books that are loosely connected. KMM's books are typically light reads. You can polish one off in a few hours. Sexy, funny, adventurous... Good enough to keep you reading, but not anything that will haunt your thoughts. However, every single book, thus far, is so similar I'm not sure if I can stand it. Part of the draw is the romance, Scottish laird, etc. but goodness, there has to be more to it. Every single man is dark haired, over 6 and a half feet tall, a Scottish laird and warrior and has some major issues. Every woman in petite, blond, blue eyed and a virgin. Every book ends with babies. Every single book (maybe 5-7 are different). A small bit of variety would be great. Overall, the first few are good, but it starts getting really boring by book 4 because every character is the same as in the previous book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best I 've read in years","review":"I had just about stopped reading romances...the same story ,the same impossibly beautifulheros and heroines.YUCK...but Karen Marie Moning'swonderful book has me addicted again...I read this book in three hours, went straight tothe store and bought, To Tame A Highland Warriorand The Highlander's Touch...my house cleaning issuffering and I haven't paid my bills but,I getting dressed to go find Beyond the Highland Mistsright now... the love scene at the stones is absolutelythe best...Thank you Ms. Moning I had forgotten how toreally enjoy a book..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Outlander Fans","review":"Having recently returned from the world of Claire and Jamie in Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series, I was on a Scottish kick, so to speak. I picked up this book based on the recommendations here. Boy was I sorry! If this is an example of Moning's work, then I will certainly not read any other of her works. I found this book shallow and silly. Little detail is given to the physical setting, the characters were vapid and did not ring true what so ever. There is no real historic \\"feel.\\" Overall, the book is cheesy. For fans of Outlander, I recommend the Into the Wilderness series by Sara Donati. Although it is not a time travel, the characters are strong and true, and there is a high level of historical accuracy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Backwards Sleeping Beauty","review":"This book is excellent as I knew it would be. All of Karen Marie Moning's books are full of enchanting tales, erotic scenes, and the whispered promise of true love. Lose your self in love and time, that's what I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favorite","review":"A breath-taking novel... I loved it from beginning to end.The characters are so adorable and the plot is exciting and fast-paced. I love Gwen and Drustan so much. They're so sweet together. This book is sexy and fun from beginning to end... And wow... What an ending!... It was so beautiful it made me cry... Don't miss out on this one... It's a keeper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"85 million in WASTE !","review":"Simply a poor stereotype flick with a COMPLETE TOTAL WASTE of talent, music and MONEY.Fails in all respects EXCEPT amazing photography & score.But even Yo Yo Ma, Gong Li & Co. can't pull this Box Office flop out of it's failed lack of cultural research, depictions of Asian women as high class hookers & bad, phoney accents NOBODY on earth speaks. A regress of the 1930's dragon ladies. Anna May Wong is ROLLING in her grave ! A revelation to American movie crowd- They DIDN'T fall for the DRAGON LADY crap this time ! YAHOO!I'm just SHOCKED such fine actors of Asia didn't RUN off the set once subjected to such a screenplay. Shame on them for being in such dated, racist rolls.Hollywood, take notice & learn from another film about Japan that did GREAT, The Last Samurai.

I'll wait for the new book being publised by Arthur Clark and keep my fingers crossed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Magic Mountain","review":"This book won a Nobel prize and it's obvious that it's well-written. However, it's a very slow story with lots of descriptive details.

Like watching grass grow. Worse than reading Proust and that is pretty bad. I actually read through the entire novel which proves, I guess, that I have time to throw away. At least save yourself some $$$ and get it from the library, then you won't feel as if you threw your money away AND your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh puleeez!","review":"thomas mann was a GREAT writer, don't get me wrong. however, it is my feeling that Magic Mountain is one of the most overrated books in history. it is dull! it is boring! it inspires somnolence! and that is being polite. thomas mann wrote so many other truly wonderful books, i find it very sad when people pick up magic mountain, throw it down in disgust and never read another book by this great author. let me name a few ... Royal Highness, Buddenbrooks, Transposed Heads, the Black Swan. i have not read the joseph books because my local library has never had the first volume in the set and i can't read them out of order. good reading to you all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just like being there","review":"This book will give you a true insight into what it was like to be in a TB Sanitarium which is where the story is set. Reading it is just like being there. Dull, Monotonous, Tiresome, Going on without end.... If that was Thomas Mann's mission when he wrote it, then the book is an amazing success."},{"rating":"2","title":"This isn't Stephen King","review":"I am writing this feedback solely based on the comparison another reviewer of Thomas Mann to Stephen King. The comparison is not fair to either writer. Stephen King writes contemorary american horror, Mann is an author of classical literature and he won a pulitzer prise.This book is a masterpiece. It is a story about love unfulfilled, realition of death and sickness and about the general human condition. You will not get anything out of this book if you are not ready to recieve."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Great Novels of the 20th Century","review":"This and Ulysses by James Joyce are full of mystic and mythical symbolism. The difference is that The Magic Mountain is easy and Ulysses is hard. But both are a must for those ready for the message. Thank you to Joseph Campbell for turning me on to these wonders. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"only 2 stars for the modern translation by John Woods","review":"The Amazon blurb states the translation is by H.T. Lowe- Porter and John Woods- but that's misleading- it is only by John Woods.I did not look at the book cover when ordering a replacement for my much-read, badly treated hardcover translation by HTLP, the original translator.At times, she is unwieldy and archaic, but Woods is charmless in comparison. Well, now I have both sitting side by side....If you can find an old second hand version, the first translation is, to my mind, much more evocative."},{"rating":"2","title":"a few comments on translation","review":"... I found it to be a challenging, and very rewarding, work.My only disappointment with H.T. Lowe-Porter's translation relates to her reluctance to translate the conversations that take place in languages other than German. A pivotal 9-page conversation takes place mostly in French, and I was forced to find a second copy of the work in the Woods translation in order to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Stab at Brevity","review":"Like Thomas Mann, I have been accused of prolixity. Sadly, for me, Tom and I have only this alleged vice in common, for I claim none of his virtues. I will try to be brief, then, as penance for past sins._Magic Mountain_ is my favorite novel, because it is inexhaustible in the way that great art always is.Also, I am in love with Madame Chauchat, for though I know that she is named after a machine gun, when I see her name, I always think of \\"warm kitty,\\" or something like.Despite its longueurs, _Magic Mountain_ is a snappy read, I think, and I may yet change my name, here deep in my dotage, to Peeperkorn. We all go some time, after all: why not go spicy and big?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A History Lesson and not much more","review":"If your interested in a history lesson this book is for you. Harvey Houtkin does a good job telling the of the origins of modern day trading and promoting his ego. If your interested in learning how to trade to make money pass this one it's not for you. The title is very deceiving. He doesn't really teach much other than history. He should have been honest with people and not implied that people would learn anything about trading."},{"rating":"1","title":"HARVEY-Please stop having people post fake reviews!","review":"Nobody cares about the person. This book is about business, not about what great things Mrs. Houtkin has done for the SOES business. Thus, when it comes to \\"SECRETS\\" none are revealed. This book is horrible and I am tired of seeing \\"shills\\" come in here and try to boost the already inflated rating on this piece of garbage book. DO NOT BE DECEIVED PEOPLE! There are much better books on this subject matter...This is just an expensive coaster or floor mat. Don't buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure RUBBISH","review":"i have been trading on the SOES for roughly 5 years. this guy should be in jail, first of all, and anyone in the industry knows it. second of all, who writes a book if he's making so much money? a wall street altruist? the info in this book is laughable and outdated. buy 5000 at the market when a market maker isn't looking and post 1/2 point higher? if you talk to the original, ORIGINAL daytek guys from the staten island basement, yeah, that happened, but save your 14 bucks and rent a couple \\"Wall Street\\" and \\"Duece Bigalow.\\" how many ways can i spell \\"garbage\\"?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Houtkin only want us to know what we owe him !","review":"If you are a novice trader looking for trading strategies, systems or any other educational information this is the last book you should consider to buy, this book only tells the history of Direct Access Electronic Trader (DAET) and what Houtkin did for the DAET revolution to succeed. Bottom Line: this book won't make you any better trader. I have read about 15 day trading books and this is the first I should not bought it cause is really a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book!","review":"And don't bother reading this book either even if you can borrow it; you will waste your time. The book is nothing more than a promotional brochure for his expensive course. There are no secrets to be revealed."},{"rating":"1","title":"library check out","review":"I'm glad I checked this book out from the public library and not purchased it. Purchasing it would have been a terrible trade/investment. The only expense I incurred was the waste of time trying to read it. It is just plain boring. Shame on you McGraw-Hill for publishing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should Have Been A Three Part Magazine Article","review":"This book, full of the author praising himself, would have made a very interesting three part series in Active Trader or Futures magazine. There is not nearly enough interesting material to support building a book around it. Not a single stock market strategy discussed in this book. Highly suggest Sy Harding's \\"Riding the Bear\\" for beginners/intermediates to gain the stock market understanding necessary in today's tricky times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written, sketchy, basically a waste of money","review":"I was extremely disappointed. SOES trading is an exciting concept, but NOTHING in thisbook will prepare you one iota for SOES or any other electronic trading. He steers you to his costly on-site trading course and system. This type of operation has been in the news as several have gone bankrupt and ruined their customers."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK","review":"I'm not sure why so many people have given high reviews for this book. This is a REAL LAME book. I was looking for day trading strategies and as the title indicates it should have it. But NO, only chapter 6 has some guidelines on strategy and was very general. If you are looking for day trading techniques, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. If you are looking for general day trading information and what Harvey Houtkin has done for this industry then buy this book. Again, this book is REALLY LAME and is a total waste of money and especially time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disappointment","review":"After I read the book, and especially after I read the last ten \\"book reviews\\" from 10/14 - 10/16, I was really disappointed. If the reader gets excited after reading this basically useless book and can't wait to do day trading, he/she is bound to fail as a trader. And I have to suspect who really wrote the comments.I have to agree with some earlier comments about this book - a total informercial stink."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting. Will add business for my company","review":"After I read the book, which I found very stimulating, I contacted Mr. Houtkin's office, and hope to soon start trading for my company's account on the U.S. Markets. All-Tech seems to be a quite honorable company."},{"rating":"1","title":"i have met harvey and this book is a sales job","review":"Mr. Houtkin is selling a technique that cant possibly work in todays market. I've read the book payed him $5000.00 for the course and traded at all-tech. He teaches how to trade but only he makes commisions on traders and no longer trades himself. excuses. dont fall for it. I am not disgruntled I am now a proffessional trader making an excellent living through trial and error and breaking all of the commission generated rules that Mr. Houtkin teaches."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOOTKIN'S BOOK STINKS AND LACKS CONTENTS.","review":"I know for a fact that using the soes trading system one can make a very, very good living. Since I am already a soes trader and talking from experience. But, I must admit that this book is a sales pitch, and is comes short when it comes to useful trading knowledge. Also, the comments in the books that you can make, for example, a garbage man into very successful trader is nothing short of being silly. One must understand that day trading is a drain on the nervous system and not for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment","review":"Completely mis-represented. This book makes no attempt to educate anyone on how to daytrade the market. It is a compendium of the rules and regulations that Houtkin sought to change by becoming the \\"Original SOES Banner\\". All I can say is \\"Be careful not to break your arm trying to pat yourself on the back, Harvey!\\" If Amazon offered a 0 rating, this book would get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted Money!!!!!","review":"A friend bought this book for me because they know I love to trade. With eager expectation I read looking for the \\"Secrets of Soes bandit\\". This book was a sales pitch for DAET trading and leaves the reader empty and disappointed due to lack of substance in trading techniques and strategies. If you want to read about a man who continually \\"slaps himself on the back\\" this is the book for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT a book about Day Trading","review":"This book was pretty BORING. I wanted a book that talked about day trading strategies, how to get involved with a firm, what is required, etc. The book dedicated a good 20 pages to what I wanted to know. Book also discusses a lot about NASDAQ and NASD practices in the past. Who cares? It's the past. The book touches on what the author expects in the future. If, on the other hand, you're looking for a book where the author praises himself on and on and on, then buy this book. This book should not be titled \\"Secrets of the SOES Bandit,\\" but rather \\"This is How I'm Getting Even with Market Makers.\\" Don't get me wrong, I have no love for Market Makers either, but if your going to market a book about day trading, the book should be about day trading. The book should NOT be about yourself, the mean Market Makers, the way NASDAQ and the NASD operated in the past, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"no substance, lots of repititious history","review":"I read this book, and THEN I read the reviews. Unbelievable, how most of these people can blatantly \\"thank\\" the author and praise his company. The book gives absolutely minimal strategies and explanations into what exactly one does when one day trades. Instead, the author bores you to death with the history of the SOES program and amazingly says the same things over and over and over. This is the first book I read regarding day trading and I pray that the next one is more helpful and \\"teaches\\" me something about trading that I can actually apply."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dud!","review":"This would have been a good book if the author spent less time bragging about himself and more time writing about day trading.

And outdated since SOES is hardly being used anymore as the market makers have learned ways around it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very helpful","review":"What disappointed me the most is that after reading this book, I could not find a single recommendation that would help me day trading. Also several technical errors leave doubt as to the quality and depth of the research done. Can I get my money back Mr. Houtkin? Probably not. By the way, where does the suit from the Massachussets SEC stand? (see Business Week Jan 6)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A total farce and a waste of money","review":"This book like the first SOES bandit abomination is a total waste of time. Self promoting none sense which in the final analysis is grossly misleading and borders on lack of professional integrity. Ask Mr. Houtkin how many day traders burn out at AllTech. The successes are measured in micro percentage points. DO NOT GET NEAR THIS MAN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better named \\"My political war with Nasdaq\\"","review":"As a book entitled \\"How I'm saving the world from the NASDAQ\\", its great, but if you want to learn about SOES trading, move on. I bought this book thinking I would learn secrets about SOES trading. What I got was a lot of attitude about the nasdaq. Even the subsections dedicated to techniques seem to be intended to support the author's war with the nasdaq rather than delivering advertised value to the reader. By the end of the first chapter, I was scanning each paragraph to see if it was more useless opinion, or if he had something useful to say. Useful trading information could be distilled down to about 10 pages. Can I have my money back?"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book totally changed my company!","review":"After reading Harvey's book, I immediately contacted his company, All-Tech Investment Group, with the hopes of aligning our company's for me to offer their product and training in Germany.

This guy is NO trader and should quit claiming that he is! It smells of late night infomercial stink! The information is old, historical and ancient and doesnt help an advanced daytrader worth a lick! I definitely feel ripped off.A much better book with real detailed HARDCORE level 2 trading (not just soes!) information and strategies is The Underground Level 2 Daytraders Handbook.Thats my opinion!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial and misleading","review":"After reading Friedfertig and West's book, I was looking for a better-written book with clear step by step explanations.

Harvey Houtkin claims to be the messiah of the day trading universe, yet, what is really going on here is he is cashing in on a market that has reached critical mass.

Have they no shame? Are they just trying to capitalize on Electronic Day Trader's suprising success? Why don't they publish a more serious second volume of Electronic Day Trader for the advanced trader instead of just trying to skim the commercial cream. Publishing is a responsibility, particularly, in the financial arena. A waiver in the front of the book maybe legal, but there is a moral responsibility. Doesn't McGraw Hill understand that \\"at the end of the day\\" they share responsible for those readers trading on the skewed information they supply. Though not as extreme, it is similar to talk show host who set up situations where contestants get killed i.e.Jenny Jones and then disclaim responsibility and 1st amendment protection."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment!!!","review":"While Mr. Houtkin may have done great things to make the NASDAQ a fairer place for the individual investor, the book goes into this in detail with much self praise.

Overall, it's pretty amusing and is good for anyone with an interest in the language.For serious Japanese language students this book may not be the best choice. Because the language has evolved since the book's publication, the slang presented isn't really up to date. Furthermore, it's easy for novice speakers of a language to use slang and idioms at inappropriate times.

I didn't have a problem with over-heating, but felt the tracking device didn't function (however did not have a problem keeping the belt tracking from a visual check). When the air blower passages were clean, the sander functioned well.

This was supposed to be JEW's best album, one of the guys from blink 182 went even as far to say that this was one of the greatest albums made in the 90's. First off, there is nothing to original about the songs, most of the songs sound the same and are very repetitive, it was a hassle just trying to listen through this album, and to me that does not signify greatness. Music should just flow and be enjoyed by the listener, not be considered a chore. It just goes to prove you cannot believe everything you hear.

As the title of my review suggest, I would marry it, if it were legal for me to do so of course. Beautiful lyrics, beautiful sound, I cannot fully express my feelings for this album in a review.

This album is only troubling in the fact that [Jimmy Eat World] is still making music, and it's hard to imagine that they will ever surpass the quality of this masterpiece. Of course, I would be delighted if they proved me wrong.The best album from one of the best bands in the business. Ripping guitars, Jim's floating vocals, and some of the best hooks I have ever heard. Catchy, melodic, sweet, rockin. This album has it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blessed Greatness","review":"It is clear that this is of the highest quality music that can ever be produced. This rock and roll band from Arizona is amazing, simply put. Their music is soothing to the soul, transfering pure energy from the band to your heart with the waves of sound that carry their magestic words. The lyrics melt in your ears, so full of feeling and emotion. Jim has a beautiful, flowing voice that would put the sirens to shame. If you loved Bleed American, you will love Clarity too.

The third season was retarded, and the fourth season was just goofy. What made the show was the relationship between the girl-next-door Marissa and straigt-out-of-Chino Ryan, and they literally killed that. And instead of giving some sort of presence of Marissa in season 4, the show's viewers are dumped in 5 months later, not able to mourn, and the characters essentially resolve their grievences for her death in 5 episodes. The O.C. ended with a very prolonged whimper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Happy","review":"I bought this and when recieved it could not play it in my Australian DVD player as it was reigonal code 1.When i contacted Amazon about this i did nnot get a reply.

From the fantastic new regulars playing Taylor Townsend and the Bullit way on back to Ryan, Sandy, Julie, Seth and the rest, with plot lines that (almost) never focused on ridiculously convoluted revenge or romance, this season was a joy to watch.Thank you, Josh Schwartz-you let The OC end in the best season yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"HM","review":"This thing is really cool. 2 weeks ago i got it right before christmas.

Installation requires nothing more than a little common sense, but for those that lack it, there's an instruction disc that makes installation almost impossible for you to screw it up. Gameplay has been very smooth for me. Of course, you're going to have your occasional server issues and your typical freezing every now and then, but that's to be expected, no product is flawless. I have a broadband connection, so if I play against someone with a slower connection things can drag a little bit. But for the most part my gaming experience with the PS2 Network Adapter has been problem free. I'd reccomend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"PS2 Online (Beta Tester)","review":"My experience from the beta testing was great and if didn't get a network adapter for free I'd definitely buy it. First off the installation took me about 45 seconds. The ISP set up took about 5 mins and the required save was about 130 kb.About the games, I used my phone line (56k) to play and could play 2 out of the 3 games. I couldn't get the football game to play though. You have to create a user name and then login to server/lobby. You can talk in the chat room go play a game and then come back to the chat room, pretty cool.The network adapter is simply the best to me b/c I can use my parent's existing narrow band ISP and still play games w/out having to pay a fee (unlike XBOX) and when I figure out a way to brain wash my parents into paying [money] for a cable modemn I won't have to buy anything else (unlike GameCube who is releasing 2 seperate adapters for narrow and broadband connections).

And you can't forget the games that are online accessible: Final Fantasy XI, Everquest, SSX 3, Amplitude, Monster Hunter, SOCOM, and every other sports game from all the top sports series. Halo is great, Top Spin is okay, FMW is just meh. Now you get on PS2 and you see the amazing selection. It's pretty obvious what delivers.So yeah, don't buy a PS2 without it.

Twelve sermons are included. They come from such luminaries as Alexander MacLaren, D. Martyn Lloyd-Jones, Harry Ironside, and Charles H. Spurgeon. What disappointed me was the effusive, even excessive use of pulpit rhetoric, and the absence of concrete insights into the meaning of the resurrection and gospel stories associated with it. Only four of the sermons provided this kind of help for me. So, this raises the question as to what constitutes a \\"classic sermon\\" for author Wiersbe? Since this is only the first compilation by him I have read, and it may well be the last, I do not know if the selections here are representative of his view on the subject. If they are, however, he seems to prefer praise, repetition of assertion, and abstractness over against concrete and insightful analysis, illustration and exposition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exploring their new-found musical freedom","review":"After recording blue-eyed soul for Atlantic for years, The Rascals signed with Columbia Records and were given a new-found musical freedom that resulted in two extraordinary albums. Peaceful World and Island of Real. Both albums were a definite departure from their Atlantic hits. Unfortunately, the music buying public agreed. Both albums include significant jazz influences and are VERY well done. If you haven't heard them, you should. I frequently used the Peaceful World album, particularly the track \\"Mother Nature Land\\" when selecting new stereo components, because of the variety of instruments (and frequencies of sound) in the album. Very nice to listen to (again)."},{"rating":"2","title":"It ain't so bad.....","review":"This is a tough album to review because it isn't a true Rascals release, just Felix & Dino, & it is flawed. The concept was good: taking off from John Coltrane's spiritual plane. But the jazz musicians, with the exception of Alice Coltrane, aren't good ones for the job. So it settles into an easy listening groove that almost floats away on good vibes. Yet, as early, somewhat funky new age music it ain't so bad. Every song gives up a nice riff or two. A couple of songs are first rate, particularly Love Letter. The ethereal spaces of Mother Nature Land & Little Dove are hard to resist. The title cut is very nice makeout music. Dino plays great throughout. & the price is real good for what was a double LP. No point in complaining about Peaceful World. You'll know if you need to have it in your collection. I do. But if you prefer unqualified praise, don't listen to a 20 year veteran of New York free form radio.Bob Rixon, WFMU-FM"},{"rating":"2","title":"The title says it all","review":"I used to listen to this album over and over on my 8-track player while sitting in my Bug at Sandy Beach watching the body surfers and waves.

My most favorite believe it or not is the beannaise, an awesome sub for mayonnaise. My son and I both are allergic to dairy and this book has been a God send.

The recipes will not taste exactly like your favorite cheese. However, they still taste great in their own right. It would be a very useful stepping stone for anyone trying to become vegan or eliminate cheese from his/her diet. Also, this book is great for people with food allergies. All possible allergenic ingredients are listed at the bottom of each recipe, and one index lists recipes by lack of allergens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book!","review":"This book, along with Vegan Vittles, another Joanne Stepaniak book, has become a staple in my kitchen. I am a cheese-aholic, and this addiction has been what has held me back from taking the vegan route.

I tried gooey grilled cheese...it tastes like warm playdough. I tried the mac and cheese....ARGGHHHH ...like I threw up in my mouth. I like the taste of nutritional yeast but this was nothing like cheese and everything like a mess of mashed beans and yeast. EWWWWWWWW. I wanted to like this book so much...i read the reviews...I was pre-pared for it to taste not like cheese but at least good. These flavors are an absolute abomination to tastebuds everywhere.

The recipes are long and strange and the ones I made weren't all that.

It looks good on the shelf but fails to satisfy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impractical recipes","review":"This book contains a lot of useful information about nutrition, ingredients, and the differences in cheese vs. uncheese. Having said that, I have to admit I didn't find these recipes very useful. I can't vouch for taste because I didn't actually try any of the recipes. Most of them require ingredients that can only be found in a whole foods store, like nutritional yeast flakes or miso paste. You also have to plan in advance to prepare some of the recipes, like the imititation feta cheese which has to be marinated for 2 days to a week before it attains flavor. I didn't think it would be worth the effort to approximate the taste of cheese; I'd rather have the real thing. If you really need a substitute for cheese, it might be worth a shot, but if you're a real cheese lover, you might be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Culinary abomination","review":"First, I would just like everyone to know that there is a lot of really great vegan food out there. None of it, however, is contained in this book. After trying a few recipes and reading the others, I was forced to hide this book to keep it from being inflicted upon me.

I want a cheese substitute that tastes and acts like cheese. The recipes in this book just don't cut it. The \\"Unprocessed Cheeze Sauce\\", made with boiled potato, carrot and onion, tastes like pureed potato--exactly what it is.The macaroni and cheeze is not even describable...So, if you're an ethical vegan and not concerned with fat content or preservatives, you'd be better off buying Veggie Shreds by Galaxy Foods at your local grocer. They taste great and melt like real cheese.Cheese lovers--DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY...DON'T BUY THIS BOOK"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I bought this book expecting to learn about fermented cheese and meltable sliceable cheese.

The recipes taste so much like cheese that you have to do a double take. The ingrediants are easy to acquire. Preparation time is very short. The recipes are well written and easy to understand. Some recipes use nuts, others use soy or beans! For anyone who cannot eat cheese or chooses not to eat dairy, this book is great. A few of the recipes have a little higher fat content, some have very little fat content becuase of the beans used in them, so there is a good choose of what to prepare.(The amounts of fat, fiber, etc are included with the recipes.) Absolutely no cholestral. This book is a must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book if you've had a hankerin' for cheese!","review":"The recipes in this book are easy and nutritious.

The things I have made just don't taste very good at all. The nutritional yeast taste is strong, and I like nutritional yeast, even when I reduce the amounts in the recipe. The taste is definitely not cheese like in anything I have tried. I was hoping for this book to help me to get over the hump and give up dairy cheese for good, but the results have been very poor so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super cookbook","review":"Aside from the one downside of not having pictures, this cookbook is great for the vegan out there.

Quite a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"eeeww!","review":"If I could have given this book \\"no stars,\\" I would have. The recipes just sound disgusting -- so much so that I never even bothered to make one (which I know is an unfair indictment, but still says much about it). I gave it to my son's school rummage sale, and can only hope it went to a home that thought it served a purpose.

Great Book!!!","review":"I bought this book for the novelty, but it's extremely odd how cheese-like some of the non-dairy cheese recipes can be! The recipes are very tastey.

All in all, I think this is a great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Surprised!","review":"I purchased this book because both my husband and son are both very lactose intolerant. When I opened the book, my initial reaction was: \\"Oh no, I've ordered a book with a political agenda and nasty recipes.\\" I didn't even know WHAT nutritional yeast was, and my nose was actually curling up at the thought of what these recipes would taste like. But, I perservered, purchased a small quantity of nutritional yeast from a local health food store, and made the parmesan and mozarella substitutes. They were GOOD! I was so excited that I took some of the first batch over to my neighbor to try and she LOVED it, too! Even my one year old daughter was asking for more and more and more. I tried the uncheese danish for breakfast this morning, and my husband ate it right up. I think this book is going to be a well used one in my kitchen from now on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally! A Godsend for Vegans!","review":"As a vegan, cheese was the hardest thing in my diet to give up. As the book says, cheese is an American tradition, from Macaroni and Cheese at family picnics to Cheeseburgers on the grill on the Fourth of July. But, I wasn't willing to contribute to factory-farming and the decline of my health JUST to enjoy a tradition. I looked everywhere, from soy to rice to hemp to almond to tofu cheeses. All of them contained casein, a milk protein. FINALLY, I found this book! There are so many recipes not only for cheese taste-a-likes like Mozzerela, Muenster, American, etc, but also cheese dishes, like casseroles and, yes, of course, Mac 'n' Cheese. The only qualm I have is that it does use Tofu in several recipes, which I can't stand the taste of. But, that's a personal issue, and in no way affects the book's quality.Highly reccommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Our key to successful vegan transition","review":"My husband and I transitioned from a lacto-ovo to vegan diet easily and painlessly using the recipes in the UnCheese Cookbook. I am absolutely addicted to dairy and never thought I would be successful in eliminating it. This book proved me wrong! We feel great and no longer feel the weight of guilt about consuming dairy.Like any cookbook, you will need to make adjustments in your seasonings so the flavors are to your liking. Try making the recipes as they are written and go from there. For recipes calling for agar agar, avoid purchasing it at the health food store, where you will likely see a $7 + price tag on a tiny bag of flakes or powder. Instead, go to an Asian grocery and purchase it there in either form for around $1.I recommend this book to anyone who is struggling to eliminate dairy, it will change your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I've made a few recipes in this book. They have all been great! We make grilled \\"cheese\\" sandwiches, use it in wraps, on English muffins, etc. Tonight I made the Eggplant Parmezano. Excellent! I've also made the baked Mac and Cheese, which was also very good. I definitely recommend this book. It's cheesy, though it doesn't really taste like \\"real\\" cheese. But my meat eating, cheese loving husband has loved everything I've made so far and is impressed by the cheesieness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great source of decent recipes","review":"You'll have to have access to a health foods/specialty store to buy some of the ingredients but if you're on a dairy-free restriction this book can at least help you have some sort of normalcy back to your diet. If you're used to eating gooey dairy goodness this food probably won't live up but if you've been missing your big ol' bowl of mac-n-cheese while living with new restrictions the recipe here will come pretty close.

The author has some favorite words that he uses abundantly, e.g., \\"instrument\\" as a verb, \\"network appliance\\", etc. He keeps on referring to a MIB as \\"an MIB\\" and many times refers to an unsigned long as \\"a unsigned long\\".

When I rented this film, I was expecting some intelligent, elegant philosophizing on suburban marriage and adult friendship among married couples.This film has nothing intelligent to say. It only serves to depress. It makes a strong anti-marriage statement.

These stories are not from a historical context or from a military standpoint, but of normal, relatable people. The stories cover the carnage seen through the eyes of a twelve year old to the memories of women going back thirty years to the high school they once attended. It also covers how the outlying villages were indirectly affected by the bombing through word of mouth and deaths of friends and families."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great information, maps and tables would be good","review":"The information presented in the book is exactly what you would expect - it is a thorough history of the promotion of rails and canals by government. \\"Government\\" is meant in a general sense: the author tracks promotion by municipal, state, and federal government.However, following the information and comparing it state by state would have been made a lot easier had there been more than one map. The only map in the book is located at the front to illustrate Gallatin's findings. As Goodrich delves into the details, and as the tale progresses past the Alleghenies, the map is nearly useless. Unless you have memorized all of the towns, rivers, and mountains of the Eastern Seaboard, you may have to resort to another resource. Also, it would have been nice to have the data tabulated geographically and/or chronologically for ease of comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful source of information","review":"Ms. Gallo's book is very informative and when written was cutting edge.

But this book has some goods pictures of the \\"HJ\\". But most of it is good for a laugh.

That foreshadowing made the quiet, catharis of Pale Green Things both a logical progression and very moving. In Get Lonely we again find Darnielle in an apparently autobiographical mood, but going from one languid arrangement to a similar next one, often with just piano and his falsetto voice, as he recounts a faltering relationship. Perhaps it's the staggering into adulthood, perhaps it's too much Prozac, but the pain and sadness is muted here and that's not all to the good. Make no mistake -- one should buy Mountain Goats ahead of about 99.7 percent of what's out there, but Get Lonely makes lonely sound a little more, well, dull than painful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced","review":"Overpriced.

The handles are so comfortable, and the fixed base is squat and low for good control. The plunge base interestingly doesn't have a depth adjustment screw.

In this amazing book she starts off by having Meggie, who is the main character, read herself into a book about a fantastic yet somehow very dreadful world. Meggie continues through the book battling evil with her voice but still the Inkworld is under the shadow of the tryannical King Adderhead or the Silver Prince.

Brandon Frasier is a terrible reader, simply incomphrehensible. I was driving from Boston to New Hampshire and tossed to the first CD into the back seat. I so disgusted listening to him bumble his way through making up accents, stumbling over the language and dialogue. He is truly an awful reader, what was Listening LIbrary thinking? And he is to star in the film Inkheart? Let's hope he is a better actor than reader.I know this is a delightful book, and I was enchanted by the first audiobook, it is terrible that this series is marred by this audiobook. I hope listening library brings back Lynn Redgrave for the third book in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Quite What You Think It Would Be","review":"Anyone who read the book Inkheart by Cornelia Funke would know that a sequel would be hard because of the impression that Inkheart left upon the people that read it. Inkspell does not have the same emotion and feeling that Inkheart had. The book is somewhat dry compared to the first book. In this book, the characters that are introduced are not as developed as the other book. Overall, if you are looking for a good, long book for your children that would keep them entertained Inkheart is the one to chose, but if they have read it before, I suggest that you do not go for the book of Inkspell. It did not keep my attention and often I would find myself un happy with the book because of the boring writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inkspell","review":"I am hoping to read this book soon.

And this second part is my favorite of the three, if I had to choose.

If you love this book too, I would suggest checking out Cornelia Funke's other books, especially The Thief Lord."},{"rating":"2","title":"Page turner!","review":"All fans of Inkheart should be thrilled with the progression of the story and the development of the characters.

However, I was rather disappointed because SPOILER ALERT the plot wound on and became more implausible and impossible, so to \\"fix\\" it, or make the plot work (make that to TRY to make the plot work) more and more people can suddenly make things happen by reading and writing. Ie, to resolve conflict and crises, we get someone to read something, or someone to write something...and there was even one point (re the reading of the magic book) where it seemed to me something worked out outside the way the story itself specified as possible (maybe I'm wrong). Also, the way it ends you get the impression its deliberately made to drag on and on...it brings no closure at all and yet there's no feeling of \\"good, it goes on\\".

I was surprised to find adult profanity used quite a bit in the sequel Inkspell for it to be a children's book. I feel it could have done without the profanity. As with that adult language in it - it cannot be used in Elementary school libraries. So students that read Inkheart will not be able to get the sequel in school due to the adult language."},{"rating":"1","title":"It leaves you hanging","review":"We liked Inkheart.

I would have abandoned it halfway through, but I had already committed 300 pages. The book was way too long and started to become ridiculous by the end. The first book, Inkheart, was written in good taste, but Inkspell was very poorly written. I just wanted to say get on with it and let me finish the book.

She's planning a sort of sightseeing vacation, a brief tour to see the fairies, talking trees, and other amazing elements described to her so vividly by her mom. Just like Gilligan's, Meggie's own little tour turns into something quite different. Once again, author Funke creates a place out of time, populated with many of the characters from Inkheart (Basta, Dustfinger, Farid, Mo), and adding many more, eg, a good prince and an evil one, strolling players, Dustfinger's wife and daughter). Once again, bonds of loyalty, love, selflessness drive and shape the energetic plot. Inkspell is a nonstop adventure set in a cruel, feudalistic society, where the written word, properly wielded, can be the most powerful force of all. Recommended for all who enjoy effective, credible fantasy fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was wonderful","review":"This book is beautifully written and has a wonderful plot and theme. Though it does not quite stand up to Inkheart. Inspell falls at a close seconded. As you know if you have read the first book Meggie has the capabilities to read things out of books. This book however puts a new twist on her powers instead of reading charaters out she reads herself in. Her journey contines by trying to set the story she is in to rights. I liked this book very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"What A Novel! A Total Page Turner!","review":"Did you ever wonder what it was like to slip between books smooth creamy pages? Meggie is a young girl who posseses a unique talent to read people or things in and out of books.

Go with Faird into the Inkworld the place she imagines everyday? Or stay at home with her newly reunited family?I would recommend this remarkable book to anyone who read and enjoyed Inkheart. Beware: you will get absorbed in this thrilling book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book Ever","review":"Inkspell is even better than Inkheart! It is so unpredictable and leaves you on the edge the whole time! It isn't just a story of faries, elfs, castles and enchanted lands. (though that is what it is mostly about)It is a story of Romance, Adventer, and so much more! I truley wish I could actully be read into the story and be with Meggie, Farid, Mo ,and Resa!

While I did enjoy reading it I thought this one was a littler harder to follow with so much going on at the same time. I was disappointed at the end to just be left hanging. It leaves you no choice but to have to read the last book to get any type of closure. Which I had intended to do anyway, still I just don't like to be left hanging.

Also, her way with words... graceful, romantic, and suspenseful. I just can't understand how a work of like this can have that much power, when it's translated! but she brings another place to life and with that place, another world that is scary and gorgous. In this sequel, I melted with the book and I felt like I could see everything happen right before me! I wish it could really happen to me, meeting the the Black Prince & his tame bear!

The plot is engaging with so many twists and turns that you won't be able to put it down. Cornelia Funke but a lot of imagination into it and the characters are all unique and different and fun. My favorite is the sassy Aunt Elinor.... She's a hoot. This book is not at all predictable like the first one was. Great job! My only complaint is the swearing, this books is mostly targeted towards young teens I think it could have done without a lot of the swearing, it seemed to have even more than the first one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Series","review":"As a busy adult, I value my reading time. This series (Inkheart, Inkspell, Inkdeath) was worth every minute I invested in reading. The books were well written so they flowed easily. The stories had enough mystery to keep me engaged throughout. The connection from book to book was seamless. The characters were believable. I recommend this series to all readers, young and not so, as it was quite enjoyable! (You might want to have all three books available at the start!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"She did it AGAIN!","review":"Cornelia Funke did it again! Inkspell is a wonderful addition to the Ink series. I believe I will be saddened when it is over. Mo and Meggie embark on more adventures together and keep us glued to their travels. It was great to catch up with Dustfinger and Farid in the Ink world. This novel takes you into the Ink world where so much of the bad came from in Inkheart. As you come to see what a beautiful world Fenoglio created you are drawn into the magic of how Resa, Dustfinger and Fenoglio desire to be in this mystical world. Again for those with students needing AR points here it is. A book parents can enjoy their students reading and racking up those points! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Audiobook: Inkspell","review":"The book is great, no mistake about it. Inkheart's audiobook was so wonderful that perhaps there's no way Brendan Fraser could possibly live up to the standard set. That said, however, his voice was flat in narration, and his voices for the characters were cheesily accented so that Farid sounded Russian (or ?) and Dustfinger had a vaguely Celtic accent, which was distracting to the story. My daughter and I also found that he lacked any subtley or depth of emotion--so that, for example, his reading of Fenolio's angst came off as merely surly. I'm glad to see that Fraser wasn't booked for the third installment, and immensly disappointed that he will play Mo in the movie . . . But more to the point, I'm really sorry I bougth this audiobook version of Inkspell. Read the book. You'll be much happier!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Magical Adventure in the Inkworld","review":"Inkspell, by Cornelia Funke, is a captivating fantasy sequel to Inkheart. As in Inkheart, Meggie and her father have the ability to read living things out of books. Meggie reads herself and her friend Farid into the world of Inkheart, the \\"Inkworld\\" as she calls it. They find that the story has changed from the original plot and must save the citizens from the evil ruler: the Adderhead. While reading Inkspell, I truly connected with the characters and felt their fear or awe.The fascinating world of Inkspell would entice anyone ages ten and above. There is a lot of suspense and action to read about; however, there is some violence involved. It seems to me that Funke ended Inkspell kind of quickly. I understand that there is another book in the trilogy, but she could've wrapped it up a bit better. As a seventh grader I highly recommend Inkspell to children and adults who are seeking a magical adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inkspell W0ot!","review":"I loved this book!

Meggie and Farid, I won't say how or why, are in Inkworld. Mortola's on the rampage, and it's just a whirlwind of excitement, drama, and a little romance. The character's, Dustfinger in praticular, have so much deph. I refuse to spoil anything, so I'll make it simple, READ THIS! you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!!","review":"This book was very good, I really enjoyed reading it!

I immensly enjoyed this book and i recommend it to anyone who enjoys an adventure and magical story!Inkheart"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, horrible reading","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Lynn Redgrave's reading of Inkheart, and looked forward to listening to Inkspell. Now I find Brendan Fraser a likeable actor, but his reading of this story is so bad I have given up on it and will read the book instead. He resorts to obnoxious vocal caricatures to differentiate between the various characters -- not sure if this was because he thought it would benefit his listeners, or because he lacked the ability to do something more subtle -- but the result is horrendous: for example, Fenoglio has some generic Bronx/\\"Joisey\\" accent, Elinor sounds like Monty Python's Terry Jones in a drag skit (think \\"Spam\\"), and the little children's \\"voices\\" are so grating it makes me want to slap them, or Brendan, silly. A huge disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Artistic writing! Exciting concept! Fun reading!","review":"You can tell by the first two books in this trilogy that the author has a deep, abidng love of books. This is the second in the series and the concept of having book characters come alive within a book within a book is quite complex ... but magical and wondroous.This writer is excellent at bringing her characters alive by the use of clever words and fabulous description.Cornelia Funke is a marvel, and I look forward to the third book in this artistic, exciting, fun trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio Reader Stinks, What a Shame","review":"After hearing Lynn Redgrave read Inkheart, I was so eager for more, but Brendan Fraser, the reader, is so concentrated on his different accents and shallow interpretation that I can only listen for a bit without shaking my head and wondering why they hired him for the reading. He gets in the way of the story. Someone in the Marketing Department must have thought he was good, what a pity. I'd rather have a bland reader and then at least I could use my own imagination. There is no maturity and not much warmth in his voice. I hope someone else reads it someday. Better read it in book form, I say. Best of Luck to You All and Happy Audio Experiences!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic read","review":"I'm 39 and loved this whole series of books.

I reccomend it to anyone age 13+."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why all the curse words?","review":"My kids and I really enjoyed this book. It's not quite as exciting as Inkheart, but a good story nonetheless. However, we were dismayed at all the curse words! What is the purpose of them in a book geared toward 9-12 year olds? Lot's of da*ns, h*lls, and a couple of bas*ards and bi*chs. What for? Sheesh! Otherwise, a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"If Inkheart was 10 out of 5, Inkspell was 100 out of 5...","review":"I didn't think it was possible to find a book better than Inkheart, but when I read it's sequel, I was proved wrong.It's excessive excellence is complicated to explain but... It's my new favorite book. What else can I say? Of course, this book left us a lot less reassured than Inkheart did, but there's an excuse for that: The fact that this is the second installment in a trilogy. I cannot wait for the final book and of course, wish that it wasn't the final book. But of course, I'll read them all again, because as Mo so greatly puts it, books get thicker every time you read them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book !!!","review":"What a cool book.

So I am not sure how this justifies the title of what seems to be a legal textbook. I sugguest any purchaser look closely at the picture of the title before buying. Certainly that stopped me from getting this book.Oddly enough the version on AUdible seems to be totally different - different cover but same author, same title and different description.

It is written in a negative style, and there is very little help to hand for the endometriosis patient who has to make a decision about the best long-term care available. It is not very well researched and facts are wrong in many places. It feeds old myths about the disease, and gives no new insights into the management of endometriosis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"I did not care for this book at all.

The author showcases many different projects that employ many different techniques in Photoshop. While he does step you through each project, he does not hold your hand with each step, so I would not recommend this book for absolute beginners, but for those who know how to use layers, masks, etc.I only wish that the image files used in each project were available for download so the reader could work through each project in the book. The book would be infinitely more useful if this were the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"inadequate","review":"This treatment of Lincoln is inadequate at best. I've read other biographies in the \\"Penguin Lives\\" series (e.g. Jane Austen, Napoleon) that were fine within the scope of the series' purpose, but this one fell short. For example, the author seems to be projecting his own religious views on Lincoln when his characterizes Lincoln as an agnostic without much proof . This is reminiscent of how Lincoln was characterized as a kind of stain-glassed Evangelical for so many years by writers of that persuasion. Lincoln is more complex than this in his religious perspective. Likewise in the evolution of his views on slavery. My suggestion is not to waste any time or money on this volume, but instead to pick up a much better one-volume biography: \\"With Malice Toward None\\" by Stephen Oates. In his source notes at the back, Keneally himself states that this is his own favorite book about Lincoln."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conjecture, Fabrication, and Pop-Psychology","review":"King's scholarship is severely in question in this book. Many of his claims about both Rasputin and Yusupov are mixtures of conjecture, pop-psychology, and pseudo-mysticism. In some cases, they're downright libelous.Too bad Felix Yusupov isn't alive to sue him, too. (As he did both MGM and CBS).King makes claims that cannot in any way be substantiated, but he presents them as truth, as allegations, and as innuendoes. The book comes across as an apologists attempt to paint Rasputin in a good light and to brand Yusupov as some kind of insane sex-criminal.King even maintains that Rasputin could actually heal!In most of the rest, he just re-quotes other sources. I know that stealing from more than one source is research, not plagiarism, but the only new insights into the events are from King's imagination.Read it as fiction, not as fact. Yusupov might not have told the complete truth in his memoirs, but you can't take this book as fact either."},{"rating":"2","title":"best unknown band ever","review":"This CD is an awesome continuation of the band Ed Hall,,these three guys know how to do it,,hats off to Larry,Gary and Lyman"},{"rating":"1","title":"kindle map fail","review":"The book itself is a good solid specialty guide but the maps do not display on my kindle.

Even if parents don't like the idea of sleeping with their babies and children, this book should persuade them at least to hold their babies more of the time than most in our society do. If all new parents would read this well-researched book, we might turn the tide on parenting styles that have babies isolated in cribs, carriages and car seats. Jackson shows that babies are meant to be close to their caretakers, that touch is crucial to their well being and that staying close with one's baby actually makes early parenthood easier on the parents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Judge a Book by its Cover","review":"I bought this book because of the adorable cover photo and my interest in the topic of co-sleeping. I was looking for practical information and perhaps some personal anecdotes, but was very disappointed when I found a philosophical, awkwardly compiled volume. I found it to be so unreadable that I could not bear to finish it. Fortunately, I also purchased a book called Good Nights by J.Gordon M.D and Maria Goodavage, which provided the practical information I was looking for in a very enjoyable manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT SAFE","review":"According to the book, the author is saying that there are benefits sleeping with your baby. I do not agree; then why do cribs exist. Babies should NEVER sleep in the same bed as the parents. There are NUMEROUS accidents of babies suffocating due to the parents rolling over. If the experts all state that a baby should NEVER sleep with the parents in the same bed, then perhaps we should all follow this advise. This book should should be taken off the market...we do not need people encouraging parents to sleep with their children. If there were ever an accident to occur, the parents will blame themselves and they should."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cautions:","review":"1. This is not the complete opera. The director has omitted the Prologue, which is need to introduce the opera in the context of Monteverdi's era.2. Characters dress in 20th century costume (so, a modernized performance).3. The performance practices are not historically accurate.But, if you are interested in a modern interpretation of one of the more significant early operas, you may enjoy this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's with the sound mix?","review":"I'm puzzled by the other reviewers' positive comments. First, the sound was clearly recorded in studio and synched to the live performance, sometimes quite poorly. The mix is terrible, which is bizarre given the above. The acocmpaniment, especially the harpsichord, is very clear, but the singers are muddy and hard to hear. It's generally considered pretty important in opera to be able to hear the singing.Costuming is mix and match-most of the characters wear clothes in quasi-Roman tailoring, but made of silkish polyester. You'll know why when you see the title singer's admirable endowments through her translucent top. However, the one major \\"good guy,\\" Otho, wears Nazi black leather; I'm really not sure what they had in mind here.Set is an opera house one that probably looks great live, but as usual appears cheesy on screen. If they were not going to record a live performance, I'm not sure why they used it."},{"rating":"1","title":"very bad","review":"I bought it new from Amazon. In a 4-5 month it broke down.

The machine is full of you know what."},{"rating":"2","title":"DeWalt 735 thickness Planer","review":"I have been working with wood since high school - about 45 years. I have used/borrowed other thickness planers so when it came time for me to purchase my own, I decided to buy the best home unit available. My requirements were for a minimum of 13\\" width and portability within a home workshop. I decided to purchase the optional extension tables which should be considered a necessity unless you are providing a lot of support for the workpieces.I've been using the unit for 10 days and am extremely pleased. It arrived in perfect condition and required no setup or alignment. I've run about 100 board feet of walnut, cedar and pine using both feed speeds. The lower speed does give better results on the harder woods.I am extremely satisfied with the unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Packaging/shipping problems still not addressed","review":"My planer arrived today with a crack in the aluminum base, and a small piece of the base ready to break off. The styrofoam packing materials were all broken and cracked, not doing their job. I've read reviews here back to October 2003 that point out the problems with the packaging. It's hard to believe that no one at Dewalt or Amazon has recognized this as a problem and done something about it by now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive planer due to blade cost","review":"I have used my DW735 planer for dimensioning rough cut cherry, pine, black walnut, fir, oak, and maple. I've also used it for restoration of surface on worn oak, fir and maple. These blades wear out very quickly-- within a few dozen BF of materiel. I find a set of blades will last 2 hours of planing before they are too dull to allow wood to feed. For the cost of the blades I have used, I could have already purchased a 'real' planer. I would not buy the DW735 again if I could do it all over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"defective sprockets","review":"I have a collection of DeWalt tools and have to this point been satisfied, but the DW735 appears to be defective.After having used the unit less than a dozen time (all on soft wood), the sprockets driving the feed rollers fractured. The unit had not bound or seized on the material. It just broke.The manufacturer's online order system shows these to be back-ordered - so one might reasonably conjecture that this is a problem irritating more than just me.Rethinking my commitment to DeWalt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got Taken","review":"Bought the DW735 thickness planer three months ago, first 3 boards the machine worked great. I raised thickness setting to 4\\" and the machine locked up. I could not go up or down. I called Amazon, Tool-Crib they said to call Dewalt, called them was told to bring it to there local repair center and they would not replace it. The man at the repair center said they never seen one of these in here before but they will do there best.After many phone calls between these people 3 months later and having to delay some of my furniture orders even longer I do not have any faith in Dewalt product at all. If it breaks your going to have a lot of trouble. I'm sure I will have to get new blades to. Do you want these problems to!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Planer","review":"I owned a Delta 22-540 for many years, but had become frustrated with the results on cherry and other chip-out prone woods. After much research and debate, I purchased the DW735. Survival from shipping set my fears of the broken base stories at ease. The performace is flawless too, leaving a glass-like finish on the most problematic woods with the slow feed rate. The depth stops are right on the money and absolutely no snipe leaves give you more usable wood. The only issue I have noted is that the knives seem to leave ridges after minimal use, especially compared to other planers I have used. They all sand out easily though and this planer is definitely worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy something else","review":"I'm a professional woodworker and have used this planer for two years. I would have dumped this one and invested in a different one if I had the extra money. If you buy this one from Dewalt, plan to spend alot of money on blades. They dull very quickly, even in soft wood like cedar. I've also had to replace the rotating handle three times after either the screw attachment or handle broke. For the past 6 months, the unit fills up inside with wood dust and shavings. And, because of the open design inside, the wood particles jam up the sprockets that raise and lower the machine. I also hate the fact that there's very little support for wood when it exits the machine...causing it to snipe (cause divots in the wood) significantly. And, last but not least, it's almost impossible to find someone who can repair it! Dewalt wants $200+ to do their over-haul. Hardly worth it!Buy something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Planer for soft woods only, and the blades are terrible","review":"I missed the fine print when I bought this planer - the blades are disposable. I tried to plane some maple with them and after 1/2 hour, I had tear-out and scoring - it just ruined a bunch of figured wood. When I removed them (they are reversible), I couldn't score my fingernail with EITHER side. The solution is for DeWalt to come up with a quality blade package that can be resharpened and will take a micro edge.I would not recommend this planer to anyone planing hardwood or figured wood. It may be O.K. for softwood, but when you spend the amount of money that this thing costs and then realize its limitations are softwood, it's a major dissappointment. I would strongly advise anyone shopping for a planer for hardwood applications to look for blades that can be resharpened and a reasonable quality. Don't waste your time with this turkey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Little Planer","review":"I got my DW734 on sale at a great price and have used it in my shop with great success. I have used it on all kinds of wood hard and soft and it has done an excellent job. So far no need to sharpen or replace the blades, although I would not have expected to at this pointI wouldn't even consider purchasing this planer without the optional infeed and out feed extension tables. I think Dewalt should consider including them as part of the package rather than as an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Pulled the planer out of the shipping box and discovered about a 2\\" x 3\\" area of the aluminum base was chipped out. Thought that perhaps I could live with that but then I tried to adjust the depth. Planer is supposed to have a range from 1/8\\" to 6\\" thick. However, it would not move out of the 3/4\\" to 1\\" range.Then comes the service. I had to physically bring the 100 pound machine to the nearest DeWalt service center. Even though I live in a big city the nearest service center was over 40 miles away. They said it will take about 2 weeks to repair and I need to drive back and pick it up because they could not ship."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cuomr service from dewalt","review":"I have owned many plainers and simply love this one. I have no complaints. I make musical instrument so I require smooth wood. It gives you smooth wood all the time with the in and out feed tables. The out table must be raised a penny lenght at the end and there will be no snipe. This machine is easy to get to the inside and replace blades. I can't imagine anybody having this machine and complain about it. And here is the best. I purchased this from Amazon almost three years ago. It stopped passing the wood. I took it to the Fort Worth Dewalt service center. They replaced a sprocket and I picked it up. A short time later the same thing happened. I took it back to the service center and they gave me a brand new one in the box with new warranty. Any way to you put it that is customer service and product backup without compare. I give Dewalt a big thumbs up and will continue to purchase their fine products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent results","review":"This planer was easy to set up out of the box.I have used it to plane oak, cherry and walnut. All have come out glass smooth. There are cheaper planers out there but you will be glad you paid a little more to get this baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay, yea...","review":"I've been planing rough sawn hickory with mine since I got it. And, yes, it takes its toll on the blades. But, I came in and read the reviews before purchasing this planer (my older brother also got one) and several had some really good suggestions on how to minimize the issues that come up. Using wax paper on the bed every so often really helps. Also, I use Mineral Spirits to clean the bed every so many board feet.A neighbor makes fun of how often I change the blades with the hickory but then, he has a six thousand dollar planer. For my budget, this was and has been a good purchase for me..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well at either speed.","review":"Works way better than the equivalent JET and much better than my (really) old Mikita. I recommend the folding table accessory, but I still get snipe on short boards. (Probably a matter of adjustment). I had been dreading the day that the blades needed to be changed (turned around actually, blades have two edges) but that turned out to be a snap! The rotating drum has pegs that fit into alignment holes in the blades. I rarely use it on the 'finish' speed (179 cuts per inch) as it works just fine at 'rough' 96 cpi. I've had no trouble at all going down to 1/8 inch thickness. However, connected to my dust collection system, chips fall back down onto the table surface!? It doesn't do that when it isn't connected to the dust collection system, so I don't know what that's all about. It's an ear buster, and it pretty well needs a dedicated 20 amp circuit."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a dissapointment","review":"This planer has been a huge disappointment. It worked great for about 100-150 board feet. Since then i have had to feed the material through manually. I bought this machine before i started only buying commercial grade woodworking tools (mostly Grizzly) and i regret it. For a few hundred bucks more you can get a 15\\" grizzly planer that you will love forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sniping And Ridges","review":"I bought the Dewalt 2-3 yrs. ago. My first impressions were very favorable, the 3 knife head did a smoother job in fast feed than my other planers did in slow. It did a good job on pine, but when I started planing red oak it started sniping and leaving ridges in my boards. I rotated the knives and it helped for 2 or 3 boards then I started seeing these problems again. The sniping occures on both infeed and out even while lifting up on the lumber, because of this I'm reluctant to buy the extension tables($50). Dewalt advised me to feed in high until the finish cut to improve blade life, I've purchased 3 sets of knives at $50/set to plane 300-400 ft. of clean oak that I ran through my old Ryobi to insure that it was clean. I've been a toolmaker for 25 yrs. and I believe the grind on the knives is too thin to hold up to hard wood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dewalt 735 planer","review":"I have only used this a couple of times as of yet,I first ran some really rough oak through it,next was some walnut and I am really impressed with how well it planes in both instances. I really can't tell any real difference between the quality of cut using the slower( more cuts per min.) speed rather than the faster one. Really like this machine!Perhaps even more stars are to be rewarded for their prompt customer service. The unit arrived with a broken gear case cover. Going to their web site gave me the part number and a short email explaning the damage in transit resulted in receiving the replacement in just a few days. There may just be a place for some other yellow tools in my shop as a result.I have read of problems with the blades wearing too fast, and I guess time will only tell there."},{"rating":"2","title":"great planner with weak blades","review":"I have only had this planner for a few weeks now, but the combination of the solid carriage and the fans assisted chip collection are great. When attached to my dust collection system I get almost no mess, except when planning some narrow edges. After attaching the folding tables I get no snipe at all. I think the planner was well worth the extra cost.My only gripe is the blades seem to be a bit brittle or weak. The first couple trys with hard maple gave a glass like finish, however, like another reviewer after only a few boards I am seeing ridges, probably caused by small nicks in the blades.Overall I highly recommend this planner over anything else in its class."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!","review":"Bought this unit about a year and a half ago and have planed A LOT of lumber with it. I have also gone through a lot of blades. DEWALT ARE YOU LISTENING!!!!!!!!

Very disappointed with the roller not strong enough to pull lumber through. I have to pull and tug. Qaulity of blades extremely poor and costly to replace. Dewalt hear this!

Not very good testimony to Dewalt quality and support."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the best I've used so far...","review":"I was about to purchase a new portable planer, and had narrowed my choice down to either the Delta or the Rigid - both are good tools, but I think DeWalt has \\"aced\\" them on this one. That is saying a lot, considering it came from me and I am by nature more of a \\"Delta\\" type guy. HOWEVER, in all fairness a tool should be rated by it's capabilities, user - friendliness, and design. In other words, when you are talking portable planers - what kind of work can it do ? My answer : \\"OUTSTANDING WORK\\" ! It is so easy and simple to set up and use, the preset thickness stop was a pleasant surprise and is dead on, blades reverse and are simple to change ( no more gauging or aggravation). I have used it on White Oak which is VERY hard and prone to chipout, and it is impressive. It is priced higher than some - due in part to its \\"newness\\", I should think, but as I said - It is definately worth it in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Taking it to the dump","review":"I've had this planner for about 4 years and I'm taking it to the dump as soon as my Makita planner comes in. I've had it in to the Dewalt service center 4 times because I could no longer raise or lower the bed. I'm not sure what the problem is - whether saw dust is blocking the sprockets or the posts are moving, but Dewalt does not seem to be able to make a lasting repair - and they don't seem too concerned about it when I talk to them. Other people here have mentioned how quickly the blades dull. Some of the more expensive aftermarket blades are better, but not much better - it you do a lot of work planning, you need to have a supply of replacement blades. The only thing I like was the dust extractor - which blows sawdust out - you don't have to pull it out - but the inside of the machine does fill up with saw dust.My advice, look for a different planner."},{"rating":"1","title":"YOU'VE CHANGED MY MIND!!","review":"After reading the reviews and recalling other bad experiences with Dewalt service I'M RETURNING MY PLANER I purchased yesterday.I'm fed up with manufacturers treating their customers like morons.

It's now crippled because I can't get parts from their site. I placed an order on May 7, today is July 13th. The order has been repeatedly delayed a couple of weeks at a time. But do they (DeWalt, Porter Cable, Delta) bother to tell you you're order has been delayed again? No! The only way you can find out that they've decided to delay fulfillment is to in initiate a search yourself.Bottom line. It was a decent planer for a while but once it breaks you're done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big little machine","review":"It never ceases to amaze me, what a difference one piece of equipment can make.

I was going to buy the DW734 12.5\\" planer, but decided this one looked better. Boy was I wrong. This planer has plenty of power and leaves a nice finish, but it snipes very, very badly, way beyond acceptable limits, and that was with a narrow, short piece of wood. They claim there is a built-in cutter head lock, but it must be a ghost. This thing snipes worse than a Ryobi without a cutter head lock. I returned it first thing this morning and bought the DW734. It is what I was looking for. With the cutter head locked, there is only 1 to 2 thousandths snipe, easy to sand off. Save yourself a bunch of money and buy the DW734. This planer, DW735, doesn't perform to the price tag. Buy the DW734."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Pay More","review":"The Dewalt two speed 13 inch planer is by far the best bench top planer on the market. However, Amazon's pricing is way off!! 499.00 at Home Depot gets this for you. Granted, you pay sales tax but it's still less!! I have bought a ton of tools from Amazon because of the deals so I am a little confused by their higher pricing!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent little planer","review":"I have been using this planer for about two years and still love it. I routinely use it to plane rough hardwoods such as maple, oak, hickory, and walnut. I always run the boards over my joiner first, otherwise this planer has trouble with warped and rough boards. I love how easy it is to change the blades, even thought they are rather expensive. I get about 70 bd ft before I need to change the blades but since they're double sided, I really get about 140+ bd ft per set of blades. I'm very happy with this planer and I would buy it again anytime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maintence is important","review":"I spent a lot of time researching different planers and decided to spend the extra money on the DW735 because of the third blade. Some of the reviews suggest that the blades are not of good quality and are expensive to replace. I would agree that they are expensive to replace, however I have run a lot more rough sawn hardwood (hickory and oak) then I expected. Also, ran some poplar with great results. The biggest error in planing is to take too much wood off on each pass. Other advantages are the blades are easy to change, fan assisted chip ejection chute and speed setting for cpi. Recommendations would be to purchase the chip collection accessory and the folding tables, wax the bottom of the planer (I use a balled up piece of wax paper) and clean the rollers. I have had my planer for 6 months now and still have not had problems and would purchase this planer again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea .... Bad Implementation","review":"If you enjoy buying High-Priced Ink Jet Cartridges for that low-priced printer, then you will love this planer.I've had my DW735 for two years now and I've spent more on replacement blades than the original cost of the unit (including the side tables)(can't believe those cost extra!)I plane a lot of White Oak, and smaller quantities of other hardwoods. I'm really lucky to get 2-3 hours of planer time before nick marks start showing up and the blades have dulled out!!!!!!Also...the inside of the unit is all formed abs plastic, and hairline cracks are showing up, so it probably will not last much longer. Kind of like Dewalts' Random orbit sanders that typically last me about 7-8 months! Sure has become a disposable tool market...nothing lasts anymore!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad part ruins planer","review":"Planer worked great for a short period of time and then the front sprocket that drives the rollers broke into three pieces. I have not run a hundred board feet thru yet and its broke.

The only reason I replaced the AP10 was I wanted to plane wider boards. If the knives would plane more than 24 board feet the planer would work just fine. I am thinking about returning the paner for another brand if I can not get better knives for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you rate an item less than 1 star? Do not buy this thing!","review":"Basically I should have read the reviews before getting this. If I could give this thing 0 stars I would. I replaced an older dewalt planer with the 735 and thought it was a good price for the features. Well, I have planed about 30 board feet of 4/4 cherry and if your boards aren't perfectly flat to begin with you are done. I don't mean twisted and warped, I mean 1/8th of inconsistency and you are done. Instead of bogging down the motor, the planer catches it and it kills the rollers. Have that happen a couple times and you will wish the thing bursts into flames. I'm sure I will be told I am using it wrong but I know that is not the case. I have been very patient with the thing but now I have given up. Going to get a new planer, not Dewalt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feed problems","review":"Cabinetmaker 20+ years, this planer doesnt feed well. After exchanging planer had same problem. Rep told me to run at slow speed but that didnt help. Plus whats the sense in two speeds if one doesnt work. Bad design and possibly dangerous as it could kick back if not feeding properly. If you dont help the wood thru sometimes it wont feed at all. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"$25 per project on blades","review":"I have had this machine for a year and I automatically charge all my custom in build cabinets and furniture a $25 dollar surcharge for blades, this planer is faboulous for about 30 board foot of lumber, a typical project. Then you can flip 'em over and do one more project. It would actually be cheaper to let my hardwood supplier surface two sides that to run this very expensive planer. Dewalt, listen up!!! You may have the DIY and weekend enthusist blinded by your fancy marketing and race cars but professionals are starting to grumble, put your house in order, include the accessories to achieve the best results!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DeWalt DW735 was a mistake","review":"I should have read other reviews before purchasing this thing. I bought it for my wife to use in her clock shop for the occasional replacement of a panel for a cuckoo clock. On the first project, it lasted all of an hour of light use before the drive belt broke. That was $27.42 plus tax and gas for a two hour drive. Then the blades were dull within another hour of use. We never tried to take off more than 1/32\\" at a pass from clean clear walnut. Flipping the blades was easy, but at $55 for new ones this could get expensive. Unfortunately, we let it sit un-used for over a year so it can't be returned. I'm shopping for something else. I love all the rest of my DeWalt tools, of which there are many."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not reliable","review":"I was going to buy this planer from Amazon but wanted to see one before parting with my hard earned $$. Visited a local woodshop where the guy told me he had been canibalizing machines for parts as his customers were complaining about breakages. One guy had his break twice in a week on simple planing operations.Sounds like the reviewer that talks about a design issue with the new DeWalt got it right. I wouldn't part with the serious cash needed to buy this machine until I heard definitively that the problem is fixed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't buy it again","review":"I waited eight months to write this review hoping that I would grow to like the DW735 planer. No chance!I really only have two problems with the planer but they are critical problems.First, as most people have stated, the blades wear out very quickly and are expensive to replace. I have used three sets already and have only owned this planer for eight months. The last set of blades I bought were carving grooves in the wood after just one day of planing maple. That's pretty bad!Second, the roller feeders get dirty very easily and don't pull the wood through so I find myself having to help the wood pass through the planer. This is very frustrating as I would prefer to let the feeder do the feeding.On the plus side the planer does plane the boards very flat. But, because the blades dull so quickly I still have to do quite a bit of sanding after planing to get rid of the ridges and grooves that have been cut into the wood by the planer.No, I wouldn't but this model again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good planer","review":"I have owned this thickness planer for about 6 months and used it for a few projects. The surfaces are excellent on a variety of woods--so far I've used it on curly maple, cumaru, cherry, poplar, and oak with no issues. Dust collection is good with just my whining shop vac attached. Set-up was a snap and worked great right out of the box.So why not 5 stars? Two reasons: first, the \\"optional\\" extension tables are not at all optional. Without them, the planer has significant snipe; with them attached there is no appreciable snipe (<1/64\\" at worst). At this price point the extension tables definitely should have been included, and I would not recommend buying this planer without them.Second, the knives are disposable, which could run into significant expense down the road compared to sharpening them. Replacement knives run about $50 a set. Thankfully I haven't needed to replace them as yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"More time cleaning than working","review":"OK so apart from the knives becoming dull within 1 hour of starting this machine up, I feel it is necessary to comment on the poor dust evacuation. I use this planer with a high powered dust collector connected at all times. For some reason I am constantly having to remove the case and manually clean out the cogs and chain as they have become so clogged that turning the depth adjuster is impossible. I don't know if I am the only person who seems to have this problem.I would not recommend this planer as it seems to be the proverbial money pit with regards to new blades and constant repairs, not to mention wasted man hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Results, Returned the Planer.","review":"I am a professional woodworker, and I decided that I needed a portable planer in addition to my Powermatic 160. I bought this one over the others for two reasons: it supposedly did not need a headlock and the blower/chip ejector meant it was it's own dust collector (this feature worked well). The problem? The knives are GARBAGE! They last about 30 minutes before they are dull. At that point, two things start happening. The feed rollers start to need help pulling the wood through AND the supposedly self-locking head creeps upward as the wood is pulled through. These problems render this machine nearly useless. I understand that planer knives get dull, but these dull much faster than any other knives I've used, and because of the quick-change system (which is nice, I have to admit) they are your only choice. I was extremely disappointed with this machine. I own other Dewalt tools and am very happy with them. I returned the planer to where it was purchased."},{"rating":"1","title":"DW735","review":"This is a good planer for very small projects. If you want to run a decent board through the DW 735 make sure you have plenty of extra drive sprockets. I have gone through at least two dozen drive sprokets in the first month of operation with the DW735. The earlier models (DW733 and DW734) have fewer or no problems because the drive sprockets are durable. It seems the management at DeWalt saved some money on the smaller drive sprockets on the DW735 and increased the costs for the consumer. If you want to make small bird houses out of cedar (without knots) this may be a good planer for you; however, if you want a decent quality planer buy an older model or a different brand with durable drive sprockets. The drive sprockets on the DW735 are not designed for durability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snipe and blade performance","review":"I purchased this planer and at first had terrible trouble with snipe. After disassembling it and figuring out how to adjust the ball screws (not something I recommend to most folks) I am astonished at how much better it performs. It went from horrible snipe over the first and last three inches to an indistinguishable amount. Mine was apparently misadjusted at the factory. It happens....I've seen complaints about blade life and the blades do seem susceptable to getting nicked and leaving tiny ridges. However, they are not dull and if the ridges become objectionable I'd turn around just one blade. Primarily I've been planing hard old growth maple.Overall I'm really happy with this planer and recommend it. The claims stating \\"virtually no snipe\\" are true and the wood is usable from end to end. No more losing 6\\" off every board."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Problems with DW735","review":"I, like most others here have bought the DW735. At first glance this machine has all the features that I wanted.

I am very disapointed with Dewalt on this, I love that features but cant live with the problems. I called Dewalt about the blades and they sent me a free pair but denied any knowledge about the blade and rollers.

This problem should have triggered a recall notice. We'll see how much it costs to fix this problem. Oh, and snipe is still a problem with this machine, even with the outfeed table supports.

For anyone who has had to deal with injuries, much less a chronic debillitaing illness, this book shows how to approach such situations with courage and humor. It also brings up the importance of letting others help you through crises, whether they be teammates, friends, doctors, psychologists, or the clergy. I especially liked the insights into other National soccer team members. And it was very interesting to read about specific National team games, games which I watched in person or on television. I had no idea the struggle Akers had just to continue playing, much less competing at a high level.

Ms. Morrison has always been an unusual and gifted stylist but I think that the theme and interwoven plotlines of \\"Jazz\\" bring out the fluidity and cleverness of her writing. Each mini-story is a repetition of another story, but in such a gracefully twisted way. Out of all her novels, I would have to say that \\"Jazz\\" is the most detached. However, it is not passionless! Each character throbs with hate and fear and love but depicted in such a way as not to exhaust you with their emotions.

The book has many underlying themes and symbols throughout. It was difficult for me to draw the connections of the symbols to their meanings. While I read I had a hard time keeping up with the narritive because the scences changed rapidly. When I finished reading it I felt like I needed someone to come and explain all the symbolism used in the novel. However I do enjoy Morrison's descriptions of the city before and during the Harlem Reniassance and how jazz was an expression of Black's emotions during the time period. This was my first Morrison book and I was not too happy with the overall feeling I got but hopefully her other works are more clear cut."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real World","review":"This book taught: That day to day is completely different for African people, That America will always have a main system along with alternative governed by ethnic groups, and more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written, beautifully read","review":"Intertwined stories of loss, jealousy, and rage end in surprising reconciliation and renewal. Morrison's language is, as always, gorgeous and moving. Her voice on the audio version is expressive and musical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This was the first book by Toni Morrison I had read, and I was a little intimidated. I listened to the audio book. Her soothing, calm voice and the poetry of her language quickly absorbed me and I was deeply entangled in this fascinating, strange story. However, I was very confused from the middle all the way until the end...narrators keep switching and the time period keeps jumping around. I was so frustrated that finally I had to actually read the book, and now I feel more confident that I understand it, but not really. Anyway, her language is so beautiful and unusual that, coherant or not, JAZZ was worth the read. I'm now reading SONG OF SOLOMON, and that too is confusing at times but good so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Picture It: Harlem, 1920s, Geezer Kills Teen With Impunity","review":"Toni Morrison is one of the most brilliant writers of this century, but this book is a mere shadow of her usual ability. Again, Morrison tries to show how people can bear the unbearable and the twisting effects of it. But I think a more fitting title for this book would have been \\"Complacency\\". The characters in this book are so stalwart in their misery that not even murder can compel them to action or change. I almost got the feeling that Morrison was offering the victim as a warning, like: \\"that's what you get for being a slutty girl. Don't ever try be vibrant.\\" This story had the opposite feeling of jazz, for jazz soars and falls with new times and new constantly-improvised melodies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly Disappointed.....","review":"I was very disappointed in this novel. It was uninteresting and I didn't feel that it \\"all came together\\" in the ending. I would not recommend this book to anyone. Definitely not on the same level with some of her other works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Like It","review":"I have read quite a few Toni Morrison books and I have to honestly say that this one was really disappointing. First off, make sure you do some research on this period before you do any reading. Also, find out what \\"Jazz\\" means, not the music type. I found the story uninteresting and didn't have that \\"everything came together\\" feeling at the end. Contrary to most of the other reviewers, I did not enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"time consuming","review":"i read this book for school and you have to read it at least twice in order to understand morrison\`s style of writing... it is not a light read"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong book!","review":"We wanted a particular cover so that my daughter could follow through with the book they use in class. She was quite careful to select one with the same cover - dissapointing to get another edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent introduction to ancient warfare","review":"This is an excellent introduction to ancient warfare. It is lavishly illustrated, and provides excellent diagrams to support some of the concepts such as how a phalanx of Greek infantry manoevered and then moved into combat. The book covers the technology of the times, but also looks at tactics and gives an overview of the politics that lead to the various conflicts. I would higly recommend this book for beginners in the field of ancient warfare such as myself. My only reservation, is that while the primarary authorities are extensively referenced in the text, I would have liked to see a bibliography (although the glossary is great too!) Highly recommended for beginners or those with a general interest in the topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"All you wanted to know about Greek and Roman Military!","review":"This volume contains details of battles, of famous strategic details that are hard to find in other books.

I am sure during this X'Mas both of us will want to fight for the book. The pictures and the drawings are of the highest qualities. I love the descriptions of major wars. I just wish that the author has given it more explanation of the drawings for the major battles like adding more legends. Also, it is kind of hard to read/understand the numbers and types of soldiers for both sides on the battlefield. But all in all, this is a great book that I suspect I will read and re-read many times."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST BUY","review":"As far as explaining warfare in the classical world, you really couldn't get a better book. Its illustrations are clear and informative. I originally found this book in my high school library and it took all my will power to keep from stealing it. I've found that most books that expain famous battles do so in a manner that's often vague and leave much to the reader's interpretation. This book shows how a battle came about - step by step. Keep in mind that it doesn't especially delve in the political/social mechanisms of why the battle started, but that isn't necessary considering that so many other books cover those topics sufficiently."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY IT NOW","review":"IF YOU ARE REMOTELY INTERESTED IN CIVILIZATIONS OR WARFARE FROM THE CLASSICAL ERA, THIS IS A MUST HAVE BOOK.

The whole feature has a nice set up. Inbetween the nudity scenes, they show the casino and parties that the models are talking about. You might even see a flash or two at the parties. All of the scenes are great, although the video only gets 4 stars because a few of the scenes drag out a little too long with the same action. Overall you will not be disappointed with this DVD. This DVD also features a bonus feature of Irina Voronia (Miss January 2001) and it is a very nice edition to the DVD if you know what I mean. Pick this one up today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You need to see this one","review":"I have to say that I have always been a fan of the Playboy DVD and Videos. This is one of the best ones I have seen. Usually there are two or maybe three good scenes out of the (usual) 5 or so, this one is actually full of good scenes. Most certainly worth a peek."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for workout fatigue and pain","review":"At 35, I didn't think I needed this product as much as my 70 year old neighbor said I did. (He swears that it gives him more energy and vitality.) However, I started vigorous exercise and was hurting for days after. Joint pain, bone pain, chronic muscle pain. It was unbearable but I really liked to run, so decided to give MaxGXL a try. I don't notice any increase in energy, at all, but I have NO more body pains after my workouts. I only take once a day, not two. And just to make sure it worked, I stopped taking for a week and all the pain came back post-workout. Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!","review":"Used it on my Dewalt 13\\" planer. Tons of fine dust blow out through the bag itself.

I placed the planers on a Rubbermaid carts & slid 30 gal trash cans below (bottom shelf). What a blessing - to plane & not have dust / chips flying everywhere.

Too bad the design teams didn't talk to each other."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont waste your money","review":"Take the $50 you pay for this and put it towards a dust collector.

I ended up having to buy a dust collector after i purchased this wish i would have just bought the dust collector to begin with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product for the Money","review":"Used the DW735 without a collector when my shop vac died. Purchased this chip collector the next day after the mess I had to clean up. I bought a large trash can from local store and within 10 minutes, was planing with virtually no dust. Great improvement from trying to use a too small shop vac or certainly better than using nothing at all!!. Great quality, good price. Dewalt should make this accessory a part of a planer \\"kit\\". Unless you have a central dust control system, buy this product before the first board goes through the planer."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEWALT DW7353 Chip Collection Accessory for DW735 Planer","review":"I an not happy with this product. The concept is good, but the bag leaves much to be desired. The planer has more than enough air flow to get the chips to the can, but dust was all over the place. After seeing one of the other reviews with similar comments I will look for a new bag also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dewalt DW 7353 Chip collection Accessory","review":"Excellent solution for collecting chips from planing lumber. To use this system, I purchased a plastic trash can from a local hardware store along with large plastic bags. I insert a plastic bag in the trash can and attached the Dewalt DW 7353 Chip Collection System to the trash can, then to my Dewalt DW 7353 Planer.When the DW735 Planer is in use, it transfers the chips to the can. Clean up is relatively easy, by removing the Chip Collection bag from trash can and removing the plastic bag full of chips.The two disadvantages of the system are (1) chip buildup between the rim of the trash can and where the accessory bag attaches to the can and (2) occasionally the accessory bag will break away from the trash can which causes chips to fall on the floor.Overall, I recommend this system even with the two disadvantages because it save hours of cleanup and it is the cheapest solution to chip collection that I have found."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I have a 20x40 shop with quite a few tools and had a problem with the chips and dust from my planer. The collection method is great for the chips, but I still get a little dust out of the bag, which is alright concidering the amoount I had gotten before. I do us a leaf bag in the 55 gallon plastic barrell and this tends to let the sides slide off the top of the barrell if I don't get it tight enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I have used this product for the past couple of years and find it to be an excellent product for keeping the shop clean.

I used a plastic trash can first with the brackets for the handles cut away so the bag would fit tighter to the can. The planer blows the sawdust out with so much force that it kept blowing the bag off the can. I next tried a steel trash can. Same problem. Contrary to all my other Dewalt tools, I'm very disappointed with this chip collector."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dewalt Planer Dust Collector","review":"Results are modestly satisfactory. Overall a quality shop vac will serve the same purpose with less capacity but is adequate for occasional usage.

The real problem is the top--it goes right to the top. With effort, it can be zipped but you wouldn't want to do it often in case the zipper won't hold.Still, it is a \\"transit\\" bag, and even with the tight fit is still useful to transport places--much easier to carry than my other bag (Belkin, nice but big). There isn't a lot of padding, which keeps it light and portable.

The Dolly Dagger video alone was worth the price, plus to finally see the 1969 Sweeden concert was really cool.I would suggest that they make a film documenting Hendrix' entire life, like \\"The Definitive Elvis\\" or \\"Beatles Anthology.\\" That way, we not only see the film clips, but we get a better understanding of how everything fits together.All in all, I'd say it has a lot of material that a collector would enjoy, but as a fan, I enjoyed \\"Jimi Plays Monterey\\" more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy this only if you are a serious Hendrix fan!","review":"This is only worth while to the real hard core Jimi fan.

He seems to have gotten lost somewhere in the song's solo. But this is a good example of the bands nature. There is also a live perfomance of Purple Haze which is pretty good considering it was from a filming. There is not a lot of high tech used here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a Different Hendrix DVD","review":"This DVD is carelessly shot, often focussing on Jimi's face rather than his entire being. Show us his hands for crying out loud! That's where the action is.

The first 15 to 20 minutes of this reissued video are awful. Not only was the footage bad, but they could have cleaned the negative before they released it. The qualilty of Wild Thing in Paris '67 was horrible, but once you got used to it, they procceded to cut it short.Red House and Sunshine of Your Love from the 1969 Sweden show are the only highlights of the video. They should have released the whole 1st and 2nd set of this show and then it would have been a worthwhile buy. I give it 2 stars since it was better than Fillmore East and Electric Ladyland videos."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOEL ...","review":"This is a great video, and has excellent performances all around except for Noel. Time and time again, Noel just doesn't work. He isn't involved in the song the same way Jimi or Mitch are. I mean, that is one ...bass solo during the seemingly 40 minute version of \\"Sunshine Of Your Love.\\" While doing his \\"solo,\\" Noel pauses and SCRATCHES HIS NOSE. COME ON, WHAT THE HELL?!?!?! Jimi should have thrown him off the stage, or gotten a bass player that puts his playing before a scratch he had on his nose. Noel's backing vocals are also whinny and raspy. Let Mitch take some of the vocals (if he's not scratching his nose). So in short, Jimi and Mitch are spectacular, but Noel is enough to give this excellent collection four stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jimi Hendrix:Experience","review":"This DVD was a big disappointment.

Assuming access to a table saw and basic skills, anyone should be able to produce a more elegant and less costly solution. A plywood box with wheels will do that very well. Better yet would be to add a door and shelves for storage. Two hours working plywood beats one hour assembling sheetmetal with all the screws, washers, nuts, wrenches, instructions, etceteras.

This stand is solid! I don't have much room in my shop so the wheels are perfect to move it out of the way. The only drawback is the wheel you use to set it down or up (to move it).

The other two stand types I have are reasonably satisfactory - but operating the levers and/or hand-screws necessary to make them 'mobile' is awkward.

Looking at it that way I saved enough to purchase another, though I didn't. Assembly was straight forward and easy, it took me about 45 minutes to assemble.

The bags instead are NUMBERED! And they have nice pictures of each bolt, but they are not printed to scale, and no dimensions are ever mentioned.It tells me to use the second longest bolts (L) to attach the pedal wheel, but they're too short.And, of course, their customer service is closed, because no one does this kind of thing on a WEEKEND.Dewalt - ever thought of doing some user testing?"},{"rating":"2","title":"quality","review":"This is a quality product and I am glad I purchased it to go with my planer.

Slightly complicated to assemble as the directions don't give a lot of guidance. The pedal that you step on to raise or lower the wheels is in an incredibly awkward place. You can install it either inside the frame or outside. If you choose outside, the pedal will stick out really far and you will trip on it and snag every cord you ever use on it. If you choose to mount it on the inside, you have to contort your body a bit to get your foot under there to push it down and lift it up. The stand is great for its purpose and I would reccommend it, but the pedal was poorly designed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible assembly problems still persist","review":"I'm giving this item a \\"1\\" simply because of the persistant assembly problems noted by others. As of March, 2006, this sucker was still being supplied with mixed metric/SAE hardware, despite the instructions to the contrary. Also, my instructions had numerous errors, the most egregious of which was the instruction to use the long bolts for base assembly and the medium bolts for planer mounting. If you actually do it this way you'll wind up with a stand that wobbles loosely and can't mount the planer, so you'll have to do some significant reassembly. I just complained to DeWalt about this, and they say that they are forwarding my comments to their production manager.On the other hand, if you finally get the assembly right, the product seems to work very well indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dewalt DW7350","review":"I would be glad to review this product, however I never received it.

They do not apply to this stand and DeWalt seems to have known this for several years yet has not only not updated the ones that ship with the stand but has not even taken the minimal step of updating the instructions on their website. You can look at the picture and figure it out. You will also need to pick up a set of bolts to mount the planer to the stand as the ones sent in the package are too short for the DW735.

Maazel can be a perverse interpreter--one almost expects it of him--but here he's behaving well, and his ability to make ensembles sound good is undeniable.

This modestly priced item is a perfect example. Its performance at shuffling cards leaves a bit to be desired: it's noisy, and the feeder sometimes gets a bit overzealous and takes in too many cards at a time, frequently resulting in a haphazard stack of cards facing the wrong way or standing up on end. For the price, the performance is poor. If knocked down somewhere in the vicinity of $5, it might be a satisfactory buy.

We have used it and used it as we play \\"Hand and Foot\\" which requires 5-6 decks of cards. The only negative is that new cards being shuffled into the center get caught on the side and stand up. To solve this, we have used our fingers to support the shuffled cards until the center portion is at least half full. The cards being shuffled no longer have the space to stand upright on the side.

It quite simply does not shuffle cards; what it does do is take cards from two different piles, and intersperse them together. This is very, very far from random - for example, cards that start on top of the two piles are guaranteed to be on top of the resulting \\"shuffled\\" pile, and vice versa for those on the bottom. This quite simply is not a card shuffler, despite the name.

We used the second one five times - first 2 times it worked fine but it sounded like it was straining. The next two times it worked sluggishly as if the batteries were weak. I again purchased new batteries, thinking maybe I had gotten some bad batteries when I first installed them in the new machine. Guess what? New batteries did not help.

One thing to remember, use new cards. It is made well but the card slots are tight and old cards or bent cards will stick a lot. Use new decks and don't bend them or shuffle by hand. With new cards it works perfect and the cards will last for hundreds of shuffles. It takes 2 C batteries for each side and if batteries get low, one side may shuffle faster than the other. Also if the batteries get low, it won't shuffle a full 3 deck stack on each side, so start with part of the cards and just add as it shuffles.

The shuffler also has some odd quirks that cause it to send more than one card at a time from either side and sometimes the cards fall \\"sideways\\". Running the decks through a few times is a fast and easy way to ensure the card are randomized.This was a good find for us because we play a game that takes between 2 and 6 decks (depending on the number of players) and often includes younger players at family reunions.

They are very easy to assemble and align. Each corner of each table can be adjusted for height. The attachment points are spring loaded so they are also easy to take off and put back on. They do help in supporting the work and seem very solid. The front table folds up out of the way and stays there. The rear table however is another story. Because the main table and the back of the moter/blade assembly are pretty much even and the pin to hold the table is set back the rear table will never fold up and stay. When the depth of cut is set around an inch and the cord is wrapped around the cord holder the rear table won't flip up more then around 20 degrees. In my opinion this is a major design flaw, the main table needs to stick out at the rear by at least an inch or two to allow the table to fold up."},{"rating":"2","title":"DeWalt DW7351 Folding Table for DW735","review":"If you've read some of the other reviews you already know the back table extension will not fold up with a chip collection accessory hooked up, and that is true.

The back extentsion not folding up for me isn't such a big deal because I have the chip collection accessory and it sticks out about as far as the table extension anyway.

Repaired it numerous times and now it sits idle - have just had it.

It worked well out of the box and continued to do so for the first year. After about 1,000bf of mainly pine the drive rollers started having trouble pulling material throught the cutterhead. I should have taken notice at this point and determined the problem, I may have been able to prevent the problems I now have. The bushings that support the rollers are very cheap and not designed for much use as there is no way to keep them adequately lubricated. As a result the bushings siezed on the shafts destroying the shafts and causing the chain drive and sprockets to break.

You can also tell how this book was a stepping stone for Miller's next book where he spoke to gay men and lesbians in foreign countries. This book speaks of the 1980s and may seem dated now.

The fine lines and freckle-like sun damaged areas have minimally improved but the overall texture of my skin has improved greatly and it also seems to have minimized the pores around my nose. It also somehow made my breakouts MUCH less frequent.

This book is nothing like Bridget Jones Diary, other than that the protaganist is a British woman.

It seemed like a no risk purchase.These blades are SHARP! I could tell immediately, by feel, but I also examined them with my loupe which I use when sharpening and learning. Even the square edges are insanely well machined.My planer's humming alone like it's brand new and extra blades allow me to send out for sharpening. I've yet to attempt to sharpen planer blades.

I bought it for my 2 year olds room so she could listed to the nature sounds or an audio book now and them. Although it looks sleek, the row of buttons on the top are far from intuitive. Would be impossible to find a particular button in a poorly lit/dark room. Cheap volume wheel on the side and very cheap slider switches for am/fm, nature sounds, dim settings etc. The reason it's going back though is the broken tuner display. When you spin the cheapo dial on the side to change radio stations the digital display doesn't change from \\"82.7\\". It flickers like it wants to change...but it doesn't.

It was a good alarm clock to have - but only if you only want a \\"short term\\" alarm clock.This morning, I walked in my room to hear garbled radio playing. The display on th clock wasn't working and none of the buttons would change anything. I finally just had to unplug it. It was broken and there was no way to fix it.It seems as though others have had this problem, so it looks like Memorex just made a crappy product and they knew about it, so they're not selling it anymore.

I checked my dvd hookups and then read the liner notes about NTSC format...really? Are you kidding me? A quality show like this and you put it in a format from 10 years ago?! I just ASSUMED everything video was being done in ATSC (digital) ... uh, there are almost no cathode ray TVs being marketed nowadays, right?My girlfriend and I saw their show in Minneapolis and loved it, and I remember the PBS show so this remains very disappointing visually.

Finally I figured I'll just see for myself. The video quality is actually pretty good. Obviously it's not a high definition production since its on a regular dvd but if you are not a techy person you will probably not really notice much.What you will see is the same sequence of filming as the PBS production but not in hd quality. It does seem that they lowered the quality on the footage filmed from a distance, resulting in a slightly blurry view, but the close up footage maintains high dvd quality and looks great.If you want to buy this but are hesitating because of the video quality, I would say just go ahead and get it.

But, if you are buying this DVD to relive the experience, you'll be sorely disappointed. Overall, the quality of the recording is comparable to an old VHS tape. The audio is similar to vinyl. No Dolby, no 5.1, no nada. Just plain old two channel stereo with drop outs. The video is on a par with VHS (480i), certainly not nearly as good as the PBS presentation. If I did not know better, I'd think that this a knock-off from the back alleys of Hong Kong.In addition, the extras (The making of...) are minimal and certainly do not add measureably to the experience.Bottom line, record your PBS station and send the money to them.p.s.

This is a good start.","review":"In his usual style of challenging thought Tony Campolo takes on the seven deadly sins and relates them to modern, western culture. Today it seems as though very few people are willing to openly talk about sin and call it what it is ... SIN. That is what Campolo does. He covers the sins by giving broad and specific examples of them, helping you to understand how you might actually struggle with these sins, and then helps you to develop a strategy to overcome these sins through the grace of Christ. I don't want to call it refreshing to be convicted over my own pride or gluttony, but it was very different from much of the other Christian writing out there that seems to focus on \\"self-help\\" instead of repentance. Campolo does an excellent job of continuing to point to our (and his own) short comings and then pointing to the unmerited favor of our loving God."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seven Deadly Sins","review":"The book helps you to relate to the sins we immerse ourselves in to supposedly feel better.It gets right to the bottom of our external wants and needs which decay our spiritual compass.

These symphonies are powerful, have interesting dramatic turns and twists, some surprises in the way harmony is treated - but not too daring, it isn't Beethoven - and give a very classical feel.These Symphonies could have been within the reach of Chandos' Contemporaries of Mozart series, but CPO was here first.Praise for the good recording and the dramatic and not overblown way the orchestra plays."},{"rating":"1","title":"It pained me to even give it one star...","review":"I highly recommend NOT wasting money on this CD.

Most of the time it doesn't sound like him and when it does, he sounds tired and bored. These tracks have no energy and none of the qualities that make me such a big fan. The front of the CD should say, in plain view, that this CD contains all re-recordings but that is not the case. It's written small on the bottom of the back, and was covered by a sticker placed on the back by the record company.

They said after that it was \\"heavenly.\\" It didn't get any better. I tried wearing it to bed and found that I hated it so much that I woke up with my pajama top on the floor.

I did complain to Amazon about this, and they gave me a partial credit since I could not return the perfume itself.

Tracks one, two, and three are melodic and they showcase their skills via beats and guitar. Their fourth song (Wildcat), arguably the most known from this album, will give you a surge of animal instincts. You'll want to dance and showcase this song to all of your friends, who will think you are extremely cultured and in good taste after you've shown it to them. After that, the next few songs hold their own, but the album slightly comes apart at the end. It's just that some of the songs give us some of the same that we've heard before, and arn't unique enough to warrant their own song.Ratatat is a great band; their best attributes being their unique way of merging beats and guitar. And, this CD is a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"What???????","review":"What on Earth??? Or better, what on \\"Barkerland\\" is happening here?? God almighty! Before I knew it, BANG, it was finished. I sure do hope that \\"Sacrament\\" will pay up for his \\"The Damnation Game\\". Ok, Ok, it was his first attempt at writing, but even so, dreadfully confusing. I'm so sorry Mr. Barker...you work only looks good on screen, or if it is Weaveworld, which IS a good book... Maybe if Clive starts breathing more of Planet Earth's air, he will be able to produce more acceptable works. Because if THIS is what he has to offer, then I am sorry, but \\"The future of horror\\" as prophesised by Stephen King himself, is one of decadence...but even so, at bits, well written.

There are some great moments, the prolouge and Marty's first encounter with the Last European are classic Barker, however the book waffles and comes to an end without fully explaining some major points in the book. The story's major weakness is it's ambiguity. While I do appreciate that aspect in most literary protagonists, it's simply too much here and the characters are ultimately unsympathetic. Nice effort, but Barker has handled better in other books. Also the reader comes away a descriptive defintion of coprophagia which, please forgive the pun, may not be to everyones taste. The Damnation Game is very good macabre. But the book is all technique and lacks the passion found in Thief of Always and Weaveworld."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK!","review":"If you are a horror fan then by this book. It is one of the best books that I have read in a long time. The only reason that it has not been made into a movie is because it is soo weird and crazy.

After reading Damnation Game,, I'm starting to wonder if Barker can carry a Theme all the way through. He's wonderful at creating an amazing topic and subperb at giving horrific details of events, But this book, like Imajica left me wondering, WHY???? he seems to take another great story and makes it pointless by the time you finish the book. This is my third read from him and I have two other books I need to read. They better get better or Mr.Barker won't get anymore purchases from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame Lame Lame","review":"This book was so bad I decided to forego the last 20 pages. here's why: 1. It acknowledges that it's a \\"Faust\\" knockoff 2. Gore is used as a substitute for plot 3. Big gaping holes--the coincidences are ridiculous 4. The heroine (pun intended) serves only to set the hero up for the next \\"scary\\" scene 5.

When I first discovered Barker, I was intriguedinitially by the Books of Blood. Then, when DamnationGame came out, I was as impressed by his writing as I hadbeen by anything King had ever written. I have read allof his subsequent novels, but none packs the power ofThe Damnation Game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damnation Game","review":"Very Creative story. Be warned, it is written in British.

What started out as an interesting novel with a great and creative concept, was slowly dragged, and dragged, and dragged on WAY TOO LONG until it's creativity soon fizzled out. Honestly, if I were writing this book I would have chopped several hundred pages off the end of it. It's as though he through in a bunch of filler just to have a nice, thick novel to show off. Skip it! And skip Coldheart Canyon too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"First and still the best","review":"The first novel Barker ever wrote was also the first of his that I read, and I can still remember the impact it made on me two decades later. The assurance and clarity of the prose is shocking for a debut novelist, as is the almost tactile sense of evil that seems to leave a sticky residue on your fingers just from touching the pages. I recently picked up the damnation game for a nostalgic revisit and was pleased to find it retains virtually all of its power, but I still felt a little sad not to be able to recapture the thrill of reading it for the first time. Despite his innumerable triumphs in subsequent years, I'll always think of this book as a personal best for Mr. Barker."},{"rating":"2","title":"The beginning of this book is Barker at his best...","review":"This is the best full length novel of horror Ive ever read by Clive Barker. The beginning is delightfully NC17, and the end is great. Its the whole middle of the story that seemed to slow down in pace.

The quality is poor from all aspects. The colors are dark and they use terrible cloth backdrops, the film quality is amateur at best. The music and narrator are both annoying and the sound is awful. My six month old loves the Baby Einstein videos and watches everything with great intent but even she seemed bored by this video. The only good thing about the video are the basic concepts it attempts to teach, but it is not visually stimulating enough to hold a child's attention long enough to do so...."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my daughter's favorite DVDs","review":"I just can't believe how my children love to watch Baby Prodigy over and over again.

I purchased this DVD at a $5 clearance sale at walmart and felt I paid too much for it! It is the most amateur attempt at film-making I've ever seen-anyone with a video camera could do a better job. The \\"set\\" looks like a simple table top with a fabric drape. The main character is a simple hand puppet which always shows up from the side (ie. no appropriate puppet stage is used.) The whole movie is a series of random scenes of toys-most look like they've been purchased at the dollar store. But what I found a bit disturbing is the scene where they set up a hot plate to melt ice into water in a pan. I'm not sure I want my kids getting the message that it's OK to play with the stove. If I could have given this 0 stars I would have done so-I can't believe others have rated it so highly.

There was absolutely no creativity involved when filming this production. Don't let the title fool you...music plays in the background while you watch a slideshow of antique toys. These toys have to be at least 30 years old and are completely ineffective when it comes to capturing the attention of a small child. To be fair, I can only comment on the first 5 minutes of this dvd because I refused to watch it any longer. Save your money for some of the more educational (and entertaining) dvds.

The pop radio singles \\"Where The Hood At\\" and \\"Get It On The Floor\\" are sure to increase the sales but there is absolutely no substance or anything here. The only album DMX totally pulled off was his debut It's Dark And Hell Is Hot, after that his albums got worse and worse. Now X is reduced to simply barkin and cussin his way through an album not even worth 2 stars, but for the sake of a few choice songs, this album is not worth it.

The BEST thing about this cd is the guest stars who ALL outshine the Darkman pound for pound.If you want to hear GOOD Ruff Ryder joints, just pick up Styles, Jada's or even Sheek's cd's.

Honestly, I got sick of hearing him repeat previous lyrics. It's okay to revel in past glory, but to use them as crutches is just sad and boring.What redeems the album is the several songs that stand out. 'Shot Down', 'We Go Hard' and 'Bout To Blow' are by far the best tracks, and are the majority of the handful of songs worth multiple plays."},{"rating":"2","title":"The dog is out","review":"X will never do better or even match his first album so yall need to get over it.

The intro is good, sets you up for what you expect to be the same ole' dog. From there he proceeds to fall off. Much of the album is dedicated to dissing Ja Rule which - funnily enough - has already been done(50). And no one takes ja seriously anyways, one song outta put that pop star in his place.

The rest of this album is filled with a lack of strong lyrics that is compensated by, and I thought I would never say this, to much emotion. All the barking, growling, and yelling was cool when X was bringing it in the lyric and flow department. Now it is just plain annoying.

Don't get me wrong. The Great Depression album was a good album but,it seems like DMX was about to fall off. The Grand Champ is a great comeback album. My favorite songs were the \\"untouchables\\", \\"shot down\\" featuring 50 cent and Styles P. and \\"YO KATO\\". The best album was \\"Then There ws X\\" from my opinion. This album is definately worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"DMX is the true Grand Champ!!!!","review":"X is out with his 5th professional victory, or should I say slaughter?

As you read you feel and see William S. Burroughs' hallucinations. You feel his desparation as he and his friends frantically search for a fix. Books that make me feel something I've never felt before really impress me. William S. Burroughs was a great writer because he had the ability to do that to many people who received his writings and his ideas with open minds. Junky is so real, yet so unreal at the same time. It floats between the two and once in a while touches down to reality to \\"snap you out of it.\\" Junky makes you realize just how serious and involved heroin addiction really is. Sometimes there's not even a way out. It seems kind of like purgatory in a sense. You're held in limbo waiting for your next fix.\\"Junk is not, like alcohol or weed, a means to increased enjoyment of life. Junk is not a kick. It is a way of life.\\" Junky, William S. Burroughs"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great captivating first hand account of drug addiction","review":"This book gives a very graphic portrayal of the Junky's life,told from first hand knowledge. It starts with the use of 'M' (Morphine)rapidly being replaced with the new drug of choice for Burroughs, 'H' (Heroin)It gives a very realistic and harrowing description of the Junk Sickness,felt by all Junkies trying to break the habit. This book also gives a great insight of the socalled Cure programs and how they fail to 'Cure' the craving for \\"Junk\\".A must read for any Burroughs fan, and any person such as I,that wantsto find out what exactly drives a human being to self destruction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting and Excellent early Burroughs","review":"This is one of my favorite works by William S. Burroughs; I have read it twice and probably will again. The hardboiled, Celine-influenced writing style suits the subject matter perfectly. There are some shocking episodes here, and no punches are pulled. Unlike much of WSB's later work, this one has an easy-to-follow narrative, and therefore might be a misleading introduction to Burroughs. If you enjoyed \\"Naked Lunch\\" though, take a step back and read this; you'll really enjoy it. This edition gives the complete novel, sans any censorship which marred the early (pre-1976) printings."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nasty Fix","review":"William S. Burroughs looked for America through an angry fix and apparently found it. His first novel is filled with beat-poet anachronisms and more. It is a diary of an unrepentant soul gone south into the depths of Hell.My Review: Shocking, violent, beautiful and unhinged, \\"Junky\\" is the ultimate 50's beat-poet statement of rage, guilt, addiction and damnation-- worthy of Dante's \\"Inferno\\"..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Junky and the pauper","review":"Junky was a very provocative text.

The music is jazzy, rythmic and fast, all of which was uncommon in the more stately electronic music of that time. Compare this with Switched-On Bach (I and II) or with Tangerine Dream, and you'll see that Powell's music has a driven American sound to it.The ARP syths are not used to create electronic soundscapes like Tangerine Dream, or to transcribe classical music, which makes the portentiously-named pieces like \\"Ictus: The Primordial Pulse\\" age well. These are mediatation pieces, but living, pulsing music.Powell's album stands alone for these reasons. I paid $75.00 for the vinyl on EBay about a month before this CD release came out, and the mix and mastering are excellent, capturing and enhancing Powell's music without sounding too digitally harsh."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best electronic music albums ever","review":"I understand that Roger Powell transcribed a jazz composition college project for performance on ARP sythesizers on this.

Also, if your nozzle tip threads on your hose are distorted, the bottle might not seat properly and could leak. Try it with a new hose, follow instructions and I think you will have better luck. Please don't stop making this stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bayer Complete Insect Killer","review":"I don't know yet how well this product works but using the Ready-to-Spray bottle will get more insect killer on you than the lawn. The female hose adapter leaks at both ends. Changing out the washer or adding a second one does not help. As a matter of fact, tightening the hose connection will just make it eventually pop off. I poured the contents into an Ortho lawn sprayer to get the job done. This cheap bottle only pollutes the environment; they should quit making them.tds"},{"rating":"1","title":"Will never buy again","review":"As another reviewer noted, the spraying mechanism is absolutely worthless. It took me well over an hour to spray most of my tiny yard. (I say most because I just gave up.) The hose attachment popped off no less than 12 times. It cannot be reconnected while water is flowing, so be prepared to walk back to the faucet over and over and over again. The sharp plastic drew blood from my wet, poison covered hands at least twice while I struggled to pop it back on. The adjustment mechanism and spray shield both broke midway through use. After becoming frustrated, I once forgot to fully close the flow valve while walking back to the faucet - queue a face-full of insecticide. Since the warning labels were soaking wet, I couldn't even read how dangerous the chemicals were. I decided to take a \\"cold shower\\" in the yard to dilute what was on my skin. After all, there wasn't much dry clothing left on my anyways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tim Janis Does It Again!","review":"I have been following the works of Tim Janis for several years and am blown away by the beauty of his music. This compilation by various artists fills one's soul by the depth and beauty of the music. Yes, it sounds like great music for movie soundtracks, but everytime I play it for others who have not heard Tim Janis' music, they immediately want a copy! It's THAT good. FYI: Call your local PBS station for information about the upcoming special, \\"Tim Janis Live From Lincoln Center\\" which has all of the music from this CD performed with the NY Symphony. I was fortunate to be in the audience for this fabulous performance. Don't miss it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice recording...","review":"I bought this because the NYPO and LSO are two of my favorite orchestras and they play some unusual repertoire on this disc. The modern sound is of concert hall quality. We are treated to two ambitious orchestral works by pop rockers Paul McCartney and Billy Joel. Both works convey optimisim and a sense of contentment. Very nice sound frescoes! American composer/conductor, Tim Janis fleshes out the program with inspirational works of his own. Andre Previn and Emanuel Ax's contibutions are mainly charitable fill. The proceeds for this recording go to the American Cancer Society. A most noble cause! \\"Amazing Grace\\" with the LSO and Ray Charles as soloist is a touching momento of Ray. However his aging fragile voice is all but drowned out by songs end. No program notes to add insight, tell me the producers weren't very dedicated.

I think it's probably because of the use of low-resolution textures in the game.Overall: If you like this type of game you'll like this game. If you like Zelda you will love this game.

They make you half to think so you can't just go around and go straight to the boss or anything in a temple. First you start out in a village and I thjink it's a little bouring at first but then it get's REALLY fun. It has a very good story line.

You will fish, heard cattle, fight with your sword, use your slingshot, and boomerang. This game attracts a broad audience of users.

You could literally be stuck for hours trying to catch one fish. I've tried various methods and none really seem to help. You just either catch it or you'll get frustrated and give up. Also there is a major glitch in the game where if you save in a particular area you are pretty much done. I've not seen any tips for getting out of it.

If she had chosen to sell herself out for Mercedes, Toyota or Volkswagen I could at least give her credit for backing a decent automobile...but CHRYSLER?!?! Ugh! Cause I know the first thing that pops into my mind when I think of Sebring is Celine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not buy her CD~~~~~","review":"I must admit, I detest Celine Dion, I have never cared for her voice. I think she's the most overrated singer on earth. I hate the way she must always have the spotlight - the wedding/circus in Vegas, the magazine covers with baby, the television commercials and specials, the billion $ house with monitors everywhere, a helicopter pad (unreal), nannies, housekeepers, cooks, a BUTLER!! - all this even after claiming that she was retiring.I think that she's materialist and narcissistic. So my score for her CD is a big zero. Tho I was forced to put some score there, I still give her a zero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst enginered album ever?","review":"This is the worst overly compressed, lifeless, grainy-sounding CD I hve ever heard. It must be \\"water-marked\\" so computer geeks can't copy it.You could not have compressed the audio any more if you put it in a Craftsman Vise. This was my first Celine purchase. It will be my last. It is too bad as she does have a nice voice, but she had better get some new engineers quick.I guess if most of her fans listen on boom boxes, car stereos, or mini-systems with MP3 compression they would never know the difference. I have a $10K audio system. ...Jim Tavegia"},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry.. this is crap","review":"I'm a really big fan of Celine, who buys every album of hers that comes out for the last years. I'm truly sorry to admit that this album SUCKS big time. You want to hear the real Celine Dion? Try S'il Suffisait D'Aimer or Falling Into You. This album is a great disappointment, commercialized and overly sappy. Too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best voice, but not her best album...","review":"It is clear that this is a singer who has strived and has worked hard for a true deserved recognition as an incredible singer. Nevertheless, as a true Celine fan, I have to admit this is not one of her best works. It cannot be compared to the spectacular \\" Falling into you\\" and the quality of \\" Let's talk about love\\", which are past albums. Even though it's evident that she put a tremendous effort into this album (as she always does), I can't encourage you, with all my knowledge of her work, to buy this CD. Sure, there are some songs that are catchy and have her great, powerful voice on them, but, I still think that this album does not live up to the grandeur and quality expected by the world and seen on her past albums. In overall, I'm really sorry to say that this record, along with \\"A new day has come\\", have not been Celine's best.But no matter what she sings, Celine is, and always will be the best singer of all time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One beat shall insite you...","review":"Being a Dion fan and having attended one of her concerts (Let's talk about love) this album keeps getting better as I keep listening to it. I should start by saying that her voice, in some tracks, is almost completly different but refreshing. As many fans would agree, you can track her growth and maturity in the business as you look back into her carer and previews albums. There are some tracks I skip forward but the ones I can listen to over and over are \\"One heart, \\"Faith\\", \\"Coulda woulda shoulda\\", \\"Forget me not\\" and the first single out. Like other listeners and fans, I thought the repetion of songs previously on \\"A new day\\" were not needed and \\"Sorry for love\\" is much better as a dance song. All and all Celine will remain my favorite female artist and like the song, I will \\"forget her not\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"my review","review":"I read the reviews and I cry over the fact that some people have actually belived them enough to buy the album. If you thought \\"A New Day Has Come\\" was a poor release, reduce its quality by about 50% and you get this album. The days of excellent radio-friendly chart-driven singles have long since gone from Celines days. With forgettable over-produced songs like \\"I Drove All Night\\", I encourage Celine to get back to the style of music that made her huge. Gone are the songs that sound like her hits \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" & \\"That's The Way It Is\\". In are the hits that are reminessent of recent releases by Britney Spears and the Backstreet Boys. Maybe i am over-exagerating a little, but One Heart is an album that was only released to get the Celine hype up just a little for her new Caesars Tour. Save your money and wait for a real Celine album to release into stores after the tour ends, which will be a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"I enjoyed all the songs on this cd. Some songs sounded familiar, but the way they flowed with the rest of the songs on this cd. It just came out perfect. I can't wait to check out her show in Las Vegas. I think since this cd and all her other best hits. The concerts would be great. I won't make a list of songs I like because they are all great! Check this cd out, Heck even go buy it! You don't even have to listen to samples. It's that good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better than \\"A New Day Has Come\\"","review":"I'm a big Celine Dion fan and I just got her lastest CD, \\"One Heart\\" today.I have all her CD's and this one is better than \\"A New Day\\".I really like the songs \\"In His Touch\\" and \\"Coulda Woulda Shoulda\\".I listen to them the whole day long.The rest of the songs are good to listen too.This is a must-have CD for all Celine Dion fans!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best in Voice","review":"I am a fan--have been for a long time.This album is better than A NEW DAY.

Great from track 1 to track 13. Edgy, new, cool. Best in voice, Celine. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Heart","review":"This is truly a welcome comeback for that lady with the wonderful voice!I was slightly disappointed with A New Day Has COme - I was afraid that CDion would go the same way as other artists in her field would go in a desperate chance to reinvent (eg Mariah Carey, Whitney houston), but Celine has made a fantastic CD; no power ballads really, but the album has a sort of umph! Songs such as I drove ALl Night will definitely help her get recognised for other things, but let's hope that Celine sticks to what she is really about......those everlasting ballad songs!!!Well done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I felt this was a thrown together album. I was and am sorry I purchased it. I have always been and will continue to be an ardent fan of her magnificent voice and style. This album of songs made her sound ordinary. If this had been her first album no one would of recognized how truly gifted she is. I wish she would do an album of old songs from the 40's. I can her melodic voice singing songs such as, As Time Goes By, My Man, and any Burt Bachrach compositions. She is most certainly blessed with a rare talent,and look forward to new albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"The only good track on the album is \\"I Drove All Night\\". The rest is simply bland. Celine is so predictable and boring, why can't she do something interesting and fresh???"},{"rating":"1","title":"C��line goes Backstreetboys!","review":"One Heart? Adult Contemporary sound packed with synthesized vocals, some not really exciting acoustic guitar accords wrapped in meaning- aka soulless lyrics produced by a Swedish producer team that is stuck back in the times of ABBA. In one word: boring ; and reminds me why I still prefer to listen to her in French."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Heart","review":"This certainly was a major disappointment. I have always loved every song she has ever sung. What happened? I am not alone. Everyone I have discussed this with agrees. Something terrible has happened with her music. She has such a great voice when singing her ballads. She is right up there with Babs. She's sinking fast with the new producer. Bring back David Foster! These other guys are good, but not for her. Her special voice and talents are being neglected. There's nothing better than David Foster producing her songs as he knows how to bring out the best in her."},{"rating":"1","title":"DID SHE REALLY THINK WE WOULD BE SO STUPID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"CELINE DION.\\"ONE HEART\\".

DID SHE THINK HER FANS WOULD BE SO STUPID AS TO BELIEVE THIS IS NEW MUSIC. THIS WILL COST HER MORE THAN SHE CAN IMAGINE. AT LEAST BE HONEST WITH YOUR FANS. SAY THIS IS PARTIALLY NEW MUSIC. SEVEN TRACKS FROM ONE HEART HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY RELEASED OVER THE YEARS. I WILL ALWAYS LOVE CELINES MUSIC AS WELL AS HER VOICE. BUT I DON'T THINK I WILL EVER BE A BIG FAN AGAIN.

So I returned the disc stating that it had a defect. Well, it turns out that this 'defect' is also disappointingly apparent on the replacement disc. I am surprised that no other reviewer has mentioned this.At 3' 24\\" into \\"I Drove...\\" there is a very irritating pause, however brief. I love the song but this pause is extremely annoying at best. In my opinion it nearly completely ruins this great song.I find the rest of the songs to be mediocre. This is not one of Celine's best offerings. 'One Heart' is good and the new version of 'Sorry for Love' is probably my fave on the disc, but the original version was much better.As a Celine Dion fan, I am disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"One heart, celine dion","review":"To be honest. I am a big fan of Celine Dion. QUite disappointed with her newest album, One Heart.. which is way beyond my expectation after her fantastic album (New day has come).The beat or the music was so boring.. it doesn't come along with her voice.. and her voice was not too great in this CD in the concept of her voice potential she has.Only 2 songs I like from her album. It's not so creative album, and having 2 old songs from her old album made me think that Celine was not really ready to issue a new album, which is understanding for the time distance between her previous album and this album.Barbary Streisand album is way better than her newest album."},{"rating":"2","title":"her heart is good!!!","review":"i went to go and get this cd and i expected more from her. although this album is good the best tracks are:i drove all night- upbeat song, as always her voice shinesone heartstand by youre sidei know what love isforget me not -i love the orchestraoverall i really enjoy this album Celine is a pure DIVA"},{"rating":"2","title":"POP DION","review":"I have to admit that in the past I purchased Dion's Falling into you but I didn't like it very much;\\"One heart\\" instead is much better;positive and catchy songs performed with incredible passion.\\"In his touch\\"is so beautiful that I cannot find words to describe it,\\"Faith\\",\\"One heart\\",\\"reveal\\" and \\"Coulda woulda shoulda\\"are perfect pop songs and \\"I know what love is\\" is simply moving.It's a perfect summer cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"This album is nice, but not like \\"All the way\\" or \\"Let's talk about love\\", but it's not Celine's fault: she is trying to escort this age music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Celine Dion has done it again","review":"Celine Dion has done it again, she have made a CD that all her fans love, there are many beautiful songs one the CD, the song that i love most is one heart, because its a very touching song and i just love the song.i really love this cd and i hope that you love the cd to.buy the cd its worth the money, hi from Stephanie (:=Ps. be nice and think peace =:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Celine has once again reinvented herself with her latest album \\"One Heart.\\" Let me be the first to say that it is one heck of an album filled with power ballads and contemporary pop favourites that will inspire anyone.Get this album Now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Celine, please don't throw your talent away !","review":"We've wasted Whitney, then we've wasted Mariah and now (confirming the trend of \\"A New Day Has Come\\") also Celine is leaving us...They call it \\"updating the sound\\": maybe is a shorthand for \\"no ideas, poor arrangements, plastic music, follow-the-market-wherever-it-goes\\". Something can be saved in this album (basically a couple of ballads), but if you hope to find the GREAT voice of Celine, the voice that you loved to hear from \\"Unison\\" to \\"Let's Talk About Love\\"...well, you must be very patient and selective between all the electronic mess and special effects and programming filling \\"One Heart\\" (Heart ? Which \\"heart\\" ?) up to the core.Celine, you are probably the greatest voice talent alive: after 100 million albums sold, do you really NEED to record something like \\"One Heart\\" ? 2 stars, only because somewhere, for few minutes, something reminded me what could be a CD by Celine Dion."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I was so excited to hear of the new release. But, sadly, am very disappointed. I think she has sold out in trying to compete with the younger crowd, namely Britney. She is better than this and should sing to her own drummer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recording Quality Problems","review":"Buyers beware! The recording quality of this CD is really bad. When I was listening to 4th track, I thought I was listening to an old LP. I also had to adjust bass and treble controls for every song because each one's levels were recorded so differently. I even exchanged my first copy with another thinking that I might have gotten a defective CD, but the second one had the same problems.Even I liked the content of this CD, I couldn't enjoy it as the quality had left a lot to be desired.Last but not least, I am surprised not many people mentioned the quality problem. Could the store where I bought it have had a bad batch?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Celine","review":"This cd is pure Celine....done in the spirit of \\"The Color of My Love,\\" and \\"Falling Into You\\"...the songs alternate between slow and up tempo, making for a great collection of pop hits. Celine has her grove back with the cd, making it a more enjoyable and cohesive listen than \\"A New Day Has Come.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"More money, Celine?","review":"There are a few songs on here that are good. I love \\"I Drove All Night\\". It was why I bought the CD. But the rest are mediocre at best. And reusing songs from your last CD!?!? It reeks of \\"give me all your money and I'll placate you with whatever I have in my junk drawer\\". Don't get me wrong - Celine is a phenomenal performer and I love most of her stuff. But this CD was thrown together with mostly leftovers and repeats. Save yourself the money. Pay to download the two or three good songs and skip the garbage on the rest. This is my least played CD I have bought from her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Celine's Most Commercial Effort - But It's Still Great Music","review":"After I opened the CD case, I immediately realized that this is going to be a very, very commerical product - something that I didn't expect to be done so explicitly/shamelessly by someone like Celine Dion. The Celine Dion perfume sample was off-putting, and the Chrysler logo too. Listening to the music though, the story gets better. While some of the songs are definitely B.S. (Britney Spears), they're done by a real singer with an awesome voice, and they're catchy and nice to listen to, so no complaints there whatsoever. Two songs though were from Celine's last CD - why they're there, I can't quite figure out except to fill up an album. The rest of the album were a couple of ballads - decent, good-old Celine style. I'd say the CD on the whole has some pretty good music - just try not to think of it as a promo piece for her Vegas show which is hard to do given the way it's packaged (literally and figuratively)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different Celine","review":"While I truely love her ballads the most, this CD has it all. Once again she shows the listener the remarkable range and versatility of her amazing voice. In His Touch is my favorite along with I Drove All Night, Coulda Woulda Shoulda and the beautiful Have You Ever Been In Love. Comparing her to Britney Spears is an outrage. Have you people really listened to Britney. Not only can she not sing, she shouldn't be mentioned in the same sentence with Celine Dion. I'm going to see Celine in Las Vegas in June 2003 and can't wait to hear it all live."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll ALWAYS stand by Celine's side.","review":"I have been a Celine fan for over 10 years now,and my opinion of her has never changed....she has the best voice ever.But I'm not going to be biased about this cd.It is not her best effort...I don't feel her vocals are as strong as her previous albums which is a shame as she should be showing the world how amazing she is,however she shows she can use her lower range to her advantage.I'm pleased she chose to do a few up tempo songs...the woman can sing ANYTHING! I would have liked to have seen all new tracks instead of the two remixes.Celine is such an amazing talented singer that she shouldn't have to \\"prove herself\\" or try to impress by doing Britney-like songs.Celine you stand on your own,up there at the very top.I hope Celine will go on forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't praise this music enough!!","review":"WOW! WOW! WOW! This is such an incredible piece of work. I sure hope she is nominated for a GRAMMY For this album. She was overlooked for \\"A New Day Has Come\\", but this album is much better. If you have never bought a Celine CD... you need to buy this one!! Every single song could be a single off of this album, but the song \\"Naked\\" is my favorite. Almost every I know who has heard this album has thought it was her best. GOOD JOB CELINE!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh & Infectious","review":"As standard with most albums, the first and the last track tend to represent the heart of the album, or at least the best of the album; One Heart complies perfectly. The tracks \\"I Drove All Night\\" and \\"Je T'Aime Encore\\" perfectly capture the essence of this album: they are fresh, different, and strong. With extensive listening, to me, \\"Je T'Aime Encore\\" is the strongest track; it simply sounds better with each listening.As a whole, One Heart follows the lead of the opening and closing tracks fairly well. I think \\"In His Touch,\\" \\"Stand by Your Side,\\" and \\"Reveal\\" follow suit most closely. Bottom line: this album is infectious; you will enjoy listening to the songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!","review":"This album is so mind-numbingly good, I want to go out and buy a Chrysler. Any kind of Chrysler, just so long as it has a really good Bose brand stereo system so I can listen to my Celine Dion CD (my CD CD!) as I \\"Droved All Night!\\" I hear that if you mention this album, you can get a very attractive financing package from Chrylser: They even throw in an options package that includes a great 8-speaker Bose brand stereo and a big three-color tattoo of the Chrylser logo!All in all, I give this album 6 out of 7 possible stars. Aerosmith's latest sounds just a little better when played over the Cambridge Soundworks system in a Dodge pickup. You should buy a Dodge instead.You go, Celine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lifeless pop","review":"She has a tremendous vocal instrument -- then why is she filtered, echoed and manipulated to sound as cold and lifeless as any other calculated pop recording? Whether riding production that mimics Cher's last 2 albums, or sounding undistinquishable from Shania Twain or Britney Spears -- Dion only rises above the mediocrity with her acceptable cover of \\"I Drove All Night\\" and the lovely dramatic ballad \\"Have You Ever Been In Love,\\" which turns out to be from her previous album, which I haven't heard. Otherwise, this new set sounds like a pop record made by machines, rather than humans. A shame since Dion is one of the few current pop stars with a real voice. It's called \\"One Heart\\" but it has almost zero emotion. Ironic, and a big dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed Celine fan","review":"Celine is one of my favorite singers of all time. Yet I was extremely disappointed with this CD.

Yes she squealed through it, but it's a Roy Orbison song. Second, who says that there has to be POWER BALLADS on this CD. It's a great CD. It's light, it's catchy and it's different. Celine doesn't always have to be the DIVA. Why can't she sing songs that make her HAPPY??? No, it's not the most eloquent piece of work she's ever done, but it's certainly a good CD. I like it a lot and I've been a Celine watcher long before her English albums. I don't agree that it's a step in the \\"wrong\\" direction. I think she's a happy woman and she wants to sing like she is! She's reinventing DIVADOM!!I like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good from start to end!","review":"This CD is very very good. It has become my favorite CD in my collection. I have very few CD's that I enjoy from beginning to end, and this is one of them. Every song on this CD is very addicting. This CD does show a change in Celine's style of music, but it is very very good. It would probably be considered more pop than most of her albums, but that doesn't mean it is not good. I would definitely recommend people to give this CD a try. I have a feeling most will enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Gold!","review":"This is a very very good CD. I don't think Celine could have put together a better album. This CD is full of surprises (good ones) and captivates you from beginning to end.

Well, the wait is now over and I couldn't be more disappointed. Let's start with the show: It's a Celine concert but the problem is that the stage is so large she looks like an ant. Dragone (Cirque du Soleil) directed the show but it is in no way Cirque like which it was promoted to be. The best songs that Celine sings during the show are not even hers. She does great renditions of Etta James, Peggy Lee, and Sinatra.... The CD starts of great with \\"I drove all night\\" but it is down hill from there. Dare I say that Celine sounds more like Britney Spears than vintage Celine."},{"rating":"1","title":"A wasted gift.","review":"Celine's voice mixed with electronic effects and Britneyspearish tunes??!!

Simply Hilarious! And she over exagerates her voice, she screams, too much, and acts like she has to prove something to everyone. She's self centered, cocky ever since her Vegas deal, and is really one of the ugliest female singers i have ever seen. She is not even pretty...she's straight ugly! When she screams, it's like, skip the song. The next song starts with her screaming, so you skip that one too! Sorry Celine, you're ight, but you need a lesson or two on how to control your voice, and you need to learn how to write your own music, oops, i guess not everyone can be like mariah, but oh well.

One Heart, stylistically, has more of a pure pop sound than any other record by Celine. While there still remain some slower songs that are more like her usual style, this record seems to take its cue from previously recorded songs like Rain, Tax and Sorry For Love. The latter song is featured on this record as the 2003 version; however the original is still better. Highlights include I Drove All Night, One Heart, In His Touch, and J'Taime Encore. Overall, while it is different, One Heart is a good record that marks a new direction for Celine Dion, perhaps the best vocalist in music today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diva LasVegas","review":"I bought the cd today and Celine has once again out did herself.I never get tired of listening to her and I admire her morales.Take time and indulge yourself and loose yourself in this gifted artist who has a loyal fan following despite what critics say.She is the best"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripped-Off In A Cell","review":"Don't purchase this dvd.

I bought it for my kids, but found it a great read for myself and a great resource for helping my children feel good about themselves and easing the pressure they often feel from their peers. It tells you not only how to take responsibility for your feelings, needs, and behaviors, it explains why that's important. A great find. Our whole family will benefit from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Homework","review":"I loaned this book out to my elementary school students to read, especially the students who were being bullied.

I could see the break down in the glove's ability to be waterproof. However I bought these gloves to keep my hands dry, waterproof, and warm. These gloves failed in the warm category. When the glove's got wet and started retaining water my hands got cold this happened about 30 min's into snow removal. The work part of the gloves has held up for being tough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too big, too bulky, too much money","review":"The glove isn't very flexible and is hard to move in.

He has a great capacity for work , and his work on Post-War Europe is remarkable in scope. At the same time he is a two- bit ideologue whose anti- Americanism and anti-Zionism put him in the Noam Chomsky camp. His immoral attacks on Israel are part of his general misperception of the general world situation, and minimizing of the radical- Islamic threat to the West.He is an outstanding example of the truth that tremendous intelligence does not guarantee basic decency."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing","review":"This was the first Dorothy L. Sayers books I read and it took me FOREVER to read it. Not that it's a long book, it's just extremely confusing. One of the things I like about mysteries is trying to figure out whodunit, and with this book that was practically impossible. One of the other reviewers used the phrase \\"incessant clutter\\" and I have to agree with them.On the other hand, the idea was good. An artist dies, and six people absolutely hate him. Five are red herrings. Also, Wimsey is a rather likeable character, so I give it two stars. Definitely not my favorite mystery book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like a written math problem","review":"Though I am a huge fan of the Lord Peter series, this novel lacks the witty dialogue that provides so much of the charm in her work. This is full of time tables, bus schedules, and far to little of Lord Peter's perspective. I suppose most popular writers occasionally publish an uninspired lemon to meet a deadline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vacation with Murder","review":"Step back in time with THE FIVE RED HERRINGS. Dorothy L. Sayers moves Lord Peter Wimsey to Scotland for a fishing vacation in a colony of artists who have an eye for detail, which Miss Sayers exploits.Campbell has a tendency to badger and fight at the drop of a hat, which Lord Peter witnesses on a visit to the local pub. Campbell is discovered death at the bottom of a ravine with an unfinished canvas still wet on its easel above the body.Was his death an accident or was it murder? Lord Peter assists the police to bring the mystery home with great attention to the details in each the alibis of the six suspects who have reason to celebrate Campbell's demise.

Any Monty Python fan can tell you that one of their great sketches deals with a murder mystery that was entirely based on train schedules. I remember thinking when I saw that,\\"How silly.\\" Well, that's a whole section of this mystery,an actual train time schedule makes an appearance as a way proving whether or not one of the suspects could have committed the crime in question. The death of an artist brings about a variety of possible of solutions and killers each with ridiculous alibis and page after page is spent disproving them only finding another dead end.

Although small (175 pages) it provides very detailed and specific recommendations.Not all of the 142 secrets are earth-shattering, but there's more than 100 valuable ideas. The four authors compliment each other nicely. If I were to advise them before publishing I would have wanted only to read Bernard Zick's recommendations because he's such a whiz on marketing in this area. But surprisingly, I found the other authors to add significantly to the focus of the book as they had to face how to market themselves in their specialties.This is a book that you will want to review at least annually, perhaps as you plan the next years activities.

It has great energy and a very rock feel though D.O.A. is a ''hardcore'' band. This record makes you want to dance and thrash, though that sliver of ''They saved hitlers brain'' drives me crazy every time I hear it!

I have many blues CD's and I have listened to numerous blues recordings but the songs on this album are really special to me. Paul Rishell's guitar & lyrics combined with great harp from Annie Raines makes for some of the best country blues I have heard in a long time. I understand that they have another CD coming out soon. I can hardly wait to get my hands on it. Keep up the good work and keep them coming."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Want you to know","review":"Paul and Annie have made their best album together yet! Paul has a masterfull command of the blues that was evident even when we were growing up as kids and playing in bands in the Connecticut area in the mid sixties. I had the pleasure of jamming with Paul and Annie a few years ago at my home and her harp playing even then was the best I had heard and given her young age, was downright scarey! Now as evident on this latest release she has developed into a full blown harp monster! Together, Paul and Annie who share the lead vocal spots, along with Annie's harmonica and Pauls masterful blues guitar playing will give any blues lover a rare treat indeed.

Randy Savage is a top 5 wrestler of all time, and gets no respect by the makers of this dvd. Not one interview was done with Randy Savage, or any past or present wrestlers. I am done watching wwe. I am done buying any wwe products. As a life long wrestling fan I will only watch TNA. WWE has turned there back on all there older fans.

Yes there are a ton of matches but I wanted the Randy Savage story. This gives you absolutley nothing other than matches we can pretty much get anywhere. To have Matt Striker and Maria do the commentary on this DVD is an insult and a joke. This is easily the worst WWF/WWE dvd I have seen. To do this right they needed a sit down with Savage and interview other guys he wrestled with to give you a story, a little behind the scenes details. I wont be happy until they give us a DVD about Savage with some substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO DOCUMENTARY?!?!","review":"This is a great collection of matches but is lacking a documentary! When I bought this I was looking forward to hearing stories from Savage himself, but Macho doesn't even make an appearance as his current self. Also, the co-host are AWFUL! I wish this were more like the Dusty Rhodes DVD set with Savage himself doing most of the talking."},{"rating":"2","title":"For over 1 decade","review":"For over 1 decade Randy Savage was the man to watch. In some ways I was expecting more from this 3-disc DVD. The entire episode of 'Macho Man' and his alliance with Zeus is not featured. This was a very entertaining segment of the Macho Man with Zeus vs Hulk Hogan and Brutus \\"the Barber' Beefcake. [including a cage match].Yes, to everyones surprise Randy Savage decided to choose Ms Elizabeth as his manager, a move even the great Vince McMahon couldn't conjure up. From there his entire life in the WWF/WWE was worth watching!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I was very exited when I heard the WWE was finally going to release a Macho Man DVD. I had the release date on my calendar and bought it the day it came out. Wow...what a disappointment. No story at all, no interviews with Randy Savage or any other wrestlers. The commentary by Maria and Striker is horrible, and in my opinion is an insult. The set looks like something a high school kid would put together in his basement. The collection of matches is the only reason I gave my rating one star. However, I don't buy these DVD's for the matches; I buy them for the documentary of the wrestler's life and the interviews. For example, Curt Henning, Bret Hart, both were well done. I would not recommend this unless the buyer is simply looking for a collection of matches."},{"rating":"2","title":"oooohhh yeah!!!!","review":"I was very pleased with the match selection.The win to loss ratio is very good.The losses are important to his career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been a LOT better","review":"I enjoyed watching the matches and they made me feel 15 again so that was fun. But who arranged this DVD? The special features are going all over the place and in no particular order. Why not just run it all together? And why was the meeting of the Madness and the Mania simply glossed over? Holy Cow! Vince McMahon declared we were witnessing one of the greatest moments in the annals of sports history and it was barely touched on when the entire match should have been shown. In short, I like the matches but very disappointing otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Macho Madness","review":"Great Matches. Great Stories. Great DVD.

I would buy from this seller again."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT STORIES - HISTORICAL EPIC","review":"This book has been made into a movie mini-series, but even if you have seen the series this book is well worth reading. Some people disagree vehemently, but I appreciate all the stories within the story and Mr. Michener's great attention to the details. He starts with the land itself and takes the reader through the present day by creating a cast of characters that weave into the next, perhaps like the baskets the Indians made. I have been fascinated with the West and this book only added to it. One of Mr. Michener's greatest works."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Thoughts on Centennial","review":"The works of James A. Michener have always fascinated me and \\"Centennial\\" did not disappoint me. The research the author does goes a long way in improving my knowledge of different parts of the world. In this case I feel that I have an in depth knowledge of Colorado, its history and its people.From this book I gain a wonderful appreciation of the early American pioneers, the difficulties they encountered and the great loneliness they must have felt at times. Just towards the end of the book I was disappointed to read of the disregard of some of the present day inhabitants of the wildlife and the environment of this wonderful state.James Hughes"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Put Down","review":"For me, other than The Source (see my review), this is Michener's other standout work.

This isn't a novel, which in my mind should have memorable characters and an interesting plot; rather, it's a sort of history book-lite written on a Reader's Digest level that never really grabs you. My fellow 2-star reviewers have laid it out pretty well, so I won't rehash. This is just boring, even horrible, reading. I guess it just goes to show that a \\"runaway best seller\\" doesn't necessarily have to have any actual literary value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly Boring","review":"I read the Source and loved it and bought almost every Michener book written. This book made me regret that rash decision. The storyline is not nearly as interesting nor as awe inspiring. Even worse I do not care about sheep ranching or irrigation, and certainly not as much as this book requires. I felt like I was reading a science text book and not a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly dull book","review":"...I gave this book 500 pages and that's enough to condem it.Basically it's the history of Colorado. It starts out in a long explanation of everything that's going to come in the next dozen chapters and then it continues to tell about a dinosaur. The next couple of chapters write about settlers and Indians and none of them are all that exciting. Michener really captures the tedious lifestyle of the Plains settler with nothing to do and that's not a good thing.By the time we get to the sheep farmers vs. the cattle ranchers I just had to put the book down and forget about it. I never came back to it and I don't mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"I re-read this one about every 2 years!","review":"Centennial is one of my two favorite Michner novels (Chesapeake is the other), and have enjoyed reading it multiple times since it was published, also enjoyed the mini-series which came out on DVD I think about a year ago. This novel is more meaningful to me especially, since I attended college in Colorado around the time it was published, and had the oppty to visit some of places in Colorado so aptly described in the book. I just wish more of Michner's books had that same good, turn the page quickly feel like Centennial. I love the way he meshes in the historical story, with a modern sub-plot......and how real some of his western character's feel. I have only one complaint: When will they publish the Kindle edition so i can buy it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Centennial and Colorado","review":"When I read this book, I determined I would someday live in Colorado. It was that good. I read the book over 25 years ago and I will pick it up every once in a while and read parts of it or the whole thing.

IF YOU BELIEVE is a very comical and entertaining Christmas story. The main character is an up-tight professional whose life is going nowhere, until she is confronted by her younger counter-ego, her younger version of herself, who brings about radical change for the good in her life. Her younger version is always hanging around, prodding and poking the heroine in order to get her to remember how she used to be more carefree and fun-loving as a child.

Then it went downhill from there. \\"5 Against the House\\" was a bizarre take on Film Noir, but watching Guy Madison (Wild Bill Hickock) was fun. \\"Murder by Contract\\" - B movie all the way. I'm sure I must have seen this at the drive in sometime in the early 60's. Poor acting. Good golly - the actresses were just AWFUL!

I actually bought the book for my husband, who is into model rocketry and is making his own rocket engines and I thought this book would be informative enough to teach him to make the black powder that goes in them. Well, it is...if you have ten years to wait for everything to cure and get to a point where it's \\"good\\" enough to use for black powder.

The most tedious part of the book in the smallest proportion of gunpowder, sulfur, written in an over technical pseudo type style.

The result is After the Flood, over fifty minutes of music impossible to sit still to. 15 songs, three instrumentals, one of which -- Groove Set -- combines three traditional songs and flows without a pause out of the preceding cut, Everything's Okay. The Flood suite covers four or five cuts in the middle of the CD, but my highlights lie around it -- Better Me, Mercy, Miss You Much, Scarce, and Rest.Like me, you may not have heard of The Clumsy Lovers, but take the plunge into After the Flood.

Jorgensen sells an aluminum base to hold the bar that doesn't work on the Irwin clamps because the back of the clamp part is higher than the Jorgensen base. Irwin shows the clamps sitting in slots cut into a table perpendicular to the bar in place of this but a non-woodworker must have come up with the idea because the part needs to be moved - can't if it's sitting in a slot.

As I expected reading the fine print on the back of the packaging revealed all the evidence I needed \\"Made in China\\". The clutch plates on the fixed assembly side were installed improperly on all clamps with the long tab pointing down, this would not allow the clamp to lay flat on its back causing them to lay over on their side. In addition to that problem some of the holes bored in the floating assembly were out of line causing the floating jaw to jam on the pipe and become difficult to tighten. Irwin should inspect their products more closely especially when they are charging more than the American made Pony clamps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible quality control","review":"The concept behind these pipe clamps is great, but I had exactly the same problem that Dana Vogel did (we're not related). Specifically, the clutch plates on the fixed side were installed upside down so that the long tabs point down. As a result, the clamp cannot lay flat, which completely defeats the entire purpose of these clamps. There is absolutely no excuse for this kind of obvious mistake, and a company with a reputation like Irwin should never, ever have allowed this to happen. The fact that another person here experienced the same problem leads me to believe that Irwin has enormous quality control problems. I will definitely be returning these. I plan to replace them with the similar ones recently released by Rockler even though the Rocker clamps require a threaded pipe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clamps leave a lot to be desired","review":"I purchased five of these clamps expecting the non-threaded attachments would be a great thing. I had two disappointments. First, the lack of threads allow the clamp to twist on the pipe. It is hard to get them tight without using both hands. Secondly, and the most disappointing, is that the movable part of the clamp that should slide up and down the pipe to tighten on the work binds on the pipe more often than not and prevents you from getting good pressure on the item being clamped. I tried wire brushing the pipes thinking that they had rough spots on them but it did not help the situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"it is ok!","review":"The book looks just like the book borrow from senior students.The pen marks are everywhere, but ok to me.It just similar with the newest edition.

It hits straight down the fairway and LONG. We each put a couple bucks on a long drive contest at a par 5 hole at our local course and I killed everyone. No one else even came close to my distance!I have played 3 rounds so far and not any problems or scratches on the clubface. For the money you could not do better than this club.

A really satisfying meal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you think","review":"What nineteen or twenty eight year old sitting in the baraacks doesn't think I could do that. Its what you have been trained for. This book peals away all the candy coating and tells toy the harsh realitys of what happens when you don't have your sovereign government backing you. This should be a manditory read for considering this profession. The cold splash of water that comes with reading this book reveals the cold hard facts. Number one the pay may be nonexistant or very slow in coming. Two know who you work for, reality may not be as you were promised concerning the support you get versus what you were told. The stories of narrow escapes are not as much fun as living them. If that doesn't disswayed you then good luck and God bless.

This book begins with a well-written introduction by Betty Radice, which gives an overview of the story. The letters, written years after the affair, are of great eloquence and depth of thought and feeling. Through them, the couple works to transform their 'earthly love'(which had continued to burn in Heloise's heart) into a spiritual bond that turns out to have similarly great passion and transcendence. Although the letters are steeped in religious debates and intrigues of the time, their beauty makes the love behind them seem as alive today as it was so many centuries ago ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than advertised","review":"The main problem was that the copy was smaller than advertised and the paperback edition I had from the library by the same publisher was larger and therefore had larger type.

Parkway Drive not only possess the awesome bone shattering breakdowns that will get stuck in your head, they also feature a versatile vocalist who doesn't just scream in the same monotone voice for the entire album, as well as clever lyrics that don't just talk about love and girls.

It was the first post-rock album i ever bought, because id read good reviews and i liked the front cover, and it was the best surprise ive ever had from an album.Every song has its on melodic buildup, emotional climax and sense of complacency. And that doesn't mean the songs all sound the same, really its the opposite. The tracks each revolve around a singular melody or feel, and they all are sprawling epics, perfectly played, produced and most of all written.The best songs are: Like the Howling Glory..., Annhilate the Sparrow... and And By Our Hand...The best Post-Rock, and one of the greatest albums ever. 5 Stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for opeative porpuses","review":"Some good comments in C-Suite roles and general purposes for the COO, kind of high level outside point of view, not to develop a job description or specific information.

They are perfect for pretend play, and the figures are all very durable . . .however, they are very small in size, so they aren't for little children. (I think for kids under 7 they may be too frustrating to handle - many of the pieces like the little cups, would be difficult to place on the shelves) These pieces are as tiny as Polly Pocket pieces, if that helps you visualize the size.

This may be a good book for kids or someone just getting started, but since Eckert's book has been republished, I really would point them there first.

In March at the cost of $130 I returned this product. A month later, Amazon did credit me with the original cost. However, no one has accepted reponsibility for the high cost of packing and shipping a bulky product across the country.

Were it possible to give it zero stars, I'd be happy to oblige.Give this one a wide berth in your reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There was some growth...","review":"While there was growth from Ground Zero, Bonnie still needs to work on plot. The plot should be a natural progression of events leading to a conclusion (puzzle pieces make the entire puzzle) and should not be forced (force the pieces together and I bet the picture doesn't look like the one on the box!). The opening event (a shooting) is interesting, but it has nothing to do with the real storyline (earthquake games)! It is only placed there as a convenient way to develop a character and solve internal character conflicts; this conflict would have been better served by more strongly SHOWING the character's actions and not using a psychiatrist to allow the conflict to be TOLD. These stories have wonderful technological concepts and as long as she keeps growing as a writer (and gets over her fixations with food and coffee), I will continue to buy her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I'm a fan of adventure fiction and mysteries, so I'd hoped Earthquake Games would nicely fit the bill. While the premise is interesting (human-made earthquakes), the execution of the story was sadly lacking. Ms. Ramthun seemed to be more interested in pushing her political and social values than in creating an interesting work of fiction.

He also did lots of other cool stuff, including the machine mentioned in this book(altered slightly), and his theories may be responsible for the government sponsored change to digital broadcasting. Ms. Ramthun does not try our patience with such details, but lets the story flow from the possibilities. Her detective spends a small amount of time dramatically exploring some inner terrain whilst stuck in a tent covered with sand...waitng for the bad guys to show up. Anyone who had an uneasy childhood will find a friend here.

You'll wind your way up into a part of Americana steeped in tradition, hairpin curves and high mountains. Smith cleverly peels back the folds of time to reveal a remarkable account of the dulcimer, its interesting characters and music. Scattered throughout the book among the many photos and llustrations are vignettes about the humble people of the mountains, their character and struggles.

None have eclipsed it. Chung softens the edges, Previn hides the beauty. Nagano is good but the orchestra is dull while Wit would have had a great recording had the group been able to play in tune. Seiji beats them hands down. The performance is vigorous and intense and he is not afraid to show the ferocity or the beauty of the piece. The soloists perform well and the young Ozawa brings a youthful touch to recording that is at once refreshing and insightful. The TSO really play well as a group and are not timorous in any way. I have been nursing an LP of this for years and this release is very overdue. I have long wanted to play this in my car or on my iPod and thankfully, now I can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor recording.","review":"While I'm sure this performance was very pleasing, the recording for it is just horrid.

I would strongly recommend purchasing this book to give parents a starting point and strong educated base for nutrition.

This one seems like they are fulfilling a contractual obligation to their publisher. They are WAY too demanding about what you feed your child and don't seem to realize most of us don't have lots of money and help in the kitchen to achieve all the perfect meals they demand. The book was discouraging and unrealistic.I found that a much more useful book is Feeding Your Child for Lifelong Health by Drs. Susan Roberts and M.B. Heyman. This book was written by doctors who specialize in child nutrition and who have scrutinized the literature on nutrients, metabolism, food allergies, etc. Yet the book is realistic and helpful, not guilt inducing like Dr. Sears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent -- but watch the fish recommendations","review":"An excellent book with one exception -- it heartily recommends regular fish consumption, but fails to mention the problem of methyl mercury and/or PCB contamination in several commonly consumed species of fish.

Leva states that you should use the \\"right grade of energy\\", and her sole advice on how to do this is to read someone else's book! There is a completely irrelevant chapter on the history of Star Trek, plus the book is padded with lots of emails between Hemi-Sync fans which are interesting, but should probably be left on a newsgroup server or web site rather than filling out the book.There are some descriptions of the TMI work, but nothing I haven't read elsewhere.

Sticking the bags in a drawer or having them clutter up a cabinet just was not working for me. The only problem has been with the tape. Within one week, the Holder fell off the wall and would not re-adhere. Somehow in that time, I had managed to lose the screws.

This product however, provided an unreliable hold as it did not adhere to the inside of the kitchen cabinet that I attached it to. Initially I thought I did not stick it on hard enough, but tried many times only to see that after a few minutes it continued to produce an unreliable hold. If you don't mind that this product won't stick to your cabinets, then go ahead and purchase it - it's functional otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks Great, Works Great!","review":"My wife used to keep grocery bags in a \\"main\\" grocery bag hanging from a sticky wall hook in the pantery.

Attached it to the wall, and it fell down after a couple of weeks. Re-attached. 2 weeks. Re-attached (using different method). 1 week. This went on for several months until it fell, mortally wounded, by the water heater in my laundry closet. Didn't pick it up until I moved house last month. Ended up in the dump.PS.

Does the trick!","review":"Very pleased with this Simplehuman bag holder. Looks very nice and sleek. Simple to use and have no problems inserting or removing plastic bags. Deducted one star because the adhesive isn't the greatest. It fell down from the wall in the middle of the night and crashed to the floor, causing me to run downstairs expecting to see burglars. But luckily there were no robbers and the item didn't suffer any knicks or dents. Simple & effective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleek & compact","review":"Previously I was using one of those fabric bag things to hold all of my plastic grocery bags. This has adhesive strips on the back so literally all you have to do is peel and stick (it also comes with screws to permanently mount). The adhesive is strong, but I was able to pull it off my cabinet and re-stick (I mounted mine inside my cabinet under my sink - drywall or paint might not be so willing to let the sticky stuff go without doing some sort of damage). Looks really great - hides the mess and looks polished, doesn't swing around when I need to add or remove bags (like the old fabric thing). I would definitely purchase again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegant","review":"This fits nicely inside my cupboard, but it looks so nice I wouldn't mind if it were out in the open.

It stayed on just long enough for me to have recycled the packaging it came in, and so I likely can't return it and get my money back. I tried mounting it on a cabinet door, then once that fell off, to the underside of a cabinet shelf, but it fell off again. Also, it only held 20 bags as opposed to the \\"up to 30\\" as advertised. Only holding 2/3 of the advertised number is not ok with me. Overall, very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"V-E'd to within an inch (mm) of its useful life.","review":"I bought this bag holder because I had other items to buy anyway, and it solves a problem that currently, I simply don't have a weekend to solve myself. While attractive and sized reasonably well, any sturdy box with two holes cut in it will fill this function. For me, with two cats to clean up after, its a touch on the small side, but I'll live with it.However, my inspiration for writing this review came from my experience installing the holder on a wood cabinet door. First, I noticed that the sheet metal used to craft the body is tissue-thin; not a problem for retaining bags, but clearly it can be dented easily. Second, as I hand-tightened the screws (after drilling pilot holes I might add) I accidentally twisted the heads off. That's right, hand-tightening - twisted the heads off the screws. Wood door. This is my first simple human product purchase and it will be my last due to its cheap craftsmanship. C'mon, guys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good design but it didn't work for me","review":"I want to concur with the other comments about problems with this dispenser holding to a surface using adhesive. I think it has something to do with the surface to which it's being attached, the adhesive used, and the fact that you press down when you insert bags and pull out when you remove them.When the supplied double-sided adhesive gave out (after a few weeks) I tried several different brands of double-sided tape. Nothing worked.If I could have used screws then this would be perfect. Unfortunately the doors and sides of my cabinets are too thin for them to work well.If you have some place where you can screw this down then it will be a perfect dispenser. If you will need to depend on adhesive then (as you can see from this and other reviews) some times it will work and some times it won't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breakdown Review","review":"Quality: Better than needed. No complaints here.Usage: The bags can get jammed, but that's usually a sign that you have too many stuffed in.Capacity: The item is a bit small; it only holds about 15-20 bags. However, I can't think of any reason I'd want to hang on to more than that!Mounting: I opted to use screws to attach this device based on other reviews that the sticky tape did not hold. This has worked fine for me.Overview: Don't expect too much from this holder. Use it as nothing more than a stylish, simple, small capacity storage/dispenser for plastic bags and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self adhesive is terrible quality","review":"I mounted this using the self-adhesive strips that are on the holder, and after a couple months I found it had toppled to the floor and the plastic cracked.

Better to buy the $2 one from Ikea!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as rated, Ikea is better","review":"Bought this because of the great general reviews but very disappointed.

This thing falls off the wall constantly, it is hard to stuff bags in and hard to get them out. NO WAY does it hold the amount of bags it says.... after 20 they are in there so tight the thing just flings off the wall from all your PULLING. Plus, you have to hold it down with the other hand which just gets finger prints all over it. I am going to buy one of those simple fabric holders my mom used to have. Those held a ton of bags and it was easy to work it. Just hang the tube from a hook, simple. Save your time and money on this one....unless you are only looking for the \\"Bling bling\\" and could care less about it actually holding bags that you are going to need in the future.

Just stuff the bags in the oblong openning and pull them out of the top - It worked quite well to clean up the space between my counter and refrigerator where I used to store/stuff all my grocery bags~ It comes with two adhesive strips on the back of it so putting it up is very easy - it also comes with a hanger if you want to do it that way - but it is pretty light weight and so are grocery bags so the adhesive strips worked just fine.

This was not one of them. Other than the title and number of children, this bore absolutely no resemblance to either the original with Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball, or the book it was based on (Who Gets the Drumstick? -- Helen Beardsley). The main theme of this movie seemed to be \\"how stupid can we make our parents look\\".

Better save this one for the rental list. It's an okay family movie for the middle age range, but younger kids and older teens won't really want to sit through it.As for grown ups, well, it aint no chick flick, so don't think your doing your babe any favors by taking her to see this, espically if you got a baby sitter or something, cause all the commotion will make you wish you stayed at home. And guys, well, like I mentioned at the start here, I took four kids to the theather to see it, so because of the popcorn and m&m;'s I'm an alright guy, but don't think you're treating anyone to anything special here, it's cliches and silly humor that's been done over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"I was really disappointed in this movie. I didn't expect Russo or Quaid to be a Lucille Ball or Henry Fonda, but beyond the title there is nothing similar to the original movie. No courting, no oatmeal sandwich and where's the \\"ours\\"? Kids were out of control. Russo portrays a very permissive mother -- no discipline, just love, while Quaid is over the top running it like a ship.

It was a waste of money and space in my DVD collection can't even find anyone to give it to!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Corny!!!!","review":"Am not sure how they talked Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo into doing this movie, but the results are truly not worth their time and talent. Quaid is a widower with eight kids whom he fathers in a military fashion (he being an Admiral in the Coast Guard and all.) Russo is a designer who has a more relaxed mode of parenting. They have a chance meeting which rekindles their high school romance and, before even meeting each other's kids they are married (how likely is that?) The resulting blended brood of 18 kids has a lot of conflicts and even a large lighthouse is not big enough to hold all of them. Eventually they decide to band together to break up their mom and dad so that their life can return to the way it was before their parents married. It does not take a rocket scientist to figure out how this all turns out. The script is bad and even the family pet pig can't save this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"great!!!!***!!","review":"I loved the movie ...I went with my friend lily and we loved it when we got back we played it. weird right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Too Over the Top...","review":"I mean seriously...maybe the whole mom with 3 kids and dad with 3 kids colliding as one family worked for the Brady Bunch...but having a mom with 6 kids and a dad with 6 kids colliding as one is just a big, unrealistic circus, not to mention irresponsible!

I'm not a huge fan of \\"Yours, Mine & Ours\\".I mean, the film was cute and all, but way too crammed, and by nature of having 16 kids involved, not a lot of character development, and not an ensemble piece. Plus, there are some rather offensive stereotypes with some of the characters.There are bright moments, and some clever scenes, but this is a bubble gum and popcorn movie -- fun, but ultimately flavorless.I did like Sean Faris, and there's one almost Tom Cruise \\"Taps\\" freeze frame moment with him that surprised me."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Inferior Remake!","review":"I wouldn't consider this a really bad film. But I couldn't fault it for not trying. It did have some potential. The updated story now takes place in New London, Connecticut; not San Francisco. And, there are some adopted kids of all ethnicities, which made perfect sense in this day and age. The problem lies in the one thing that makes all films like this faulter, the screnplay. There are very few laughs aside from trying to make the dad look like a complete imbecile in slapstick moments. Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo struggle to put the film together. All in all, this was a huge disappointment. You're better off with the Lucille Ball/Henry Fonda original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not entirelly bad but not good either","review":"Here's another movie where you watch it thinking it's not good or bad but it could be way better. The film tire's too hard to be like cheaper by the dozen and home alone and alos tries to be really funny but it falls flat on it's face. The moive has some funny moments and the chemestry between Quide and Russo is real. The acting was pretty good but too bad it cant make up for the weak story.

Frank (Dennis Quaid) and Helen (Rene Russo) rekindle a high school romance and marry bringing their two families of 18 total children together. The children have been raise is completely different manors prior to the marriage and they refuse to adjust to their new lifestyle as a family. Children will enjoy watching and laugh at the pranks the kids in the movie play on each other and then on their parents in an effort to break them up. The plot line is predictable but, if you're looking for a movie to watch with kids, then laughs you enjoy as a family more than makes up for the plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nowhere Near the Original","review":"Maybe this movie would have been better had I not seen the original. This one lost so much trying for slapstick comedy instead of family feelings. Little attention was given to the parents falling in love and the bond that they shared. All of a sudden they were married (without telling their kids?) and the rest of the movie was aimed towards ridiculous antics with the children. I kept wondering when the Children's Welfare people were going to come in and take the children. Perhaps leaving them with the drunk babysitter was supposed to be funny, but it was downright scary.Stick with the original on this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...","review":"This is not a good film by any stretch, although I'll admit the stupid comedy amused me at times. But like Cheaper By the Dozen before it, this is pointless, uninspired remake of a classic movie.Dennis Quaid has a reputation of being a good actor who often picks the worst films to appear in and lo and behold, he does it again here. Rene Russo and a few other notable actors get to taint their resumes as well.If there is one thing I really like its Danielle Panabaker. She's just plain cute! I would'nt mind seeing her appear in something good again.Darkhorse86"},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Joyful Recording","review":"Although my instrument is the mountain dulcimer, I love all the others, too, especially the hammered dulcimer.

The unit no longer responds to remote controls while the buttons on the main unit still work. This doesn't really make life easy since there are only 3 buttons on the main unit.I believe this is due to shoddy worksmanship since I've read similar things about the previous model in this line dying after 1 year.

This unit is great for all of you down loaders that get your movies on divx (know what I mean!). This unit is great I hooked up a 750 gig hard drive to the usb port and I have about 90 movies on it. It has the capacity to store approx 600-1000 movies, (if your movies are divx and aprox 750mgs to 1.2gigs depending on the encoder). Anyway, with this set up I have a jukebox of movies that I can wathch at anytime and never have to load or unload a dvd. The movies are very fluid and don't jerk or pause. The only time you will get that jerk and pause action is if the drive needs to be defragmented. Oh yea you have to format the drive fat 32. The unit plays every format that I have thrown at it except one xvid formant (don't ask me why) but I recomend it whole heartedly, for any video enthusiast. Anyway, thanks for listing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price!","review":"This is excellent for the price.

It also has optical audio out so that you can hook it up to your surround system for crisp digital sound. Aside from being a bit long, it is very thin and sleek with a glossy finish.

To my great disappointment the machine clearly has a much inferior video processor to the cheaper, older, 5140.

I time shift almost all of my TV watching using my computer & DVD-RW disks. My old Phillips DVD player was starting to wear out so I started to look for something else. USB seemed to be an option & I almost ordered a \\"Sansa-Take\\" when I found this DVD player. This one plays raw Mpeg 1, Mpeg 2, DivX and Mp3 files on both disk and USB as well as the standard DVD cd player functions. It will not play my \\"ScanDisk Cruser\\" 2 GB thumb drive(There is a lot of imbedded software in the drive), however it plays my other simple USB thumb drives perfectly. As far as upscaling is concerned I am not using that at this time. In short the Phillips DVP5982 does everything that I need it to do & it costs about half what a \\"Sansa-Take\\" does. Amazon shipping was swift & free, Rock On!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"USB is just great.","review":"The USB port is a very nice feature and you can just put some mp3 or video files and play it easily.The remote controller is weird and the buttons seems to be in the wrong position.

Crappy little remote that has the look and feel of something that will get busted if one looks at it sideways. The player itself is not much better in terms of ruggedness and workmanship. As soon as I connected the HDMI cable, I was greeted to a screen that constantly went from on to blank to on again. Tried two other HDMI cables, but the problem persisted. Had to return it to the seller, who fortunately will accept returns. Personally, I'd look to spend a little more and acquire a better model. This unit has the appearance of one that you might be unlucky enough to receive at a $20 gift exchange at Christmas. Steer clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much technology!","review":"I was led to believe that the upscaling feature would produce a better picture but the extreme pixelation when a scene changed from light to dark made watching movies almost unbearable.I just purchased a new Sony progressive scan dvd player and the Phillips will go into the closet to collect dust."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cheaply made dvd player","review":"I will only give it 2 stars.

The remote hardly has any thing other than basic features. Maybe they thought a memory option was cool, but when I take a movie out and then start it again, I do not want the DVD player to remember where I was. Just start the DAMN MOVIE!

I was hopeful to find this product from Olay as I'm a loyal Olay girl. I used this on a dark spot on my cheek. The ad promised a change in 2 weeks maximum. I used it religiously twice a day for 2 months, applying the cream only to the dark spot. I've yet to see any difference on my skin, neither lighter nor darker.. nothing.

I am in my 30's, have fair/medium shade combination skin. I tried using it on various types of spots from a beauty mark to a break-out spot that was healing. I tried using it a couple of times a day, at first blending it in and then even leaving a dollop on the marks while I slept (not blending it into my skin). I tried it for several weeks. No results. This product did nothing for me. I would not recommend it. I would have given it zero start, but Amazon does not allow it.Avon has a product out that touts similar claims to Olay's product.

Because I tanned often when I was in my 20's, I now have some skin discoloration. IPL's and peels have helped tremendously, but haven't erased it all, so I thought maybe a product such as this would lighten those patches over time. I was prepared to have to continue to buy in order to keep the lightened effect.Sad to say, after at least 5 months of diligent everyday (morning and night) use, I can detect no change whatsoever; even a test spot that I had not treated before stayed exactly the same.I really like other Olay products, but I cannot recommend this one to my fair-skinned sisters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Product Improved!","review":"From previous statements about this Olay Regenerist Targeted Tone Enhancer it seems that the product made in the middle of the last decade was imperfect. The flaws must have been addressed because now the package insert is correct - the age spots are diminished and the skin is toned. This is not the same as having cosmetic surgery/treatments in a medical setting, but for those whose problems are minor (small spots, early skin aging) it doe indeed work. One excellent aspect of this product is that it does not plug pores which would lead to comedones. It is worth the investment if the expectations are right. It would seem that the product has been finessed by Olay - they are a company who constantly upgrades their offerings.

It had tasty chunks of beef and mushrooms, and was thoroughly rehydrated at nine minutes. We felt the sauce could have a richer, beefier flavor, but were thoroughly satisfied.

BUT, we ordered from several of these vendors from Amazon and only received 1 meal. The cost of the POSTAGE/AIR FREIGHT was VERY expensive. MORE THAN THE COST OF THE MEAL!!!! Very deceptive!!!! I then had to return the packages at MY OWN COST FOR POSTAGE! I read a review before ordering that said they did not receive the correct amount of meals and did not take heed.

It could use a little more pepper in my opinion, but everyone's pallet is different so don't let that steer you away. I am going to buy more of these soon and include them in my emergency pack.

Every good series that I start I do this. Julian is a Dark-Hunter, and Amanda is witch and a sensitive.I love these characters one is an ageless souless vampire and Amanda comes from a family of witches and it's funny because she wants normalcy in life,but when Julian attacks her thinking that she is Tabitha,her twin sister and handcuffs them together everything goes from bad to worse. I won't say anymore about the story because I think that you have to experience the story, I will only say that once you do read it you will want to read the series and enjoy all of the Dark-Hunters and how they find their true mates.

Fantasy Lover was fresh and funny and sexy. Night Pleasures is clich��d and brings in a confusing range of supernatural beings. In Fantasy Lover, the supernatural beings were Greek gods who punished the male love interest Julian of Macedon. Greek gods get short shrift in fantasy compared to the Celtic mythos, so including them was creative and added interest. The Greek gods are back in Night Pleasures, plus Dark-Hunters (immortal vampire hunters), and the vampires themselves, all milling around in New Orleans. The plot of Night Pleasures parallels that of Fantasy Lover, with practical and single Amanda Devereaux attracted to immortal and cursed Kyrian of Thrace. Will Amanda break the curse and win Kyrian's love?I know Sherrilyn Kenyon's books are hugely popular, so I'm going to try the next one in the series to see if she finds her stride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this!!","review":"This book is amazing!

So I was happy to see the return of the vamps with NP.Kyrian's story was so sad my heart broke for him as he relived his pain through his memories and dreams. I also loved the chemistry between him and Amanda.The book had all the elements for a good read: Romance, action, tragedy, and of course a happy ending! Two thumbs up for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll want your own Dark Hunter!","review":"As a follow-up to Ms. Kenyon's \\"Fantasy Lover\\", NIGHT PLEASURES is still a great stand alone. Here she introduces the first of her Dark Hunters, Kyrian of Thrace. Kenyon has woven a lovely tale combing mythology and modern-day romance.

You'll enjoy it enough to buy her next book. Certainly a keeper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I gave up on page 64 - wasn't interested in what would happen next. Very disappointed as this was my first Sherrilyn Kenyon romance and I expected something great. This book may not be for those wanting more realism to their romance story.

I'll stick with my historical romance novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could choose zero star, I would","review":"This is NOT a vampire story.it's a kind of mixup \\"�� la Xena\\" with silly gods of no interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I missing something?","review":"I'm a fan of romance, but I just don't get the vampire thing here. Aside from not really being able to care about the characters, I failed to sense anything dark enough to be disturbing or erotic enough to be really sexy. The book was mildly entertaining--adequate to break up an 8 hour international flight--but I can't agree with all the rave reviews. Perhaps I've read too many Anne Rice books to switch to vampire romances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What it Could Have Been","review":"I picked up this 2nd book in the Dark Hunter series after reading her first one: Fantasy Lover. The first book was great! This one just isn't. I've read the reviews and am surprised by the high score. I tend to usually agree with the majority of reviews out there.My main reason for disliking this book were the reactions between the characters. It felt like a forced attraction, lacking any genuine feelings. Every other paragraph they're staring longingly at each other on the inside but every external actions happening around them don't match with the internal monologues. Instead of creating depth and conflict, to me, it only rings untrue.It's like the author keeps reminding herself that it's a romance book and therefore it must be time to throw in some romance-type dialogue. Overall, I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"PNR","review":"I Love PNR!! This is no expection!!!! Wonderful story, full of adventure, love and lust!!!! Just juicy!!! Would recommend to anyone who like PNR!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Major letdown.","review":"Like many other reviewers, I went into this book with high hopes. I have a bit of a penchant for romance novels, but I was anticipating something at least a little deeper, and a lot less predictable. While Kyrian is a good character, and the author is very creative, I felt that the book went nowhere.If you're looking for a touch of sweet sentiment with some semi-kink, this might be your cup of tea. However, if you want some depth and more story outside of the romantic angle, read some Laurell K Hamilton. She does it better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooring!!!","review":"I read for pleasure - sometimes to learn something. I'm about half way through this book and will be real happy to be done with it.The sex every other page thing is waaay stupid - not tantalizing, just stupid. Unfortunately, after reading the good reviews, I bought a series of her books. UGH!!! Good thing they are a fast read........"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story and book, but there's a reason the Kindle version is $2.99","review":"I love my Kindle. In fact, I'm in the process of converting all my paperbacks to Kindle versions (eBaying the paper, buying the Kindle version). The Dark Hunter series is one of my favorites, and while Night Pleasures is not my favorite in the series, it's a good read. I'd give it 4 stars.The reason for two stars in this reviews? The Kindle version SUCKS. It's rife with typos. The words \\"wife\\" and \\"with\\" are almost always interchanged: \\"Kyrian went wife Amanda...\\" \\"His with, Theone,...\\" There are TONS of other examples where I've been forced to puzzle out a word with context clues. Absolutely inexcusable, in my opinion.At $2.99 it's still a good buy, especially if you're trying to complete the series or, like me, thin out your \\"book clutter\\" but be aware that it reads as if some psycho spell-checker edited it and not a live person."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"After reading the reviews below, I was eager to delve into these stories by Kenyon. Boy was I led down the alley of disappointment. When in the first few pages the heroine in a perilous situation said \\"Wake up yummy leather guy\\" I should have put the book down. Unfortunately I suffered through the entire book in the hopes that the characters would improve. I liked some of the mythos Kenyon created, but her character are almost all idiotic, self-important, over sexed, and have the intuition of a rock.In a nutshell if you like your hero's brooding and stupid and your heroine's dingy but indignant then these are the books for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, try again. This recommendation didn't work.","review":"... The story line contains the worst mishmash of vampire lore and off-the-wall Greek mythology I have ever seen. The plot is inconsistent, the dialogue so-so at best, and the resemblance to real vampire novels pretty close to non-existent.I will admit that there was one amusing concept that I liked: when Kyrian has to go somewhere in the daytime, he gets protected from daylight by calling an ambulance and being carried out in a body bag. This, however, is a couple of pages in a thick-ish book; certainly not worth reading the entire book just to get this bit.I would hesitate to read another book by this author, after my experience with this one... In my opinion, she should stick to non-fantasy romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed....","review":"I read the first book in the series and thought it was OK. I hoped this book would be better, however I was wrong. I found that there were too many references to characters throughout the book and that I had no idea who they were - I suppose they are in future books in the series but it did throw off this story too much. The different categories of vampires and the names used for them was confusing. I felt like I needed a cheat sheet to keep track of them. Also, I must be rusty on my Greek mythology because all the \\"Gods\\" and their connections to each other was exhausting. Finally, I found it aggravating that the heroine had to be plain, too tall, elfish faced, etc. while the hero was \\"perfect\\". I would like to have the heroine have some redeeming physical qualities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"it was good....but i found this under the 'vampire' catigory....kyrian aint a vampire. he's a dark hunter. there is a difference. read the book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Put off with this major disappointment!","review":"I did not like the first thing about this story!

Most of the songs on \\"Sesame Street Platinum Hits\\" are here on video, as well as plenty of muppet action, educational video and all of the creativity and joy that make up Sesame Street. I found nuggets from my childhood that my daughter seems to love too (Remember Lady Bug Picnic?) A couple of the celebrity songs feel dated (the Spin Doctors?). But, there are great songs here from Feist, Alicia Keys and others. Sure it does include a couple of the more emotional episodes from Sesame Street's past including the passing of Mr. Hooper and the loss of Big Bird's home in a bad wind. But, they are here for how well these difficult times were dealt with.

Her and I both thoroughly enjoy watching these DVDs. It is so fun that she enjoys a show I grew up watching. This is a good mix of old and new skits and songs. It is nice to see that kids can be entertained by shows that are not animated and they actaully might be learning something also."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Title is completely misleading","review":"I purchased this expecting to get all 40 seasons of Sesame Street. What I got instead were just hilites and snippets of various seasons, like a highlight video. So buyer beware, this title is very misleading. It should say \\"portions of 40 years of sunny days\\" or \\"a few sunny days over the last 40 years of our show\\" or something to that effect. I got all my larnin' from watching Sesame Street as a kid. So that is why I am a careful reader and notice things like this. I am sure Bob and Cookie Monster and Maria etc would agree with me. Which reminds me, in retrospect, I think my first sexual attraction was to Maria on those shows. Yes, I was a randy kindergartner. Its too bad they never did a show in the nude or maybe even an x rated version of Sesame Street. Think of the possibilities! It would have been a huge seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not full episodes..","review":"I ordered this DVD set thinking that it was seasons 1-40. It is not! Each season has a few segments from a few episodes. It is not like a normal season set, like disc one...episodes 1-7. This DVD set has about 3 segments per season. Not what I thought it was at all...I was really bummed out, I got this for my one year old son to start watching. Nick JR it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware, Mr. Hooper's death episode","review":"Yes, I love Sesame Street, but included in this video is the episode where Mr. Hooper is no longer alive. They were remiss to include the episode, because it is very suddenly sad. Your child may not have any experience with death/ loss of a loved one, so it could be quite confusing, especially when taken out of context! Or, if you have had a recent loss, you may not want this video around in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take a break and enjoy some down time with your child...you both deserve it!","review":"A trip down memory land and a way to catch up with artists and performers from the years I missed viewing before I had my own kids! This set is an awesome resource for preschool children through about age eight. All the original Sesame Street characters are represented and the more recent additions are included too. You'll love it as much as your kids because it's one of those rare sets you won't mind watching over and over again WITH your children. There are so many sunny days that it takes awhile to get through them all anyway!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting","review":"I bought this for my pre-schooler thinking it was various full episodes of Sesame Street. Perhaps I missed in the fine print that this is merely clips of various segments throughout 40 years. It seems to be more focused on clips with famous guest starts than it does actually teaching the young viewer..... and many of the clips are with people whom my child would have no clue as to who they are. I'm very disappointed in this."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE Sesame Street!","review":"Talk about a blast from the past!!!

This is a highly personal account, and most times one is likely to feel he's reading someone's sock-drawer diary. Frank is genuine and direct. He wastes no time getting to the point of the work--which is to aid others in self-discovery through example. His is a Castaneda-like tale without the metaphor and mysterious characters. Don Juan is the concrete, accessable Robert Monroe. The forces he encounters are similarly real. This is not a tall tale, but a travelogue offered to anyone who would like to follow in Frank's muddy footsteps. Like many works of this nature readers will be polarized by it. Most will either adore it or loathe it. One doubts there will be little in between. It's impossible to read the story without drawing parallels with one's own life. Whether you want to see these or not will play a large part in dictating how you feel when you put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're a Robert Monroe or Bruce Moen fan...","review":"..you'll enjoy this book. It centers on DeMarco's personal journal of how he's used and grown from what he's learned and experienced through the Monroe Institute. Along the way he explains what he's gained from the experience. He has a different slant in his viewpoint (from Monroe and Moen)on his adventure with the Monroe programs. He tells us what he thinks of the different experiences he's had with the focus levels and the Gateway and Lifeline programs. The more I read, the more I understand the experience of the focus levels and what to look for when I try the hemi sync and meditation, so I've enjoyed this book and learned from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"works great","review":"My wife does medical transcription and we needed an extra Xd card to swap out in an Olympus ds2300 digital recorder.

I would recommend that you try it."},{"rating":"1","title":"why this book is not so good!","review":"I hated the art in this one. you can see from the start the art is very good, very detailed. But if you look at the last few pages it is very visible that the art has gone sloppy! Ripley's character looks and feels very lifeless and dull, I can imagine her in this comic talking like she's extremely bored and tired. The aliens were very plain, they looked balloony and cartoonish. The drawings past the first half of the book look like sketches, they looked very wobbly and almost as if the artist was rushing them. On the better side the story might interest you as it deals with Ripley's psychic relationship with the Aliens, and it gets in depth with Amy and Burt, the two characters who were featured in Nightmare Asylum. I didn't prefer this kind of story too much, but you may. Overall, horrible art, ok story that might be a good story to other people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Modified \\"Earth War\\"","review":"This is \\"Earth War\\" with the names of the principal characters changed.

Billie and Wilks finally meet the famous Lt. Ellen Ripley. They gather dreamers that are being called by the Mother of all Aliens. They steal a ship and find the Aliens Homeworld and capture the Mother Alien to bring her to Earth. After leaving her on Earth for a while the Aliens on Earth should come to her. They set off a nuclear bomb to go off , I think 6 or maybe 9 months from then. Billie goes off to find Amy, the girl in transmissions. Billie finds her father and her and flee Earth. This hopefully is not the last of this series, it badly needs a sequel. You should get this book if you the liked the Aliens Movies, if you have not seen them you should. The 2nd is my favorite.

It's size is so small that it will fit in a pocket. The intructions are easy to read and apply. Haven't used all the features yet but the ones I have used are great. Shudder time has small delay but also can be set for needs. I would recommend this over the straight camera or digital movie. Unless you are a professional or anal you can get and create wonderful results. For filming you will need a large storage card (8mg) so that you get more time to film. The conversion of time from stills to movie is huge as far as storage space. I recommend you get an extra battery so you are not caught short at the wrong time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aziz, light!","review":"This camera needs light. The flash is weak. It does take a good video though, but again, in bright light. I just ordered the aux flash, I hope that helps the pictures. The size is nice, fits in the pocket, and it's great not to have to carry a len cap since it's built in. The battery is not long on life, so I ordered an extra one of that.

However, I find, me mind you, that the zoom control is upside down to how I would imagine it functioning. I also find that the shutter button is a little too far forward.Video seems to drain the battery pretty quickly so buy some spares.It does not have the greatest set of options but this is a camera you'll have in your pocket and is not intended to be the be all and all.

Also, it is a pain dragging the dryer around the garage floor, using an extension cord. It didn't save much time, and I'm much happier back drying my new 2011 Honda Accord with old towels.The seller contact, David Bernstein, cooperated in refunding his $18 (as I recall) shipping cost, but not the $32.04 UPS charge to return it. He never acknowledged that the drier is not satisfactory for use on a black car, writing, \\"Sorry you don't care for the product,\\" and somewhat strangely, \\"I understand what you are saying but everyone takes some 'risk' buying online.\\" His refund policy was pretty good, but I would have been happier with a more customer-friendly tone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review on : All About Chords - Elvo S.

Even now, there seems no reason to revise that opinion. Choosing from among several available suites prepared by Prokofiev himself, Tilson Thomas shaped a version that is both dramatically and musically complete. He and his orchestra do full justice to the bittersweet lyricism and astonishing emotional range of Prokofiev's music.

I thought this was a very interesting book, but it did slow down quite a bit in the middle. The author did not distribute her subjects evenly, but wound up concentrating a number of examples around the end/beginning of the 19th/20th centuries -- so much so that I started to confuse some of them together, especially when she started discussing multiple generations of affairs in a family.Nevertheless, the book offers insights and understanding to affairs of the heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Recipes","review":"I never thought I'd ever write a review for a cookbook, but here goes.

The piecrust is amazing and tastes just like the high-carb kind. I can use it with my own recipes. The Cherry Cheesecake is so easy I can make it from memory now. I think the most interesting thing about having this cookbook is the easy access to the author who always promptly answers my questions via email.

I also was very unhappy to find that Steel's has uped the price of Maltitol to $17.95 for two pounds. I do realize that Low Carb is expensive, but I find that price to be beyond ridiculous!

This time he weaves a tale of two \\"glinty-eyed\\" Irishmen together in a way that you really don't even mind the chatter of Nuala's spear-carrier husband, Dermot. Having those fey women in my own family, I understand how he feels nevertheless. Nuala and her brood can be hilarious at one turn and mauldlin the next. Life is never dull. It's Nuala's determination to \\"fix\\" anything that offends her sense of rightness. You have to love her fight and how Greeley deftly drops his politics into the fray.The two stories don't parallel as well as some of the previous novels, and that's the only fault I find. Still, the story of Timmy and his lady in war-ravaged Berlin will bring an Irish smile to just about any face.Okay, it's not Joyce or Yeats, but it's damned good fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"This linen is not a fine weave","review":"This latest entry in the Nuala Anne McGrail series by Andrew M. Greeley is a big disappointment. The main plot line promises more than it delivers, both in the solution and how the answer is found, and the secondary plot line wouldn't be a puzzle at all if the characters simply read faster. When the book doesn't drag it can be annoying. The sex scenes and discussions thereof are not as steamy as the author seems to think they are; overall they struck me as sophomoric. The voice in Desmond's head (carried over from earlier books) appears only sporadically and not to great effect, and Nuala's ability to \\"see things\\" seems to have some convenient gaps. There are hints of possible post-partum depression or some such that are neither developed nor resolved. I found it difficult not to just skip to the end to see how things turned out; but honestly, having read the whole book, I don't know that I would have missed much by doing so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovin' It!","review":"I love the characters in this series.

It wasn't as good as Weep No More My Lady or Loves Music, Loves to Dance, but I liked it a lot better than the last few.

Whatever you do, don't buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"fast-paced but mindless reading","review":"This book, along with all her other books are always entertaining and suspenseful. However, after reading most of her books, you come to realize that she uses the same formula for all her novels. The reason that you can never figure out who the villain is is because the characters are not developed and there are no real clues that can dictate who that person can be. It's like rolling a dice and any number has an equal chance of being rolled. I usually read her books when I want a light-harded book but don't expect any quality writing or real mystery. Do you notice that all her main female protagonists always have a male interest or inevitable lover? All part of her main formula."},{"rating":"2","title":"She tied up the loose ends!","review":"MHC has done it again. There is not one book that I haven't read.

I would check out as many as I could carry from the library, and be beside myself choosing which gem would be first.And here I am, seven years later. I picked this up on a whim, thinking I could once again revel in her words. Alas, you cannot go home.Based on a weak and obvious plot, \\"We'll meet again\\" hobbles along with characters that are dry and two-dimensional. The heroine (?) is shallow, weak, and defenseless, the plot extreme and unrealistic. The clues don't fit together in the seamless way that MHC used to carefully craft. I would suggest reading some of her earlier works (not \\"Where are the Children?\\").To her credit, MHC adds a touch of class with her careful mention of brand names.Recommendation: Read something earlier of hers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have ready all of Mary Higgins Clark's books and have enjoyed them.

This book was definitely not the caliber of earlier Mary Higgins Clark. The character's are one dimensional and the dialog is sometimes hilarious and often stilted (no-one talks or thinks this way).

Her plots are always creative and exciting and she develops her characters thoroughly. I liked the character of Fran but not as much as I usually like her leading heroines. I was rooting for Molly a little more (and maybe a little more romance for her would have made it perfect). Although the ending was a little rushed, I still would recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We'll Meet Again","review":"We'll Meet Again is one of Mary Higgins Clark's best novels. I liked this book because it had a plot unlike any other books she had written. I also like the way Clark developed her characters because they keep you on the edge till the last page of the book. Set in the Cape Cod atmosphere, this book is wonderful reading. Molly Carpenter Lasch, wife of Gary Lasch, a successful doctor, is sent to prison for murdering her husband. It was supposedly said that she crept up behind him in his office and beat him with a large sculpture to death. Though she does not remember this, she admits to having done it with the facts the court has given her. She is sent to life in prison, but five years later, she is granted parole. Now that she's out of prison, Molly wants to uncover who killed her husband, who ruined her reputation, and who destroyed her life. The results are beyond your imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This is the first Mary Higgins Clark book that aI have read. I got it inexpensively (thank goodness) at the train station and passed the time during an 8 hour ride. The book lacked believability. The plot had few twists most of which were predictable.

Poorly defined characters, hackneyed plot, and badly written dialogue. Skip this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too boring to finish...","review":"After reading many of Ms. Higgins' earlier books, I have to say this is the most disappointing of any of hers I've read so far. Virtually nothing happens and the characters too one-dimensional to make me care about any of them, though I kept trying! I always finish books I start, but I could not bring myself to get past the halfway point with this one, and ended up skipping to the last five pages to find out 'who did it'."},{"rating":"1","title":"A \\"who cares\\" whodunit...","review":"This book was a waste of trees. Clark spent more time describing the clothes her characters were wearing at any given moment rather than trying to develop their personalities. The storyline was quite like a vaudeville show, designed to make you hiss at the villains and sigh at the dramatic entrances of the wronged Connecticut socialite. Don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUSPENSE AND MYSTERY","review":"Mary Higgins Clark does it again with another book that promises to surprise the reader with the turn of every page. The characters are wonderfully developed, and the author carefully reveals the various secrets of each character's pasts. This novel also goes behind the scenes of a hospital that also has a few secrets of its own. After the wealthy Molly Lasch is released from prison, her main purpose is to go on a quest to find the real killer with the help of a college friend who becomes a well-known reporter.

I really enjoyed her style of writing because it was easy to understand and was very suspenseful. She keeps the reader thinking about more than one thing at a time. In one chapter, you're concentrating on one thing, and in the next chapter, it's something completely different. I think that's what makes the book full of suspense. Mary Higgins Clark uses descriptive words so that you can actually see it in your head. She is so descriptive that sometimes her words gave me the chills. Overall, I give the book We'll Meet Again by Mary Higgins Clark five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable MHC mystery which should delight fans.","review":"This being my 3rd Mary Higgins Clark mystery, I will certainly not say it's better than Pretend You Don't See Her, but it was enjoyable none-the-less.

Keep up the great work Mary!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Okay.","review":"Mary Higgins Clark now falls into the category of Danielle Steele where her first books were much better written than her later ones.

This will be my last Mary Higgins Clark."},{"rating":"2","title":"My First MHC was Fantastic","review":"Believe it or not, this is the first time I've read anything by Mary Higgins Clark and I loved it.

After being released on parole, Molly asserts her innocence again in front of the media. Among the media, Fran Simmons, an old classmate of Molly's from high school, begins covering the story for the local television station for a segment called True Crimes. Molly agrees to an interview with Fran and convinces Fran to help her investigate the murder further in order to find the answers that are at the edge of her memory. During the course of the investigation, a key witness is discovered murdered only hours after Molly questioned the witness. This story holds the reader captive until the very end. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"We WON'T meet again","review":"Having read all of Mary Higgins Clark's previous novels, I have to conclude that Mary has lost her touch. We'll Meet Again must have been written in a weak week-end when Mary had nothing else to do.

Its heavy reliance upon faulty reasoning is indicative of the ignorance embedded within it. Its author is a known holocaust denier. Only morons believe his tripe. One cannot know the source of his bigotry; one can only pity him and hope that in the interest of public safety Butz is a better teacher of electrical engineering than history, for as a historian he is pathetic, offensive, and slyly illogical. Only our allegience to freedom of speech permits this offal to be disseminated; only the ignorance, antisemitism, and raw stupidity of the reader provoke its purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing 'intellectual freedom' with ignorance...","review":"This book's description starts with the following sentence: \\"What happens when a man of conscience takes the hype and taboo that surround the Holocaust seriously -- and then goes public with his doubts and questions?\\". Let me rephrase. What happens when a man of questionable conscience looking for free publicity takes on the subject of the Holocaust without doing any serious research at all, while he pretends to have something serious to say about it -- and finally he has to face the appropriate criticism and outrage caused by his ridiculous remarks? He cries and claims to be the victim. Yes, joining the ranks of the so called Holocaust revisionists can make you famous for a few minutes. But confusing 'intellectual freedom' with the right to shout ignorant slogans without facing any consequence is not justifiable. And, according to the author, the only real consequence he faced was the ridicule he completely deserved...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"This is a nice, attractive changing table.

Although he never pulls it out, the consequences came around to him and his best friend. I bought this book for my 10 year old brothers to read about the real consequences of violence and in discussions after one of them read the book, I believe I got my point across. The plot is not complex or well-written enough to sustain the interest of an adult, but it is an excellent read for children who are just beginning to learn about violence (in whatever form it comes in)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not an easy read.","review":"If you are looking for something light to pass the time, this story is not it. (and I don't mean just the weight) I read Musashi from the same author and wanted to try another of his novels. This one is very good, but I don't find it as enticing. All the interactions get very complex and sometimes I have a hard time keeping up. When I do find the time to bury myself in the book I love it and am getting sucked right in, unfortunately if I only have 20 - 30 minutes to read, I just choose something else because I know I'll end up having to backtrack over the part I finished before.I recommend this book and I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes Japan and Japanese culture.

Taiko, however, I couldn't wait to finish. The number of characters, and places was overwhelming.

The character's pellet gun and silly puzzles make this game a yawner after the first hour. It wants to be clever by making you perform absurd tricks and moves by crouching into a ball. The camera angles can be annoying at times and the graphics are hardly stellar. Mario Galaxy and Zelda make much better use of the graphics engine on the Wii. Save your money and rent this lame game."},{"rating":"1","title":"For me , an exercise in tedium.","review":"I'll start by saying I have spent countless hours playing Resident Evil 4 on the Wii and I did manage to finish the game as different characters. Enjoyed every minute. By comparison, after one day with Metroid , I was ready to sell it. But I came back to it several times for another try. This game's boss battles require hitting the B button continuously for several minutes. No finesse. The save points are too sparse , so unless you are an expert at this game , expect to have to lose progress or leave your Wii on overnight until you are ready to resume. Some of the puzzles are fairly difficult,not a problem, but some of the stages require timing that far surpasses me, even after days of attempts. Currently this game in on the shelf awaiting its next owner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive gameplay","review":"In the interest of disclosure, I bought this game for a friend; I did play it a bit, but mostly watched. We'd both recently been playing more on the PS3, and switching back to Metroid Prime 3 was disappointing. The controls were difficult to adjust to, the gameplay seemed fairly repetitive, and the story wasn't engaging. We wound up selling it to someone else after about a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metroid Prime 3 Corruption Review: Wii","review":"The game totally sucks. It is way too difficult in an absurd sense. I mean the puzzles are really mindless sometimes. Example: There will be a small piece of rock lying in some corner that you need to blast to find your way out.Now how on earth can you figure that out apart from hit and trial and missing it out several times.I gave up the game then found out this link: http://www.nextgenwalkthroughs.com/systems/wii/metroid3/index.phpwhich has a complete walk through of the game, so continued playing but then gave up again as it was not as much fun.I have played RE4 for several hours and it was just awesome, the puzzles lent special life to the game.

I'm not a big gamer and I use the system mainly for Netflix and social games. That said I really enjoyed Metroid 3. The graphics are very good for the Wii and the game play is intuitive. I wish the game was set up for the classic controller, but that is my only complaint. It is a brilliant re-structuring of a classic game. Lots of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frustrating, but fun","review":"I've enjoyed playing Metroid Prime 3 on Wii, but it does get very frustrating at times. I'm pretty much a novice gamer and not too keen on shooters, but the graphics in this game are excellent. The walkthroughs seem to assume an awful lot of prior knowledge and leave a lot to be desired. The time between saves is very long at some points, so one has to dedicate a couple of hours of straight play time, at least, otherwise you have to go through the section again so you can save. The second time though a section is much quicker. Overall, I'm still not too keen on first person shooters and prefer more adventure and less bangs, but I am 62 so maybe I'm just old-fashioned. The game saves itself, from my poiont of view with the graphics, are stunning at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent technical manual for ballet","review":"I decided to take up ballet as an adult. I found this beginner's guide to ballet at the library and kept renewing it and decided to just buy it. It's old - published in the 40's - but ballet is classical so the information is timeless.It's written as a technical manual for the dancer to literally have the book opened on the floor in front of them, and to follow the dancer on the page. The right leg is black and the left leg is white to make it easier to see exactly how to do the steps, from tendus up to grand jetes and beyond.I was unfamiliar with ballet terminology and this book clearly explained it all. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in learning about ballet from beginners on up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ah the good things in life","review":"Martha shows up haw to find those things that turn a house into a home. Not everyone has family relics to start life. Remember the John Wayne, Maureen O'Hara movie \\"The Quiet Man\\" where Mary Kate Danaher wanted her things about her? However, we can come awfully close.This is more than a coffee table book it has many practical shopping insights. The section alone on glass is worth the price of the book. We see pictures and description of different modes of glass and see the difference in hand blown and molded glass. I have an extensive collection of cobalt glass.In addition, there is a section on hardware salvage. I intend to exchange those cheep gold doorknobs in the house with an eclectic collection.When you are ready to retire the book, it will look good in your library.

I know many feel all you need is the first disc and I disagree. Yes, I remember back in the late 80's being introduced to this band (first album) by a buddies house drinking tom collins' on a warm summer day. First album has a place in my heart like it does for everyone else. The second album by this band is great, just different from the first which is why it was not given the acclaim.

On April 27, 2007 at The FedEx Forum in Memphis, I sat front row as I watched Hollywood Hogan in the red and yellow using his American Made theme song wrestle The Big Show and then slam him for the pin. This show has never been released on PPV or DVD as originally promised and I was hoping at least the Hogan-Show match would've been included on this DVD when I originally heard about it, but it isn't. There were more empty seats in the arena than were occupied, and that's the only reason I can think of Hogan wouldn't want this match to be seen as it would hurt his ego.

The only problem is that Elizabeth catches them kissing and runs away from the goodbye party Jessica made for her, no longer debating whether or not to leave SVU, but intent on leaving. There's some fighting between Elizabeth and Jessica and then they make up, and then they start fighting again. It's like a never-ending cycle..."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"You will never know what Elizabeth does, that's what keeps you on the edge of your seat.

The stories hold the reader spellbound with their intensity and their realness. I know because I was a teenager who grew up there and lived in the community during those crazy times. I can assure the readers that all the events are accurate. Most of the people described in the book I knew personally. Judge Bacon masterfully recalls the personalties with great detail and as I look back some 30 years the events are brought back vividly. This is better than any fiction fairytale of crime and its consequences.

Throw in a young hot shot Devil Dog (Swayze) with alot of naive ideas but a powerful motive and Hackman as the man tasked with pulling off the impossible. There it is.What you end up with is a moving portrayal of the spirit and courage of those American heroes so unfairly derided despite whatever beliefs you may have about that particular war.Although the film is a little cliched and predictable in spots the final product is commendable, tragic, and heartfelt."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent movie","review":"this is a great movie, acting may be a little light, but the action and story make up for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the bad movies about Vietnam war.","review":"I think some people like this film because it's about American soldiers listed as missing in action but they're believed still alive.I can ignore a lot of logical holes in this picture but there are things I can't ignore.

It's when in his dream, Gene Hackman saw his son, at that time, he was just a small kid asking his Dad \\"Can I sleep with you tonight?\\".

The first day I got it, I read it within one hour. It is about two twelve year old girls- Tara*Starr and Elizabeth. Tara*Starr is a fun girl who loves to wear lots of accessories. Elizabeth is kind of laid-back and doesn't quite wear as vibrant clothes or accessories. When Tara moves, all they can do is write eachother. It really teaches you that even if you don't see someone hardly in the year, you can still be best friends. My best friend moved away this summer and I sent her the book to read.

The budget was awful or anything but it was like watching a made for TV film. Almost every time the \\"beast\\" would attack, it would show the victim cowering and screaming and right at the time when there should have been some blood and a great kill, the camera would cut away. Oh that just aggravates me to no end. The sea beast itself was just stupid looking, invisible at times, just the outline showed up. I think the movie was kind of comical. If you have a chance to pick it up cheap or borrow it, and you're into sci-fi made for TV type movies then give it a try.

However, lurking between the covers is an interesting and orginal idea for constructing scales, which McClain calls a \\"yantra\\". A yantra consists of all positive integers below a certain limiting value, which factor into primes only up to a given prime, or \\"prime limit\\". For instance, we can take all numbers less than a trillion which are products of 2, 3 and 5. We then reduce this to an octave, and obtain a scale.McClain argues that this method of scale construction was known to the ancients, who secretly encoded it in various texts.

This book just might make you scared of worms, it is a truly gross read at times, but a lot of fun, and is a good fun mystery.

You have to get a knife, and in the nut and saddle, thicken the wedges wear the strings go in, and make them deeper.Second, the standard tuning for a guitar is eadgbe. eadgbe on this size instrument will have to much slack with the strings because of the scale size. So there are to instruments that come similar to this. A guitalele made by yamaha(not sold in the U.S) and a requinto which is a mexican instrument that is also tuned to adgcea. ADGCEA would be the same tuning as putting a capo on the 5th fret of a guitar.So, tune it up to ADGCEA, the sound is brilliant, and so unexpected."},{"rating":"1","title":"It looks like a guitar, sounds like a...","review":"It arived safely (packed so well it would probably survive a plane crash) but the strings were very coroded. The tuners are decent (for a very inexpensive guitar) but once tuned all cords sounded off key. Not playable if you can hear. However if deaf it might be quite fun. The plastic fingerboard, painted binding, and plastic bridge are disapointing, but when this guitar makes it to my chop shop, the bridge pins and tuners might be usefull on another gutar. If you buy it for a child, you won't have to wory about teaching them how to tune. It will make little difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not their best work","review":"Dean makes some very good budget guitars. This is not one of them. The fret ends are sharp, and the intonation is bad. The action is a mile high. NOT a good instrument for a young beginner -- spend more on another instrument."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toy Guitar","review":"This is a toy guitar built with real guitar parts. It cannot be properly tuned since it's not made to be played. It is great for kids that want to look cool and make some noise. Tone deaf kids and adults will love it for its cool looks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saved the cost of a course and picked it up fast!","review":"I was going to take a course to learn powerpoint, but the times were all wrong for me, so I ordered this nifty book and with its help put together my first powerpoint lecture with an outline and graphics. It was a big hit with the audience and was easy to do. I think this book is terrific - and 2003 was fine for me - I still have Windows XP. Did this in May 2008."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"This thing has it all figured out. It turns itself on when it makes contact with the wall, senses the studs and allows you to mark the center without taking your hand off the little gadget.If you got it with the laser Strait-Line, (and that is the way to go!), they can be neatly coupled together and you can just mark all the studs along the line at one time.This is the perfect gift for the handyman in your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junky light show","review":"Received it as a gift. The concept seems good, but even after frequent calibrations, it rarely got the same results twice. It just produced a meaningless mini-light shows.It seems odd that this product gets either a 5 or a 1 with the majority being 1. I suspect the reviews have been salted. Do not buy it unless you are giving it as a prank gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't know a stud if it bit it on its behind","review":"I had never used an electronic stud finder before I purchased this particular tool. I took it over to my mom's house because we needed to hang something from the studs. This thing falsed left and right. It never seemed to find a single stud. In the end, I gave up on it.I ended up taking it back and bought a Zircon StudSensor Pro SL. The Zircon had no problem finding a studs. On the first try, it found a stud. Then found the next one, and the next one. It was right every time (I was drilling into the wall). I'm just amazed at how bad the Strait-Line was compared to the Zircon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful- Lame - junk - schlock - P.O.S - ugh","review":"---I ended up smashing this thing with a hammer--It needed to be put out of my misery.>Another fine product from crapco where quality is just a word<I bought it to see if it would work better then the basic zircron I had. Well if completely arbitrary readings are what you want, this is your unit. A roll of wet toilet paper would work as well, and not have the annoying high pitched beeping.man was this thing bad.No ,really it was no good at allseriously, it was junk"},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!","review":"Biggest piece of junk I have ever bought. It could not find studs properly. I trusted it and now have a whole in my wall that I have to pay someone to come and fix!!!!! It said there were two studs within 16 inches apart. I was putting up a wall niche and needed to cut out between them. IT WAS SO WRONG!!!!! It couldn't tell there was a stud in the middle at the 8 inch mark!!!! I could have done better throwing darts at the wall and going by were they landed!!!!.Please do not buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"get something else for the same money","review":"Bought this model - didn't work. Reread the instructions 3 times and tried many different surfaces - would never calibrate - always just kept beepingBought the Zircon Studsensor Pro SL AC for the same price (within a buck or so) - worked right out of the package. I also liked that you could switch the Zircon from 3/4\\" to 1 1/2\\" depth. These units say they detect live AC electric lines - but you'd be a fool to trust it IMHO - make sure the circuit is dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Like many others have said, doesn't calibrate right.... NO TWO READINGS ARE THE SAME. Half the time my WHOLE WALL was a stud. This is a terrible product. I searched for help, and found none. I even went and bought a new battery thinking it would do the trick, and nothing. Now I have to waste MORE of my time in getting a different one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than junk","review":"This is arguably the worst tool I have owned in 40+ years of home repair. Not only does it not work, it makes an obnoxious high-pitched beep that will drive the average person crazy.Total garbage. You have some nerve selling this on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Junk","review":"Deserves zero stars. I received one as a gift. Worked fine the first day out of the box, but the next day it went nuts -- every inch of my wall had a stud under it according to the finder -- and hasn't worked since.

I head the song kryptonite and got the album. I was pleasantly suprised by listening to better life because they're a lot more talented then I thought. I thought that they would definetely will not be a one hit wonder. Of course now we know that because of songs like be like that. I'm just waiting for a new album by these guys hoping it will be as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent neo-grunge album","review":"The people who say 3DD is a one-hit wonder obviously don't know much about the rest of their music. This is a great post-grunge CD without a single poor song. The energy and flow of this album is incredible; the album really never seems to get bogged down and all the songs flow swiftly through and on to the next. The guitar is pretty good, and Brad Arnold's vocals are solid. My favorites are \\"By My Side,\\" \\"Kryptonite,\\" \\"Not Enough,\\" \\"Be Like That\\" (which proves 3DD can do pretty songs too) \\"So I Need You,\\" \\"Life of My Own,\\" oh heck, just about all of them except \\"Down Poison\\" and \\"Smack,\\" which aren't quite on the same level. The Better Life is characterized by a gritty agressive attack and well-channeled energy; a must-have for fans of mainstream and post-grunge rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Debut!","review":"One of the best CDs I have bought in a long time. With a sound that seems to be a mixture of Creed, Big Head Todd and the monsters, and Eve6, there is not a song on the CD I don't like...rarity!

Rest of CD, not for those of you expecting more catchy, somewhat listenable CDs. If you have any inclination towards punk or power-pop, steer clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good overall album.","review":"I do not like Creed but I do like this band. I just got this cd earlier today and it was better than I thought it would be. Certainly better than anything Creed has ever done. My favorite track has to Kryptonite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but repetitive","review":"Even though some of the songs sound ripped straight from bigger rock bands (Alice in Chains, Metallica, Creed), 3 Doors Down has a sound which is refreshing -- straight-up rock. \\"Kryptonite\\" is easily the best song on the CD, but there are others which are worthy of radio-play, such as \\"Loser\\" and \\"Not Enough\\". This CD sounds great. I'd say it's worth a buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"An extremely good album!","review":"I bought this CD knowing only \\"Kryptonite\\", but it has quickly become one of my favorite CDs, and one of the best releases this year. It is very well-done for a debut, my only minor complaint that most of the songs sound similar, but they're so good that you soon overlook that fact. 3 Doors Down are talented, and if they keep this up, they should thrive in the business for a long time. Music this good only comes along once in a while. \\"Kryptonite\\" and \\"Loser\\" are notable radio hits, and two of the best songs on the album. \\"The Better Life\\" is a fast song with great lyrics, and \\"Be Like That\\" and \\"Down Poison\\" are my two favorites. Altogether, this is a great CD, very enjoyable to listen to, and one that should remain a favorite for a long time to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whazzzuuupppp!","review":"This is a really good sounding group. Most of the comparisons I read about were way off. To me, they sound like Days of the New with Rob Thomas on vocals mixed with a little Collective Soul acoustic guitars. They rock. I like every song on this cd. I think they'll be around for a while. Don't sell out. If you guys are reading this, please play at the Ventura Theater. Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Away from the sun is a bit better i think","review":"I first baught away from the sun (You can reed my review on Away from the sun too) and i taught it was a very god album. I went to the web site and heard some of the song from their first album( The better life) and i taught thei vere good espesily Duck And Run ( Very good song 3DD). And i baught the album, I liked it very much in the begining. But after a vhile the songs begin to get boring. But don\`t take me wrong its a good album but not extrordinary.And i have bought Another 700 miles. You\`l get an review on that to later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great record?","review":"3 Doors Down, came to the world stage in 1999, with their album \\"the better life\\", this brought them almost the whole way. Although they have waited some years befor releasing their newest album they are still one of the great american rock band. In my eyes, 3 Doors Down paved the way for bands like Lifehouse abd almost Nickelback too. The raw and beautifull texts and songs they've included on this album ae magnificent. Great album for just listening to in all situations, there are both great hard songs as well as more smooth songs. If you don't own by now, you're way behind!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"can't get better than this","review":"3 doors down is an awesome cd. kryptonite isn't even the best song on the cd,although it is on the radio. my personal favorite is \\"be like that.\\" it has a slower tempo, but adds to the great sound and compliments the lyrics extremely well. all the songs are great. the beat of the songs go very well with the lyrics. 3 doors down is definately a must buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Time for Stipe to retire....","review":"Attention to annunciation, musical diction and \\"attitude\\" are all-important to the more sophisticated listener who demands musical quality in addition to at least some depth of lyrics. A slight bit of southern accent combined with perfect grammar and a straight foreward , roch and roll style, the way God intended, create a fine blend of 9 secret herbs and spices. \\"The Better Life\\" is not peanutbutter and jelly fare. Not just the flavor of the month--this Mississippi band is as uniquely impressive as Muse or Cracker. --M.E.R., Reynoldsburg, OH"},{"rating":"2","title":"Taken for granted? Underappreciated? Get this disc.","review":"The high energy guitar with the thumping bass guitar to back it up and growlingly defiant vocals make this cd the one to pick up if you're looking for some fast rock sounds and a nice crisp slightly bitter lyrical edge."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an outstanding CD!!!","review":"This is an awesome album! I've listened to most of it, but I haven't listened to tracks such as \\"Be Like That\\" or \\"Life of My Own.\\" But the other songs are AWESOME! \\"Kryptonite\\" is the best track on the cd, no doubt about it. I am also very fond of Track 7 \\"Better Life\\" which is also the album's title. I am sure everyone will remember \\"Loser.\\" I also think \\"Duck and Run\\" is an instant classic! It's great! If you like modern rock, this is the cd for you! Go out and buy it. Trust me. You won't be wasting those 15 bucks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great band as well as a great album","review":"People said that the only good song on this album was kryptonite and that is not true every song on this label is great and do think that you would enjoy it because they kick a$$."},{"rating":"2","title":"One hit wonders be damned!","review":"Who would've thought that 3 Doors Down would last this long. When \\"Kryptonite\\" debuted early last year on modern rock stations, it was almost sure they would be a one hit wonder band. The pop stations got a hold of \\"Kryptonite\\" and ran it into the ground, while the modern rock stations grabbed \\"Loser\\". Next came \\"Duck and Run\\" and now there's \\"Be Like That\\", songs that are in the Top Ten. How's that for one hit wonder? Instrumentally 3 Doors Down is a good band, but their lyrics lack a certain punch. Nonetheless, 3 Doors Down is a solid rock band amidst all of this rap metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay","review":"This CD obviously has some strong tunes on it that were written very well to pull 3 Doors Down into the mainstream. However, if you have actually seen the band you can really understand their musical talent. They lose a STAR for not actually being as good of musicians as kryptinite makes them out to be. I have seen bands like Motorplant perform much better than them... by the way check out Motorplant \\"American Postcard\\" you will love it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is the bomb!","review":"I just got this CD and I am loving it. I love the music, lyrics, and the messages of some of the songs. My favorite on the CD is track one \\"Kryptonite\\". This CD is a must buy!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Little variation between tracks","review":"This CD album is one that contains \\"the hit single....and then all the other songs\\". Kryptonite has a very catchy melody and has been receiving plenty of airplay. But the rest of the album is very disappointing. \\"The other songs\\" are remarkably similar to each other. They have very simplistic compositional constructions with minimal variation from one song to the other."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as advertised","review":"I love 3 doors down. When I downloaded this c.d. it was not 'the better life'it was 'away from the sun' now I can't return it because its open but I can warn others.

In my opinion \\"kryptonite\\" isn't even the best song on it. check out the rest of the cd here. its realy worth the 10 seconds it takes to buffer.

I hope you take the time to check out the cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok but could be better","review":"I enjoyed this cd but it could be bettter. For one thing, get rid of the swearing; it's unnessesary. Another thing that I didn't like about this cd is that it's not very positive. In some places it even gets somewhat offensive. Even if you liked the songs you heard on the radio, don't buy this cd. The radio songs are the only good songs on the cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"am I listening to a slow Anthrax here?","review":"OK, The Kryptonite hit was the song that would have made the albumn sell if it ever was going to, Down Poison comes next, and all the rest you can take your pick, execpt Loser, I simply can't take to it - lyrics?!? But not all is bad, I can put it in the car and sift through them for a while, production seems good, and as it's their first release, I will be hoping for more,Nice try though....Erik."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Debut!!","review":"Well...I read some other reviews & had to chime in. Some people criticize the lyrics when they can't even read or understand them - it's superhuman \\"Might\\" (not mind)!! And, \\"Loser\\" hasn't been done by 50 other bands - Beck's song is NOTHING comparable to this one! Anyway, it's a very good album - most every tune is catchy in one way or another. I've seen them twice in concert, both in large & small venues & they do a good show. Yes, they may sound somewhat like some other bands, but, they have a distinct flavor too. I recommend it - Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds of Candle Box, Alice & Chains and Stone Temple Pilots","review":"Great CD. The singer/band makes has the sounds of Candle Box, Alice and Chains, STP and CREED. Some good guitar riffs. They can actually play! Since I come the guitar school of Edward Van Halen, this is a bit more refreshing to hear that oh so Foo Fighters. Great CD to listen too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"okay whatever!","review":"Kryptonite is addictive. My friends and i really like it. It's always a plus that they're from our home state. I was sorta disappointed w/ the rest of the album though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"On the strength of the song \\"Kryptonite\\" I bought this album, and wound up sadly disappointed. There's no doubt that \\"Kryptonite\\" is the strongest song on the album. While overall the musicianship is competent, none of the other tracks stand out. After awhile the songs all run together in a bland, forgettable mix. Too many start with a short acoustic into, followed by heavy guitar crunching, repeated ad nauseam. Luckily, I was able to sell the album to a co-worker and get my money back. Too bad, as I really wanted to like this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Temporary Pleasure","review":"Similar to other releases of 90's alt-rock bands Three Doors Down manages to sound competent while bringing absolutely nothing new to the table. If you want \\"real\\" lyrics, check out a more emotionally soaked band (like Alice in Chains). The music is temporarily pleasing then quickly becomes annoying while they plod out riff after riff with little to no variation between songs. The cd alternates between fast rocker to slow ballad so robotically that the cd screams \\"predictable\\".In short, the cd is good for about a month, until you either discover a new flavor of the month, or realize that they managed to pull off NOTHING original or special. A waste of money all around."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 star is not enough","review":"This CD grabs you from the moment you hit start and it never lets go, My 16 year old son & I both enjoy this album. How often can you say that."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is a debut album?","review":"This band has truly amazed me! When I heard Kryptonite on the radio, I liked their style but I was afraid they would become just another one-hit wonder. I got their CD rather reluctantly since I wasn't expecting much. Buying it is something that I will never regret! The driving guitar and bass are excelent in all their songs. Arnold (Lead singer) is superb with his haunting yet focused and clear vocals. Kryptonite is reason enough to buy this golden debut but other songs on it are just as good if not better and will surely receive radio air time. These hits include \\"Loser\\", \\"Duck and Run\\", \\"Not Enough\\", \\"Be Like That\\" and \\"Better Life\\". Bottom line, this is the best debut album I have ever heard and they already sound better to me than many popular, well-established bands. 3 Doors Down has blasted on to the scene and the future looks bright for them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"File under: Rock 'n Roll, The Resurgence of","review":"All too often bands like 3 doors down slip through the cracks- there's nothing particularly flashy or amazing about this band. Nothing other than the fact they play solid music- no nonsense rock 'n roll that reminds me of Creed and 7 Mary Three.There are few flaws with this album, the songs are sonically powerful with all the features you'd expect of quality rock music- good melodies, strong guitars.I expect this album to stay close by for a while. Highly recommended, more like 4 1/2 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish I could give it 100 stars","review":"this CD kicks. 3 Doors Down is such an awesome band. kryptonite, loser, life of my own, not enough, and so i need you are the best songs on the CD. if you don't have this CD yet...then go get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a rockin' album","review":"I agree with the above reviews.

Ok, so It's actually pretty hard to fall asleep with it on because it bores you to death.it was recommended to me by a friend and I regret spending money on it. Out of their two albums I only like 3 songs so it's easier to just buy singles.The quality of the songs was great , don't get me wrong, they have potential. It's the actual songs and combination of lyrics to music thats so bad.Maybe next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"They wasted all their hooks on one song","review":"Yeah, \\"Kryptonite\\" is a catchy song. But that's about it for this album. The rest is disposable, cliched alt-rock that doesn't have any hooks to it. The playing is good, but all the songs seem to follow a formula.

It doesn't seem that long, because I'm still enjoying this cd. They are a great group and of course the best song here is Kryptonite. Amazing. Smack and So I Need You are also great, the rest is good. I do love this cd and some of their later work. I guess this is such a great cd because of Kryptonite but in general I really love their sound and edge. If you want a good rock cd, this is it. I really recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic CD","review":"This is one of the best debut albums I've heard in a long time. I was especially pleased because I normally wait to hear 2-3 songs from a new band before I run out and buy their CD. Boy, did I make a smart choice getting this one after only hearing the song Kryptonite. Very addicting music. Excellent bass player. If you like Collective Soul, Creed, Soundgarden, or Days of the New, you'll really like this. I'm confident that these guys will release more songs than just Kryptonite off this CD. In fact, it's not nearly the best song. This is a must have CD for anyone who claims to love good Rock & Roll.

At the time I was living in Alaska and I was frequently camping or fishing for King Salmon. This cd was perfect blasting out of my boom box. Now 5 years later in the New England area it's still good.

When I first heard \\"Kryptonite\\" on the radio i knew this band would grow to become a favorite in the industry. This CD grew on me and I think it's the best release. Great songs are \\"Kryptonite\\", \\"Loser\\", \\"Duck and Run\\", and \\"Be Like That.\\" This album is both hard rock and very catchy as well as some slow songs but they are easy to get into. This CD is more like a 4.5 Stars instead 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD ROCKS!!!!!","review":"This cd is the best one I own! I love Kryptonite and Be Like That.

All the other songs on the cd are great to. This is something that you want to spen you money on this alblum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arena Rock Isn't Dead","review":"These Mississippi rockers list Rush and Megadeth as their influences, but really they sound more like an updated,down to earth version of 80's bands like Def Leppard and Tesla. While reading those names may scare you, this record is in fact a well done rock record, brimming with hooks and songs dealing with everyday life. The theme of being let down and struggling to get out of their small town pretty much permeates every song; from the daydreaming \\"Be Like That\\" to the defiant \\"Duck And Run.\\" \\"Down Poison\\" does actually sound like Megadeth-lite and \\"Loser\\" tries to combine the mellow elements of Alice In Chains with a bridge comprised of heavy Metallica riffing. The scary thing is: all of it works....whatever the concoction or combination of styles. They may not be original, but they know how to rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you've heard and loved Kryptonite buy this album!","review":"Is one of the best albums I own. I discovered this band by pure coincidence when searching for some MP3's of The Doors and found a song called Kryptonite since I didn't know The Doors had a song called that I downloaded it and found they were not The Doors but that song AMAZED me so much I went and buy Better Life album the next day, it's simply amazing.

It has a meaning to it and i think that its kind od addicting. Its so full of life. I definately suggest buying this cd. Its totally worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor album, even laughable at times","review":"This album proves the theory that if given the right breaks, any band that can put music together can get a record deal.Three Doors Down impressed the hell out of me with \\"Kryptonite\\", and \\"Loser\\" is a decent song as well. I decided to give the album a whirl.. let me tell you that almost every other song on the album is one in the same. Weak, repetative guitar licks, backed by weak, often pitiful lyrics.This album has no appeal whatsoever, and nothing to offer except what the radio plays. It almost seems as if Three Doors Down recorded the two radio hits first, then scrapped the rest of the album together in a day or two. Unless these guys change something drastic for the next album, we'll never hear from Three Doors Down again."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The emperor has no clothes!\\"","review":"Although this was promoted as \\"alternative rock\\", the music and trend seems distinctly closer to something Billy Ray Cyrus or Garth Brooks would do (I dislike country music as much as I do rap music, so that view may be biased.)I listened to this entire CD at a used record store am embarrased to see how anyone could say this is good, much less OK! I thought the singer was a bewildered Brian Setzer (who has only occasionally resurfaced after leaving the Stray Cats) and that the rest of band members just reeked. I've seen a novice Bluegrass band from a New Orleans bayou play better music than these guys!If you want good music, get any CDs from Lifehouse, Oleander, Matthew Good Band, or Coldplay (the only four current good alt-rocks bands that are out right now.) But \\"Down\\" deserves the door!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The cd is horrible","review":"Kryptonite was good, but the rest of the cd isn't good at all. The lyrics, mainly set me off. In all their songs(except kryptonite) they talk about killing themselves. You have to really listen to the lyrics to realize the message they're giving, but that doesn't change anything. They also cuss in some of their songs. I really don't recommend this cd. After listening to it, you will be in the worst mood. I personally don't like rotting my mind with that kind of stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage, rubbish.","review":"This is music for the small minded masses of middle America. Nothing new, horrible fake sounding production, no dynamics, hookless hooks, embarrasing lyrics, half a$$ed \\"heaviness\\", annoying southern drawl. This is a terrible, terrible band. You have to live in a cultural vacuum to be able to tolerate listening to this drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"3 Doors Down is a waste of your hard earned money. Buy, bad...don't buy, good. I personnally thought it waz the wworst CD I have ever heard! The songs all sounded the same or closely linked in different ways. If your gonna impress me 3 doors down, better start changing your songs up a bit because they just don't sound good!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How can this be happening?","review":"I've tried to buy into the hype about this band, but after repeated listening, I can only come away from the session with a sincere feeling of frustation about the sake of Rock and Roll today.Where is the dedication to an innovative idea? How about some element of mastery of your instrument? What happen to creativity? Re-hashed, un-envolved, un-inspired and bland music are all that I can find located on this CD. How long have these guys been playing? Months? Weeks? DAYS?It's a sad time in the history of Rock and Rock if this is decided to be the best of the new.What's next? Kid Rock elected to the RnR Hall of Fame? Kill me now, please!I can already see the future commercial for K-TEL's latest compilation disc.\\"Hey man is that Crappy High School Rock?

This is a horrible horrible band, with worthless passive music, and the worst lyrics shat out since \\"Baby I'm-a want you\\". The perfect mix between Gin Blossoms and the Goo Goo Dolls? Oh, yeah, now THERE'S a winning combination-- Kids, when you buy this, you're just throwing another shovel load on Rock's (hopefully) temporary grave. Mainstream rock will get good again, to be sure, but it's by no means in a good way right now, and 3 Doors Down isn't helping.Seriously-- \\"Kryptonite\\"-- Those are the worst lyrics I have ever heard. Ever. Are the Flaming Lips the only band that can write a song about Superman without making me want to throw up?"},{"rating":"2","title":"3 Doors Down's debut is awesome!","review":"3 Doors Down's debut album is awesome. The band plays every kind of rock and roll and they don't swear in a single song. Some of the best songs are \\"Kryptonite,\\" \\"Loser,\\" \\"Be Like That,\\" \\"Down Poison\\" and \\"Life Of My Own.\\" If you're a rock and roll lover, I recommend this album to you. There are great lyrics and great music. I can't wait for their next album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A personal favorite","review":"This CD has to be one of the best I have in my collection. Every track is playable, and the group, while focusing mainly on rock, shifts off into slower gear in tracks 5 (Be Like That) and 8 (Down Poison), which is a refreshing compromise. Although track 10 (Smack) does run a little overboard on the metal sound, the rest of the album is excellent. On track 7, the title track, I was quite surprised at something I'd never heard -- a key change in the middle of a verse! Very interesting, adding flavor to that song. This group adds flavor to the rock world as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite cds!","review":"I'm not really into rock that much, but my sister insisted I give her 3DD cd a listen. I was blown away. These guys got me into rock music. Even if you don't like rock you will love this cd. BUY THIS CD!!! I can't wait for a new cd from the band! They have so much potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't listen to the \\"official\\" reviewer!","review":"True, you can hear hints of Candlebox, Metallica, and many other influences on this MISSISSIPPI based band. Jason doesn't even know where they are from! I would highly recommend this CD. It may not set your pants on fire, but you will listen to whole thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"cd defect","review":"I love the music that I ordered but there was a small problem. I could not listen to it without it skipping because of a manufactures defect called silve that went across the disc that would not allow clean play. It would keep skipping. The reason I know what it was is because I work at a cd manufacturing company that makes cd's and dvd's this disc could not have possible passed there inspection test without failing for an uncorrectable error or e22 error. This is not amazons fault though so I will still continue to order through them, I just got a bad disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good new band","review":"I do not think this album takes full advantage of 3 Doors Down's talent, but it's still a relentlessly rocking album with plenty of riffs. Some of the riffs are vaguely Mettalica-ish, with others being more like Stone Temple Pilots. There's a morose passion in many of the songs like on \\"Loser.\\" \\"Kryptonite\\" has awesome guitar and the album doesn't quite reach the heights of that song except for maybe on the song \\"Better Life,\\" but the album is filled with enjoyable moments."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice group, nice cd","review":"3 Doors Down deliver a Sponge, Creed & Days Of The New style alterno rock. good stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Take me back","review":"When I first heard the song \\"kryptonite\\" on the radio I knew I had to find out who this group was. As an old rock-n-roller it brought me back to the early 80's with a rhythm I didn't think was here any longer. The tempo and the lyrics reminded me of the dance clubs I hung out in 1984. I hope Three Doors Down has a long and rewarding career and I have the opportunity to enjoy their artistry for many years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good ol' Rock n' Roll","review":"\\"The Better Life\\" is a strong debut for 3DD, sounding a bit like the band Creed on steroids, but with better riffs and a more straightforward attitude. Each song is well done, so you can let it play straight through without having to hit the skip button all the time. Standout tracks: Kryptonite, Loser, Be Like That, and Duck and Run. Good Buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"This cd is pretty good. I thought they'd just be a 1 hit wonder. But I was so wrong. Loser is one of my favorites along with So I Need You.

They have the qualities of both. Which any \\"real\\" cook will understand and know how to use these pans as they were designed to be used.If you do not understand why Calphalon has designed these pans, then stick with your 16 pc tin set you got for $9.99 at your local discount center. Do not buy these, you will not appreciate them."},{"rating":"2","title":"greatest pans EVER!!","review":"First, I will agree with the review that says that these pans are not totally nonstick and not totally stick. But that's the idea. I love these pans because you can use whatever utensil you want, even metal ones, without fear of wrecking the pan. They might not be the best pans for eggs or hashbrowns, since you really don't want those to stick, but if you're browning a roast, you want that to stick a little to get that beautiful fond on the pan, which comes right up very easily when you deglaze! For everyday things like hashbrowns or eggs, then you should buy the Calphalon One Nonstick versions... they are just as awesome but nonstick instead, which translates to NO METAL UTENSILS!!! Simple as that. Best pans for the money, period.Just don't put them in the dishwasher as my roommates did to 2 of my Calphalon One saucepans. They ended up buying me 2 new pans to replace the dishwasher damaged ones (roughly 300 bucks!!!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique mathematics book","review":"This book is almost unique among mathematics books in that it strives to ensure that you have the clearest picture possible of the topics under discussion. For example almost every text that discusses spectral sequences introduces them as a completely abstract machine that pumps out theorems in a mysterious way. But it turns out that all those maps actually have a clear meaning and Bott and Tu get right in there with clear diagrams showing exactly what those maps mean and where the generators of the various groups get mapped. It's clear enough that you can almost reach out and touch the things :-) And the same is true of all of the other constructions in the book - you always have a concrete example in mind with which to test out your understanding.That makes this one of my all time favourite mathematics texts."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few good styles buried under pages of useless information","review":"Learning how to care for and style your hair seems to take a back seat to a distracting, absurd, and irrelevant storyline of four fictional girlfriends. I did manage to find a few hairstyles that I liked, making it more or less worth the $13.57. I'm all for trying a new look, but this book is innundated with downright ridiculous hairstyles. The photos are not labeled with what style it is, so it is frustrating to try and match styling instructions with the look you would like to achieve. The layout is visually overstimulating and chaotic, making it difficult to find simple answers to styling questions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Complete","review":"This book is great! Its a combination of his 4 books (Vacation, City, Big Date and Big Day Hair). The pictures are beautiful, the writing is simple and there is pretty much everything you need to know about hairstyling in one book. Everything is broken down into easy to follow steps and tells you what you need before you start. But if you already have his other 4 books, I don't think this has any new material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy this book to be told what you are doing wrong","review":"The tips in this book are not for real people, they are written for people who have too much time and money to spend on their hair. I do not know anyone who actually has the time to wash, condition and blow dry their hair in the manner detailed in this book, let alone style it. The author makes it sound like you MUST blow dry your hair and coat it with expensive styling products in order for it to be healthy; there is something wrong with that thinking. If you have the time and the money to spend hours on your hair, this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This book reminds me more of a teen magazine than an adult, \\"get the job done\\" book. The pictures seemed more intent on selling figures than hair. There are some good tips on how to do hair, but not on styles and step-by-step procedures. I am returning the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Unimpressed","review":"Sorry, didn't like it. For one, i was expecting a little more \\"how-to\\" info, which this does NOT provide. It has these rather stupid characters it follows to illustrate tips and what not to do. Just not impressed. It did have a few hairstyles I might try out, but overall I was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"good text from a teacher's point of view","review":"I liked this text and might adopt it for my classes. Economics is not an easy subject but Prof. McEachern's text is clearly written. The end of chapter summary of key ideas help to clarify what the chapter was about. The problems and exercises are rigorous, but within reach of anyone who has had algebra.The case studies bring a real world aspect to the material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"This book is terrible. The author is for one thing extremely dull. Worst though is the questions he expects you to answer at the end of most chapters. The examples he gives while reading the chapter are totally different from the questions he asks at the end of the chapters. As a result of this you are left asking yourself, when the hell did we do this?????? To make matters worse their is no answer key to any of this, so even if you attempt to answer the questions, you will never even know if you did them right or not! Stay away from this book if possible, take a teacher who uses another book, because this book is very poor. In my class, probably half dropped because of this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"*yawn* I've seen much better then this.","review":"I am not sure if it was the lighting or the camera work (or the editing for that matter), or the costumes, or the performances themselves, but this is not the best tribal fushion belly dance compuliation out there that I have watched. A lot of the performances were mediocre at best. Their movements were miniscule if they did movements at all. And I'm sorry but fire dancing and rolling on the floor in wannabe Princess Leia costumes does not make for a tribal performance. I am sure all of these women have much better performances that can be seen live or at least on YouTube, but they didn't bring it to the carpet on this DVD. Kami Liddle & Elisheva's performance saves this DVD but only by a fractional margin. The only two things I could tell that made this gothic at all were -some- of the costumes and -some- of the music that was used. That's about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bellydance Underworld","review":"The CD was in perfect condition the cover however was quite worn. I was a little disappointed in that I thought I was getting a product in better condition. Nevertheless, the CD is great and the performances are inspiring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Too Convoluted. Nothing New In Here","review":"I've read some 30 books on story craft and this is easily one of the least useful of the bunch. This author doesn't believe in Outlines but this book could have definitely benefitted from one. Not only is the information put forth in a confusing manner, the author compounds this by attempting such things as trying to make up new terminology for age old story elements (apparently in an attempt to sound original and to convince you she has some pearls of knowledge that no one else has thought of).If you're looking for a useful source of story elements, this isn't the book. \\"Story\\" by McKee \\"The Writer's Journey\\" by Vogler and \\"Building Better Plots\\" by Kernen are FAR better, and more importantly, they are straight forward and easy to use in regards to your own work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical","review":"As the writer of several unfinished novels, I was looking for a new way to approach plotting--some concrete advice to stop me and my stories from petering out. This book might just be what I needed. The author presents a very clear and practical plan for structuring a story from beginning, through the middle, and to the end without resorting to an outline. Her (his?) advice about planning ahead to the next set piece has gotten me excited about trying again. The attempts to be relevent to \\"literary\\" fiction seem a little half-hearted, but if story is the center of your fiction, this book will help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not about Plot","review":"I've read this book twice, the first time several years ago, and just recently when deciding if I needed to keep it. From the time I first read it, I've had a couple novels published. If this book had been named \\"Some Stuff About Writing,\\" it would have been okay. But unfortunately, it does not address the subject of Plot in a organized fashion, and was not useful to me when I was trying to learn how to plot. As other reviewers have mentioned, the author's use of some terms is unique. If I went to a meeting of writers and started talking about The Rule of Three, I would receive strange looks. Some neat things in the book, but it does not live up to its title."},{"rating":"1","title":"About the Author","review":"I have been reading the 1 star reviews and most of them complain that they can't find any of the author's other work to read to see if she is actually a bad writer. It seems that none of the reviewers had the brain power to actually look up the author. While Wikipedia was only 4 years old when one of the reviews was written, the name Ansen (Anson) Dibell could have been Googled. Her real name was Nancy Ann Dibble. One of her books was Pursuit of the Screamer written in 1978. The last thing she wrote was published in 1985 and this book was written in 1988. That should be a clue as to its awfulness. 1) it was written in the 80's, and 2) it was written by a woman. Now I am not bashing women, but I have read sci-fi and fantasy stories written by women, and not one of the books was any good. Dragons of Summer Flame by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman was one of the worse fantasy stories I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Weakest Writers Digest Books","review":"As far as I can tell there is no textual difference between the \\"1999\\" paperback edition shown here and the earlier 1988 hardcover version.It's a rambling pastiche of ideas and commentary on various aspects of writing, with only loose homage paid to the actual topic of \\"plot.\\" There is much better guidance available on most of the wide array of topics the author touches on so briefly (and inadequately) in this book. One's time would surely be better spent with such helpful titles as:Plot & Structure: Techniques And Exercises For Crafting A Plot That Grips Readers From Start To Finishby James Scott Bell.Beginnings, Middles & Endsby Nancy Kress.Characters & Viewpointby Orson Scott Card.I'm not saying there is nothing at all valuable in the Dibell book; that's why I assign it two stars rather than one. But it's too much effort for too little result to extract the value."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you only buy one book to help you be a writer...","review":"Trust me when I say I've read ALL the books on helping you become a better writer. This is HANDS-DOWN the best guide I've ever purchased. Although it covers PLOT, the author incorporates other aspects of writing in correlation to the subject. Better yet, she uses examples of several stories that you'll KNOW and RELATE to in order to make her points more valid and tangible.The author does not waste space with useless instruction; she is concise and personable at the same time. Honestly, her method of guiding a writer to improve was more inspiring and motivating than any seminar I've taken. I don't think you can even buy a new copy of this book anymore, and that's a shame, but if you can find a used one....GET IT IMMEDIATELY!I use PLOT when I teach Creative Writing classes. When you read it, you'll understand why."},{"rating":"2","title":"small but powerful book on writing","review":"This is one book on writing fiction I will read over and over. I especially love his take on parallel plots and how to mirror and echo repeating patterns to highlight the big scenes. It's a no nonsense book with advice I have not read in any other book on writing. I give this book a 5 star and if you do buy this book savor every word."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"Compared to 1.0 and Onda, this one left me cold. Maybe it was a little too quiet and moody for my tastes... I wanted upbeat dance numbers, and this didn't deliver that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Susan rocks!","review":"The way Susan sings and plays guitar makes you want to get up and move! Isn't that what it's all about? Her voice is amazing, and it's been said before that she sounds a bit like a mix of Janis Joplin and Bonnie Raitt, but she's also her own. Get this album and listen to it, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lover of all music","review":"No it isn't a perfect album. But that is what blues is about. If you listen to Stevie Ray Vaughn, I mean really listen.....he makes a few mistakes as well, but you take that in the whole picture and he is beyond doubt, the best. I sorely miss him, what a terrible lose. But all in all Susan, is a fine blues singer in her own right, and I look forward to hearing more of her in the future.........Keep on singing Susan.....we love you."},{"rating":"2","title":"This lady will surprise you!","review":"This is a great CD and if you like blues buy it. When you see this young lady on the CD cover you will be shocked by her powerful voice. There are a number of very good tunes. You like rock? Then (\\"Rock Me Right\\") should move you. As for blues check out (\\"You need to be with me\\"), (\\"Little by Little\\"),the title cut (\\"Just won't burn\\") and my favorite (\\"Friar's point\\"). And if you like John Prine you will love her cover of (\\"Angel from Montgomery\\"). I look forward to Susan Tedeschi's next CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best new blues artist in 10 years!","review":"Caught Susan in Greensboro, NC on Sept 17, 1998. She opened BB King's blues tour and stole the show. Great stage presence! Bought her disc the next day. She's tremendous!Her voice is much like Bonnie Raitt's but with more growl and edge. Perhaps somewhere between Bonnie & Janis Joplin (I said this BEFORE reading the liner notes!).The disc is excellent! It channels that energy you'd found in a small club and creates a heart-pumping CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great voice, lousy guitar","review":"If only Susan could find a professional backup band she would be impossible to top. Vocals are great, strong and soulful, but please find a good guitar player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps I should move to Boston....","review":"This one barely edges the formidable new release from Shemekia Copeland to have my vote for best new release of the year (so far).

Now it never leaves my cd player. So what if it's not pure blues? Susan Tedeschi has a powerful, bluesy voice and she is even better live. She stole the show at Baltimore's Artsfest. I had people coming up to me after the show saying \\"who was THAT, she's great!\\" If you like Bonnie Raitt, i can't imagine you wouldn't love this."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am blown away by this CD. She is GREAT.","review":"I have just discovered Susan Tedeschi and am thrilled with her music. It's been decades since anyone has come along with her energy and force; I think Janis is involved in Susan's spirit. She is awesome and her music feels like food to a starving blues listener. She is HOT. Listen to her! You will be thrilled, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have. The electric blues CD of the 90's","review":"Of all the up and coming new artists playing the blues, Susan Tedeschi has hit the best combination of the authentic blues form and the present time.

What hoter dat woman got. Yo pice up with dat slamin blue."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mediocrity","review":"One star to help balance off all these four and five star reviews. I think this CD is very mediocore (two stars really). She can sing okay, but she has no dynamic in her vocal. The songs are pretty formula and bland, \\"nothing particularly bright about 'em.\\" STINKY guitar playing. I am never going to trust customer reviews to buy a CD again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Won't Cut It","review":"Those critics perhaps have a better understanding of blues than most listeners. Look at the customer comments carefully, and see how many of them say that Tedeschi is \\"just like Janis Joplin\\" or words to that effect. That should tip you off. While I think this effort has its fine moments, it sure comes across as someone trying desperately to painstakingly mimic the Joplin style. Perhaps this is because Tedeschi, like many other performers these days, is well aware of the seemingly unsatiable thirst of baby-boomers for nostalgia. Tedeschi may sound fine, but you have to ask, \\"Why listen to a Joplin clone when you can still get the original stuff of Janis?\\" In my view, most of the songs on \\"Just Won't Burn\\" would work well in a \\"Saturday Night Live\\" skit which parodies Janis Joplin -- not as great blues for the 1990s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't even warm-up!","review":"I have seen Susan Tedeschi, and was totally underwhelmed by what I heard. SHe seems to have a powerful PR machine behind her, probably the same one that tries to convence us that Kenny Wayne Shepard, Jonny Lang and Shannon Curfman are \\"Blues\\" people. Anyone who is serious and \\"really\\" knows the Blues genre and realizes that it is more than just hard rock blues guitar played by someone not old enough to get into a bar, have a wife or facing an uncertain future. I suspect that most reviewer giving her 5 stars are the same people who give Kenny, Jonny and Shannon 5 stars. Either they don't have a clue or a clue or hint of blues is all they can really relate to. Debra Coleman is the one to be heard and listened to, not just because she is the a black woman born of the blues tradition, but because she is the real deal not trying to play at being a blues artist. Debra's playing reflects rock influenced elements but her voice is pure blues as is her song writng."},{"rating":"1","title":"More ham, anyone?","review":"I bought this record having read some positive press, what a let down! The vocals are so over the top and hammy - it's a complete joke. It's like a bad Bonnie Raitt parody -especially \\"Angel From Montgomery\\". Bonnie should slap her around for that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I get less repetition?","review":"A local station, KMTT, has been playing Tedeschi's album for a couple years now and to be completely honest, I AM SICK OF IT! If I hear the amazingly redundant \\"You Need to Be with Me\\" (or any other of her songs for that matter) again, I will throw up! Granted, Tedeschi has talent and a great persona but she is no Bonnie Raitt and she is certainly not Janis Joplin reincarnated! Now, she is nominated for a Grammy for best new artist almost two years after the release of \\"Just Won't Burn\\"? It befuddles the mind! Oh well! If you love the sound of someone playing the same 5 chords and repeating the same lyric over and over, buy this album. I guarantee that you will throw it away soon after."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is blues?","review":"Get real. this girl stinks. it is \\"cut and paste blues\\". she has no real identity of her own, I don't care who she has toured with, she needs vocal lessons and guitar lessons in a big way. buy some muddy waters or something if you like the blues. it is a waste of money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hail Gilda!","review":"Gilda Radner has risen from the dead to do a Janis Joplin imitation.

I bought this disc in anticipation of the B.B.King Blues Festival coming to town. What a disappointment though. Susan can really wail and will just get better with time. The biggest problem is the guitar playing on this disc. I have to skip certain tracks when I listen to this CD because the lead work is so awful. I hope that I'm pleasantly surprised when I see her next week in concert. If you're looking for a newer artist whose CD you can listen to all the way through, try Tommy Castro's Right as Rain instead. No bad tracks on that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Susan Tedeschi blues singer","review":"Susan Tedeschi and Bonnie Riatt are my favorite female blues singers. On this cd Susan really belts it out with unbelievable feeling. She has been described as a cross between Bonnie Riatt and Janis Joplin. Fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest blues in a long time....","review":"I have been listening for a long time for some new sound. Since I bought the first Bonnie Raitt album when i was a senior in high school, i have not hit anyone who can rock and blues like Susan! Great sound, great energy...all from a little person. Check her out live...you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's out of this world","review":"Man, you guys got your head in your fannys,i just saw her live in Rochester NY,and she had people from 6 to 60 danceing.A star is being born.I hope you don't get paid for reviewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"This girl can wail!","review":"I popped this CD into my player when it arrived and felt I was back in college around 1970 listening to some of the old Bonnie Raitt albums I had before she was discovered! I cranked up the sound system so high for her song Hurt So Bad that my teenage sons complained! Now I'm convinced we have to see her live. She is such a neat cross between Bonnie and Janice with that voice of hers, it really gets me hopping. You go girl!"},{"rating":"2","title":"On my player for a month.","review":"What a great major label debut. I love this lady's music. I've listened to Bonnie Raitt for 26 years and this young lady grabs me the same way that Bonnie did on her self-titled debut album. Can't wait to hear more from Susan Tedeschi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tedeschi Magic!","review":"Susan Tedeschi is an amazing artist. She combines Janis Joplin and Bonnie Raitt's gifts to create an amazing sound. Once you have heard her amazing talent every thing else will pale!In other words...SHE ROCKS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ok, but there are better","review":"this album seemed very \\"sterile\\" and some of the songs were poorly constructed. I don't think she deserved the grammy, the other artists have sold several million copies of their albums and have better music and arrangements for their songs. i do agree that Beth Hart is very talented and can do the same with her voice in coming in softer then tearing it up. Beth also has a Joplin styling in her voice too and seems more passionate. I also thought that susan's vocals did not seem to show much of a range, like Mariah Carey or somebody, so I really wasn't overwhelmed. I know I will be bashed by the \\"susan Lovers\\" in the house, but I am entitled to my opinion and i definately think she needs work."},{"rating":"1","title":"No dynamic = big bore","review":"Sounds like Bonnie Raitt on amphetamines - there is no dynamic to her vocals whatsoever, - all one speed (high). As a result, the CD gets boring really fast. A comparable problem to Natalie Merchant, who sounds dosed on valium, no dynamic whatsover- all one speed (low). Another bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"good singer, lousy songs","review":"Susan can belt it out, but her albums suffer from bad song selection (of mostly bad songs) and third rate production (they just plain out don't sound good). You can really hear it on the radio when one of these songs is played back to back with pretty much anything else. I think she could make real good records if she had decent production and better song choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Janis, Not Melissa, Not Bonnie, Not interesting","review":"I bought this based on the number of 5 star reviews here. Guess I found out why they make chocolate and vanilla ice cream. There's a spark of potential there, but to mention this singer in the same breath as Janis Joplin is ludicrous. Anyone who compares her Angel From Montgomery with Bonnie R's cannot honestly say Susan is ready for prime time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bonnie and Janis? I don't think so.","review":"She can obviously sing, but the CD really isn't worth the 12 bucks - it's so over the top it's aggravating, and the production and songs suck. Let me know when she calms down and starts to make MUSIC."},{"rating":"1","title":"C'mon folks . . .","review":"OK, I have to admit I'm being very hard on the woman -- she is quite a talent. But GEEZ, Susan, give up playing the Bonnie Raitt wanna-be with \\"Angel From Montgomery\\" which you latched onto as your \\"signature\\" encore in your live shows -- more like a forged signature, since Bonnie Raitt has been doing that for 20 years or more, and your version is ripped right from her performances. No points in my book for flagrant disregard/respect for your elders."},{"rating":"1","title":"uh...","review":"It seems that this CD rates high amongst the illiterate community (see following review). Perhaps I too should speak in run-on sentence form and say that this CD is an unmitigated piece of garbage from a third-rate artist of the quality you can see in any bar anywhere most any night and, gosh, it really is a piece of garbage, and hugh, duh...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinks.

A friend brought her copy with us on vacation and I went out and bought it for myself as soon as we got home! I was hooked! I was never a real blues fan (although for the most part I like all kinds of music), but now I find myself seeking out other blues musicians to experiance. Thank you Susan Tedeschi for opening new doors for me and keeping me ROCKIN!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"I heard one of her songs and bought this CD back in the late 90's and I absolutely loved it. I lost it some where along the way and I really wish it was available for download. This is one I will absolutely buy again if Amazon makes it available."},{"rating":"2","title":"This girl is awesome, reminds me of Janice Joplin.","review":"I fell in love with Susan's unique sound the first time I heard her. She has strong vocals that remind me of Janice Joplin. I look for her to be a household name in the world of blues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sue Tedeschi--views of a \\"senior\\" admirer","review":"I have loved blues for as long as I can remember, and I am a 66 year old female. Janis Joplin has always been the one to really stir me up, but I must say that Sue's new song \\"It Hurts so Bad\\" gives me the feelings that I haven't gotten from any female singer since Janis. When I heard Sue had received a grammy nomination I was thrilled. Sue and Carlos, my two favorites, were both nominated. How exciting. Sue is just beginning to show what she can do, and I think we will hear a lot of positive things about this performer in the years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't let the cover fool you....","review":"This little girl has got a great soulful voice. I haven't heard a girl wail like Susan Tedechi since Janis Joplin. Rockin guitar rifts make this a great blues album."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Bought and its been in my Cars CD Changer for Three Years","review":"I just read the amazon review. It misses the point on this one. This is a woman who sticks with something simple tried and true and she does a great job doing it. I like listeining to her music and everyone that hears it wants to know who it is and where to buy it. I don't believe she has any pretensions about what she playsc and if her band played regularly in my town, I'd be there hanging out every Saturday night."},{"rating":"2","title":"was half asleep and heard Tedeschi for first time.!!!!","review":"...she brought both my husband and I out of a lazy slumber...caught her on Conan O'brian...was immediately impressed...cant wait to see her in person...if she is anything at all like her spot on CO'B's....shes dynamite"},{"rating":"2","title":"Little person,Big Sound!!","review":"Saw Susan at blues fest in upstate New York.She wowed the place.Bought Just Wont Burn the same day.Turned alot of people on to it.They loved it as much as I do.Take it for what it is,Blues that wont dissapoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Threat of a white guitar slinging blues woman","review":"It seems that if you are white and a blues singer you are cursed. You are never expected to fully comprehend the blues. Nor are you capable of singing them with the proper suffering and angst. Well it appears all that has changed. Susan has managed to revive a dying style of music. She has sucessfully combined rock and blues into a style that only Janis and Bonnie were able to do. However, Susan sounds better than Janis and she plays the guitar as well as Bonnie. It is unfortunate that we now live in an age when people have become self proclaimed experts (2 reviews down). Don't feel threatened by them. Let them play. Let the music be your master."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rocks me right.","review":"Saw Susan in Pittsburgh after purchasing this CD. The women rocked my world. Her voice is better live! Great performer who enjoys her music. I have high hopes that her career keeps growing. Look out ladies of Lillith in Motown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, not great","review":"Susan Tedeschi is a legitimate blues player, but not nearly the type of musician deserving of so much hype. The comparisons to Janis and Bonnie would be unfair, except that she seems to invite it--doing \\"Angel From Montgomery\\" in a knock-off version of Ms.Raitt's. She is much more successful on her take of \\"Momma, He Treats Your Daughter Mean\\", at least THAT sounds original! The ability to take a standard, and reshape it into something unique, is what separates the great blues players from the pack. Right now, Ms. Tedeschi is learning this."},{"rating":"1","title":"She can sing, but shoot the guitar player","review":"I really dig Susan's voice, and I believe she has passion for her music. However, the songs she chose to sing, the guitar solos, and price I paid for this cd really, well, suck. I dont think I have ever heard such immature, stylistically shallow, and, well, sucky solos on a \\"produced and released\\" album ever! I mean, didnt someone listen to this cd before they released it? My suggestion: get someone to burn you the songs you like, and save your money for Buddy Guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Living Blues Review Is Rediculous","review":"Susan Tedeschis' 1st commercially released CD is very good. The Living Blues reviewer obviously dosen't appreciate Susan's attempt to release a varied album. I look forward to seeing her music mature in the coming years."},{"rating":"1","title":"just won't burn...for real","review":"I bought this CD after hearing her for the first time on a local radio station. I was excited at the prospect of the appearance of a new female blues singer/guitarist and couldn't wait to hear all of the tracks. However, after listening to the disc twice (a general rule of thumb for me is to listen to an album twice before making a judgement) I became bored with her monotonous style of singing. I felt the guitar solos were lukewarm and ineffective. The whole album seemed to be detached from the real essence of the blues which is of course the expression of profound feeling ie, anger, desire, sadness, hopelessness, and even joy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A perplexing album","review":"This CD had the potential to be really great, but for one thing: Ms. Tedeschi for whatever reason was allowed to play her own solo bits. Why? Who knows. But they absolutely ruin otherwise rockin' tracks, and as a muscian I can't understand why her amateurish (at best) playing was ever allowed onto this album. Chalk it up to producer incompetence if you wish.Ms. Tedesci does have one of the great new voices I've heard, that is one thing no one can argue. However, I find it exceedingly difficult to enjoy any one song due to her poor work on the guitar. In the future she would do well to leave the guitar to the professional studio musicians until her performances cease resembling aural train wrecks. Practice time should not, after all, be conducted on a global stage."},{"rating":"1","title":"like this? Beth Hart is better","review":"I put 1 star as i feel these reviews are overrated. Susan tedeschi is ok, but definately needs more work to expect to enjoy any longevity in the music business. If you want to hear a great singer that sounds MORE like Janis Joplin and Bonnie Raitt AND HAS BETTER control of music and her voice, then I would recommend Beth Harts new album over this one. Sorry! Pick up BETH HART'S new album instead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Leave out the headphones","review":"This protector is great, it keeps all the corners covered and has a carrying strap.

Sometimes, if you have a white piece of paper, clear, 12-point text, you can get 80% accuracy, but this is a rare occurrence.I ended up spending more time \\"correcting\\" the text from the Iris Pen than I would have typing it out...so now my $70 \\"tool\\" sits unused on my desk.I can't wait for the day that an actual pen-scanner works, but today is not that day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT get this product","review":"This product fails miserably at every type of text I tried.

I spent more time scanning, pasting, and FIXING the errors than I would have ever spent typing the text directly myself.This isn't even a good value if it were offered FREE because of the frustration level. Plus, as a Mac user, it is so clunky as to make me want to throw it out the window (I returned it instead).Do NOT buy this unless 1) you have a very high frustration tolerance 2) you like using white-out 3) you have $100 you want to waste or 4) need to own every gadget, even if they don't remotely work.Have I been clear enough how little I think of this product???Cheers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor product","review":"This 'scanner' is a joke.

A little edgier, sometimes serious, but at the same time touching and satisfyingly romantic. The theme, a sister who falls in love with her twin's estranged husband, would probably be too edgy for a traditional romance but the author handles the topic in such a skillful manner I laughed for, ached for, and cheered for the hero and heroine.

He's a fabulous piano player, an excellent conductor, and now, come to find out, he's kept up on his guitar playing.....Now, I'm not a guitarist, so I don't really know the intricacies of style for the instrument, but I can say this; this album is just plain fine guitar playing. It's good finger-picking, done right and no frills and no funny business. Most of the album is on the quiet side, but the Paniolo Reel gets pretty \\"down home\\".

There is something about it that reaches into you and begins to pull out tension and stress. I can feel my breathing becoming calmer, but it is more than physical relaxation. There is something deeply reassuring and emotionally satisfying about this music, as if your energy is shifting to a higher vibration and being rearranged into a more beautiful pattern at a core level. Everyone who listens asks me where they can get this album. I also highly recommend their newer albums, although this remains my very favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb work","review":"In my opinion, this is Liquid Mind's best work. If you haven't listened to this type of music before it is quite different. There is no beat, no melody, but drifting synthesizers that rise and dance on a theme of inspiration and grace. If you're looking for Yanni type New Age music you won't like this. If you're looking for something that plays well in the background as you do your work or meditate, this just might be the cd for you. One of my favorites.I gave it to my father who leads a meditation healing group at his church. They play this cd during their session and people really find it promotes an atmosphere of quiet positivity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Numb Resemblance","review":"Balance is a mirror of Chuck Wild's first project (Ambience Minimus) 3 years earlier. Unfortunately there is no forward progress in the Liquid Mind series. There is more warmth than it's predacesor \\"Slow World\\", but that ethereal \\"Ambience Minimus\\" tone is lacking. Here the tone tends to be outlaid rather than uprisen. Yes it dose maintain that flowing monochromatic state and it's planes dissolve well with some interesting soundshifting. But that is not enough to make this project appealing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have for Horse Lovers","review":"Jockeys is a show from Animal Planet. It follows a group of jockeys at the Santa Anna racetrack during the month before the Breeder's Cup. It is a fascinating look into what really goes on behind a horse race. I learned so much. The show is fast paced and is very easy to get addicted to. I made my brother watch the first episode and he hates horses but ended up watching the entire season with me. I feel that the DVD is well worth the money if you enjoy horse racing and or horses. If you are not into the races then you may not enjoy this show.

Carl Humphries is a clear, concise writer who gives you a wealth of information.

I was very impressed when I picked it up and read about the history of the piano and studied the detailed diagrams of how a piano's mechanisms work.Too bad I didn't stop there. I tried to actually learn to play piano using this book. I didn't get more than a few pages into that part before becoming hopelessly lost.I'm a rank beginner, so your experience might be better if you are already a skilled pianist.For a beginner, the Alfred Adult All-In-One has a much better pacing, better explanation of topics, and more pleasing choices of material. \\"The Complete Piano Player, Omnibus Edition\\" also looks pretty good. Just pass on this one, unless you want a coffee table book or are already an advanced piano player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Amazing book, the musical selections however are challenging with large gaps in the difficulty between pieces.

It had the same problem that a lot of beginner piano books have--the material is slow moving and BORING. Uninteresting songs/exercises make learning drudgery. I happened to be browsing the music section at a bookstore and found this book. I knew I had to have it as soon as I flipped through it. It had a wealth of material, unlike most beginner books, and the thoughtfulness of layout and detail were exciting. It's really a beautiful piece of work.I'm still near the start of this book, as I'm only working on song #15, but I'm having a good time with it. I've found that even the simpler songs in here are interesting. And I've learned more about reading music in a few weeks with this book than nearly a year with the software program. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautifull reference book","review":"A beautifull book, with excellent content for someone challenging himself to learn piano on its own. Excellent tuition program throughout the book, history of piano, music, references to CD music listening. Such a book format quality and size (partition spirale book is a must) for a very nice price. Carl humphries teaching qualities makes it a nice companion book supported by CD of practice pieces for a long time. Suggestion to the Author/Editor : what about releasing a DVD of played pieces to visualize piano playing technique and exercices?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for beginners","review":"I got this book a couple years ago. The beginning is good for beginners but it gets advanced very quickly. Now that I've started looking through the book again I feel like I actually have a chance of playing the excerpts now that my comprehension skills and technique are better (from doing Hanon with accented triplets and studying theory at dolmetsch.com). While the exercises IMO aren't very effective, the book is still very informative concerning different styles of music. It's definitely a good intermediate book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real treasure!","review":"I found this book by browsing Amazon.com and bought it based on other people's recommendations. I just received my copy and am totally thrilled with it! It is a visually stunning book and beautifully written. I am so happy to have found this book; it is very likely I would never have heard of it otherwise. Many of the pieces are beyond my playing level at this point, but it is a wonderful inspiration to me and gives me a great incentive to push forward with my studies. The accompanying CD is awesome; the pieces are played by the author and provide needed listening experience -- a very important feature missing in other books of this type."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best beginner book","review":"If you have prior experience and are looking to rekindle the fire, this may be the book... in which case it may deserve 4 or 5 stars.But I am a beginner, and there seems to be a lot of material delivered too fast!The good: Glossy pages, Spiral binding, a lot of material (it all looks complicated to me, so I guess it's good)The bad: Too much too fast, not a self learning beginner's book.I got the Alfred series, and I feel that their pace is much more in tune with my learning speed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense study","review":"Book starts out with a pictorial history, then moves into lessons.

Unfortunately, when you put the study guide and companion book together, you get nothing but confusion. You need to keep switching between books, exercises do not seem to match and on the CD you are not given enough time to respond to the words or phrases.The book does have some positives. It is attractively packaged and the study guide is colorfully illustrated.As an alternative, may I suggest the first text I completed.

The thermostat doesn't work every time. So, half the time it is turned on, it just stays on until the room is over 90 degrees even though the desired temperature is set at 72 degrees.

After over a week of either waiting for the heater to turn on during icy temperatures, or waking up sweating because it overheated the room by some 15 degrees, I am giving up and returning this item.The problem is that the thermostat on this heater is completely worthless. For some reason, the heater continues to heat up the room even after the set temperature has been reached, or it doesn't turn on even when the room is frigid and colder than the target temperature. For over a week now, I have woken up during the night because the heater has overshot the thermostat and heated the room to some 75 or 80 degrees, and this is when the thermostat was set for 65 degrees.I would absolutely NOT recommend this product.

In fact I bought this heater to replace the other one because it was loud and would turn off and on every two minutes all night long. This new one works well and the thermostat seems to be much better at keeping the room a constant temperature. We did worry a little about the very hot grill, because we're using it in our two year old's room. But he's smart enough now to know not to touch hot things and it's mainly on when he's in bed.

One was returned due to a dent on the grill, so only 1 is being used. This one is excellent. It works very quietly, completely noiseless. You almost don't know that it is turned on. It heats up pretty well. Keeps you warm and comfortable. Twice we forgot to turn it off, and it was left on overnight (we use it in our business). But next day, the business place was nice and warm, due to our oversight. The \\"caution\\" light has not turned on, even if we use it daily for over 8 hours straight. Operating it is simple. 1: Turn on the button, and 2: press the temperature, which you have previously set to lets say 75, and it's done. No further hassles. So all in all, this is a very good heater."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honeywell HZ519","review":"This is far above the others we have had. Quiet, thermostatically controlled, and throws off alot of heat"},{"rating":"2","title":"Honeywell HZ519 Low Profile Silent Comfort Heater","review":"My elderly father was having trouble keeping warm at nite. We searched the web for the highest rated heater and this one came out ahead as far as heating, safety and noise. NOISE-what noise? You have to put your hand over the heather to see if it's running. Dad hasn't been cold since getting the heater. Safety wise, they have enough room to ensure it's far enough from anything flamable but since it's rather long, others (with smaller rooms) may have a challenge finding a place with no combustibles nearby. Highly recommend the heater. Good value."},{"rating":"2","title":"honeywell HZ519 heater","review":"Very pleased with this product...highly recomended by [consumer products]...heater has preformed to perfection...instructions for the dummy make it simple to operate and it dose what i needed...have recomended this heater to several friends and i know of two who have bought same...they are as pleased as i am...enjoyed doing business with you and will be ordering other products...many thanks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Diappointed","review":"We were rather disappointed in this product. It didnt put out nearly the heat that we thought it would. And would have sent it back if it hadn't been for the shipping and restocking fee. It wouldn't have been worth the trouble and costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still running strong!","review":"I've had this unit 5 years now, and it shows no sign of slowing down. It's easy to use and has worked phenomenally. One word to the wise though, while it doesn't get hot enough to scald if you touch it, make no mistake that it gets very hot! I got this at a really great price, and have purchased a couple others over the years when I couldn't match it again. Bad move on my part, I just should've just coughed up the extra few bucks given the durability and performance of this unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"would buy again","review":"Needed a temporary work space in a 45 degree garage. I hung two sheets of plastic to create a 10x10x15 space. The heater can heat the space to about 75 degrees although the heater is turned up to 85. It takes about 30 minutes to raise the temperature 5 degrees as confirmed by the temperature read out on the unit and the warmth of the space. I want to point out the garage space is not insulated and the sheets of plastic are not securely fastened to both walls and ceiling.As soon as the heater is off, the temperature drops. The heater does make a difference. My previous space heater was a medium sized oil filled heater (which only worked in closed spaces).Also the unit does not get that hot in case you bump into it or leave it on overnight. Wish it had an auto on feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"patience","review":"Very disappointed! This product was bought for a small sun-porch area with brand new weatherized windows. We turned it on and it took one hour to heat 10 degrees and two hours to heat it to the 68 degrees-our desired temperature. This just was too long to wait to heat this room up. It also does not have a timer feature for turn on if we wanted to have it warm ahead of time. We were not willing to keep it on all the time either. Use this heater in a room that doesn't require heating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead after 1 winter","review":"I would have given this heater a great review during the first winter of use. But after putting it away for the summer, it no longer worked correctly when we tried it again. First the positives (assuming yours will work): It is completely quiet, it is low profile so it can be placed against a wall or floor board, the thermostat option is nice because you can set it for a certain temperature and it will turn itself on and off to maintain that temperature. HOWEVER, once we plugged ours back in the second winter, it would no longer keep to a certain temperature. No matter what we set it to, it would just get hotter and hotter. It took us several times of coming into our daugher's room to find the temep in there at 91 degrees before we realized it wasn't working and would no longer regulate itself. BOTTOM LINE: If you get one that works, it's a good heater. But if you don't get one that works, you're going to pay a lot of money for one season of heating."},{"rating":"1","title":"The story plot was different and I really disliked it!","review":"Twenty five years of Viola Thornhill is presented to the reader as a very sweet, caring woman. But one third into the book the reader discovers that she has a secret past. She had been one of London's most celebrated, most sought-after, most expensive courtesan. Now I figured when I read this, there must be a catch. The heroine in a romance novel is never a whore. I imagined that she must be the identical twin of this courtesan. Boy, was I surprised! Viola had a tragic past which forced her into this profession but regardless her past, it turned me off. The hero, Lord Ferdinand Dudley, falls in love with her. He turns out to be a twenty seven year old virgin. Half way through the book, I had enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most people will not find this helpful...","review":"because I'm not going to rehash the plot. It's been ably described by many. But how many people could buy into some of the situations Ms. Balogh gave us? The man a virgin at his age and at his station in life? Getting all the men of the ton to give back a woman's reputation after a meeting in the park?This author has frustrated me for the last time. There are several of her books that are on my all time list of best romances but in later years it is evident that she's writing to get a book out and not spending time on writing a story that begs to be told.The best thing about this book was the cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah, he's a virgin, so what?","review":"I know there are some things in this story that make us stretch our disbelief a little far, but don't be turned off by the negative reviews here. The characters are taken down paths not of their own choosing because of *pride* which makes people do stupid things all the time (even in the 21st century!) I loved this book, my first by this author, and ran out to get more the minute I finished it. I read about his brother's romance after I finished Ferdinand's so it was great to see him in more innocent times, then see how he had matured. I'd recommend you read them in order though... ;-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst book I've ever read so far.","review":"It was so boring that I couldn't finish reading it instead I put it in the trash. I don't understand what this woman was thinking about when she wrote the book. Very, very boring. I wish I could rated 0, but you can't."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"I cannot believe this author is the same who wrote \\"More Than A Mistress\\". Where is the tension and plot? This book is so boring that I couldn't even finish it. I don't like either of the main characters because they are not suitably matched. I hate weak men!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck?","review":"REALLY strange bad read. I love the first half of the book. Both characters delightful. Then we find out Viola secret. Not one I thought was that Viola was the Earl's [...] and things go down hill from there. Viola turns mean and nasty. Ferdinand can't talk sense to her. He offers to give her home back not good enough for her. He offers to marry and protect her with his family's name still not good enough. His sister and sister in law come to talk to her STILL not good enough. COME ON!I really don't understand why Ferdinand loved her after she changed. It really made no sense. I like a book with a LOT of drama but it must be believable for me to enjoy it. No Man's Mistress has a sweet ending. It the middle of the book ruins it. This my first book by Mary Balogh. I don't think I will be buying her books for her name. This not the worst book I have read but it's still pretty bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heed the warnings!","review":"I should have checked the reviews on this one before buying. Learned my lesson. Can't buy Mary Jo Putney without doing that anymore. The only reason I'm not giving this story one star is because it was good and kept my interest - until Viola's big reveal. I figured early on that she was a bastard and that it was her natural father who gave her the property. I was not prepared in the least for the wagering whore part - and she was a talented and good one too. Just yuck. My heroines don't have to be virgins, just not... this. And the reason that she was one made no sense at all. Ferdinand was likable enough. Charming, good-looking, sexy, a bit of a naughty fellow growing up. Yet, he was a virgin at 27. I'm sorry this reversal of rake/whore and angel/virgin was nothing but revolting. As a result I quit reading at page 215."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cover","review":"I bought this book for the cover, and boy and I glad I did. It's a great story, with wonderful characters and (for once) a believable scenario for a man and his mistress to end up married! Highly recommended!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of her best!","review":"OK, I was prepared to be lukewarm about the lead character; after all, his name is Ferdinand for pity's sake, and he was portrayed as a rather useless fellow in _More than a Mistress_.But he turns out to be quite adorable; much more a Regency beau than the usual dark-'n-dangerous main character. The author's plot twists and teasers are remarkably well-rendered and keep you turning pages. Sure, you have to suspend some disbelief, but I find I do for most fiction. I think this comes off as a very-well written, entertaining story and great escapism. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great romance with many twists and turns","review":"As you read you may think you know where it is leading but quite cleverly it does not go there. Just as you think so many details have been revealed and surely the ending is coming then you note you are only halfway there but what else could possible happen. That is when the biggest twist of all occurs leading you again on another adventure.
