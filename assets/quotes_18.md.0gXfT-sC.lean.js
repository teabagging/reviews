They are written as intimate conversations from the Master (the great self, or christ if you like) within to the author.The information imparted in the books is universal, there is absolutely no need to be a christian, e.g. for the wisdom to be understood and enjoyed by you.

I couldn't out the book down, because each case was unique and interesting. John Grisham's books are fine, but not real life. These were real life and while I can't believe some judges are asinine, as are CEO's and doctors, there are mistakes made in bad judgement. Everyone makes mistakes, and not all are cold cutthroat people who spit on the little people. Edwards seemed to get through all that, and did his job.As for Wade, he was a remarkable boy, just like his Dad."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book and a riviting read","review":"This book would give John Grisham a run for his money - the fact these are not fictional trial stories make them truly gripping. The character of the writer comes through vividly as Edwards describes each case's background and how he approached his work. Edwards masterfully interspersed vignettes of his own life without a heavy hand. I was not prepared for the power of this book and simply couldn't put it down. How fortunate we are to have John Edwards as a candidate for President this year -- I definitely plan to vote for him and truly hope we get this man of character and integrity in the White House."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four Trials","review":"In Four Trials, John Edwards, presents four compelling cases of ordinary people with whom the reader can identify. Each story is a moving account of individuals who were terribly wronged who sought help through the justice system. Throughout the book Mr. Edwards interweaves his life stories and his feelings with the accounts of each trial, revealing his strong character and good heart. One statement that remains in this reader's mind is the opening one \\"I trust you\\". Trust is what needs to be put back into both our judicial system and our government."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Bad John Edwards Didn't Win","review":"It's too bad John Edwards didn't win the Democratic nomination and the Presidency.

The discussion incorporates Mr Edwards personal insights, convictions at the time and interweaves some of his personal life experiences occurring during the trial work.

He portrays himself as a humble advocate for the overlooked and underpriveledged.

It is becoming increasingly difficult for these same overlooked and underpriveledged people to have access to proper medical care as a result of doctors fleeing hostile states. He also fails to eduacate the reader about the fact that he became very wealthy from his contingency fees.

I have read many books on anxiety and panic disorder over the years, and this is one of the most useless. Nothing new here. The personal stories sound phony and are not in the least bit inspiring.

The plot is really stupid.It starts out that Mary Anne's step-grandparents' house flooded. While she is helping to clean up, she finds a music box. It has a threat note on it. Mary Anne asks her step grandmother about it, but Granny denies everything. But you can tell right away she's a main suspect just by the way the book is describing her voice.

I fully expected that any book touting itself as \\"the complete\\" story would offer detailed plot info of each episode.

During this he struggles to define himself as an individual after his breakup with a longtime girlfriend. The story of Max is very believable and readers will be able to easily connect with one or more of the characters in the book. Max's struggles throughout the story seem common and are very real.

This is a good movie with a tight story line, entertaining special effects, filled with slight drama, and a few plot twists.Have spent a far worse couple of hours. Just don't get how the book afficiandos hated this movie. Burroughs wrote entertaining stories - but it would be a stretch to screen them all and create a franchise about John Carter. This movie was good and its pace was such that it did not seem too long. Enjoyable for all and a lesson that one should not believe everything the critics say.

For instance, the Therns were not introduced until the second book, \\"The Gods of Mars\\", but they are introduced here, not as the religious leaders but as the villains and very technologically advanced. However, after seeming to pan the film, I do have to admit that it definitely had the \\"feel\\" of a Burroughs book. I'm still not sure whether the changes made it better or worse. The acting was really quite good, the special effects are uniformly excellent and the story, while not \\"true\\" to Burroughs, had enough of his ideas that it was very entertaining. So, if you are a fan of Burroughs like me, it is somewhat disappointing, but the good points do outweigh the bad.

For those of us who had not read the book upon which the movie was based, there were far too many loose ends in the film. For example, it was not clear who had killed his wife: Indians?, outlaws?, enemy soldiers? And the motive of the shape shifters is never convincingly explained nor was it easy to understand the complex and confusing interaction that Carter had with the four-armed creatures.

Was written before Star Wars and Lucus might have stold some of the ideas. That is why this should have never been made into a movie. Everything has been stolen by someone eles. It make the movie look very unorginal. I'm one of the few that saw this at the movie. It was the movie that would never end. There were so many false endings, that I stopped caring about the characters and just sat there thinking about what I was going to do after the movie. The characters were so bad. The guy from \\"fridays night lights\\" and Megan Fox's older ugly sister had zero chemistry. He had more chemistry with the alien girl then her. I like cliffhangers, but when I saw that ending...I wanted to punch the wall. It was one of the worst endings I have seen in awhile.

There's battles, fun and interesting characters, great CG, and plot twists you just don't expect. There's only one momentary ecological jab, but I can live with that. No agenda card is overplayed either, which is equally refreshing. It's a fun, \\"Sit down to enjoy it and don't over think it\\" movie. For what it's worth, it did poorly in the major reviews after it was released. That generally means it's awesome. I kept having those, \\"Yes!\\" moments. You know the ones?

My wife and I had only recently watched the two seasons of Rome and were delight to see Caesar and Mark Anthony reappear on Mars in something close to their same roles. The physics was nonsense, of course, but the actual pace and complexity of the story was measured and as good as any classic western. Carter, the movie, has been given a bad rap. It ought rightly to capture more of the attention it deserves--just for being a well-spun yarn.If the movie had weak points (Ok, maybe Taylor Kitsh was a little under-dimensional--but even that worked), they were nothing to the critics who gave it an eager thumbs down and the seeming frightened old women shuffling the deck at Disney."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disney has done again!!!","review":"Great writing with an all star cast lots of action and suspense a movie the whole family can really enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a good movie","review":"We enjoyed this very much.

Which leaves me to wonder why so many took an instant dislike to it (mostly critics, although that can't explain why so many people didn't bother to see this movie on its initial theater release, thus sounding its death knell). Yes, the story is a bit complicated (as it always is when people jump back and forth between time and space). Yes, they could have picked a stronger actor for the lead. Yes, they had way too many villains to keep track of. Yes, it's not always a good thing to be cryptic about everything.

(not as in oh dude, that was so epic!, but more as in Homer's The Odyssey). It is very classic Hollywood stuff, and very entertaining. I enjoyed watching it in the movie theater.I was surprised it did not do so well. Perhaps it just didn't fit in with all the other films that came out around that time, which is just as well, because it has a timeless quality. Perhaps in another 10 years it will become a Hollywood classic.

If you follow the pattern of these losers' lives, if a movie does not have the F-word every 10 spoken words, or gobs of nudity, sex abuse, rapes, and x-rated violence, the movie can't possibly be any good. Well, the critics that bombed these movie need to wash their mouths out with soap. This is a great movie and I will definitely buy the DVD when it comes out to see the director's cut.I think, for whatever reason, the critics were out to get Stanton on a personal level.

In that way it is sort of like the movie Inception, but the viewer has to do all the work. That takes more effort than many viewers are willing to do, but if you exercise your mind you'll find an enjoyable film and experience.Along the way you'll experience storytelling they way it was in the '20's and '30's which is different from what movie goers are used to today.

The story and character development was great, it was *very* well-acted, the CGI was seamless and totally believable, and the voiceovers were excellent.

Although I didn't love it, it could appeal to other people, and it didn't deserve to bomb at the box office like it did.Pros: There wasn't too much language or graphic situations, and it inspired me to check out the books it was based on.Cons: The plot was confusing, and the movie was long.9/24/12 EDIT: I'm currently reading the book series, and I would have liked John Carter a lot more if I had read it first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic movie and good adaption of the story","review":"I know this movie was panned by a lot of critics, but I thought it was very good. The start of the movie drags a bit and could have been edited down, but once John Carter arrives on Mars - its all solid action, well done effects, epic sets and an interesting story line. Those who think a lot of the story was lifted from other sci-fi stories forget that this is based on a book older than all of them - they lifted their story elements from this story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"John Carter","review":"John Carter is a fun sci-movie that has lots of action. It is a great family movie for all to watch. If you like special effects this one has a few."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It","review":"I had no plans of any kind to see this movie (due to the cheesy, laughable trailers), however, my son and I found ourselves standing in the theater one day back in mid-March, with no other movies starting anytime soon...so we decided to take a chance on John Carter. I have to say, it was great...as far as space operas go, it wasn't on par with, say, \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" (then again, what is?) but it was significantly more fun and engaging than any of the Star Wars prequels. Bottom line - if you're into the sci-fi or adventure genre, I'd say give this one a chance. We both loved it.In fact, of movies that have come out in the past six to nine months, I'd say the only one we had a better time at was \\"The Avengers.\\" :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"All most like being there","review":"I have read every E.R.B about once a year, I know the movie did no follow any where near the bookBut they honored it close.

And this movie satisfies and entertains those matters very well. The cinematography and special effects are superb. The story is well written and draws you in from start to finish. I would highly recommend this movie, and I believe this is one of the best you'll find in production for 2012 viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE JOHN CARTER","review":"I wanted to watch it again the moment it ended on the big screen.

This interpretation was by in large very much in keeping with how the character was portrayed in the pulp magazines so many years ago. Entertaining and fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Watching","review":"This movie received terrible reviews and I could never understand why. I really liked the story frame: Edgar Burroughs wrote this a century ago and it is still fresh today. Any story that can seamlessly take us from Victorian-era steam powered cities to the Old West to Mars! is worth a night of watching. The exploration of gravity differentials on Mars is fun and creative. The visual artistry is great: alien technologies, and life forms are very creative and amazing. OK, so there is some ho-hum love story and a large part of the plot is left unexplored, but John Carter is an entertaining watch to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Carter","review":"A nice, solid, little gem that did not get the warm reception it deserved from the community that have celebrated much worse.

It's senseless!Would love to see what you guys think in the comments. I had not been following the leadin to the release of this movie, so I don't know what kind of \\"hype\\" it was/was not getting, so I would love to hear from you all...Just get this movie.

The critical reaction to it only confirms one of my axioms: \\"Never take seriously a mainstream film critic who reviews a science fiction, fantasy, or horror movie.\\" The marketing of the movie was a pathetic waste of money. Disney should have invited science fiction/fantasy critics only to an early screening and let them go and done little else. It would have saved them tens of millions. They should not have fearfully changed the title to \\"John Carter\\". I think many people only know the name as an ER character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleh and bitter that the only option was to purchase it","review":"All I can say is we thought our 6 year old son (who is completely obsessed with making up Martian battles) would enjoy this movie.

But I can't figure out the taste of those people giving 5stars to this movie.. I think it is something like Democrat vs Republic stuff.. I remember many people had given 1star to \\"No Country for Old Men\\" which is worth all 5stars... So anyways, I rented this movie from Amazon VOD based upon higher user ratings.. and Now I agree with the critics.. The plot sucks.. the lead actress totally puts dumb face many times..And there are is nothing original or interesting in this movie to watch.. I just wasted my time and money..And this can no way be compared to Star Wars or Avatar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Action Adventury","review":"Personally I liked this movie, it was packed with action and the special effects were spectacular.

It has an intelligent script with no plot holes, or faulty logic. All the characters motivations make sense.If you're tired of all the \\"popcorn\\" movies like transformers and GI Joe, that put cgi and explosions before things like plot and acting, then go see John Carter. You will care about the characters, and what happens to them.From the director of 2 pixar movies, John Carter is a movie for everyone. I saw this movie with my nephews (6 and 9), my brother and his wife (33 and 32), and my father (60), everyone loved it! My nephews said it was the best movie ever.If you kind of want to see John Carter, GO SEE JOHN CARTER, you'll love it and you can thank me later!Truly an AMAZING movie!!!

I didn't care about ANY of them. To me it just felt like scene-after-scene of \\"stuff\\" just happening, which leads into the #2 reason for disliking this: it simply felt incomprehensible.Nebulous character goals, unfeasible CGI monsters, epic worlds inhabited by... oh never mind.

Even the special effects touted by some reviews were severely lacking. The quality of special effects reminded me of the original Star Wars, but hey, that was 1977. Characters were silly, dialog was juvenile and corny (wait till you see the salutes), effects were terrible; it was basically a waste of 2 hours and $3.99. Save your money. This was a stupid movie. Very B movie quality. Wanted to like it, but couldn't. Really can't think of one redeeming quality in this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"POORLY DONE MOVIE","review":"I have read the Martian Series many times. I was ten or so when I read the series for the first time. I have enjoyed the books since first reading them. Just had the displeasure of seeing this movie for the first and last time. Long story short, this movie is very poorly done. The writing, acting, story are silly. What a waste of great base material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and horrible adaptation of the book.","review":"How do you take one of the great SF books and drain out all of the color and adventure, well ask Disney? The best part of the movie takes place on Earth, Barsoom looks like it was shot by the Mars Rover, the actor playing JC had zero charisma and to be hip they gave ugly tattoos to the otherwise attractive women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mainstream media products","review":"No substance. I shut off the movie in the middle because the story was not interesting. Mainstream media cranks out products like this simply to make money. Even if it flopped at the box office (which I understand it did) they profit. Another good reason to read instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly, no enough of Lynn Collins","review":"I had to take two breaks because I was so tired of the slow moving action. It's difficult to disagree with over 300 viewers, but what can I say?The fx were good.The action was slow.The acting was awful.The script worse than the acting.Lynn Collins was the best of the movie, but they didn't show enough of her and she was too covered up for the role."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goofy, childish fantasy film","review":"I'm shocked that this movie got an average of 4.5 stars and that there are so many people who take it seriously. It's just a dumb, childish fantasy movie. It's not worthy of being called science fiction. I normally like popcorn movies but this one was too dumb, goofy, and childish. It was made for 9 year olds. It's like a combination of Star Wars and Avatar. I'm surprised this movie didn't receive a lot more hate since the green aliens are reminiscent of Jar Jar Binx, who was despised by so many. There is plenty of corny, cheesy, bad acting. I disliked that the princess is a great scientist and also a great warrior. In the real world, women are neither of those things. I'm really tired of this ridiculous, unrealistic portrayal of women in movies from the past few decades."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only finished watching it because I'd spent the money to see it","review":"Right up there with Snow White and the Huntsman as worst movie I've seen this year.

Best 3D since Avatar.","review":"If you like Star Wars or epic Sci-Fi films, you'll probably like John Carter. Unfortunately, it is one of the worst marketed films in history. I didn't even know what the movie was about from the movie poster I saw in the theater. Did not even know it was a sci-fi... But the effects were great. Story was pretty decent and the acting overall very good for a sci-fi film. I didn't think I was going to like it, and was pleasantly surprised. I saw it in 2D in the theater, and so when the 3D bluray came out, I decided to give it a try, and it is by FAR the best 3D film I have seen on my TV since Avatar.

While the movie differed from the books, all movies do in one way or another. I liked the story and the special effects. I thought the acting was good a well. I do not see what those who rated it a 1 star have against the movie. I think it is the second best movie released this year. Number one would be The Advengers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this movie so we can prove the critics wrong!","review":"As a Burroughs fan I was worried about what this movie would convey to people who were not familiar with the books written by Edgar Rice Burroughs. I was overjoyed as I watched this movie with my 10 year old son - a movie I have been anticipating since I was 13. There have been some fan trailers (I am sure you can find them on YouTube) which convey the real story of this movie. This movie is true to the original story, for the most part, and hopefully people will see it when it comes out on DVD Now if we can see a - true to the book - Tarzan movie, that would truly be an awesome movie. Buy this movie - I really want to see A Warlord of Mars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Critics are blind","review":"I just read that John Carter was named as the top 10 list of the worst movies of the year.

Thumbs way up from a Guy that actually pays to see movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really liked this film","review":"I saw this in the theater when it was first released and I throughly enjoyed it. As so many others have mentioned, the marketing job was horribly botched and frankly, the movie title was just a mistake, \\"John Carter of Mars\\" would have made much more sense.But, the movie itself was great fun. I bought it on Blu-Ray recently and have watched it twice so far and enjoyed it each time...it's just a fun old time adventure and it looks and sounds great on Blu-Ray!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't understand why this movie didn't get better reviews!","review":"I love this movie! I read all the books when I was in high school and was thrilled to see that it was being made into a movie.

I want to see more!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Watching","review":"Even though this movie doesn't follow the books it does remain true to the basic story. I think Edgar would have liked it. All the characters are there but with a slightly different take on their relationships (especially between Carter and the princess).I thought Wolla was the best part of the movie its sad they couldn't show how much Wolla meant to John Carter. In the book John felt until he met the princess that Wolla was the only thing on Mars that could show him love. Maybe Disney should make a movie about John and his best friend Wolla - it would be a great kids movie. In all this is a good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"From a werewolf to an alien on another world.","review":"I know the critics panned this movie, but I was thoroughly caught up in the story line and the characters.

I was not aware of the books, so the name \\"John Carter\\" didn't really ring any bells. And the trailer I had seen did spark much interest either.But when I saw it, I loved it! It's a great science fantasy adventure, with a well-designed world and an interesting plot. And the ending leaves you wanting more!I quickly looked to see if sequels were forthcoming- but then I learned of the box-office flop- so buy this film, and maybe, just maybe we can see a sequel eventually."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it","review":"I never read the books until this movie came out. I had heard about it, and dismissed the movie because of all the media hype. Lesson learned, never listen to the media.I watched JC once, on the airplane, and felt even days after, that I missed a lot because of the venue. I bought it, and watched in the comfort of my own home, and wow, did I ever miss a lot. Great story, fabulous graphics. And now NASA has confirmed magnetic portals on earth - so far just to the sun, but if there are portals to the sun, why not to other destinations too? Highly recommend if you are a science fiction fan, this has to be in your library.I enjoyed it so much, I bought the books for my kindle, and started reading. How did I not read these so many years ago, maybe was too caught up in Pern, I don't know. Thoroughly pleased with both purchases."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Carter, Should have done much better at the theaters.","review":"I seen the commercials for this and thought I would like film but rarely see films until they are released into Blu-ray.

As the years went by, I reread these books from time to time. Although I enjoyed the movie itself, the story had been so changed as to only have some of the vague ideas from it. To see the Therns so early in the story and with such power was very dissapointing. If you plan to see this mvie because you have read the book, be prepared for the fact that this is nothing at all like the book. Woola is actually cute in this version.

Sadly, I honestly believe critics bought into the \\"bad marketing\\" hype and just wanted to make the movie fail. I picked up the movie on 3D Blu-ray and I watched it waiting for the movie to start to suck or be \\"confusing\\". Interestingly, that never happend, but what did start happening was I became more and more engrossed in a different world filled with fully realized cultures and characters. Dazzling special effects and a story that just pulls you in. The picture on the Blu-ray is also stellar and the 3D adds depth to the image making the world of Barsoom (Mars) come fully to life. I enjoyed the movie so much, that I've been reading Edgar Rice Burroughs Mars Trilogy. I highly recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enjoyable","review":"Having read all the bad press I was intrigued by the high ratings viewers gave this movie on Amazon. I have to say this was really enjoyable! Good vs. evil, and the guy gets the gal. I don't need a sermon when I just want to be entertained and escape into another world. The CGI was great! I found the plot easy to follow - despite the reviews. The characters well-rounded and engaging and, dare I say, far more appealing than some of the CGI (and human) creations in Star Wars I, II, and III! Great holiday movie when you want to forget how much turkey you ate!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the wait","review":"I first read Princess of Mars back in 1967. I fell in love.

I also really liked the idea that this movie, and possible follow-ups, were intended to stay true to that series. The Princess of Mars was a very good and exciting story as written by E.R. Burroughs. How the writers of this film could have turned that simple story into a totally incoherent mess is beyond me? The film is visually stunning so it makes this mess even sadder. If you buy this DVD, just watch it with the sound turned off and you you are likely to enjoy the beauty, thoughtfulness and effort that went into its filming and special effects. Otherwise, don't waste your money. The writers should be ashamed of themselves for ruining what might have been one of the best science fiction movies in years."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG awful...","review":"I read these books when I was in grade school and the series has always held a place in my heart as classic sci-fi. The movie... one of the few ones where I have gone to the rest room and debated whether or not to go back in or just leave. Nine bucks though... ugh I guess I should go back in and sit down. For me it was a very bad rip off of avatar. Acting was bad, script was worse, and I had no attachment to the characters whatsoever. It did make me want to go back and read the book again though, if nothing more than to justify my fond (if rather vague... its been some time) memories of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I loved this underrated movie, but with this cover, it will make it a hard sell for anyone!","review":"I loved this underrated movie, but with this cover, it will make it a hard sell for anyone!Just look at it.

This movie is amazing.Not only is this movie spectacular, there is a very rich history behind it worth discovering. After seeing John Carter I went and bought the digital copy of the first 5 books (the first of which, A princess of Mars, this movie is based) in the 11 book Barsoom series that got its start 100 years ago. I am on the third book now and I cannot stop thinking about how great Edgar Rice Burrough's imagination must have been to illuminate Mars in such rich storytelling back in 1912. While the movie deviates from the original book a little here and there it is still propelled by the same adventure and spirit that ERB penned.Everyone, do yourself a favor and give this movie a try. I am hoping Disney pays more attention to the fans of this film than the critics and continues to make more John Carter movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular!","review":"I can't figure out why the Disney people did such a poor job of publicizing this film, starting with thehumdrum and misleading title. Earthguy On Mars would have been better, or at least more descriptive. Oreven Leading Woman Has the Most Incredibly Beautiful Eyes. The views are utterly breathtaking, thescript actually has some funny lines along with the comic-book hokum, and the whole thing keeps movingalong suspensefully at a fast clip. Anyone who loves sci-fi action thrillers will get a kick out of it,even if the storytelling is a bit lumpy--important explanations can be gasped out rather suddenly, majorplot turns are often unsupported...that kind of thing. Clearly, a lot of people took a lot of troubleto make this film exciting, and it shows. Don't listen to high-hat critics. See it for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"I like this film. Good pace, amazing effects, intriguing story that makes you want to hear more, it was the perfect night's worth of entertainment. Also, a worthy take on classical Ed Burroughs novels - the mixing and matching from the various books was imo a good thing, as was the new take on the Therns. The only downside was a surplus of schmaltziness but i guess this cannot be avoided in movies like this.

Here is a group of eleven books that a large group of fans read once, twice, three or more times. Then I saw the movie. The director/ writer tried to cover all the books in one movie. As I watched it, I would say this is not in the books. Then a part would stray back into the story and I would hope it would stay there. E. G. B. was a great writer and as one person stated, we will never see a second try at doing this movie. In trying to update the story line, the story line was destroyed.

John Carter captures that same movie magic with a great story, great characters and a beautiful score by Michael Giacchino. Where Star Wars is Wagnerian space opera, John Carter is more of a personal journey of the central character. I'm glad this movie kept Edgar Rice Burroughs' original setting of Carter as a 19th century Civil War vet and they didn't try and modernize everything. This is an old-fashioned adventure/romance story that gives you a great feeling of nostalgia for a long lost time and place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't understand why this did badly at the theater","review":"I really don't understand why this movie did so badly at the theater other than that it was sabotaged by the critics and bad marketing. I read some of the critics reviews and all I can say is that they didn't see the same movie I did. Their comments were so odd that I really question whether some of them even bothered watching the movie before writing the review. I love adventure and sci fi movies but I'm picky about which ones I watch. I absolutely loved this movie and I have to say it was true to the original book. Which may be why some folks had problems with it. Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote A Princess of Mars (original title) in 1912. It was a brilliant envisioning of the possibilities of space travel. Disney went with that original vision rather than 'updating' the movie to what we know now 100 years later. So watch the movie in the spirit it was intended and enjoy the adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action Packed","review":"This was a gift for my husband who watches it over and over.

They tried to shove far too many things into the movie and just lost the whole story. If it had even been close to the books it would have been a twenty hour movie.

Personally I thought the actor who played John Carter, Taylor Kitsch, was a joke. Even angry people have more than one emotion. The story line was OK, but wasn't developed.

There is a lot of materials I could tell you why I did not like it, but it is not worth it.

It perfectly blends action-adventure, comedy, and some romance all in a SciFi setting.

From here Carter rescues \\"A Princess of Mars\\" (a famous Pulp title) and finds himself in a war between alien races. Produced by DISNEY, this adaptation is unfortunately a piece DISNEY threw in the garbage before it was released in theaters focusing very, very little on marketing. It's not a bad film nor is it the greatest summer blockbuster. For me, the most memorable moments was the arena scene and the gorgeous Lynn Collins. It's a fun ride while it lasts but don't expect a sequel because in DISNEY's minds, it bombed before it hit the box office. Look for it on DVD and BD in June."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Carter never even started to live up to the book.","review":"I know that it is difficult to make a movie of a book and please all the fans of the book. In the case of John Carter it appears that the movie was never introduced to the book! The film took what was one of my childhood favorites and made it into something I was sorry to have wasted money on. The only things that remained true to the books were some of the names. The entire paradigm for the movie changed, In the book the residents of Mars had faced the danger of extinction and had come forth victoriously into a state of victory in an advanced civilization. In the movie the residents were hanging on, barely!The movie did not do justice to the books or the characters in the books.

Ironically, the disturbing footage isn't the same for everybody. For some, it is the actual footage of dogs being blown into a red mist. For others, it is actual footage of 1930 government programs designed to kill millions of varmints.

His playing is flawless and tasteful: the vurtoso passages are never over-the top but they aren't blase either and he is very lyrical in the slow movements. Mr. Shaham works well with the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra and their choice of dynamics creates excitment and adds to the emotional depth of these concerti. Their orchestra/solo balance is perfect and I might also mention that DG recording on this one is superb. Gil Shaham and the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra play these pieces like they are bonafide masterpieces rather than elevator music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful music by any standard","review":"Until a week ago I would have said that this is the finest version of The Four Seasons ever recorded. Shaham's approach is much like we used to hear from Jacqueline du Pre. Ferocious, full of intelligence and virtuosity, and with great love for the music. The disc is miked very close to his violin and the slightest growl and touch is clearly visable in this most dramatic of recordings. Now how could I not rate it the greatest recording of this music? Easy, I just bought Guiliano Carmignola's version on original instruments (which I usually don't care for) and it may be as perfect as any recording ever made...in every way. I have to say that If you truly love this music you must own both versions. Life is short, just bite the bullet and own them both.

It's nice to hear the concertos in a modern rather than period instrument style that still preserves the chamber ensemble size of the performing forces. Flashy, yes, but very musical, too, and the Kreisler concerto \\"after Vivaldi\\" is a real bonus on the CD.

It lacks flair."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you have an attic, don't dare read this book in it!","review":"One of the scariest books I've ever read.

I read this because of all the great reviews and I didn't even want to finish it. It was gettng increasingly silly and predictable and then with about 35 pages left to go, I just skimmed it. The twist is pretty obvious, I knew that would be it on about page one. The early parts of the book did have some good scares, genuinely creepy stuff but it really unravels at the end. Also, I know horror books can be OTT but really this one seemed bent more on disturbing you and grossing you out than scaring you. I've been on a horror book spree or a little while and the Haunting of Hill House was the only one that really seems to me what a haunted house book should be. This one was just too disturbing and not in a fun way. I threw it out as I'm not reading it again and my husband would be disgusted with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barclay's The Revelation of John Volume 2","review":"I love \\"Barclay\\" and use his concordances for all my Bible Studies.

It is filled with the dullest, most over-used \\"style\\" tips in fashion history - make your \\"classic\\" pieces neutral in color? change your look by changing your accessories? Mon Dieu! This is not advice on French style... this is recycled notes from 'fashion 101' pieced together from ancient advice and common sense.

Mostly the mother-daughter team, who own a costume jewelry shop, tells you to buy expensive French brands you already knew about. The book is about half photographs of them wearing classic clothes that don't look particularly French---cream, khaki, navy and other neutrals. Very tasteful, and stylish in a quiet way, but nothing specifically French. Maybe that's the point.

If you are wondering what goes into the je ne sais quoi of Parisian chic, you won't get an answer here. All it is is a pretty magazine. The most profound statement is the pronouncement that the French woman values the simple black dress! Most of what these two women do is advertise their costume jewlery and show an outfit on each page. It's like reading Vogue but only if you look at the pictures. As a Francomaniac who spends a lot of time in Paris (and in France), I can say that this book is \\"nul\\". Compare this with the book French Toast and you will see the difference between a book with substance and this brochure. The only nice thing I can say about it is the quality of the photographs are superb."},{"rating":"1","title":"subtle advertising","review":"Having just returned from Paris, I did find this book \\"right on\\" (simplicity, accessorizing etc.) in many ways, however , it lacked depth, and the costume jewelry was quite gaudy and not really that current.

To package, I strain the extract through a goldtone coffee filter into a gift-sized bottle, and add a section of vanilla bean to the bottle.

I had bought the vanilla beans to make my own vanilla extract for Christmas gifts, so I went ahead and put all 15 of the beans in my bottle of vodka.

I don't have a lot of background experience with vanilla beans. The one experience I DO have is that I bought one vanilla bean from my local health food store ($6)and I brought it home in a little baggie, twist tied at the top. My whole kitchen smelled wonderful when this one bean was on my counter in a bag. When I received my 16 vanilla beans, I opened up the package waiting to be hit with that wonderful aroma I had smelled before. NOT EVEN CLOSE! I was upset, but very busy at that time. So I put them aside for about four or five days. Then I used them to make vanilla bean cupcakes, the same recipe I used my first vanilla bean for. I couldn't taste vanilla at all. When I had made it before people were amazed at the unmistakable flavor. What a waste!Sorry for the long way around the story, I'm still upset..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but disappointed","review":"First of all let me say the beans came quickly, were packed adequately and were priced right. They looked and smelled fine, not too dry and decent amount of aroma. They probably would have been fine for cooking, but they did not perform up to my expectations. I have been making Vanilla extract for the last 5+ years or so and that's why I bought the beans. I make 750mL at a time using vodka as the base. I cut up 4 beans and began soaking them a week before Christmas. After 2 weeks the extract was not strengthening correctly (too light of a color) so I added 2 more beans. Now that it is the end of January (over a month of soaking) they still have not extracted properly. I have the last batch to compare it to (different beans -- I believe Tahitian) and the current batch is half the shade and strength of the previous with 50% more beans. So I will go back to the more expensive Tahitian beans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Price!","review":"I purchased the beans (and had never even seen vanilla beans before) to use in making homemade frozen vanilla bean yogurt.

The main floor of our townhouse is a mix of laminate and ceramic and this little vacuum is exactly what we needed. We have two cats; one of them sheds like crazy! This stick vac picks up all the cat hair and even does a good job getting if off the couch. It picks up all the little bits that seems to end up on the floor in the kitchen and the living room. I even used it on the carpeted stairs, for a quick touch-up.This vacuum is small and i am able to keep it in the hall closet for quick access when I need it, instead of hauling the canister vac from the basement. It works way better than a broom and dustpan.

I have 2 dogs (1 black and 1 Grey/white) that shed like mad. I was sweeping up the hair and it never seemed to go away.

The vaccuum itself is very quiet and easy to use. I didn't even need the directions. Plus it turns into a dustbuster for those hard to reach/narrow spots.

It has good suction, it does not fling the dirt and rocks underneath and behind the vacuum like a regular upright does and it is simple to empty the cup when you need to. It picks up pet hair and fireplace ashes and the small attachment gets right under my stove and fridge. The small wheels do not scratch the floors and it is small enough to sit in a pantry without taking up a lot of space. My only complaint about this vacuum would be that the cord is not long enough. However, this is a lightweight vacuum and I can see that it might not be all that practical the extend it.

It's fine for picking up onesy twosy items, but it really does not do a good job when you are trying to vacumm an extended area (i'm only talking about the size of a stair). I find that most of the items that are somewhat attached to my carper or very small pieces of lint tend to stay in the carpet.Also, the wide \\"vacuum\\" attachment is useless. The suction hole is only about two inches wide and that is the only place it will pick up anything with that attachment. You might as well just use it as a hand vac to pick up articles that have some bulk.Was it worth $20?

Much easier than dragging out the 30 foot hose to my home integrated vacuum system.Plus, my daughter loves it!

This little Bissell is SUPER lightweight and perfect for my hardwoods and area rugs. We have 2 cats and a corgi, so hair would be in abundance without an easy way to clean. This vacuum is powerful, picks up hair, dust, and kibble, and stores away very neatly. I can step on the bottom portion and pull gently to convert it into a dust-buster to get corners. My only complaint would be that the cord isn't very long and it must be unplugged to go from room to room, but that is a minor problem compared to the convenience! I'm so glad I could move my monster vacuum upstairs and use this easy product in my downstairs.

The suction is ok but there are too many design flaws on this product. First, the handle doesn't collapse so forget about storing it easily. Also there is no agitating brush. The biggest problem is the way the filter fits in it. Instead of resting in the cup when it is taken apart,it stays on the motor side. This means it is IMPOSSIBLE to remove it without shaking dust off of it and all over the place(including your face!) Also the filter has to be put back EXACTLY right which can be difficult and frustrating, or else the vac won't go back together.So in conclusion, if your looking for a small lightweight vac, you'd be better off spending your money elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bissell 3106A","review":"For a small vacuum this does a good job.

I use it everyday and don't ever want to be without it again. It's so easy to use that it is almost fun to sweep with this. It seems like a toy, yet it pulls up all the cat hairs and dirt that blows in. It's great to use in corners too, as it's very easy to put on the attachment. It even works on one very low pile rug. The only thing I don't enjoy is taking it apart in every room to clean the very small filter/cup. I seem to have a hard time putting the vacuum back together again.

I've seen this vacuum advertised for almost $40. That said, I did expect it to pick up a little drywall dust that fell on our newly tiled bathroom floor when we installed the towel rod. It didn't do it. In the laundry room, I used it to clean up some cat litter, but even that wasn't so easy. There just isn't enough power to do an efficient job. The only value it has to me is that I don't have to drag out the Dyson all the time and it will convert to a handvac. If I had to do it all over again, I'd invest my money in something better."},{"rating":"2","title":"great little vacuum","review":"My 5 yr old Dustbuster cordless stick vac died and and I couldn't find a very similar replacement in my desired price range. I ended up looking at corded stick vacs instead and saw that the Bissell Featherweight had been around a long time and had many good reviews. Plus, the price was incredibly low. I have been using it almost a month and it's almost perfect for what I needed, quick cleanup on tile floors and a few door mats. It's easy to clean (I empty the canister and tap out the filter every time I use it), picks up more stuff than my previous stick vac and was quieter than I expected based on other reviews. The only drawbacks are its fairly short cord and the fact that replacement parts are not easily available. I guess it's just as cheap to replace the whole vacuum rather than buy another floor nozzle when it wears out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets the job done","review":"This was the third \\"stick vac\\" I had to buy for my 84 year old mother.

Although it does pick-up debris from carpeted areas, I would never depend on this to be my primary vacuum cleaner. I still vacuum my area rugs with a regular sized vacuum.This vacuum does let me do light touch-ups without having to drag out the heavier version. My only complaints are, it would be nice if the cord was longer. I find that I have to plug and unplug it 3 times to reach all the areas in my little house. Also the clip that connects the handle to the vacuum does not hold. It clicks in place like it's going to hold, but after a few passes the two components come apart.I fixed it with a wide piece of packaging tape."},{"rating":"2","title":"bissell good value","review":"Initial opinion is great.

You should have some \\"serious\\" vacuum for deep cleaning once in 1 or 2 weeks. But this one is just perfect to keep yr home clean every minute.

I live in a highrise bldg in NYC...and of course it gets really dusty. It takes me about 15 minutes to vacuum the entire apt..granted it is not more than 1,ooo sq feet. However it gets the job done quickly. Wish it had a longer cord.

It works great on picking up loose dirst all over my Pergo floors. Fast forward a few months and I hate the thing. I have noticed small scratches all over my floors. I first thought my son had scratched it with one of his toys. We sorted through the toys and discarded any suspected item.s It didn't stop the scratches. So last night I tested the vacuum on a not so obvious part of the floor and guess what........ the wheels scratched my floor. Unless you go in a perfectly straight line the floor is gonna get scratched. Be careful when considering this purchase for use on Pergo."},{"rating":"1","title":"This vacuum did not work for us","review":"The suction was weak to begin with and got worse over time.

It was a lousy piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"It shouldn't be called a vacuum machine","review":"The suction is so low that it doesn't pick up anything you can see. If you actually want to clean your room/house, do not buy this - it will have no visible effects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet!","review":"Wasn't too sure about this product due to its size and weight. However after reading other reviews, I decided to give it a try while it was on sale for $17.00. Got it - easy to put together and use. I was amazed how smooth it was over carpets. It definitely picked up a lot of dust off the carpet. Use it in the kitchen too where it works great on tiles/hardwood floors. My daughter who is 2 loves help out with it too. Its not a heavy duty vacuum but trust me it gets the job done in the same efficient manner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for clean up","review":"This easy to store and use Bissell is absolutely great for daily (or whenever needed) clean up of my hardwood floors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is mine defective?","review":"I bought this based on all the positive reviews, but the one I have doesn't pick up anything!! The few things it did pick up would only get sucked up after going over the item several times. I really just wanted something small to use daily for small jobs instead of getting out the big vac. This thing is going back. It's not even worth $20.00. A small hand-held vac is more powerful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I bought this vacuum to help sweep up our all hardwood floors house. The reviews of this product were so good, but I wasn't impressed. It is impossible to use on rugs, the suction is OK, but it's pretty inconvenient over all - cord gets in the way and isn't very long, small cannister needs emptied after every use. Plus, when I use it, it gets coated with a thick layer of dust. So, it seems all the dirt is just getting sucked off the floor and spit out the top of the vacuum. Just easier to get out the broom and dustpan. Perhaps a battery charged unit would fit my needs better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little vacuum!","review":"I love this little vacuum for every day, around the kitchen. It is not made for heavy duty vacuuming but for light easy clean ups, it does a great job. It is sooooo much better than sweeping with a broom and dust pan. Perfect if you have toddlers or pets.It is a little hard to clean the filter, wish they would have come up withsomething a bit easier, and could use a longer cord. Other than that I have no complaints, and would buy it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"customer satisfaction","review":"Just what we were looking for. Our previous one finally went kaput after many good years of service.

It's NOT light as you'd expect. Suction is not strong. The cord is too short, so you have to plug in and out several times to finish cleaning one floor. If you live in a studio, it's the perfect size. I'd recommend you to buy a cordless vaccum for the better performance in every way. Good thing I only spent $19.99. If I knew that I could return the item that used once, I'd definitely have returned this item. Please don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a messy item!","review":"You will be very annoyed every time you go to empty this thing. Really, on a bare floor a broom and a dustpan do a much better job. On household carpeting it is just OK, but there is still that emptying problem. What a mess! I tried it on the carpet in my car, too, and it left a lot of particles because of the pickup unit being too wide. Not a good deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't let those high ratings fool you","review":"After doing research and seeing high ratings for this, I bought it for my small apartment.It is a major disappointment.

I wish I could return this product because it was a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vaccum","review":"Maybe I am a little dense but to vacuum carpet its such a pain.

It appeared to be lightweight, could perform many functions and was on sale. Well, after using it nearly one month, it is indeed lightweight and can be used as an upright or a handheld. However, the motor is very weak and it can't even pick up small (<1/4\\" dia.) stones and debris. Also, it has a cup instead of a filter bag. Big mistake! Dust comes out of the top of the cup.In conclusion, the vacuum is simply too weak to suck up anything more than dust and very small debris. I am returning it to the store to get my money back and invest the refund on a much more powerful and better vacuum. Yes, I expect to pay considerably more, but the next vacuum will be able to do what we need it to -- clean our carpets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it for the most part","review":"I agree with most other reviewers who say it's a great lightweight vacuum for the price. I have most all hard floors so it's easy EXCEPT that the cord is too short! While it's a small thing, it's annoying to have to unplug halfway across the room and move to a new plug."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes Cleaning Floors Fun!","review":"I'm in love with this little vacuum. I needed one with a power cord, because I've no place to put a charger. But I've had rechargeable quick-vacs before, and the batteries always seem to lose their ability to hold a charge anyway. That's not an issue with this little baby. It has fantastic suction, even at the outside edges of the sweeper attachment. I've added an extension cord, since the cord provided is short. Cleaning out the dust receptacle is easy--I'm always stunned at how much this puppy picks up, even when I think the floor is not that dirty. Works great on all but the highest pile carpet. I use it on my orientals with great success."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Powerful","review":"This is not the most powerful vacuum. It's strong enough to pick up dust, hair, etc. from bare floors, but it leaves larger particles behind. It's not powerful enough to do anything on carpet. The cord is about half as long as it should be; we had to use an extension cord to vacuum our SMALL kitchen and dining room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Featherweight vacuum","review":"Great product for small projects and tight areas, especially with the included crevice tool. Very long cord. Removable handle lets me get into smaller areas were maneuverability is difficult with a handle. Great value."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it","review":"I bought mine years ago for $20...it's like a powerful long handled dustbuster. It doesn't hold a lot of debris, but it IS pretty strong. The floor attachment comes off and the handle breaks down to use it as a hand held vac. Also comes with a crevice tool. Get some extra filters and you'll always have it ready to go. The filters rinse out in the sink or blow off with an air compressor. I wash mine and let them air dry. No BENDING over. The cord isn't real long, but for the price I am really pleased!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much, there are better choices as cheap","review":"What a disappointment!!!! This little vac has a stingy cord making it suitable for bathroom sized rooms only. How much would another 5 feet of cord cost the manufacturer? It hasn't much suction unless you have pet hair or feathers or sawdust mess or ants. There is a much better choice: the Eureka, cordless Quick Up 96 D sometimes sold as Boss quick up for around $35. The Eureka has 5x the suction, a powered roller brush for carpet and is cordless/battery powered so goes anywhere. I bought the Bissell as a second vacuum, what a disappointment. Now I'm searching for another Eureka Quick Up. Give this one (the Bissell) to a kid... it is a toy. No I don't work for Eureka."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific for light cleaning jobs!","review":"After reading the reviews I thought I'd give it a try--got my Bissell at Linens 'N Things (online) with a 20% off coupon for $15.99. Very easy to use, picks up what I need it to, mainly dust and very small crumbs, etc. For those who complain about a short cord, just add an extension cord and keep it with the vacuum--worked for me! Like others, I wish it had a small brush attachment. But it was great for vacuuming my stairs, I simply took off the long handle--MUCH easier than lugging out my canister vac.I really like it NOT being cordless, having to worry about running down the charge.Very happy with this lightweight vacuum for keeping my hardwood floors, linoleum, and very flat area rugs free of dust, crumbs, and other small debris."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor suction, don't even bother using it on carpet","review":"I've used this vacuum a couple times to vacuum my carpeted dorm room, and I can't recommend it for anything other than the lightest dust and particulate matter. Perhaps all the other happy reviewers are using it on vinyl or hardwood or something, but on carpet it utterly fails. I still have lint and clumps of dust after making a couple passes, and in the end I just gave up. Right now I'm trying to find a better vacuum without dishing out the hundreds for a Dyson Slim.What's good is that it's quite portable, and emptying it is simple though potentially messy. Make sure to empty the vacuum fairly often to maintain what little suction it has."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good vacuum.","review":"This is a pretty worthless vacuum. Don't ever try vacuuming rugs or carpets with it, as it will just push the dirty around or get stuck on the bottom. It's one of the cheapest vacuums out there and it shows. I'm really bemused by the number of positive reviews this product has gotten. I have only read a few of them, but the owners must all have hardwood floors or something. It works okay on them, but any rug or carpet makes it worthless. I usually end up resorting to my trusty old red dirt devil, and getting down on my hands and knees and cleaning the carpet.Seriously, if you want a good cheap vacuum, this isn't it. Look elsewhere and ignore these other positive reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, but doesn't work well","review":"I wanted to use this as a vacuum in my dorm and the price was great so I thought I would give it a shot. It really didn't pick up enough dirt and it wouldn't pick up any hair at all. I have low pile carpet so I thought it would work - wrong. I ended up buying a regular bagless vacuum and this Bissel featherweight is sitting at the bottom of my closet as a back up (at least it doesn't take up much space.) Bottom line: if you need a vacuum, buy a real one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard working vacuum","review":"It's perfect for my NYC apartment with parquet floors. Haven't used it on rugs though.

It's very easy to use and has a lot of sucking power so even small crumbs are gone instantly! I love the light weight and ease in dumping the collection.

The reviews all raved about this product but I did not have the same results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Featherweight Lightweight Bissell 3106A vacuum","review":"It's convenient, very lightweight, easy to use and has very good suction. It is kept handy and used every day to pick up crumbs, dust, etc., on our hardwood floors. It's very easy to empty the bagless container. We had hoped that this vacuum would have a thicker brush to protect new hardwood floors. Since it is advertised as a hardwood floor vacuum we assumed it would have a soft brush that would gently touch the wood floor. Instead, it has hard plastic wheels with a short, firm brush. It hasn't scratched our new floors yet, but we worry and try not to press down when we are vacuuming the floor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ah, just what my back wanted...","review":"It's spring time, or feels like it...hence the spring cleaning and the reviews of my 'must-have' cleaning products. I've been looking for something lightweight to pick up small messes from floors and very flat carpets (which I have). I got tired of lugging the big vacuum cleaner around with the cord and all the attachements in such a small house, so I ran and got this Bissell. Frankly I am not sure this is the same one, it looks the same and was the same price...but I don't care. I've liked most of my Bissell products over the years, and this was both the price and the weight I wanted. I just love it, and it couldn't be better for reaching under things and getting up hair balls, & the mistakes of grandchildren (who are more important than their mistakes!)...Karen Sadler"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for hardwood floors","review":"I like this vacuum because it's very light and I use it almost every day. It's great for hardwood floors because of the dust that accumulates which is difficult to sweep up with a broom (just blows around). This little vacuum does the trick. My steps are also hardwood and it's much easier to vacuum them with this little gem. Very lightweight. My only complaint is that the cord is not long enough. I empty it after each use (according to the instructions) and I believe this keeps the suction strong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product for the money","review":"I am really happy with this vaccum. I bought it because I wanted something light weight which I can replace the broom with and at the same time I did not wanted to spend too much. I tried this one and it was perfect to clean bathroom floors, kitchen floors, hardwood floors and even on carpet. My 5 year old can easily carry it and clean up the mess. I bought two more vaccums for a friend and my sister. They are also very happy with it. I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bissell featherweight vacuum","review":"This is a great, very light weight little vacuum. Not so good on carpeted areas but works well on wood and tile floors. Easy to use, carry around and store because of its compact size. Great for quick clean ups. Just make sure to empty the canister often or suction won't be as good. I love it! Highly recommend. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for the price","review":"I have two of these at home and recently bought one for my daughter and one for my son. They are great for wood and tile floors, light and easy to use. They are easy to empty, although a little messy if you aren't careful. The filters are washable and last a long long time.I was disturbed when my daughter told me that there was a warning in the instruction booklet regarding lead in the power cord. It is suggested that you wash your hands after handling the cord. Turns out a lot of appliance cords have lead in them, so it's not unique to this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't pick up cat hair or stray litter or particles...so...","review":"I previously reviewed this item and basically said it was decent for the price. After a few months of watching my carpet get cluttered with cat hair and whatever else this hunk of plastic wouldn't suck up I realized you can't be skimpy about vacuums if you want the job done right. I finally went to Target and bought the Dirt Devil Vibe, a VERY impressive bagless with excellent hand-held extensions for $80. Four times the price of this one but...it actually works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for small quick cleaning","review":"I love this lightweight vacuum. I bought one for each floor of my house. Great for quick cleanups. Don't have to lug heavy cleaners out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little vacuum!","review":"This vacuum really works great! I use this every few days on my kitchen floor, and it is amazing to see how much it picks up. Sand, crumbs, cat food, cat hair, and whatever else my [...] drags in. It is a little noisy, it has hard wheels and on the hard floor it makes a rolling noise, but not so loud that I care. It does a great job and is easy to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little sweeper","review":"I just received my Bissell today and was very anxious to use it. We have a new home and the entire first floor is hardwood. I have been using a swiffer, having to stop and change the cloth and vacuum the particles up, so I was happy to get a sweeper that vacuums. This little machine is great! I was amazed at how much it picked up, even getting the leaves the dog brings in from outside. It's small enough to fit into tight spots, and even slides under the couch. I highly recommend this especially at the price of under $20.My only complaint is that the cord is too short. I had to stop and change it several times to get through the first floor. But, I simply attached an indoor extension cord and only had to change the cord twice. The extra lenght the extension cord gives is perfect, and the holders to wind the cord around on the Bissell are large enough to accomodate the added extension cord.Overall, I am very pleased with this vacuum!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price works well on the bare floor","review":"When I bought it it was only 15 dollars.For the price this is the best vacuum.I like it because I can use it with stick and without stick.I like 3 way use system!!!!It works great on my kitchen floor and play mat for my son.It works on the carpet for the dust but don't expect it will work as upright heavy vacum on your carpet.I use it for the carpet everyday because it is so light and easy to use. When I open the vacuum to clean it. I know it did its job because there are many dust.For the price this is the best and convinient vacuum!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great a buy","review":"It's quite an ordeal to use this machine.

Save your money and time.","review":"This vacuum has great suction. Unfortunately, the dirt/dust it sucks goes straight into the air. This thing actually set off my smoke alarms. What doesn't make it into the air builds up inside the vacuum parts, not the dust bin. I have never seen such a poor performing vacuum before. The dust filter is pitiful and the dust bin doesn't completely close tight, which adds to more dust in the air. The cord is also too short unless you're planning to vacuum within 8 feet of an electrical outlet. Suction and price were better than expected but that means nothing when the dirt/dust goes into the air. Thankfully Amazon has an easy return policy."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"When you consider how much a broom costs, this is not a bad deal. However, the feather weight is very limited in what it can do and how much it can hold. After playing around with it for a few months, this is the plan of attack we've come up with. We leave it plugged-in in the living room, the wide nozzle is off and we use it about twice a day to pick up dog hair. We have a big dog and bare floors so it works well without the wide floor attachment. Cleaning out the canister is a nasty proposition, though. If it was just the dog hair, that would be one thing, but it picks up lots a dust, which ordinarily would be a plus, but the emptying process usually means another cleanup at best, or a face full of dust at worst. I think I'd be happy to pay twice as much if it came with 100 cheapy little bags that could be thrown away if it meant a cleaner cleanup.Also, the wide attachment is useless except for giving the vac a wider base to stand on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough suction for me","review":"I read a lot of reviews before purchasing this vacuum and was STILL disappointed in the poor suction and returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I game mine away","review":"it won't even stand up by itself against a wall...doesnt'do well on carpet at all.

I dont know what's other people's need but all i wanted is a vacuum that can get all the dust. I wasnt looking to pick bigger stuffs. Just dust.But, when i use it, it doesnt have enough power. It wont get to corners or edges because suction is not power enough. If you're using the hand version, you need to be very close to the surface and even that way it wont take all the dust off, so i still have to sweep or use other tools.I guess its only 20, but at least it should do one small thing good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple and not for heavy Cleaning","review":"It works well for simple cleaning like floors, Sofa's.

Works better than all those expensive vaccums"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this vacuum","review":"If you have hardwood floors and don't have to worry about carpets much then this is a great vacuum to have around. We use it instead of a broom and it works great at picking up hair, dirt, crumbs, the insides of plush toys (we call it the remains of my dogs victims) and even dry dog food. The only set back is that it makes no difference on carpets. Luckily we just have throw rugs so I just take them outside once a week to rid them of dust and dirt but still it would have been nice to use this little guy on them. Overall I recommend this vacuum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenience in a small package","review":"I use this for small jobs around the kitchen and it works well. Lots of suction power and you can use it as a handheld or put the extension handle on the main assembly and use it as an electric broom for floors. Cleaning the internal bag is somewhat messy, however, but if you use care and do it over a trash bin, it's not too ugly. For the price, its performance is worth the money. I thought it was a \\"rechargeable\\" when I ordered it, and that would have made it more convenient, but I'm satisfied anyway, since the suction power appears to be greater than a rechargeable's."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for the price","review":"arrived fast, great little vacuum, the only issue I have is holding on to the attachments when not in use, but other that... great for a fast clean up and the price? excellent"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vacuum for our boat","review":"We needed a compact vacuum for our boat and the Bissell Featherweight is perfect.

It picked up the grass, but no way was it going to pick up the little grit that my other vacuum cleaner would have done.It just wasn't powerful enough. It didn't cost much, so I don't feel like I lost much, but I was hoping for much better. It is lightweight, though. For finer dirt this is not the vacuum -- save your money.

In fact, if you're plagued by vague symptoms of any kind, this is a doubly must read.Simply put, this book's message is that we all don't thrive on the same kind of diet. Some people (like me) do better on a high protein diet, while others do better on a higher carbohydrate diet.The author goes into great detail about why this is so, and backs up his assertions with considerable scientific evidence and studies.So how do you tell what kind of diet is right for you? Well, there's a self test within the book, comprised of about 50 questions or so. After taking this test, you'll have a pretty good idea what your ideal metabolic type is, and you can design your diet accordingly.Bottom line: This book is highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair to mild","review":"There were a lot of unclosed loops in the book.

In this book, he reflects on the many strange synchronisities that appeared as he moved through his journey at the time. I took away the understanding that the more attention and devotion to any subject, the more the subject will elaborate itself. The greater the elaboration the more it will appear that whatever it is, IS real.I enjoyed the memoir and I wish that one thing in this book was more true: that my reality tunnel was running more through a collective based on the value of understanding consciousness.

Some times I'd finish reading few chapters and deliberately just stop, with ache, so I can look forward meeting with the characters again and have the story last longer.This is a beautiful story of a young women from a Provencal lavender farm, being sent to work in Marceilles.Her determination to succeed in the big world, passion for life,friendhip,love and most of all being a beautiful human, makes you want to have this book open always,on every single chapter, even after the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Information / Incorrect Information","review":"I own a 96 Trans AM w/ the RAM air option.

Neither Pires nor Abbado seem to be able to bring to the foreground the remarkable subtlety of Mozart's language. This becomes increasing apparent in the modulations (slow mvmt.from #17, the development in the first mvmt. of #21 or the give-and-take between the soloist and the woodwinds in the last mvmt. of the same), or in their tones. It is brittle and lacking in warmth, sensitivity or feeling. The tempi are uneven, at times too fast, and while Pires may be outgoing, but these are 2 masterpieces for more reasons than that alone. I would personally favor Perahia's recording of #17, and for #21, either Brendel with Sir Neville Marriner (except for Radu Lupu's cadenza to the first mvmt.) or preferably, Kovecevich with Sir Colin Davis and the London Symphony. Unfortunately, the latter is now only available in the UK.

Written entirely without punctuation, and sometimes a little obscure as to exactly what is going on, this book does not make for easy reading. It's worth the effort, though.I almost didn't get through it myself. \\"Post-modern hocus-pocus,\\" I thought sourly, as I read the first third. But it becomes oddly compelling, even poetic. Beckett's severely minimalistic style is fascinating; there's nothing in this book except the eerily dehumanized voice of its narrator, a lonely monologue that generates real poignancy. The effect is like hearing a voice from beyond the grave, and it haunts the mind like few conventionally written novels do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Proto-literature","review":"Beckett does not move past the novel: he predates it. How It Is is a work trapped in the space before language: in the \\"primordial mud\\" from which life emerges: from which suffering takes shape.

Despite the vast cruelties that he clear-sightedly portrays and the passing of what in the 20th century was still almost a feudal society, Thomson never loses his affection and interest in the people, whether one calls them Irish, Anglo-Irish, Protestant, Catholic, or what have you.

Please, take my word and read this book, or start reading the series. They're incredibly worth your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly dissapointing","review":"'The ill-made mute' was a beautiful story about an interesting and flawed protagonist. Then somehow that heroine, who was flawed and beaten but not broken turned into the most beautiful lady in the world, in love with a king and possessing wealth untold. And all her personality dribbled away.I could not empatise at all with the characters in either 'Lady of the Sorrows' or 'The Battle of Evernight' (any character who calls their love \\"My dark fire\\" lost me at the first heartfelt sigh.) This was the most dissapointing though.The biggest pity is that Cecilia Dart-Thornton obviously has a lot of talent. Her writing and beautiful and flows wonderfully(when she hasn't gone onto another story telling tangent) and it's just a pity she didn't write her lead characters with human failings. They're so much more interesting then."},{"rating":"1","title":"wimpy","review":"The first book was wonderful. The second was good; not great, but good. The third was just so much wimpy mush. The main character, Ash, was great in the first book because she was strong and smart. She saw the flaws in others and was very perceptive. She was kind and gentle without being a fainting doormat. In the second book she is still pursuing her goal in a non \\"oh, my goodness\\" manner and the history of why she is the way she is, is great and takes up a 1/3 of the book. She is naive and innocent, but still an interesting character. In the third book where she gets her memories back, it seems like she looses her spine and her smarts. She seems to relie way too much on a man saving her. Granted, it is a middle-ages setting, but still, after all she has been through, she should be tougher, not weaker. The prithees and thous do bug after awhile, the author could have done less or not at all. Over all the book is worth skimming over to see how the trilogy is tied up but not worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skipped most of it","review":"This lady has a writing knack, no doubt about it. She can create a world really well. Some of her ideas are quirky, unique and downright fascinating. And the way she has taken the old fairy tales of the UK and transformed them into a story reveals considerable research.Yet the characters failed to engage me. There was so much distance between me and the characters that I found it impossible to have any loyalties towards any of them. Far too many prithees and dost thous for my liking.There were also far too many instances where the story would just stop and CDT would describe a flower or a tree or some other such thing, as though these sidetracks added to the story. If you deleted all the unnecessary descriptions, you might reduce the size of the trilogy by 10-20%.And the ending was infuriating, as though CDT had run out of puff and ideas.Not worth the purchase price."},{"rating":"1","title":"In a word - HORRIBLE!","review":"It took me quite a while to get interested in the 1st book of the series, but once I did I enjoyed it and the 2nd book quite a lot. However, in reading this, the 3rd book, it appears that the author decided not to carry through any part of the main character's personality. She's bland and lacks any qualities to make the reader care whether she finds happiness or not.I kept hoping the book would \\"pick up\\" as the 1st one did, but unfortunately that never happens. As others have mentioned, the ending it poorly done and personally made me wish that I hadn't wasted the time on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agggh terrible ending","review":"The key thing about this book is that I could have binned the book when I read the ending!!! CDT - you might be advised to do an updated edition.TOTALLY unsatisfying ending that finishes all in a rush and lack of steam. The book has lots and lots of beautifully written descriptions (and yes I did skip pages and pages of it) but what is the good of all that great world building if we skimp on plot and character. The protagonist starts out interesting in ill made mute but gets more and more Mary Sue as the series progresses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want an SAT vocab book?

Intriguing story, but poorly written."},{"rating":"1","title":"The series started so well, too bad....","review":"that it ended so poorly. I hope that Cecilia learns how to end books better for her next series as I really really liked the first two book.

I certainly recommend the first two, then make up a conclusion in your own mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"lost in the darkness","review":"I'll have to say the first book in the series was the best written of the three. It was what kept me interested in the story, and the reason I finished the trilogy. The second was an enjoyable diversion, though not as well-written. I wasn't completely satisfied, but decided to read the final book because the first had been so good. This final book in the series wanders aimlessly around, a thick molasses of prose dragging on. Finally, it completely loses itself with the ending. Even an epilogue fails at an attempt to recover the loss.I would recommend that you do not read this trilogy unless you've already started. It starts with a rush only to falter to an agonizingly slow pace, and then finally it completely disappoints you with a wreck of an ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible ending","review":"There was promise in the first book, but I have to say not as much as is claimed by some here. The second dragged, and this one was terrible. And the ending was absolutely offensive. I would recommend Charles de Lint, Juliet Marillier or Elizabeth Haydon if you are looking for a lovely touch of Celtic writing, and skip this trilogy all together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crushed by the denouement","review":"As with the previous books, the prose was well-written. I couldn't put the book down because of the plot twists and turns. However, the ending was totally inappropriate. CDT was probably feeling guilty because she tried to rescue her trilogy with an EPILOGUE!!! Her editors should have screamed at her. If you want to read well-written tragedies that have a love story, pick Elizabeth Haydon, Jacqueline Carey, or Robin Hobb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying and Aimless","review":"I skipped through paragraphs at a time, and only finished the book because I was hooked by \\"The Ill Made Mute\\". The author could go on for pages about the bark of a tree, but she introduces characters and doesn't do anything with them. We meet wonderful characters and become involved with their lives, and then they just sort of drift away. Even the heroine ambles along without a path or a definite goal. I had to force myself to finish the book, and put it away feeling irritated and disgruntled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunate ending to an interesting trilogy","review":"I had such high hopes for this trilogy! I had a hard time starting the first book, then got hooked when it began involving the \\"wights\\" old world scottish faery tales and thought it might be going somewhere. After three books i believe readers deserved more than a P.S. at the end of the book implying a rumor of a happy ending. If you chose to view it that way of course. Since the eagle does fly away with a seabird linked with a CHAIN it may very well have meant her perfect faery king wasnt terribly happy that she hadnt trusted him to protect her and was simply retreiving her. ah well good or bad the ending was extremely dissapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitterblunder","review":"I loved the first two books in this series and being somewhat of a soppy romantic I had fallen in love with the unErithly beauty of \\"Thorn\\". I finished reading 'The Battle of Evernight' about an hour ago and I am still reeling from the putrid, pathetic ending. The ending is so unsatisfying and utterly hateful that I wish I had never starting reading the series. I have given it two stars in memory of my love of the first two books. Don't bother with it folks. Read Lord of the Rings again instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat better than the 1st two","review":"If you read the first two books in the trilogy, go ahead and finish. If you haven't, don't start.As stated numerous times in the listed reviews, the ending left a lot to be desired. The plot twist upon her return did not follow the thread of the story up to that point and it then just abruptly ended.CDT's prose is oustanding but her placement of the details is often times suspect, interrupting an action part of the novel with drawn-out, detailed descriptions that leave you wanting to skip the prose to find out the outcome of the action. At times, the action sequence ends and your tossed into a different sequence where you are unsure of the outcome of the previous events. I found myself skipping back to see some sort of resolution, but none existed. The first book drove me crazy in this aspect, the third still exhibits this characteristic, but not as bad.I'm just a person that can't stop reading a trilogy once started. But this one almost changed me in that regard."},{"rating":"1","title":"A new Genre: Fantasy/Romance :(","review":"I read this series when it first came out and wish I had stopped at book 1. The writing style is agonizing to read. The story and concept is excellent but the writing style drags on and on. I've never read a romance novel but I expect it would sound like many parts of this book. I read the whole series and unfortunately each one gets to be more and more like a romance novel. Reading this series was somewhat tolerable as you can just skip over pages and pages of the descriptive text and not miss a thing. It's really ashame because there was so much potential here and I really wanted to like this series. The faerie lore is the only redeeming quality and the reason for the second star. The best part was that the ending left no room for a book four."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nice Finish","review":"I love the trilogy, I love the plot. However the execution needed a tiny bit of work. This book had the most excessive note on the detail of every place they travelled and every animal, wight, and tree they saw. I'd say 1/4 of this book was dialouge and the other 3/4 was travelling and description of the travel so it was kind of too slow paced for me. And if you're one who can't stand old english and reading wight accents this will be a challenge. I am one of these people so alot of the time i had to just skip parts. But don't be turned off if you've read the other two, it is still a wonderful story. If you haven't read the others, you probably don't want to start with this one, go back to The Ill-Made Muse and enjoy.

Being the first book in a series, it tended to have a lot of character development. Although it picks up towards the end it isn't quite up to the same level as some of the authors other works i.e...Dragonlanc Chronicles. The plot involves several main characters who all have serious flaws in their very human personalities. While i appreciated this more real envisionment of the proposed \\"heroes\\" it also seemed to repel my interest being that there are no particularly likeable characters.

I continued to modify it by swapping the tube out for a better one. I notice it was still giving a thin sound. I then replaced the capsule & still no good.By the end of my modification I concluded that the mic was cheaply made & nothing short of replacing all the inner parts (transformers, wires etc...) would help this mic...I guess thats what you get for a mic under $200"},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"These things are awkward to handle and simply don't work well.

I was expecting one grip but it comes with 2 which is nice I guess. Overall, I'm disappointed with it but I should have known it was crap from the price.

I mean, it's one thing to cover your back against lawsuits by writing a \\"no-names-mentioned\\" roman-a-clef, but to do that and then slap \\"Anonymous\\" on the cover...that's like ringing your neighbor's doorbell and then, instead of running, beating yourself up so you could say a mugger did it.

If you read the firsttwo thirds and then put it down, you will be just as happy,if not happier, than if you finished it.

I read it because I heard everything in it was true. That is easy to say because nothing is ever clearly stated it is eluded to. If the point of this book is that Clinton, or Stanton, as he is called in the book messed up every life he ever touched I didn't need a book to find that out it I and most people already know that. I gave this book two stars because the one good charcter in this story is Libby and she is entitled to the two stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT READ!!","review":"I found this book absolutely fascinating. It had just enough reality to it that I didn't feel like I was reading fiction the entire time. It was indeed humorous from beginning to end. The one drawback was the mind-numbing number of characters. Many of them, however, played such small parts, that you could pretty much ignore them and focus on the main, integral players. This book is worth reading simply because of the character of Libby. She is definitely one of the most fun and outrageous characters I have ever had the privelage of reading. I recommend this to anyone. One of my all-time favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little confusing, but a good read","review":"Primary Colors is a definite recommendation, although exactly like the movie. It has good insites into the world of politics, and I enjoyed it even though I'm 14. I did have faults with it though. There are too many characters to keep straight. The book lags in many parts. Also, if Susan Stanton is based on Hillary Clinton they make her into a saint compared to the real Hillary. As for the redeeming qualities of Primary Colors, it's funny, gives a good look into the workings of a campaign, and makes you care about the main characters. As far as I'm concerned the enjoyable parts of the book outweigh the flaws."},{"rating":"1","title":"SEE THE MOVIE!!","review":"The book was the exact same as the movie...virtually word forword.

A lie would be what a great piece of writing. It is not absolutely terrible so it makes you cry either.

For a political story go for something a bit more funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cynical Look at Politics","review":"Joe Klein, no not of NBA infamy, takes a poke or two at the political foundation of America - in a humorous manner. Told in 1st person narration by Henry Burton, a young African American with political and civil rights lineage, Primary Colors proves to be a satirical look at the election process, the genuineness of the political candidate, the many faults of the system itself, as well as the intricacies of running a campaign from the inside - the staffers' points of view.Having read All the King's Men by Robert Penn Warren, I felt compelled to pick up Primary Colors and have a look-see. Although not on the Pulitzer Prize winning level of its predecessor, Primary Colors provides for biting political satire and insight as well as just pure entertainment. I must admit that despite the lack of redeeming value that the book provided, I read it tirelessly as I found it entertaining & humorous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kind of \\"clean tabloiding\\" and \\"dustbusting\\"","review":"When I got the German version of the book, called \\"Mit aller Macht\\", it was always hard for me to stop reading it when I had to go to bed.

The scary part of the book is the final truth that Stanton is the one best suited for the job. No doubt he is concerned about the people. He can work an audience, and knows the art of hand shaking, but we can't and should not forget the major weaknesses in his character that should disqualify him from achieving the goal he so desperately seeks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I expected.","review":"When I first read that Wakeman and Cousins were reuniting to record a disc of new music with Chas Cronk and Tony Fernandez, I thought it would make for some creative and enjoyable music. Turns out I was right. With one exception , the fact that there isn't much in the way of contributions from Cronk, Fernandez or Ric Sanders (violin). This is primarily a collection of duets. Cousins and Wakeman cover the majority of the instrumentation as well as composing all of the pieces. Surprisingly, Cousins' voice sounds terrific. A bit aged, but still terrific. There are a couple of upbeat numbers where the entire band plays energetically but overall, this is is a quiet but complex recording. These two old friends compliment eachother brilliantly. Wakeman is just brilliant. It's a treat to hear something this special thirty plus years from the origins of prog-rock. Well worth picking up.

A limited ingredient list is used over and over in some uninspiring combinations; nearly every recipe relies on either soy protein powder or whey protein powder, and neither one in my experience results in desserts that taste like *the real thing*.The only two sweeteners used are sucralose and stevia. No mention is made of other popular sugar alcohols like maltitol, xylitol, and erythritol.

Granted, I must admit that I only sampled the Chocolate Chip Delights and Maple Pecan Drops before I couldn't stomach any more. The cookies not only looked odd, but they were horrible-tasting and difficult to swallow.I'm afraid I will be relisting this book for sale, although I wouldn't recommend its purchase.

It's a series of self-important ramblings disguised as case studies, offering very little actual insight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good, but a lot bad","review":"It seems ironic to me that Mr. Levenkron says in this book how self-injurers are treated with contempt and misunderstood, but he himself misunderstands the basic facts. He bases his conclusions on self-injurers merely from a few girls he sees himself, and there are faults with this: one being, most of the girls he sees have been abused in the past, and while I admit that many are abused, not all self-injurers are abused, a fact he seems to overlook. As he says in his book, self-injury needs more attention, and I agree, but I'm not sure as if this sort of attention is what the sufferers need. A good book if all you're interested in is one person's view but if you want a balanced opinion, pass this one by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Penis Envy and Other Such Banter","review":"Levenkron is much like Freud, somehow he means well but over all he is spreading misinformed propaganda. The reason that \\"self-mutilation\\" is not in the DMS - IV is because it is a symptom of multiple mental illnesses, not an independent condition (to answer a question posed by Levenkron). The main fault I found with this book is Levenkron's tendancy to place himself in the role of savior, which could be construed as sign of narcissistic personality disorder. Instead of describing the more clinical aspects of cutting, as well as reasons behind the coping mechanism, he implies that the only way to \\"get rid\\" of this \\"disorder\\" is to place all one's trust in the perfect therapist (himself). To add to the further irony of this book, there was an ad for cutlery (50% off) next to the \\"ad\\" for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cutting: Understanding and Overcoming Self-Mutilation","review":"I found this book too frustratingly self-congratulatory to gain any insight from it. As I read the author's accounts, it seemed he was more interested in portraying himself skillfully penetrating these girls' psyches like a master swordsman, leaving these poor waifs astonished and broken by his superior knowledge of them. I also bought \\"Bright Red Scream\\" by Marilee Strong, which I found much more objective and covered a much bigger picture on the topic than this book. A lot was applicable and insightful, a lot made sense and explained a lot. Some of it was very indirectly relevant and perhaps superfluous, but interesting nevertheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very helpful book","review":"I recently bought this book and read it from cover to cover.

He makes self-injury into a form of psychosis, as opposed to the coping mechanism it is (even if it is maldaptive). He views it entirely as a sickness, and never seems to fully take into account why his clients use this form of coping.I find this book to be almost insulting as it invalidates all reasons a person might have for using such a painful coping mechanism, which at the same time causes an invalidation of the person. There are some excellent books on the market that address self-injury; this is definitely NOT one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must be the only.......","review":"I must be the only \\"cutter\\" that didn't come from a broken/abusive/etc home.Though I found some of the book informative, the focus on child abuse throws me for a loop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recognition of a very mis-understood activity","review":"I've been an on-off cutter for 17 years. I knew it was a problem, but never admitted it to anyone, and had managed to avoid clear detection. Though never knew what really caused the condition. Seeing this title on a bookshelf left no doubt that I had to read it to better understand the activity. I now understand it, and can clearly see where it started. The only problem is that while the book clearly identifies some of the emotional isolation that causes this problem, it doesn't present any path out of that isolation. It works on the assumption that the cutter has already been detected and exposed. This is not always the case in a mature, highly intelligent, but vulnerable cutter."},{"rating":"1","title":"made me feel like a statistic .","review":"i myself have dealt with cutting, i still deal with it everyday, and this book not only made me feel like a statisitc but it also didn't touch a lot of subjects. this book made me want to cut myself while i was reading it. i highly suggest reading another if you are a self-injurier, or if you are just reading about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This book is a great book!

While it's nice to have a no-nonsense attitude, he only includes patients with whom he's had success so that he comes out smelling like roses.There is little solid implication that therapy is in development for self-harm, and it is irresponsible to present case history information with the idea that two pages per person (half of which is self-agrandizement) adequately expostulates their plights. This book, in my opinion, is a psychology disaster.I urge people in therapy and also caregivers to take great care in diversifying research material beyond this book, but to read it anyway, if only to get a ground-idea about some of the twisted ideas and myths that float among therapists regarding the subject matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"I self-injured for many years as a teen and young adult.

Levenkron has done a great disservice to the community and to self injurers by continuing this all too common error. This book is not a fair examination of a very serious syndrome, but a biased and incomplete book designed more to provide a soapbox for Levenkron's studies in anorexia nervosa.

This book is great both for cutters and for those close to them, as it speaks to both. Most importantly, my friend read it too, and it has helped us have a good dialogue about the book and about her situation. If you read this book and keep in mind Levenkron's advice when you are interacting with a cutter, you might help that person to feel more comfortable with you and other people, thereby alleviating some of her isolation and desire to cut."},{"rating":"2","title":"No denying skill, but still freeze-dried","review":"It says a lot about contemporary poetry when a prize-winning collection's frame of reference is 40s and 50's jazz music -- a form not popular since, well, the 1950s. The Singer book skillfully drops all the requisite jazzbo references, which must make people like W.S. Merwin, the Yale Series judge, ache for his youth or at least feel hep for the hour. But how long can poetry crutch on such shop-worn referentiality? Certainly not long enough to earn poetry a general and appreciative audience. My quibble here isn't with the skill -- that's all there. It reminds me of the question the late poet William Matthews, also a jazz fan, once posed to a lecture audience: \\"What did posterity do for us lately?\\" In the case of this book, not much, I'm afraid.

Unfortunately, the author's self-importance seems to get in the way of his ability to even frame his own position. His \\"Martian man\\" perspective comes up now and again but is not adopted with any rigor, merely tossed about in a sea of observational rhetoric unbacked by empirical evidence.

I generally love Anne Rice's books, but this...............this was disturbing. I'm no prude by any stretch of the imagination, but this was just disturbing.

As many others have said, there is a lot of spanking in the story. Also, I know everyone has different preferences in the erotica department, but this book did absolutely nothing to titillate my senses, and usually I can appreciate quite a variety of styles. I felt absolutely no connection with the characters, Beauty is pretty young in the story (15, yes I know back then this was a more acceptable age, but still!). And I really never figured out Beauty's character at all. Nor do I want to read the next two books to even try to figure her out, it is definitely not worth my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"the claiming of sleeping beauty","review":"Horrible, no changes to the story.

I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't deserve ANY stars!","review":"My first clue should have been at the never-ending forward explaining to me why, I, as the reader should give this book a chance. I purchased this on kindle for an exorbitant amount of money for a book that is absolutely awful. It's repetitive, boring and so gritty that I was the one who felt used after reading only half of this book. I love a great D/s book more than anything, but I like ones where the participants are willing and understand the relationships they are seeking out. This, just left me hollow. The premiss of the twisted fairytale was ingenious, however only if done correctly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it!","review":"Stopped reading a third of the way through and I NEVER do that!

I cannot believe this book was put on a \\"if you like Fifty Shades\\" list. It is NOTHING like \\"Fifty\\" and I couldn't believe what I was reading. I would never recommend this book and have actually told people to not purchase it. Read at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good at all","review":"Not up to A Rice's standards.

Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cut the bull and call it what it is","review":"This review applies to the enitre series. A friend told me about them and I had to see it for myself. What really kills me is that people insist on calling this \\"erotica.\\" All Anne Rice has done is taken hard core S&M pornography and dressed it up in frilly Victorian themes. Wander into the adult section of your local video store, pick up any low budget flick made in a dingy motel room and substitute \\"Buck Naked\\" and \\"Summer Rain\\" with \\"Prince Tristan\\" and \\"Lady Juliana\\" and you're all set. If you think that pointless mental, physical and sexual torture is a turn-on, I suppose you'll enjoy it. But, if you think the rationalization and intellectualization that these books are \\"erotica\\" is a thinly veiled attempt at denial, then you'll probably file this with the paperback versions of \\"Ridin' Miss Daisy\\" and \\"Rambone.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Anne Rice Erotica (Sleeping Beauty what?)","review":"This is a book you don't expect to be bombarded with BDSM. You expect beauty to be the same fairy tale character as she has always been. She is awakened with a kiss and her life is saved with her prince. This is a trilogy, don't bother wasting time reading the other two books. This is a book not for your youngThe Claiming of Sleeping Beautyadults. This is a book different from Anne Rice's usual stories. This is not for christian readers. This book makeds Fifty shades of Gray look good in comparison. I do not recommend this book. The characters are flat and all that happens is beatings of men and women, rapes, sex and punishment. This is a very dark book."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed and disturbed- NOT was I was looking for","review":"I picked up this book because I was looking for some erotica and I am fan of Anne Rice's other work, however I was extremely disappointed. As other reviewers have said, the \\"spanking\\" was so redundant it was annoying, the plot was non-existent and the narrative was only so-so.Most importantly I was NOT aware when I bought this novel that it was so strongly S&M;, nonconsensual acts etc. Some people may enjoy those fantasizes(as fantasizes ONLY) however, pain, the threat of infliction of pain and explict descriptions of forced sexual activity do NOT arose me in the slightest. Unless you are a fan of S&M; I do not suggest you purchase this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Child molestation is not my idea of a good read","review":"If you imagine that the characters in this book are all consenting adults, then this is a decent read. Unfortunately they aren't. The book begins with the Prince raping and awakening 15-16 year old beauty. Yes, raping her. She wasn't awake to give consent. I got half way through this book and couldn't read any more. I have yet to find one mention where any of the 'slaves' give any form of consent at all. A lot of the slaves seem to be 15-20 years old. A book about children being beaten brutally is not my idea of a good read. Any slave showing their unwillingness to do something is punished severely, brutally and cruelly. It is just not a sexy book. If it were completely consensual and all characters were adults, it would be a fairly decent book, unfortunately, they aren't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never-ending Spank-Fest. Where's the Sex?","review":"Although I would say the book is worth reading simply to be able to say you did, I have to worn you: It would be half as long if the spanking sessions were taken out. No,.. I'm not talking about spanking along with sex. I'm talking about pages and pages of descriptive spanking. And where is the sex? Oh! There it is! Those 3 sentences in the last chapter! Although I can say the book WILL turn you on and will push you through to the end, I found myself skimming over entire pages as I thought, \\"Dear God,.. not another spanking.\\" It just got old after a while.The main thrust of the story is a beautiful and brilliant concept, but i could've written better. Makes you wonder what goes on behind Anne's closed doors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I have to use 20 words....Awful, disturbing, demeaning, degrading, disgusting, oppressing, depressing...if people find this \\"erotic\\" well, I guess, to each his own. I regret wasting my money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love erotica, but this is a AWFUL book!","review":"I seriously don't understand how anyone can give this five stars. This was a absolute horrible book. If you get off on a young girl getting raped while she's crying, then I have to suggest therapy for you. I would not suggest this to anyone. THIS IS A HORRIBLE BOOK."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty- neither shocking or erotic.","review":"This is one of the least erotic books I have ever read. It is basicly non stop sex which is neither particularly inspired or, at times particularly realistic. The sex is also neither shocking or all that unusual within this genre. The writing is fairly awfull and struggles to keep the readers intrest. It's only defense is that it is neither flowery or over done. There's no purple prose here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not in any way similar to Fifty Shades","review":"Skimming through the first chapter convinced me to waste my $12.99, besides the \\"if you're looking for something to fill the void of Fifty Shades\\". Spankings, etc. by Christian Grey were hot and sexy. The torture inflicted on the 'love slaves' in Beauty makes you wish the prince and all his people would come to a violent end. There's nothing sexy or romantic about it. I'm trying to force myself to skim through and finish it, but not sure I can."},{"rating":"1","title":"This story is disgusting","review":"This was the most repellent and sickeing, deprived, story I have ever read, very disturbing for a weak mind... I have read thousand of story and exotic too. but nothing like this sick...sick... what-ever... this thing is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable.","review":"I feel compelled to read this book every three or four years. It's as close as I come to Erotica without feeling creepy. The story is a Faery tale so of course it's not going to be literal. Yes, there is way too much spanking (I have never understood the appeal of getting off on being spanked). I definatly prefer backrubs and chocolates.The Bridal Path is also something I could just not get my head around. I couldn't even fathom how it would play out in my imagination.I think the world Ms. Rice creates here is as awful as it is original. It's shocking and horrific so yes, it has the horror element going for it as well.I just can't understand why the sex slaves never rise up and beat the hell out of their tormentors. Weird."},{"rating":"1","title":"Modern women don't serve anyone!","review":"...I was thoroughly discusted with this book! ...I enjoy erotica, but this was not it. It was disturbing and filled with terrifying mental images. Beating people until they bleed is not sensual, its sick! There is enough torture in the world around us, I certainly do not want to read about it, glorified in a book. I didn't finish the book, nor will I ever purchase another one of Anne Rice's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Degrading","review":"I thought this book might be fun to read with my husband. I was wrong! This book is very degrading to women and I don't recommend it to anyone. It is going in my shredder to be recycled into something usefull.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Titillating, but slightly lacking on the. . .well, everything","review":"I have read and re-read all three books on numerous occasions, hoping to find the hidden, deeper reasoning behind it. In these readings, I eventually find myself skipping past the long diatribes of why this submission is so rewarding to some of them, and just reading the tawdry gay and lesbian sex. And yes, there is a LOT of spanking. If you are interested in learning about BDSM, stay away from these books, as they do no more than confuse the hell out of you. I agree with the other reviewer, that I'm fairly certain this was not the socioeconomic trials of Medieval Europe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable.","review":"They say this book is comparable to 50 Shades of Grey, and I must disagree. It is far more about pain than pleasure. There is absolutely no love involved. The story of Ana and Christian is a story of a relationship that just has an interesting sex life, but the story of beauty is about humiliation and complete and total submission. It's disgusting. I can not believe that any person, male or female, would want to be in the position of either Beauty or the Prince. This book is just too much. Sure some of the racy scenes were hot, but it was just too much for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offending","review":"I recently read that if you liked 50 shades then this was a must read. Not. In the first 3 pages I was so offended. It wasn't sexy it was awful. The Prince essentially rapes Beauty while she is still sleeping from her curse and when he finally kisses her to wake her he immediately treats her as an object. I tried to get past it because a friend told me how good it was. I couldn't get past 40 pages and took it back and got a refund. NOT 50 shades. Not respectful. Demeaning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite Anne Rice book","review":"I purchased this book, only after it was recommended as a must read for any Fifty Shades fan and it was not my cup of tea. It bored me to say the least and I quickly lost interest in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"very poorly written","review":"With so much hype, I was looking forward to reading this book. The writing is just awful and the story didn't keep my interest at all. The story was more the problem than anything. I did like 50 shades, though 3 books was a little overkill but this is an author I will never read again. Total waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good","review":"This book does not sound like Anne Rice at al. It is not well writen, the story i poor and is not even sexy as claimed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"Complete waste of time and money. Read the other reviews before purchasing, which were 50/50 and took a chance. I'm the loser."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sexual torment and abuse of children","review":"I find these books very very disturbing. It is not erotica it's torment and abuse. IT IS NOT LIKE FIFTY SHADES OF GREY AT ALL. All Anne Rice does is describe these characters abuse and it is the same thing over and over again. Chapter after chapter of the same \\"punishment\\" and no real story line. PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Claim of Sleeping Beauty","review":"This book was nothing like I thought it would be. It was graphic and sadistic. Nothing romantic about sex slaves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't even finish","review":"Degrading and demoralizing. Made it half way thru and had to stop reading. I do not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly Disgusting","review":"I am a few chapters into the book, and so far it is the worst thing I have ever read. First, the Prince is 18 and Beauty is 15. She is constantly \\"punished\\" and screwed on any given occasion. She is made to speak only when spoken to and is not allowed to wear clothing, even in front of her parents. Excuse me? What kind of person would gladly write child porn and sell it openly? Part of me wants to keep reading because I feel bad for Beauty and hope that things get better for her, but at this point I think it will only get worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Common dirty book with MUCH more imagination","review":"I've never beeon one to read erotica books, but I really like Anne Rice so I thought, \\"Why not?\\" I must say that even though the story line is a bit static and shallow, the things this woman comes up with, as far as punishments, are amazing. The book managed to hold my attention for 3 days. Because that's how long it took me to read it. It will definitely open up some areas of sexuality that you may never have even considered, and your wife/husband just may thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"How many synonyms for \\"buttocks\\" could possibly be used?","review":"This book was painfully repetitive. The spankings held my interest for a few pages, but the whole novel? Perhaps the plot and character development are in the next two books. I like the idea of discovering hidden sexual layers in Sleeping Beauty, but the descriptions are trite and cliched. I find it difficult to believe a woman wrote a novel with so much humiliation, punishment and borderline rape yet no insight or character growth. I threw it across the room to prevent my IQ from dropping any lower. If you like page after page of raw backsides, read this, if you want intelligent erotica, try Anais Nin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blecccchhhhhhh!!!!","review":"This was just a terrible book. In her forward, Ann Rice compares her story to, and says she preceeded Fifty Shades and the concept of dom/sub. But hers is taken to a weird extreme and in my limited humble opinion on the subject, it's NOT provocative or sexy, or even interesting. If you could give negative stars for a review, this book would get it.And in addition to the excrutiating read, it made my knees hurt!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lazy and Slatternly Writing","review":"The most outstanding feature of this book is the fact that it rambles on for so long.As is mentioned in so many reviews, only 1-2 pages even make reference to the Sleeping Beauty legend. Furthermore, not only is there no context for the kingdom in which the no-doubt syphilitic queen and prince reign, but the author only occasionally attempts to invoke the apparently mediaeval period in which the tale is set by throwing in words like \\"breeches,\\" \\"ermine,\\" or in one case a \\"pointed\\" damsel \\"hat.\\"I purchased this book for a book group meeting - I'm just glad that I finished it quickly enough to pass it around to everyone else in the group so as to minimize sales of this rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it","review":"When I started reading this book the feminist in me was screaming. I am not a hardcore feminist, but I was doing a concentration in Women's Studies and after reading half the book I could not pick it back up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I am an avid reader of all sorts of genres, and it's very rare I can not get in to a book. A friend recommended this as a good follow-up to 50 Shades of Grey. Not even close. It's very violent, not my style at all. I couldn't get past the first few chapters after seeing the way the woman was treated. She's not a piece of meat, she's a woman. Frankly, I found this book rather disgusting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Claiming of Beauty","review":"It was interesting. I could have done without so much beatings, but I continued to read and became so involved with the characters. The strength these poor slaves show is unreal, but as the author states, it's fairytale, not real. I will continue onto the next book to see what is in store for Beauty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interestingly raw","review":"Hard read knowing that there was so much pain and humiliation torchering the royalty.

I was so bored that I couldn't even finish it"},{"rating":"1","title":"it's garbage","review":"I usually like Anne Rice's stuff, but you have to some kind of loser to think this was anything other than a medium for her to vent her obvious sexual frustration. Total crap, just mind-numbing s&m with no plot, character development, etc. I have no problem with erotica, but I guess you have to be really into being abused to get turned on by this at all. If you're not in to that, don't read this book for any other reason cause there's nothing else there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my thing","review":"I didn't even finish reading this one... don't waste your money.

It starts off with a young girl essentially raped and then progresses with graphic sexual abuse of young men and women. It disgusted me and I am so relieved I did not order the trilogy. Anne Rice should be ashamed of herself and this book will keep me from EVER reading anything else written by her!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is absolute crap","review":"This book is a waste of the ink and paper used to produce it. Having it advertized as \\"if you liked 50 Shades of Grey, you'll Love The Sleeping Beauty Trilogy\\" is so misleading and extremely disappointing. I can't believe I've wasted my time reading this book and I certainly won't waste my money on finishing the trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh...","review":"I had to force myself to finish the book. I have read other Anne Rice books, such as Interview with the Vampire and Queen of the Damned and loved them, but this book was so utterly boring and repetitive that I put it down several times. At one point, I thought about abandoning it completely. Also, the rape and constant humiliation of a fifteen year old girl isn't exactly appealing.Oh, and Anne...A penis is just a penis. A butt is just a butt. And a vagina is a vagina. Address them as such. Not everything needs a pretty synonym."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like getting spanked with welts to go with it? Or maybe being humiliated is more your thing...","review":"The book does what the forward claims; there are scenarios and in depth details almost on every page, which is what \\"seduced\\" me into making this my first erotica book.The book got two stars instead of one because the writing itself is decent and saved it from a one star. The story is about a 15 year old princess who fell asleep for the 100 years, so I guess she's technically of age, becomes a love slave and learns to lose her fear. Basically.There is A TON of spanking and humiliation with a fair amount of bondage mixed in to lighten things up. Not my thing, which is why I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiction, but come on!","review":"Let's be real. The characters in this book and the other books in the trilogy are far, too well adjusted. Being repeatedly raped and dehumanized does not create a well rounded person as Anne Rice is portraying. She presents the happenings as a Dom/Sub society to help the reader deal with and ignore the brutality. Beauty & Laurent ride off to live happily ever after? At least she kept it a Fairy Tale in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!!!","review":"I generally do not consider myself a prude, but this was WAY TOO MUCH! I ordered the trilogy, was excited when it got here, and dove right in, and was horribly let down. I kept reading through page sixty something, thinking that an actual story would begin to take shape, but it was not to be. At that point I was disturbed and disgusted, I seriously worry about anyone who enjoys this book. I like a raunchy story, but rape, beatings, humiliation, and any annoying amount of spankings??? All three books are in my garbage can, unfinished and unread, and my life will be better because of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"disgusted","review":"I bought this book Several months ago and recently someone asked me about it. I did not find this book very enjoyable it was difficult for someone \\"rape survivor\\" to read. I do not suggest this book to anyone who has survived a rape or been in a domestic violence relationship. Unfortunately I could not return the purchase and believe me i had tried. I only read the first few chapters and decided right away this book was not a good read for someone like me. I am sure others might find it enjoyable but i am truly disgusted with it"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty","review":"This was my first Anne Rice novel and though I understand that this is not her usual genre, I don't think I will be reading another book by Ms. Rice. I expected there to be more of a plot for this story, I was intrigued by the idea of an erotic twist on a fairy tale. I was disappointed by the lack of character development. If anyone is looking for pages upon pages of naked princes and princesses being tortured, this is the book that will fulfill that requirement.If you're looking for a story, try another book.I hardly ever dislike a book I purchased full price, especially after reading great reviews, but this book is not what I was expecting. More character development and less paddling would be nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!!!","review":"i am an avid reader and I could not get past the first chapter...

Not even close. Too far out there and not even believable. Disturbing. Will not read the other two books in series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was looking for...","review":"I'm a fan of some of Anne Rice's books, but she seems to vary wildly in quality and tone, so I'm never sure whether I'll love or hate the next book. I was curious about this trilogy because I thought it would be neat if pornography were written by someone with real talent. My complaint isn't that the sex offended me (obviously you'll want to avoid these books if you're offended by \\"mature themes\\"), but the problem is that they just aren't well written. There's a starting point and an ending point, but it appears that each chapter in between is merely an exercise in whatever sort of sexual escapade she felt like writing that day. So it's just a collection of sloppy writing and disjoint incidents, and (I'm not a connoisseur of pornography, so maybe this isn't fair) it's probably no special addition to the porn genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"DULL, DULL AND DULL!","review":"I had read previous reviews about this series and since I enjoyed the Vampire books that Ann Rice had written, I was looking forward to her new twist on an old fairytale. It was awful. What could have been an electrically charged retelling of a familiar story became a marathon of spankings after spankings. Save your money and forget this stupid series altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"the entire series was a waste of my life","review":"so I started reading this book after I read bared to you and let me tell you this is nothing close to erotic. this series is more about princess and princesses being used as sex slaves and its claimed that they're being taught when really they're just being humiliated and tormented. This book doesn't mention anything but spanking, paddles, spanking, sobbing, spanking, buttocks, spanking, spanking and more spanking. thats all it is is spanking and how people touch their sex and people tug on their nipples and crawling naked. the whole book is repetitive and pointless. I don't even recommend reading this book to see if you like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't stand it!!!","review":"First, I'm not an overly sensitive reader. The graphic sexual nature of this book , reads like a child saying things for shock value, at least at first. Then it just gets predictable. I've read Fifty Shades of Grey and the big difference in these books to me is that Fifty actually has a story to it. I could empathize with the characters and the book was emotion evoking. The only emotions I felt reading this book were anger and disgust. The abuse Beauty suffers is so offensive to me as a woman. And I find it completely unbelievable and ludicrous that she would have any desire for the perpetrator? This isn't BDSM - it's sadistic abuse by a misogynistic man and a host of other characters. I'm really disturbed that anyone, much less a female, could stomach this book. I REALLY hated this book and wish I had never bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit \\"hard core\\" for me...","review":"This book was a little to hard core for me.

There at least was a story line in fifty, in this book it was nothing but spankings page after page and the men making her do what they wanted. There was no romance or even any erotica. I can't even say this is BDSM because I don't think nothing but spanking qualifies in that department. For you very few who like this that's great, we are all entitled to our own opinion but this book doesn't even deserve to be in the same category as fifty, let alone be a book where \\"if you liked fifty shades of grey then try this\\", it's just boring and although usually if I lend my books out I want them back, this is one my borrower may keep.

I have read many of her novels and am a great fan, yet Beauty is just too much for me. I immediately saw where 50 Shades has taken her ideas and turned them into a modern day story (personally I would have been a bit upset by this) even the lip biting habit. All and all, the attraction to the story of love and lust with the trilogy in 50 was addicting. This book, so sorry Anne, is nothing more than raw, graphic, repetitive pure vile acts of animalistic sex. I found no tenderness acts of love or romance in it at all. To be sexy and capture the mind (which is part of seducing one) it takes more than the acts of dominance and rape. I wish I had stuck with 50 shades lingering in my mind.....I would still be romancing the ideas of Christian and Anastasia.

I thought that this would have been a love story."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is just really badly written erotica","review":"can't Anne Rice use the english language any better than this? (maybe she's better in her other books) this book just comes off as really badly written smut! Unless you have never ever imagined or been exposed to the concept of S&M or D/s, every scene in this story is completely predictable and repetitive. But, if you've read any other D/s fiction, i would bet that whatever you've read before is probably much more erotic than this. I can't even put this book in the hard core erotica category, 'cause there's books that are much more hardcore than this. And if you're looking for softcore erotica, the writing in here is definitely not subtle or eloquent enough to qualify. A suggestion for those who might be willing to read something SciFi-oriented that portrays a similar world of Domination/submission: _Captive of Gor_, _Slave Girl of Gor_, and _Dancer of Gor_ all by John Norman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abusive and disgusting","review":"This book is horrible. When I purchased it, I thought that it was going to be like the other books I enjoy reading. Consensual Dom/Sub relationships. It was not even close to that. Sleeping beauty is 15 years old and the prince swoops in to cut her dress off and rape her. He then makes her remain naked and walks her through towns like that. He also put her on display allowing others to stare at her, touch her, and he even lets a Innkeepers daughter beat her with a paddle. Through all of this the poor girl is sobbing. This is not a consensual relationship. This isnt even a Dom/Sub one. It is cruel, vile, and disturbing to the highest. If you want to read a good book try 50 shades or Bared to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting","review":"This book claims to be like 50 Shades of Grey. It is NOTHING like 50 Shades.

This is very dark and very disturbing. Not sure why someone would write and sell this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT 50 shades","review":"I bought this book thinking it would be decent and like 50 shades. It turns out this book is incredibly disgusting and digrading. DO NOT buy this if you're looking for romance.

From the beginning Beauty is turned into a slave where she is beaten, humiliated, and basically raped. I couldn't even get to the middle of the book I had to stop reading. I would not recommend this book at all. It is NOTHING like fifty shades. In one instance the Prince was so mad at her for looking at Prince Alexis he beats her with a belt continuously on every part of her body until she is sobbing uncontrollably and in crazy pain. Nothing about this book is hot and the sex scenes are short. All this book contains is Beauty being beaten. I only gave it one star because although the storyline is awful, it is well written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing !!Nothing Like 50 shades of gray","review":"This book is awful unless you are into being beaten,raped,enjoy reading about men getting things put in their butt ect. No story line, it is about beating, beating, and more beating. I felt very sorry for Beauty and the other Prince and Princesses. I got angry every time I picked up this book and tried to read it. I finally finished it, but won't be reading the others. Very disappointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I give it 0 stars???

I love to read good, well-written eroctica and this was not it. As the other reviewers say, it's just boring. The writing is so non-descriptive ( other than the many colors a rear end can turn). This is an excellent premise gone terribly wrong. It's just a rehash from chapter to chapter of one long spanking. I guess that if you only want that in your erotic collection then this might be of interest.

Boy, was I really disappointed. Oh, the book had its moments, but there were so many spankings and it just got redundant. The first couple of punishments were kind of exciting and that got me thinking, \\"cool, now we're going to get to the actual sex!\\" But it wasn't to be. No, instead it was just spanking after spanking after spanking after . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what you expect...","review":"No, not at all what you expect, much much more.

This one was out there,but it's a fairy tale. I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great first part of the trilogy!","review":"I hadn't expected to enjoy this novel as much as I had -- after all, Anne Rice is notoriously known for her vampire novels, and I'd never tried her erotic novels. However, I was told that the Sleeping Beauty trilogy is one of the most haunting and tantalizing erotic trilogies out there. And it is! Anne Rice's retelling of the classic fairy tale is a disarming one of domination and submission. Beauty is forced to show the Prince her gratitude for having woken her from a century's sleep by surrendering to his sexual desires. Adapting to his enslavement proves difficult for Beauty. Will she be able to be tamed? The implications brought on in this novel are provocative and compelling. I look forward to reading the other two parts of what appears to be a memorable erotic trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW, this was crap!","review":"I bought this book because I have an interest in S&M... but it was SO repetitive and utterly boring that just finishing it was an amazing feat! The very fact that \\"Beauty\\" could be Soooo shocked at her predicaments, even though it was basically the same tedious, unimaginative torture page after page, became quite a joke to me. The book starts out nicely but quickly becomes one long Y-A-W-N .... You might as well put it down after the first few chapters, because believe me, at that point ... you HAVE read it all. Save your money and try reading some erotica with a little imagination, intrigue, and a plot . like \\"Topping From Below\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"It was utter trash and a complete waste of time. I'm hardly a prude; graphic scenes don't offend me, and I like to see some 'raw' details, but this was NOT well-written. I kept wanting to scream, \\"WHERE OH WHERE IS THE PLOT?!?\\" and I barely had the stamina to actually finish the book. I heaved a sigh of relief when I turned the last page.If your focus in life is watching other people get walloped, you might get a few vicarious, cheap thrills out of this book, but it's otherwise a waste of time and money. Go buy a tank of gas with the ten bucks.I did find a use for the book, however: I gave it to one of my pet mice, who was delighted to have new nest material. Day before yesterday she delivered six babies amid the remnants of pages 16 through 28."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty","review":"I purchased this book because I was told that if I liked \\"50 Shades of Gray\\" that I would enjoy this series. They could not have been more wrong. This book goes beyond safe words and trust and straight to the raping of a 15 year old girl alongwith her continued physical and mental abuse. I do not recommend unless you are willing to endure some very strong sexual violations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prepare your Psyche","review":"The first in the trilogy will without doubt change your mind and erase anything you ever were read at bedtime as a child. Brilliantly written! Who knew Anne Rice had it in her. It makes much sense to me. If this story did in fact take place in reality, I believe this things would have taken place. Enjoy this book with an open mind. Beautifully portrayed. I look forward to the next two! *smile*"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be called the spanking of sleeping beauty","review":"As a long time fan of Anne Rice's witch books I started this book with high expectations. Instead I found myself skimming the long descriptions of spanking, welted bottoms, paddles etc. As a result I skimmed most of the book. This book was just too boring to justify buying the other 2. They really shouldn't classify this as erotica because there was very little \\"sexy stuff\\".

I am very open minded when it comes sexuality, but what I found in this book here was more humilation and spanking than anything else.As stated by other reviewers, some of what is written as punishment would indeed injure, maim or kill a person. Not to mention the techniques used to attract flies and other insects to a person's nether regions.... ugh!The story just drones on and on and to me is just not enticing at all.Give me some good BDSM on fanfiction over this anytime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spank me if I ever open this book again!","review":"This book is the most repetitious book I have ever not completed reading. It takes a classic love story and turns it into ridiculous tale of bondage and punishment over and over and over again. It would have liked it better if Sleeping Beauty would have ate a bushel of apples and went into a irreversible coma on about the 3rd page. Oh, did I mention that this book is repetitious?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Immensely horrible.","review":"I never thought that Anne Rice could disappoint.Turns out she can.I bought this book figuring a little fairytale erotica would be good, however this book has no plotline, the characters are undeveloped at best and there's nothing erotic about being spanked that many times.Don't waste your money on this. I'm sorry I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Having read Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles (both old and new) I figured I would give this a shot too. After all, it's the same author, the books should be similar, right? I was horribly disappointed.There is no plot to speak of, just spankings on top of spankings. The relationships have no depth. Neither do the characters.I found the Vampire Chronicles to be more erotic than The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty because the scenes in The Vampire Chronicles were called for and needed to advance the story. In The Claiming of Beauty, the scenes serve no purpose, and there are a lot of them.I would advise all Anne Rice fans to skip this trilogy. Otherwise you are going to be in for major disappointment. I know that I personally, am not going to read the remainder of the trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Well this book was definitely interesting...Good for an article written in playboy, but not what I expected from Anne Rice, whose books I do enjoy.There was sex on the second page, and the plot escaped me for most of the novel. It was graphic and filled with meaningless sex which to me makes the entire book pointless. Buy a Penthouse instead...it costs less and there are pictures to go along with the text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spanking, more spanking...Is there anything else?","review":"I purchased this book based on the reviews I had read and on a coworker's comment: \\"It was so hot I had to put it down.\\" Please! Are you kidding? I like Erotica, but not when the author has no imagination. This book is full of nothing but one spanking after another. While spanking may be fun every once in a while, page after page of spanking got old really quickly. I understand the whole idea of control, etc., but please! Half way through this book, I put it down and swore I would not continue. Unfortunately, I convinced myself that at some point the book had to be about something else. Trust me it isn't.Just leave Anne Rice on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"I actually am a fan of Rice's Vampire Chronicles. But even just reading the first few pages of this book and skimming the rest was enough to leave me feeling disturbed for several days. I wouldn't reccomend reading this book unless you have a strong stomach for things such as rape and sexual torture."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty","review":"After being sorely disappointed with Fifty Shades of Grey, I was told I should try this trilogy. I did some research and decided to give it a whirl. But I was definitely not prepared for what was in store for me from Ms. Rice. Now I'm no rookie when it comes to romance novels, but The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty gave new meaning to sex scenes... if you can even call them that. There were moments where they were more likely to be considered rape than consensual sex and left me feeling uncomfortable.You can read the rest of my review for this book on my blog, Reading Until I Fall Asleep:[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"This was a painful book to read (no pun intended). Too many repetitive spanking scenes, but I guess that's what it is supposed to be about. Although his experiences were repetitive, too, Prince Alexi's narrative was the most entertaining. All in all, however, there are better erotic books out there to spend your time on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough Already!","review":"I love myth; I love story; I love erotica. I hated this book! It's a long, grueling, repetitive NON story of spanking, torture, and more spanking. There's no plot! Just spanking and more spanking. If the editor had used \\"find/replace\\" function on a word processor for every instance (...)the editor wouldn't have had anything to edit. What's the deal? Don't waste your money on it. I'm sorry I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"It started out with promise but about halfway through, it gets monotonous. The constant spanking, slapping, and the characters unrealistic reactions to the situations just bored me. I was hoping the book would be a bit more detailed and expound upon other aspects instead of centering attention on wanting to please and begging for spankings. As an avid reader and writer of multiple verses and genres, I found this book to be rather flat. There should have been better descriptions of the events and delve into the total psychology of the characters instead of having the constant, annoying, weighing of options like 'do I give in and adore the humiliation\\" and 'Why cant I be a bad pet\\".I guess for the time it was written it was considered risque, but in today's day and age, it seems to be lacking the normal 'substance' that makes up good erotica. Perhaps it should be 'updated' to fit the modern times?"},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give it 0 stars I would...","review":"This was the most horrible book I have ever attempted to read. It made me feel ill and I burned it to get rid of it! It is degrading and disgusting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left Unsatisfied","review":"The concept intrigued me but the content left me disappointed. To imagine Sleeping Beauty as a real woman with thoughts and desires that any one of us could relate to would be truly refreshing; but, sadly, I found Anne Rice's Beauty to be childlike and relatable to only that of a molested ewe. The story line of erotic scene after scene became tiring and silly. I found myself wondering how anything got done with everybody spanking and exploiting their slaves incessantly. And, seriously, who would tune in to watch the Bridal Path? Masters racing their slaves by paddling their behinds? Really? Trust me, don't bother with this trilogy. Even Elijah Woods's big, watery eyes couldn't add depth to this piece of fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"cruel and unusual","review":"Bought this as a light beach read - oops! Boring, repetitive, cruel, mean-spirited - there are only so many interesting ways to describe raw genitalia. And I prefer my s&m consensual, thanks.

I would give it 1/2 star if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an appealing Beauty","review":"I did not think this trilogy compared to Fifty Shades of Grey at all.

I have read other Ann Rice and loved them (The Mayfair Witches trilogy) but this one, not so much! i do read some erotica and did read Fifty Shades. Can I say Fifty Shades is the best written plot ever? No, but I can say I thought it was pretty erotic and everything in it was consensual. The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty is anything but consensual and I have a problem with a book written purely about cruel treatment as must of the story was not about consensual acts and then try to say its erotic?? I don't think so, I can't see how a normal person would think someone explaining how they were raped over and over is erotic. The spankings and such aren't made to be erotic in my mind. Even though it's not my idea of a good time I have read stories were it seemed like fun but this is not one of those, it's harsh, a lot of rape, mistreatment and just bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointed","review":"I couldn't even finish the first book of the trilogy. It was mind-numbingly dull. How someone capable of writing such gorgeous Gothics set in New Orleans could crank out something so dry and mechanical and soul-less is beyond me.

There is so much better erotica out there; don't waste your time on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Throw it away!","review":"I was considering buying Fifty Shades of Gray until I read those reviews which recommended this book. The review chastised \\"Gray\\" as being written from the juvenile mind....that somehow Stealing Beauty is for the higher intellect. Are you kidding me?! I did read several pages waiting for the higher intellect to show up. All I can say is it's the worst book I've ever been conned into purchasing and reading.

I have no idea who (or how) they came to this conclusion, because this book has no romance, no love story, and pretty much no character development. Once you've read the first few chapters, the rest is pretty much the same: Beauty is just a novelty item, the Prince has no emotional attachment to her, the characters in the castle are all flat and one-dimensional. There are plenty of spankings, and then some more. There is plenty of humilliation too, but that's about it. Not even a twist or a turn, to keep things interesting. Just the same thing over and over again. If you must read this book, do yourself a favor and save the money: check it out at your local library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disney never saw this one coming","review":"The tale of sleeping beauty through out history has been the muse of countless paintings, movies, plays, and fashion photo shoots. The princess has memorized all of us with her renowned beauty and magical circumstances of sleeping a hundred years under a spell that could only be broken by a prince's true love kiss. Anne has taken the magical moment of the first kiss and turned it into something dark and fierce. No sweet tender kisses here the prince was there to claim her and he did just that. He claimed her and stole her naked back to his homeland as his new personal sex slave. I wish I could go into more detail but it is just too graphic for this my blog because I do have YA readers.

Sorry, but this is more like pornography than 50. It's utter degradation for Beauty, and endless beatings - spanking sounds too pleasant for what is conveyed here. Couldn't get through it as it was much too repetitive - just a series of new backgrounds for the beatings and public humiliations.I loved The Witching Hour, and the vampire stories.

But alas I guess there there many other unfortunate people out there who are just as twisted. I kept reading in hopes that Beauty would find a way to kill that horrible price and his mother. Plus it made no sense that only her kingdom would behave in such a manner. If every other flipping kingdom had to go through that horrible ordeal, why on earth wasn't it spread across the lands? If Beauty was so bored, then why didn't she just tell her parents to adapt such horrilbe rituals as well? Maybe that's in the next books in which I will never waste my precious time on this earth reading.

Anne Rice's trilogy is a lot different (though I haven't, and will not, read the other 2 books). It is sad and cruel; I feel this trilogy is like hardcore porn, where as 50 Shades is soft porn.

This book however, is not and made me feel ill."},{"rating":"1","title":"There MUST be better reads out there!","review":"Rarely have I been SO wrong about picking a book ... but this book is, to keep it simple, CRAP. There is nothing sensual, romantic or erotic about it ... contrarily, the book more resembles S&M with senseless beatings and forced, bazaar sexual activities, better known as glorified rape. I'm disappointed in Anne Rice... although I have not read many books by her, I will certainly not choose another book from her anytime soon ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware","review":"Okay I had no idea when I picked up this book that it contained material I had never been exposed to. It was shocking. However, I couldn't put it down. It was like a car accident, you hate to look, but just have to. I tried to put the book down and then I would tell myself \\"just a little more\\". It was a real page turner... which after all is what a good book should be... one that you just can't put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting and Relentlessly Cumbersome","review":"This was one of the most repetitive, sickning, and most boring book I've read so far. I can't believe an author would even attempt to destroy a childeren's fairytale with this nonsence. Having been forced to read this junk for a class, I was totally shocked at Anne Rice's degrading and horribly narrated smut. I wouldn't recommend this rubbish to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"They all suck","review":"I read all three of these novels about a decade ago. They suffer every fault listed in the other reviews. Rice is absolutely fixated with forced homosexual abuse that goes beyond BDSM. And don't think you'll catch her balancing out the scales with lesbian sex, either. She's simply obsessed with homosexual rape, everything else is merely setting."},{"rating":"1","title":"the claiming of sleeping beauty","review":"I love Anne Rice, but this book is a complete mess. It's bad porn. The sex didn't make me uncomfortable; it made me laugh at how ridiculous the scenarios were. Rice is trying too hard. This book would have been better off had it never seen the light of day. There are reasons why the original \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" fairy tale uses sexual metaphors instead of actual sex. This book is one of those reasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preposterous II","review":"This review is actually an homage to the 2004 review of S.C. Mitchell, who said everything that I was thinking. I laughed, I cried, I wished I'd written that review myself. I enjoyed her review way more than I enjoyed the book. I was given the Sleeping Beauty series by a friend who knew I was reading the Vampire Chronicles. I gave my friend back the books and told him to get his money back. He did.I cannot - repeat, cannot - improve on the Mitchel review, so I'll just say: Yeah, what she said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy all three. BDSM classics.","review":"You must suffer and serve before you can rule. That is the theory in the mythical kingdom where Beauty is a princess. In her world, young royals are sent to serve in a neighboring kingdom where BDSM is the rule and the \\"slaves\\" are the royal princes and princesses of surrounding lands. Erotic, mysterious, and charming all at the same time, Rice weaves a spell of sensuality over her readers. Beauty is taken from her parents by her new master, and forced to walk, bear breasted to the neighboring kingdom. Her torments begin in earnest when they stop for a night at an inn along the way, ad of course Beauty's bondage is prominently displayed for all the local riffraff. Arriving at the castle where she is to spend the next year in bondage she's displayed naked for inspection. Rice describes many erotic and painful tortures that Beauty and other royal scions suffer through. It's a classic of erotic BDSM fiction. You might as well buy all three to start with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Degrading","review":"This is one of the most degrading books I have ever read. There is no consensual sex, there are no safe words, no hard limits. Just unilateral degradation and abuse. Beauty is raped by the Prince before she is even awake and endures the most humiliating, degrading abuse imaginable at the hands of the Prince and his court. She has no say in what happens to her, she has no escape, she is definitely not a willing participant in this \\"relationship\\". Everything points to a sadist prince and his court that take pleasure in treating their slaves worse than you can possibly imagine. There is no safe sex at any point in the book, and definitely no romance or caring in any way, shape or form. Ms Rice has written an incredibly irresponsible piece of crap that why would anyone call it a good story is beyond me. This is the last book I will ever buy written by Ms Rice, she is not an \\"author\\" (if she can be called that) that I am willing to support any longer. She should be ashamed of herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting","review":"I have to start by saying I am not an avid Anne Rice reader, with that in mind I bought this series of books based on a friends recommendation. We are almost no longer friends over this series. The book is literally nothing but continuous rape and subjugation. I forced myself to finish the book on the hope that it would improve but at no time did I ever see a plot. The book started with the raping of beauty to wake her, then the prince took possession of her and used her as his play thing through the whole book. It really is disgusting, and now I have two other books in the series that I refuse to read. My stomach just can't take that amount of crudity and cruelty.On a personal note, if you somehow have found joy or interest in this book there is really something wrong with you. The girl is 16 being raped day in and day out. I'm shocked a publisher even took a chance on this series...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proceed Reading This Book With Caution!!","review":"All I can say is WOW. This book is not for everyone at all. I was so disappointed and disgusted with this book. I am all about pleasure and pain and good erotica. I am in no way a prude, but this book is almost sickening. I do not mean to be offensive to those that liked the book, but this book is not about passion...it is about cruelty. It was sadistic and I cannot believe I actually read it all the way through. I love a good trilogy, but cannot fathom reading the next two books. I should have known better when the Prince awakened her by raping her, which is really what he did. I don't care what spin you put on it. She was a sex slave and there was nothing sensual about it. And how many spankings can be in one book.

As a long time reader of her books I decided to give this book a whirl. Within the first 2 pages I was shocked, horrified and disgusted. How can anyone think this non consensual relationship is erotic? Its flat out rape! She is merely an object to him. If you want a real book to follow after 'Fifty Shades Of Gray' thats also better written then read 'Bared To You' by Sylvia Day. That story has real erotica, romance, and humor. I tried to read a few more chapters hoping Anne Rice wouldnt let me down. But rape, humiliation, and being forced into servitude is not what I look for in a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"trash","review":"This book is pointless pornography.

Never again will I purchase another erotica book!

I enjoy kinky writing just like the next closet freak, however this book was absolute drivel. It made little sense from beginning to end. The writing was beyond elementary. The \\"show but don't tell\\" rule of writing is thrown out the window. Everything the reader is supposed to learn is stated by one character or another in very dry and silly dialogue. I don't know how people got turned on while reading this. Its rediculous and not well thought out. Personally I am convinced that Anne Rice's Master made her write and publish this novel as a \\"punishment\\", because something so juvenile could not have been a true attempt at well written fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"It could have been better","review":"I bought this book hoping that I would enjoy it.

It deserves no stars","review":"After enjoying the romance & love story of Fifty, I jumped at one reader's recommendation of the Beauty books. What a disappointment! No love story! The Prince pretty much raped her to \\"awaken\\" or \\"claim\\" her! There is no romance; no love when he makes her a (sex) slave and lets lowly villagers ogle, grope and (gasp!) spank her. I am grateful I at least did not waste my $ on the other 2. And remain still searching for my next erotic love story ...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I think the statement on the front of this book of \\"if you like 50 shades, you'll love this\\" is 100% misleading. The book takes place during \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" time meaning hundreds of years ago in a time where marrying off your 15-16 year old daughter was common. Regardless, knowing that the \\"love slaves\\" you're reading about are 15-17 years of age is cringe-worthy at best. They are beaten violently, humiliated, and raped all the while being held against their will in a castle.The reason most people liked 50 shades is because of the romance and passion and protection, not because of actual violent S&M.; I have only read the first book of this series and will not continue on to read the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"*panting*","review":"Thank you Anne Rice!I thought I was never going to recover after the ruin called FSoG.

Maybe I don't know what \\"erotica\\" means, but I expected it to be somewhat sensual. I cannot imagine that there are two other loads of crap in this series. Anne Rice is one twisted individual and I only hope I can get some of the disgusting images from this book out of my head. Although extremely disturbing, I actually got bored half way through and skimmed through to the end . . . bondage, rape, humiliation, torture, bondage, rape, humiliation, torture . . . yuck! Again, a complete waste of my time! Thankfully I downloaded this as an ebook from my public library and didn't waste any money on this - thats what the one star is for!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kinky and Addictive","review":"I bought this book and finished it in the same night. It was an expensive reading adventure(should have bought it on Amazon) but totally worth it. I could not put it down. A fairy tale with sadism and masochism woven in a darkly delicious manner. This is a very sexual novel, in fact it is considered \\"erotica.\\" However, there is so much more to the book besides sex. It is also a love story, but a very disfunctional and twisted love story.

Clara deserves better than Ms. Kaufman who comes off as a spoiled brat who should know better than to foist on a reading public what might best serve as e-mails among gossipy friends and adoring family. Kaufman has the craft, yet lacks the sensibilities, to tell Clara's story without horning in w/her own foibles and baggage. She cannot resist periodically nudging Clara off the pedestal and grabbing the spotlight with her tiresome adoption garbage.

I began to hate Margo more and more with each page. She clearly does not \\"get\\" what it means to be a dog-owner, especially a pug owner. Her first reaction when she sees her new puppy, Clara, is to call her husband crying because the dog's tail wasn't perfectly curled had a white stripe on it. Give me a break!

I now know the truth about my own life: I, too, am owned by the pugs! Seriously, if you want to read a book that is well-written, highly entertaining, and also hits the nail on the head, so to speak, then you've got to read CLARA.

Her wry, witty, heartfelt observations of pug love, new mom-hood, and life in general really rang true. As a pug owner, new mom, and fellow ironic observer of the human condition, I loved Margo's sense of humor and ability to laugh at herself and her challenges. I was shocked to read in this month's Pug Talk that she passed away of breast cancer at 46. She will be sorely missed.

I think it's a touch hypocritical to on the one hand extol - and write a whole book about - how dogs are as emotionally and personally viable as people, and then on the other hand to just blandly assume that any dog will be shunted aside to a large degree by any human child.

Margo put owning a Pug, or being owned by a Pug (which is usually the case) into perspective.

The story of a pug who ruled the world around her, her sibling and the two servants (the writer and her husband). In addition it describes in superb detail the problems the writer encountered when attempting to adopt a child, first from China and finally from Russia.Sadly, the author died shortly after the book was published, and I have tried to find out what happened to Clara after the book ended.

And I can forgive Clara for that. But I had a tough time being as forgiving to Clara's owner who ends up sounding even more spoiled and whiny than her cute pug. Kaufman, Clara's owner, manages to tell us not only how she indulges her dog, but that she shops at the most expensive New York department stores, travels to Siberia in mink, and attends therapist sessions with her dog. I also found myself questioning her adoption of a child. Interestingly, that she admits she has some insecurities about adopting a child of a different ethnicity -- but doesn't see the hypocirsy of her complete devotion to her pugs, whom I assume do not look like Kaufman either. A disappointing book. written with large heapings of hyperbole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Pug lover gift!","review":"If you have pugs you will love this book - so true to the nature of Pugs.

This is clearly a 1970's style production, and the choice of images, image quality, etc. reflect it. If that was your time, and you like that sort of thing, by all means go for it. If your looking for well shot images of exceptional yacht interiors or ideas for a restoration project (like me) then keep looking or get if from a library first to decide if its worth owning. As someone who is willing to look at pictures of almost anything nautical, I found it pretty disappointing - mostly because it is so out of date and unprofessional by modern standards. There are a few classic yacht images worth seeing, but much of it is run-of-the-mill boat interiors of the day. I regret being so harsh because I'm sure a lot of work went into this in its day, but in my opinion, it is time to let go."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Book","review":"I have had this book for years, and I review it often.

I believe this comparison is easy to make but flawed. While both books are addressed at an audience ready to face questions about individuality and society, Lowry's hero faces a society of man's own creation. Blacker's title says it all.

The family is supposed to be vacationing in Santa Barbara. The text refers to their visits to Hollywood Studios and Disneyland as if Santa Barbara is in the LA area -- it's not. You certainly can visit those places from St. B. but you'll be driving 2-3 hours each way. Later the boyfriend, Luke, says he wants to go to a surfing competition UP the coast in Ventura. Ventura is an hour or so SOUTH of Santa Barbara. This was really annoying me so I had to mentally substitute Santa Monica (in LA and fits the details better) for Santa Barbara. Blacker and his editor need to look at a map."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! What a thriller!","review":"First of all I like thrillers. Tiger forced me to stay up all night until I finished it. Henke uses a revolving stage for his characters shifting the action and leaving you hanging at the end of each stage. The book just propels you on. Mountain lion attacks are on the rise in California, and a wild man-eating tiger is three times bigger and hungrier. Kate Reilly, the protaganist, is one gutsy lady. Sometimes you can fortell what will happen, but with this novel, you can't. The suspense builds until the very last page. I can't wait to see a movie of this book. Five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiger put me to sleep","review":"I got this book from a friend in Salinas and tried to read it. I was told the author said it was a 'page turner'. It was boring and predidtable. It must be Henke's first book as he cannot tell a story without falling all ove his own words.

The slower sections of Nocturnes are exceptionally beautiful though. The strings and chorus in Sirenes are heavenly.In Jeux, I also find the brass slightly lazy. Other than that, It is a wonderful performance.As for La Mer, I found the climax of \\"De l'aube a midi sur la mer\\" unexciting. I thought the tempo was a little slow, the percussion including the tympani and gong had not enough impact, and the players seemed to be holding back. Also, in the final moments of the peice, I find a lot of inner detail missing which is odd considering that Pierre Boulez is known for bringing out inner detail. For a better recording of \\"La Mer,\\" I recommend the recording by Fritz Reiner and the Chicago Symphony."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pierre Boulez's Recording of Debussy","review":"Pierre Boulez and the Cleveland Orchestra were just great!

Truly!Boulez's performance of \\"La Mer\\" (which is my very favorite music by Debussy) is smooth, yet powerful. I assure you that it's even better than Karajan's or Ormandy's recordings. (I had to admit that Bernstein's recording is the best to me, but Boulez's recording is almost as great.)Like before, for Debussy-lovers, this CD is a perfect choice! If you don't have it, BUY IT!

I wasn't a bit moved by the overrated Streep and handsome Clint. It's a story about two hearts linked as one - a sacrifice by a beautiful woman for the greater good - a touching story of common adultery committed by two randy, bored adults. Yawwwwn. Streep can do any accent on the planet, and sprinkle it with more affected mannerisms than Marcel Marceau. That doesn't make her an actress - just a clever chameleon.

Eastwood comes to the farm seeking directions to a covered bridge that he has been assigned to photograph and Meryl Streep gets in the pick-up truck with him to give him directions. One thing leads to another and pretty soon Eastwood is diddling the wife. The movie is told as if the wife's children are reading her diary after her death.

She does convey the look and feel of someone far from her home who is lost and feels abandoned, a fate that brought her to a troubling place. I remember when they were first making this movie, it looked like Isabella Rossellini had a lock on the part (of \\"Francesca\\"), does anyone think she might have made a better Francesca than Meryl Streep? I can't make up my mind, oh well. Rossellini doesn't get a chance to play very many head-on romantic parts, does she, so it's hard to tell whether she has the complexity and resources to carry a movie the way Streep does. (Remember DEATH BECOMES HER, in which Rossellini plays a minor -- very minor -- role while Streep swans it up all over the place? It's a demonstration of old fashioned star power if ever there was one.)PS I do agree this DVD needs an upgrade to widescreen please!

Madison County, Iowa is a beautiful and relaxing place to spend a long summer day, visiting the bridges and other elements from the movie, although sadly the home was damaged and no longer accessible. Streep and Eastwood are nothing short of magic in the dialogue and dancing that they share. The scenes of her two children's reaction are at times campy, yet effective in framing the moment in the larger picture of Francesca's life, and also the important ramification any affair has on family (usually disastrous, but the touching manner of the characters and specific context of how things unfold in Madison County make it work).

Adapted from Robert James Whaller novel, the film is a moving look at true love that comes too late. The characters are wonderfully acted by Oscar winners Streep and Eastwood. As usual Streep shines in her portrayal of Franchesca. Making us feel her dispair in a situation she never thought she would be in.

For me I know it will never happen, like Francesca, I am married but I have not in my life, and probably never will experience the emotion of those four remarkable days in Madison county, I will only see it through the eyes and life long intense feelings of these incredible people in this movie.

Meryl Streep is married to a wonderful husband who she completely fails to appreciate. He's nothing. Take a hike, jerk. The man she falls for, to the point of insisting on being buried with when the time comes, is some guy who drifted into her life for a week while her husband had taken the kids on a camping trip. Sure he's a nice guy. But what kind of advantage is that. Who will a woman be more excited about - her husband of 20 years or some handsome new guy who falls for her while hubby is away? This ditz seems to think that she and her lover are doing the family a favor by not splitting up the family. Who the hell is she? I hope her husband had a few dozen girls on the side.

Probably never will read it actually. The movie, however, was not half so bad as many of the informed opinions implied. What we get is a so-so romance novel depicted by actors (Streep and Eastwood) who know entirely what they are about. Eastwood is not doing his normal turn here. He is showing us that he has some vulnerability to expose, after all. The tin man has a heart. Streep is Streep. I don't care if she is the lead in a Betty Boop Cartoon, she is going to make it interesting. Maybe the plot is offensive in a Southern Baptist sense of the term; the story plays on the screen. Eastwood shows a great deal of dexterity in directing this little treat. He's not pretending to be Truffaut. Just a simple narrative, told from a simple perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent acting and a good script.","review":"The performances are top-notch. The story is good. All-around a great one. The big dissapointment subtracting from a would-be 5 star rating is the lack of a widescreen format.

Now, I cannot speak from experience on that; and I hope I never will. But finally, as painful as much of this movie is, the book is ten times worse.

Problem is, it also drags in most of the scenes, and the constant overexposure of the lead actors becomes tiresome and unappealing. The settings could be more diverse too, since at times it seemed like I was watching a play and not a film. And although it never reaches corny melodrama, it gets too sappy at parts. Overall, not a bad movie, but not a masterpiece either. Far from a must-see, it still is worth watching once, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"LUST AND BETRAYAL","review":"I gave it two stars because of the outstanding performances of Streep and Eastwood, otherwise I would have given it only one star. So! It seems many reviewers went through boxes and boxes of Kleenex tissue while watching this movie. I found the story line quite sobering and depressing. Francesca has been married for twenty years or more to a faithful husband who loves her, and while he is away on a camping trip with the kids, lo and behold, she plays tiddly-winks behind her husband's back with a roaming, divorced photographer because she is bored with her existence. Well, isn't that a shame! What happened to her vows, \\"Until death do us part?\\" The plot was so inane, it was embarrassing.And what a legacy she left for her kids! She recorded her affair. Please! I would rather not have seen the film. It left me feeling not too good about the human race."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two stars is generous","review":"This could have been quite a good movie but the selection of actors was inappropriate. Streep was from the first scene too worldly to be believable.The story had potential, but Eastwood was probably too close to the film to do it justice. He too was unconvincing. The brother and sister get the alocades here, for their excellent supporting roles.The sound track was relentlessly boring and stereotyped. During the dance scenes I considered switching it off, but I am glad I did see the ending. I'll read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Widescreen?","review":"I saw it on TV, wanted to own the DVD, but in this day of all TV sets eventually going to 1.85:1 imagine these numskulls issuing the movie in 4:3 only. I will not buy any more 4:3."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Just Left No Impression","review":"Times like this I wish there were a way Amazon could allow us to specify when a product is a gift, which means the giver may not actually have viewed the product. In this case, although I did indeed purchase the DVD as a birthday present to my fraternal twin sister, I had watched the movie some years back and despite its two well-established stars, the movie itself made no impression on me, and I have no desire to see it again. I recall Eastwood was playing a photographer, and wanted to photograph a covered bridge, which was reflected in the title, but I cannot recall how Streep's character fit in with that, or the relationship that must have sprung up between the two. The relatiohship between H.G. Wells and Amy in Time After Time was much more intriguing and interesting to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have read more carefully","review":"I was looking for a new copy at a good price.

However, anyone who has experienced what Francesca went through, knows the inner-battle and confusion one faces. This movie gives a person comfort that the one you are with may or may not be the \\"only\\" one meant for you. This movie gives me hope and relief that what may happen in my life is shared by others (fictional or not). I can relate to Francesca and it helps me to rationalize some of my own decisions. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is torn between two relationships or is lost in their own."},{"rating":"2","title":"an excellent movie worth watching","review":"truely a fine movie that, in many ways probably imitates real life more closely than many people would be willing to admit. eastwood and streep do a wonderful job of acting. they make you feel as if it is really happening to someone you live next to or is or has happened to you"},{"rating":"2","title":"Romantic Movie","review":"If you're a true romantic, as I am (Jackie) you will absolutely love this movie.

Not worth your money. If you are at all rusty on algebra and arithmetic, you will get lost or be frustrated with the demonstrations and problems shown in the book. Even the answer guides in the back are poor illustrations of well-worked, fully explained problems. You find a lot of \\"and so because of X formula, we can see Y\\". You will think to yourself, how in the world did one make a logical step from the previous statement to the last. The chapters and chapter sections are also very inconspicuous and figures do not relate well to the surrounding text. Quite terrible book unfortunately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution. Accuracy in question","review":"The results of these strips didn't look right so I decided to test them. Water is a neutral 7.0. First I tried carbon-filtered tap water and got a reading of 5.0. While carbon filters aren't perfect, water should never be that acidic. To be sure I bought a jug of distilled water from the pharmacy. To make sure nothing could skew the results I got a strip from the bag, opened the jug, stuck the strip in for 2 seconds, pulled it out and took a reading. It was 5.0 with a bit of color (maybe 5.2). That can't be good readings.The strips must be old or bad. Either way I caution you not to make health decision based on your strips until you verify to your satisfaction your batch is accurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Readings Not Accurate - large acidic bias","review":"Bought these and one other brand of test strips. My first reading was around 5.0 and after going back and reading reviews on this product, I did what one other 2 star reviewer did, tested our water (well water with a lab test of neutral 7.0) and got a reading of approximately 5.5. Conclusion, these strips are not accurate and heavily biased to the acidic side. I concur with another reviewer, they are probably intended to be biased to sell some of their alkalizing products."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dishonest Mistake","review":"I absolutely abhored this book and I regretted buying it. Though the explanation of the English sec. was acceptable, I was mostly upset with the way the explained the math format. They made the simplest concepts having to do with prealgebra or basic algebra more complicated for people who either know it or not. I agree with one of the reviewers who claimed that the questions were harder than questions on the actual ACT. I answered sample English questions online from the ACT's website and I easily got them correct compared to the ones found in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!","review":"This book is terrible especially for the math section. The order of difficulty in this book is so erratic and random that it does not match the one used on the ACT.Here is an example of a math problem found in this book:13) (5 1/8) - (3 5/6) = ?A) 1 7/24B) 2 17/24C) 1 1/2D) 1 1/8E) 1 7/24Here is another bad math problem:35) What base eight numeral corresponds to 90_(ten)?A) 882_(eight)B) 102_(eight)C) 110_(eight)D) 132_(eight)E) 112_(eight)I recommend the Offical Guide to the ACT with 3 full practice tests, which does not contain any errors as far as I am concerned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste you time","review":"Most of this book has stuff you don't need to know. For example, it talks about graphing complex functions and sequences and series. You'll never see anything like that. If you do, it will be easy enough not to know the formulas they give you. The practice tests are ten times more difficult than the real test. Go with the Princeton Review, or better yet, take the SAT.

I tried it out because I was looking for an extremely sharp film to test out some lenses. All I can say is \\"Wow!\\" - this stuff showed levels of detail in my test targets (topographic maps taped to a wall) that I never expected to see (and yes, if there is something amiss with your lenses, this film *will* show it). I had it professionally processed and scanned at very high resolution (16Mp) for this purpose so I can't comment on the darkroom chemistry side of things. I liked the grain structure, though for general-purpose use I would probably go with the ISO 400 version for greater versatility. The combination of biting sharpness and detail with good tonality would probably make it a good choice for landscapes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Way To Go!","review":"This is a great way to change out your struts.

I live in a more refined woods (in Minnesota) than Mrs. Hoover and her husband and I am amazed at how they managed to live in the great North Woods of Minnesota especially considering they moved there from Chicago. I read this book first and couldn't put it down. A Place In the Woods should be read first, then Gift of the Deer, then Long Shadowed Forest, and finally, Years of the Forest. There are incidents that will make your hair stand on end, some that will anger you, and others that are sad. I have shared these books with my brother in law and my sister.

Sorry but it was bad compared to the magic of the later years.

The food here is truly delicious and the ultimate \\"comfort food\\" that we all crave - plus, as Faith demonstrates, it doesn't have to be fattening or unhealthy. I also love the format of the book. Filled with Faith's family anecdotes, photos and stories, they are wonderful touches and add a personal warmth. Candice Bergen's \\"Forward\\" was also a nice surprise, and I agree that Faith should diversify into other books on home decor, entertaining, style, etc...

I gotta admit, this is one of my favorites. The CD single has 11 tracks, including remixes by RMB, Dresden & Gabriel, a chillout remix and more. My tastes for the song made me wonder the outcome of it's success. The last time I was an early listener to a song like this when later it would claim the techno nation and even be played on daytime radio was Alice Deejay's \\"Better Off Alone\\".

Because it is laid out in a straight forward manner, I was able to use it as both pleasure reading and reference to accompany my trips to the music store.

Although the workmanship and detailing on the tote is very well done the wood handles seem dwarfed by the large size of the tote and the detachable shoulder strap does not sit the purse comfortably next to one's body. It's too bad because this could have been a really cute fun tote. I don't think the arist, Sara Henry has control over the manufacturing of the tote only the design and the design is darling.

I very rarely laugh out loud while reading. It is even more rare for me to read out the best bits to my friends at every opportunity. And it is an extreme anomaly for them to actually laugh at my renditions. Yet somehow all three of these things occured as I read this book.

However, most of the other characters, especially Mohammed and Rida Faheedi, and Davood and Mrna, were sympathetic characters and very interesting. Overall, By the Sword is a good book.

Even though this 'cliff-hanger' might be considered more of a man's book, as a woman, I still enjoyed it. It was fun reading about the different places in Switzerland that Mike Yorkey wove into the story.

But along with the downbeat storyline, they just make sure that this attempted low-budget film is just that -- cheap.Cliches abound: violence, drug abuse, sheer boredom of an inmate's life. The shock or fear quotient is largely derived from disgusting moments from uninspired characters play-acting stuff like a high school drama.If you want raw, there's \\"Romper Stomper\\" with Russel Crowe.

Last month, I changed her to California Naturals because it costs less and I can get it at a cheaper store. She has stopped vomiting and doesn't drink as much water.

Poop is still poop, but the smell is minimal. I have noticed it also quickly disinigrates into the ground when it rains. With the cheap food, it smelled like rank dog poop! Would make you retch and gag! And there was so much of it! Less poop, firmer stools with barely any odor, less food consumed per day. AND NO BAD BREATH from your dog!

I have great reservations on Levine's plodding tempo, and the singing is generally much below expectations. Above all, the entire performance never manages to take flight, and it sound all so earth-bound. I don't think this can be a good introductory to the Ring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used Book like New","review":"Bought this used book and it said it was in \\"good\\" condition but it almost looked new.

It is quite easy to consult and accurate. Since its publication, 12 years went by and a lot has evolved in the understanding and performance of keeping these critters, still it continues to be a very helpful guide.With the knowledge achieved and gained over the last 12 years, if this book is updated, it will become the guide of the quick guides. I hope for that ... until then I will continue to use it and make mentally the adjustments I know from nowadays knowledge, especially for the NPS section, that is to say, the non photosynthetic octorals mostly known as Gorgonians, Seafans that nowadays are further and further understood and kept with success.

I especially like that it lists similar corals and gives some basic information on how to tell them apart. It can be deceptive, though. The information it gives on the specific corals is very general, and should not be considered a good source for research on a coral you're planning to actually buy. Don't get me wrong, though. I'm happy I have this book, but I'd suggest supplementing it with a text such as Eric Bourneman's \\"Aquarium Corals: Selection, Husbandry, and Natural History\\". This text will actually give you much more specific information on requirements to care for the corals, as well as some better techniques to identify certain corals, since many look very similar, and there's no way any book could show every possible shape and color for many species."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Job !","review":"Very nice book with lots of images, sketches, interviews with Bob and his famous clients.

Caitlin then retreats to the quiet village of Linnvale to regroup and try to make some sense out of her life. However things are not what they appear to be when Caitlin falls under the influence of Herbalist and Healer Shiela Garvie .This is a very well crafted book full of eerie atmosphere and vivid dreams .

I agree wholeheartedly with the review by Toni Bernhard and can only add that apart from hearing Florez perform another role, the entire opera is a complete delight. From the assembly of the stage-set during the playing of the overture, through the ingenious use of black and white costumes and sets for most of the opera, the eccentric makeup of almost everyone except Count Almaviva and Figaro to the curtain dropping on the colorful set and crouching soldiers at the end of this performance from the Teatro Real, Madrid, this is a Barber of Seville that very successfully distances itself from all other versions available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent but too much Mack Sennett","review":"This is an excellent Barber, good orchestra and singing, but I gave it only four stars because I thought it strained too much for laughs and reminded me of the slapstick in the old silent films.

For the perfect mix of characters, singing and comedy, I still think the Rawnsley, Ewing one on Kultur can't be beat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honestly, Jeremy Ain't That Beguiling a Bunny","review":"The best things about this book are its quaint jacket illustration, the 40-year-old picture of the author and her daughter on the back cover, and its built-in bookmark.

I purchased it so that I could read it to my 4-year-old great grandson.The story features a hand-made bunny, made by a young woman in England for a customer in North Carolina, and it's all about Jeremy's travels to get to his new home, and the people (and animals) that he meets along the way. Knowing my great grandson, I know that he will listen wide-eyed from the beginning 'til the end of the tale.The author, Jan Karon, wrote it for her own daughter, Candace, which is also the name of the North Carolinian recipient of Jeremy, the honest bunny, in the story.The illustrations by Teri Weidner also add a nice touch to the book. No children's book would be complete without appropriate illustrations. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very helpful","review":"As a senior I took AP Physics, and this was the text the teacher used.

He reveals the details of the journalist and their issues as they tried to cover the war effort in an honest and fair manner. Like several of his fellow journalists, he was out with the troops in the middle of the action which gives his story the authenticity of combat experiences. While the book is long, his experiences and those whose story he tells justify the completeness of his memoir.

It shows what would happen if there was not any truth, or boundries. I couldn't put the book down till I finished readin it. One quote that stuck out to me was \\"Take away truth and they will lie. Scoff and virtue and betrayl will follow\\" It showed how a pychological goverment experiment on different personalities, can go ary and what some people are trying to figure out on how to control others. A Book that people can relate to in a way with what happens in everyday life, it will keep you thinking long after the epilouge."},{"rating":"2","title":"You really get into it, even if you aren't a teenager.","review":"What I liked most about this book was that Peretti made the arugements on truth realitstic...and you were captivated anyway by the plot, so the \\"debate\\" parts didn't seem slow at all. He gave the \\"other side\\" really good arguements, and they weren't stopped by some magical clever Christian phrase that the teenagers said (So often we hear the advice \\"just say this\\" -and that'll get 'em). In fact, the heroes were LOSING the verbal debates and the plot actually reveals what's true."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME BOOK","review":"I just love Nightmare Academy and the Hangman's Curse, Some of the best writing i have seen in a while!

Nightmare Academy is suspenseful, but, I hate to admit this, it's not quite as good as the first one, which is why I gave it 4 stars. It has a great story line, but I found it harder to connect to the other characters in this story, unlike the first book, where you could really empathize with the kids who were getting picked on. Also, I thought that the ending was a little outlandish and I had a hard time believing that anyone would go through so much trouble, money and murder just to research a theory on \\"truth.\\" However, the story does clearly show the effect that the lack of truth has in our society today. And don't get me wrong, Peretti is one of my favorite authors and this book is definitely suspenseful. Maybe I just expected too much after the first one. But I definitely recommend reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best writing.","review":"If you have read This Present Darkness, The Oath, or even the first Veritas Project book, this is a disappointing novel. The print is 1.5 spaced, meaning lots of whitespace to make up for the minimalistic content. The storyline itself has a lot of interesting content, but just lacks the Peretti \\"feel\\" of the other books. If you really like Peretti, this is a good read if you just want to read something, but the ending is disappointing and I feel it could have been better to offset the lack of content in the main plot (which is really bizarre). This is what I would expect to see in a first draft of a Peretti book, not a \\"best seller\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"This was one of the most boring books I've ever read.

I had to buy baskets as dividers/containers for the clothes but that didn't last long because after putting the baskets in the doors wouldn't hold completely. Mind you I did measurments and the baskets did fit but there is no real latches or anything to keep the door closed. That's my major complaint about the thing is that the doors always just kind of flew open with no real way of securing them. So I finally stopped fighting with it and just let my children put toys inside (which they don't) and that was the end of it. So after a year of owning it, it just doesn't get used AT ALL!

You'll need to crank up the volume a bit.In all, a very representative live performance of Strauss' masterpiece.

Actually, in some ways, the Boehm/Vienna Phil. is better. The reading is more precise, and some of the minor parts (I am thinking here, especially, of Anton de Ritter as the Italian singer, whose one solo brought me almost to tears) are exceptional. But we go on judging Rosenkavaliers by the famous trio in the final act, and I cannot prefer Boehm's Ludwig/Toyanos/Mathis to Schwarzkopf/Ludwig/Stich-Randall. Just as the Penguin reviewer suggests, the Karajan/Philharmonia will always rate ***** in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Amazing","review":"With Randy Rampage gone again, Annihilator turns to the talents of Joe Comeau, whose harsh yet melodious voice makes for a new degree of heavy Annihilator metal. Carnival Diablos takes the sound of Criteria with a little bit of Remains. There are no weak songs on the album, but there are several outstanding ones. Denied features some ripping vocals, Hunter Killer is heavy as hell and just as fast, Time Bomb and Battered have some cool riffing, Shallow Grave gives off a wicked AC/DC vibe, and the Perfect Virus has some amazing guitarwork and a great sound. Not the best Annihilator by far, but definitely a solid release and will be liked by Jeff Waters fans and heavy metal fans in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised!","review":"I never really wanted to buy an Annihilator album. For a long time I had overlooked them, but the fact that they came from Canada and that they had just released a new album was too much for me. I hadn\`t expected much from this album, but boy was I surprised! There are all kinds of different styles present here like the AC/DC-ish Shallow Grave, the song Epic of War which has the melody of Iron Maiden but thrashier, the instrumental Liquid Oval which wouldn\`t be out of place on a Satriani album, and Insomniac which when breaking loose closely resembles Exodus\` Toxic Waltz. But don\`t get me wrong this album has its thrash moments as well. So in conclusion, this album is strongly recommended for those who enjoy melodic thrash metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun book, good food... what's wrong with you 2 star people?","review":"I grew up in NY, but had never heard of Patsy's.

Since I was dining alone, I asked if I could borrow a copy of this book to look over. The book is great as a cookbook. The recipes seem easy to follow and have few ingredients that are all easy to come by. But the real fun of the book are the anecdotes between recipes.

And, the calamari salad, again, easy (I bought the calamari already cleaned and cut), delicious, and refreshing (this is going to be a staple when I entertain this summer).

Ozawa's isn't as mercurial or imaginative as, for example, Andre Previn's on EMI. But he has two advantages over all competitors. The pairing of Kathleen Battle and Frederica von Stade in the vocal parts is one, but for sheer enjoyment, the prize goes to Judi Dench reciting quite a lot of Shakespeare, overlapping the appropriate music. She speaks every part, male and female, as does Kenneth Branaugh for Abbado on Sony, but Dame Judi is more warm-hearted. Add to this DG's multi-miked recording, which puts us in the second bassoon's lap when need be--we hear the smallest details from the BSO's unsurpased solo players. I wish Ozawa had more to say, but no matter. His reading is detailed and refined, if a bit lacking in energy, and all the rest is quite alluring."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't help but agree","review":"The above reviewers have pretty much said it all: this recording is certainly amazing in all respects. Judi Dench adds credibility and talent to the narration, while the orchestration and singing are simply marvelous.

The only reason I am giving it 4 stars and not 5 is because when it came one of the boxes was open as if it may have been squished during transportation. But that's why we put film in containers!

ONe is left wondering why Billy Dee Williams doesn't get to play Two Face in the post-burn Harvey Dent since it would have been nicely established from the first movie.

Val Kilmer, a very good actor in his own right, can't live up to this; he's too...blond, maybe. Just not dark enough. And the star-studded cast of villains is also reminiscent of the earlier TV show.

Still, with that in mind (and the fact that they ditched Tim Burton, Micheal Keaton, and Danny Elfman) this is a pretty good movie. Jim Carey's Riddler is a tiny bit over-the-top and Tommy Lee Jones's Two-Face is a bit too humorous for my tatses (I blame this on a script that completly deleted his tragic story). Val Kilmer makes for a pretty good Batman/Bruce Wayne. Nicole Kidman plays the love intrest that anyone with eyes would fall for. Chris O'Donnell played Robin well (the \\"Holy rusted metal, Batman\\" line was a nice flashback to the old TV series and forgivable). And Alfred is fun as usual. I was kinda hoping for Catwoman to pop up at some point, especially after Batman Returns, but oh well. . .

Fist of all, this film would've been nothing without its stellar cast, Kilmer, Jones, O'Connel, Carrey, and Kidman, what an A list lineup. This time Val Kilmer replaced Batman, and I think he rivals Keaton's performance.

While Val Kilmer may have looked better for the part of Wayne, that was the only good thing about him. Kilmer, O'Donnel, and even Nicole Kidman simply didn't work for this movie. there was no chemistry between any of them. Jim Carrey was the obvious choice for the Riddler, and he was histerical. And although I was a bit surprised at the casting of Tommy Lee Jones for Two-Face, he did a brilliant job. He has a real flair for playing psychotic. Those two were the only things that saved this movie from being a total disaster, and frankly, if they had cut out all other scenes and just shown the scenes with those two in them, I would have been happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Batman's best","review":"Very fun flik. I HATED the boring original. While Val Kilmer is no Michael Keaton, he still makes a pretty good Batman (Unlike the horribly cast George Clooney.).

He is a cold, calculating insane genius. Val Kilmer is pretty good as Batman, although I'd like to see Batman portrayed as the brilliant detective he is. Chris O'Donnell.

Neither of the actors playing title character nor Harvey Dent wanted a part of this.The only redeeming aspect of this film is the introduction of Robin. And that is what makes it one star above 'Batman & Robin' (otherwise known as 'Batman on Ice').The primary problem is style.

This movie has the romance,the action and a spectacular, action-packed ending!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Batman movie Ever made!","review":"This is a great movie and is one of the best superhero movies EVER made.Val Kilmer,Chris O'Donnel,Tommy Lee Jones,and especially Jim Carrey are great in their roles and Nicole actually is pretty good in this as well!5 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jim Carrey is OK rest of the movie is trash.","review":"I enjoy Batman movies Batman 1987,Batman begins, Dark Knight,... but this movie well it sadly got worse with the next installment don't waste your hard earned on this garage. Really stupid story-line."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst batman film","review":"i actually hate this even more then batman & robin to be totally honest. Atleast from beginning to end we all saw a camp train wreck with no plot; so it can be laughed at the for the camp classic that it is. Batman Forever masqurades as a good film but falls so far short that it earns much more of my hatred. there's just so much too hate about this film. first off lets get one thing straight...Jim Carrey is just awful as the riddler shouting and mugging through the movie. TLJ is just as bad as TwoFace laughing and screaming. Nicole Kidman is horribly miscast as bruce waynes love interest. Joel Schumacher seems to be obssesed with beauiful women then actually above average ones that are better suited for the part. the music was also horrible loud and annoying. funny enough Kilmer and O'donnel are the only actors who adds a sense of seriousness too the movie. in the end you will see a movie that had poteintial but in the end comes crashing to a big terd."},{"rating":"1","title":"wasted movie","review":"The main reason i came to hate this movie was because of two face.don't get we wrong i think tommy lee jones is a grate actor could have made this role his best.but instead they made him to a joke. To me he was alway the best of the batman bad guy, never good nore evil but both. Not only that he had been at one time brue's best friend. which meant that it wasn't easy for batman to fight him.In this movie we see nothing of this. The part good part bad story is forgotten. In one part two face kept tosing his coin untill he got the side that he wonted. the bad one, the whole pont of the coin was becuase he could not make up his mind.Batman on the other hand seems to have no troubal beating up his one time friend, in fact the only time it there past is brought up is by two facs at the very end and then it's only for a second. As for the rest of the film it looks as if the makers were on LSD or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, but at least it made me laugh","review":"Oh god, what wasn't wrong with this movie. 1st of all what's with the nipples on the batsuits, was that really necessary? 2nd of all the actors were all wrong. I mean I love Jim Carey, but I don't think he was quite right for that particular role. Honestly, if you're a harecore batman fan this movie is definitly not for you. Of course if you were a hardcore batman fan you probably have all ready seen this movie. Personally I loved it, probably not for the best reasons but at least I can give it some credit. So if you need a pick me up watch this movie, it lets you know that somebody's more of an idiot than you are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Batman is back, but it's not Keaton.","review":"I loved the first two Batman movies, but I hated this one. This one stunk! Jim Carrey is so annoying as the psychotic Riddler. Scarface, played by Tommy Lee Jones, was pretty cool. However, this movie just wasn't as dark as the first two films. And Val Kilmer is no Micheal Keaton, who played as Batman is the last two. I think Kilmer makes a lousy replacement for Keaton. The plot in this movie is poor. The script stinks, too! Sorry. That's the way I feel about this silly mess. Batman is old anyway. How about some James Bond or Jackie Chan. Their movies are a heck of a lot better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This movie was disappointing but almost all sequals that I have seen are. I always wonder why they don't use the original actor(s)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely loved it!","review":"I remember seeing this movie in theaters when I was a kid, and to this day, its one of my most favorites! Kilmer did an awesome job as Gotham's legendary protector and O'Donnel was simply brilliant! I know people usually hate anything to do with the idea of Batman needing help, but Grayson and the rest of the Bat-Family that joined after him are an important part of the Batman story. They show that no matter how good a hero is, we all need a little help sometime right? Anyways, going back to the movie, it was an interesting mix of humor and action that couldnt have happened in any other movie! Not saying it's the greatest movie in the world but it is worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Batman Movie I've Seen","review":"I began watching the Batman series starting with Tim Burton's 1989 film. The first two films were excellent, full of layered characters, surprisingly good dialogue, and satisfying action sequences. Even the city of Gotham looked good. This film, however, features groan-inducing dialogue, a completely incoherent plot, offensively fluorescent sets, and just generally bad acting. I would rather have watched Batman Returns a second time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, but not horrific","review":"Look, a Batman movie is only as good as its Batman, and considering there have been a number of them throughout the entire series, I've gotta say that Val Kilmer is not only a terrible Bruce Wayne, but also a horrific Batman. Perhaps the worst, probably moreso than George Clooney. This movie was successful due to lots of advertising, flashy effects and the fact that it was a Batman movie. It's not so much that Val Kilmer can't make a good hero, but his acting performance in this is simply pathetic, he's like a piece of wood it's ridiculous and painful to watch a fantastic actress like Nicole Kidman putting her heart into her role meanwhile Kilmer is just responding like a stiff.Jim Carrey and Kidman make this one work. I have no idea what they were thinking casting Val Kilmer, it's no surprise to me that shortly after this film his career pretty much went downhill, they should've fired him early on and gotten someone else. No Batman will ever match Michael Keaton."},{"rating":"2","title":"a role custom made for Jim Carry","review":"Yes, what prompted me to place an order for BATMAN FOREVER was I caught the tail-end of it on tv on the other day. I am mainly intered in the Jim Carry role as the Riddler. Mr. Carry pulls off a bad guy who is genulily distrbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Batman Forever","review":"Batman Forever is a marginally better movie than the fourth one in the series, the film has a plot it has better acting & the cool bat suits & good vehicles especially the Batmobile (Although the Batmobile in Batman & Robin was pretty cool too. ) Which isn't saying much. which stars are good i rate this 2 1/2 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls short","review":"This film is somewhat lighter than the first two films, and in some ways it works. We begin to see the campiness of the next sequel, the god-awful \\"Batman & Robin\\". Jim Carrey does a decent job portraying the Riddler, but what is up with Two-Face? Out of all the Bat-villians portrayed in films, Tommy Lee Jones does the worst job. He makes his character totally uninteresting. If you want to see Two-Face done right, watch the animated series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Batman \\"Whatever\\"","review":"Batman Forever is cartoonish, silly and filled with shallow performances. Val Kilmer replaces Michael Keaton as Batman. He turns in a souless performance, a complete walk through. Chris O'Donnell is the only spark of interest in the film as Robin. The rest of the characters include Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face and Jim Carrey as The Riddler.Under the direction of Joel Schumacher, the Batman entry looks like it's based on the campy Adam West series rather than the brooding Dark Night of the comics. The emphasis here is on flashy sets and comic one liners. This is the first dent in the Batman series and it only gets worse from here."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOOOOOO!","review":"Okay, admittedly all I've seen is the trailer and all I've heard are comments by other people, but even that it is enough to say with some confidence that if you have any regard for the character of Batman/Bruce Wayne DO NOT waste your time on this movie. Even the catchy quotes that appeared in the trailer were all wrong, and out of character for the Dark Knight. That smile of his? Yeah, not unless he was faking it for a reason, or had just been gassed by the Joker. Heaven forbid! If you want a good Batman movie, rent/buy Batman Begins."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled by the name!","review":"This is not immersion. It is a series of games in Hebrew. The games will teach you vocabulary, but it will not teach grammar nor will it help you make sentences.On the positive side, I did find the games were useful in getting down vocabulary that I had a hard time memorizing. The other good thing about the CD is that there is no English."},{"rating":"1","title":"Instant Immersion Hebrew","review":"I was very disappointed in this title. There are better free programs online than this one. In my opinion don't waste your money. If you want a serious Hebrew program you should be searching titles available from Judaism websites. They may cost more but you are getting what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"A slightly dry, but exhaustive tome on American religion!","review":"Mead's book is an excellent reference manual on denominations in the United States. Statistical information is included, along with the origins and beliefs of various religious groups. Among the most helpful features were the list of headquarters of denominations, the glossary, and the list of helpful resources. I definitely learned valuable information about denominations I knew little to nothing about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Handbook Available","review":"I have owned several editions of this book over the last 30 years. I find that it is the best source of informaion available about denominations in the U.S. However, from time to time you will find a branch of a denomination referred to in an article but you will not find that group listed because they have failed to return the questionaire that the publisher sent to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Handbook of Denominations in the United States 13th Edition: 13th Edition","review":"Do not buy this book in the Kindle edition. You can not use the go to function to get to the table of contents. This fact alone renders this book useless as a reference book unless you want to spend hours just clicking through pages to get to the place you want. You can't return a kindle book so my money was wasted and I won't spend more money to get the actual book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deflated","review":"I was a bit disappointed in this book. It was recommended by a professor of mine so on his word I bought it. I guess the let down is on me, I over hoped for what the content would look like only to find out it was a fraction of what I personally was looking for... On that note, it is still a useful resource and one that will stay in my library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource !","review":"I have owned previous editions of this work and have always found it most helpful. It is the only source I know of which contains information on the many Christian and some non-Christian sects found in the United States. Of course, there are some omissions and some articles are more informative than others, however, this is the best resource available. It is excellent for research and also for those trying to match their beliefs with a church out there! One omission which surprised me are the modern schisms from the Roman Catholic Church. Some of these are well-known and should have been included."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book- TOO SHORT!! MY ONLY COMPLAINT!!","review":"For the lay person, this book provides an excellent resource. The authors actually write in ENGLISH :)---My only three gripes: #1 the articles are TOO SHORT!! Theoretically, this book should weigh around 25lbs. #2 - some familiarity with Christian doctrine (e.g.-Arminianism, Calvinism, etc...) is needed to understand some areas. #3 - the authors should make an 'unabridged' version with more detail. But overall, this book is great. I really rate is about 4.5, not just 4."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Sad that This is the Best Book on the Subject!","review":"This book should be compiled like a travel guide. There should be an introductory chapter that explains the major divisive doctrines of American denominations. Each denomination should then follow a common format that starts with what its members believe. Then, church history deserves a section, followed with a discussion of the current state of the denomination (schools, charities, number of members, etc.) There should be photos of representative churches, worship services, etc. Then, at the end of each major group of denominations should be a chart summarizing the information.This book is ok, but as with so many books within the religious category, it just doesn't measure up to its potential as a useful resource."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"EA should take the Cinematic cameras in Return of the King, and shove them up their ???. They only succeed in hindering game play. This is purely a 'reflex' fighting game, with strategy thrown out the window. Nothing more.Forget the so-called 'Combos' and special moves... they are not only frustrating to use, but totally worthless in combat.The only reason I award it the score I did was for the excellent graphics, soundtrack and cinematics. The rest of the game is worthless.Fortunately for me, I bought the game as a 'pre-owned' title at a local store, at a drastically discounted price.

If you like trying new wines, make sure you have this book with you. It is fascinating to look up the exact winery's location, possibly even read some text about it, while enjoying the terrior directly in the glass. This book is for the novice and the expert, and will give key information to make you one.The details about the many growing regions of the world are fantastic. This book will help you select wines from a region, not just by varietal or by country, but even by vineyard or block. The maps show incredible detail. Every wine lover should have this book.There is only one negative, and that is a book cannot contain every location and winery. So sometimes it won't be there. But overall, this book has to contain 99% of all wine regions, and certainly all the well known ones. You are likely to discover a winery in your backyard, even if you are not in one of the famous wine regions!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cliff Note's Version of the More Modern History of OKC","review":"I actually read this book twice because I felt that I had missed a few things the first time around. What a great Cliff Note's version of recent OKC History. I think the first 3 chapters were very well written and detailed oriented. The Author managed to transport me back to the time my mother was born and gave me a better insight into what was going in her world during that time period. The rest of the book is a pretty easy read and provide some interesting pictures of recent changes to OKC so that the reader can compare that to images from the late 1800's. I thought it was actually a nice touch to include some family photo's so that people 100 years from now can see what was going on at the turn of the 21st century. I thought Mr. Griffith did an excellant job on taking us down memory lane. Although this particular book was not my favorite I find it a great read and a must book for those history lovers in your family. DC"},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so","review":"Not Kenny's best.

Oddly enough for someone who is supposed to have a Christian viewpoint, Ms. Herr seems to totally discount inspiration of any kind for a writer. Perhaps that's why I found her writing to be uninspired and uninspiring. She insisted writers use a cycle of endless writing and rewriting. It left me wondering when you get to the part about actually getting published. She had one valid point, in that authors may not make substantial amounts of money from writing (although that is the reason for being published) and should take solace in having done what God asked. Perhaps she hasn't heard about Internet marketing and promotion, although it's possible she wouldn't be inspired by it if she had.A caveat for those who take a writing course using this as a textbook--you will not find encouraging words here."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of Money !","review":"Nothing personal, I'm sure Ethel's a wonderful lady... but i found this book to be patronising rubbish!

If you die hards want Sepultura or Nailbomb then dust off those old CDs! This is a new band with a new objective. This release is a nice balance of heavy in-yer-face tracks like the title track, Execution Style and Defeat U, a Portuguese native named Porrada, and a great tribute to Helmut in their fine cover of In The Meantime. Soulfly breathes on with new members and Max's growing fan base.Keep in mind, those \\"bouncy simple 4 string ESP Viper riffs\\" are self proclaimed as Max admittedly rips off the other two strings since he isn't very good at guitar. No prob - give me a scream MAX!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Triumph for Soulfly; disappiontment for mainstream","review":"In the age where metal is slowly edging its way to mainstream with generic guitar distortion riffs and overused screams, Soulfly sticks to its roots of being unique and foreign. A lot of the tracks on this CD do not feature the common sound that a lot of bands today produce; Soulfly uses a mixture of different instruments and combines a number of different styles into their music. Soulfly is a stand of uniqueness in the metal scene filled with bands that produce the same sound that renders them to be almost indistinguishable from each other, especially in shows.To the point, the average metal/hardcore fan will probably not like this CD. However, fans of Soulfly's brand of originality surely will."},{"rating":"2","title":"ok soulfly album","review":"I think this soulfly recored is an ok recored in not as great but it is much better than soufly 3. there is more rocking sound and its much more better songs. but of couse nothing can bet the crate cameos on the primitive disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's happened to you Max?","review":"For one thing, it seems that Max Cavalera is trying to change his musical soundscape yet again, as his Soulfly outfit returns with another major lineup change and an attempt to go at an even more harder edge. In the end however, \\"Prophecy\\" is a mess, and Max is doing more of the same that was featured on the last album, and it's sadly pretty lame. Not to mention, when did this guy get so religious? Like a previous reviewer stated, anyone else remember \\"Antichrist\\" and \\"Necromancer\\"? How did this guy conjure up utter filler dribble like \\"Moses\\", \\"I Believe\\", and \\"Wings\\"? I never thought I'd say it, but Sepultura is better off without Max leading the way, especially considering the direction he's taking Soulfly in. The title track is a solid song on it's own, but it's not enough to save \\"Prophecy\\" from being a coaster.

The songs aren't heavy or have the same crushing beat like those on Primitive or III. Why does Max kick everyone out of his band every record? This is ridiculous, the songs have lost intensity, all of them.

The second album \\"Primitive\\" was also brilliant , it had so many great cameo guest vocal spots and sounded fantastic and the songs seemed to flow into each other. The third album \\"3\\" was another fantastic attempt it lacked the power of the last two albums but was still by far better than this new album i honestly cant believe Soulfly even released this. Plus Max has got rid of all the band members off the last album and gone back to original members and newbies. Why doesnt he just call the band \\"Max Cavelera and others\\" because the fact he still calls it soulfly is stupid. If you like metal which puts u to sleep then by all means buy this album.

Max shows all those doubting old Sepultura fans that he can still thrash out killer heavy riffs while backed by amazing tribal sounding percussion.

And who other than Soulfly would include a WWI song \\"March on the River Drina\\" played by a marching band of Serbian gypsies? Much harder of an album than the first 3 soulfly cds.

Standouts for me are: the 2nd half of Prophecy, 2nd half of Living Sacrifice, the blazing although brief guitar solo in the middle of Execution Style, 2nd half of Defeat U, 2nd half of Mars, whole damn song of Born Again Anarchist, cover song is good, Soulfly IV instrumental good as usual. Whole damn album is good....if there were a way to combine Sepultura + Soufly into a megaband even for just 1 album and tour, that'd be cool by me."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I must say, I like Max Cavalera as a hardcore, metal musician, not as a religious one trying to be spiritual.

But somehow they find love.","review":"Starring Julianne Moore and Pierce Brosnan as two divorce lawyers who find love, I couldn't help wondering how these two talented people could have agreed to act in such a silly bit of fluff. But I guess they're entitled to make their own choices.Laws of Attraction is one of those lightweight confections that are upbeat, lively and has zippy background music. It's an old fashioned theme with classic gags and the comedy depends on the rhythm of the dialogue.Even though the plot was set in modern times, and Julianne Moore cast as successful attorney, the romance was controlled by the Pierce Brosnan character. She was made to look stupid and childish and ridiculous in every scene. He's super confident and arrogant; she is insecure and vulnerable to panic attacks. Both of them eat junk food and they find love only after lots and lots and lots of alcohol.Fans of romantic comedy might get a chuckle out of this but I was bored throughout."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried to like it..","review":"Really like Juilanne Moore but the story was so predictable. Some cute moments and occasional humor but I would not watch again...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Opposite poles are attracted!","review":"Among the genre of light comedy with some remarkable dialogues about the significance of the marriage, spiced with slices of fine humor, the film is worthy to see.Both of them are distinguished, renowned and famed divorce lawyers, who eventually will meet in NYC through a common case. Since this first encounter where the innate skills and well different points of view about the divorce will be carved n relief.The result was a light comedy with slices of original situations, according the canons of the classic comedy. Moore and Brosnan are remarkable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light and Predictable","review":"If you are simply looking for some escapist fluff--or just want to look at Pierce Brosnan for awhile--\\"Laws of Attaction\\" may work for you. Brosnan was his usual dashing self in this film, but there was not enough substance to make the film memorable, or to provide any basis for concluding that the role played by Julianne Moore was that of a hotshot atorney. In fact, she was so poorly prepared for her court hearings, it is a wonder she still had a job! Verisimilitude was shorter than the word itself. Except for the pleasure of watching Brosnan onscreen, I didn't care a whit about any of the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"laws of attraction","review":"This was an ok kind of film, but the story was weak and not much impressive acting by the actors."},{"rating":"2","title":"laws of attration","review":"to whom it may concern I BELEIVED best that i say it very good movie for men likes our selves distcovers both geners a man and wowmen well funny and well put togather. thanks again for this signing of sammy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring conglomeration of romcom conventions","review":"Two top divorce attorneys with differing styles (Pierce Brosnan and Julianne Moore) find themselves married to each other while on opposite sides of a high profile breakup.This is just a tired, tired rehash of romantic conventions we have all seen a million times. Brosnan, Moore, and the rest of the cast are good and manage to invest the film with some fun on occasion, but they are completely let down by the creative team on the other side of the camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWSOME!!","review":"I saw this movie twice in two weeks and I love it!! My friends and I couldn't stop laughing, it's great!! It's very funny and is for people from 10 to 99 years. Julianne Moore and Pierce Brosnan are the perfect match. Is one of the best movies I saw in my hole life!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Kind of Movie Little Seen These Days","review":"Judging from other reviews, it seems that people either love this movie or hate it. I belong to the former category. I saw it tonight and absolutely loved it. Pierce Brosnan and Julianne Moore work wonderfully together; their characters' differences may seem trite at first, but the charisma that each actor has overcomes this slight defect in spades.One does not often see romantic comedies concerning people past 25 anymore. As a college student who loves old movies, this seems to be a kind of modern Adam's Rib (at least on the lawyer side of things), and that's fabulous. At last, a movie that doesn't solely rely on situational comedy or graphic sex scenes/references in order to make it work. It's about two people who have matured and grown into themselves, and how they fall in love. I hope Brosnan and Moore make more movies like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A grown up Remington Steele","review":"This picture tries to harken back to the screwball comedy format of the 30's and 40's. It was funny, romantic, and visually beautiful. A very nice date movie for grownups. Brosnan plays a slightly sloppy version of the Remington Steele of his youth. Moore trys to play a woman whose job has spoiled her faith in men and marriage. She is too sweet in her role. However, they do click onscreen and he is so very,very handsome. In the mold of so many recent romantic comedies like Intolerable Cruelty,and Somethings Gotta Give, the writing and jokes start off fast and funny but bog down in the plot twists and slightly slow pacing. I hope hollywood's writers can someday come to terms with the idea that the movie can keep up speed and pacing even with the love scenes heating up and the sparks changing from anger to affection. It should as funny and fast for the middle and end as it was at the beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn yawn","review":"BIG YAWN. Bad acting,this is onr of the most boring movie I've EVER seen.

Maybe it can be sold at Ebay's... for the fans of these two..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Malarky!!!!","review":"This was a completely unrealistic feministic role reversal fantasy. With no disrespect or disregard for maturity in women; Julianne Moore can do every minute of the well preserved 56 year old role that was portrayed to be her Mother's age."},{"rating":"1","title":"About as atttracting as two positive ends of a magnet","review":"This film containts all the elements for a delightful comedy but at the end one is left with a feeling that a lot of things were just not right. Talk about formulaic - you knew from the first that the two divorce lawyers would eventually marry. And that they would also battle in court. And that they would have problems.What you DIDN'T know was that the attraction between the two would be about as phony as a North Korean promise and the sexual tension (quote unquote) had about as much spark as a used firecracker. Cutesy rather than cute."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Solid Waste of Your Time","review":"First things first. It was an atrocious idea to cast these co-stars in their roles. Not only does Pierce Brosnan's performance feel forced, but Julianne Moore is remarkably bland and unappealing. That's not even the worst aspect of this appropriately labeled piece of garbage. The arguements these two get into are notably tedious and uninteresting. The shallowness of all the characters is mind-blowing, and those two celebrity clients are incredibly stupid, not only in their acting but in the stereotypical fashion in which they were created. I could've done a whole lot more with myself in the time I wasted on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"Pierce Brosnan really needs to do away with his tradmark smirk: it's really getting tedious. He's the weak element in a fluffy flick which features lots of nice light comic performances. Julianne Moore displays good comic timing as the opposing counsel and Michael Sheen whoops it up as her not-that-bright client.It's not a movie you remember much after it's over, but it's actively offensive, and that's---well, that's about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"Unbelievably incoherent. Meandering plot, very little chemistry, tired situations, full of set-ups that go nowhere and make no sense. Julianne Moore tries too hard to be funny and isn't. Pierce Brosnan is just smarmy. It's supposed to be a take-off on Hepburn-Tracy movies but the \\"career girl finds love\\" premise is done in such a corny way that it's not retro but really just irrelevant. Gets one star for good looks. Waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Portraits in Oil the Van Wyk Way - very helpfull","review":"I found this book to be very helpfull. I hopeto benefit by it in my portraits. I throughly recommendthe book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just set it up yesterday","review":"So I received this item pretty darn quick. The first thing I noticed was how heavy the box was. The top is one solid piece and makes up the bulk of the weight. I was able to assemble it by myself in about an hour and a half (I'm not especially handy). Most of the assembly involves using a hex wrench and some pretty long bolts. I also used a drill on the screws that you use for the doors. Assembled, the unit seems to be of high quality, very sturdy. The wheel locks work very well, at least on my tile floor; there isn't even a bit of rocking. The wood seems high quality, although the little caps they give you to cover the bolt holes could match the grain a bit better that's a very minor complaint. Overall, very satisfied with my purchase, especially for the price I don't think you can find a more durable island surface at this size and price point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent quality","review":"This is a great kitchen cart. Better than I expected. High quality materials not some cheap piece of furniture that is going to fall apart in a few years. very satisfied"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell apart","review":"It gets put together much like Ikea furniture. But being a kitchen island cart it gets used constantly and we chop on it, stack bowls underneath. So, after a week of use we cleaned the kitchen and pushed the cart onto a rug. When we pushed it off the rug all the joints came loose- all of them. So we grabbed PC7 and super glued every joint so it won't fall apart.However this shouldn't happen!I given this item a 1 star until they figure this out. It has to be very sturdy for kitchen use!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Item","review":"Beware, I'm sure I would have liked this item, but instead got the wooden top. Just love having to send back a 70+ pound box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pain Or No Pain To Assemble?","review":"My Wife and I took our time assembling the kitchen cart. We unpacked everything except the stainless steel top and laid out the pieces so we could see what we had and made sure all the pieces were there.I used the Allen wrench that came with the cart as well as a cordless screwdriver. I remembered to keep a beer handy.We followed the directions step by step reviewing each step twice before assembly.We had no trouble putting the cart together.Although the cart was made in Thailand, I found the overall quality to be worth the price (so far). It looks good in our kitchen and we moved our dishes and flatware to the shelves and drawers on the cart thus freeing up our meager cupboard space. We also ended up with more counter space.I think the cart was a good purchase and knowing what I know now...I would buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good & Sturdy","review":"It took about 3 weeks for the item to finally ship from the distributor, but it arrived very quickly thereafter.The quality of the cart is very good and sturdy. They send clear instructions & extra hardware. Only a Phillips Head screwdriver (or a drill, if you prefer) was required for assembly beyond what shipped with the cart. It took 2 of us about half an hour to put this together.The only negative was a slight ding in the stainless steel top along one of the edges. It seemed more hassle to repackage & ship back than to accept the ding as is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product for the price","review":"I received the kitchen cart over the weeked and we (2 people) put it together in a little over an hour (with a 10 minute time out to put on a band-aid when a piece of wood fell on a toe)But other than that minor mishap the assembly went as well as can be expected. The directions are \\"OK\\" - could have been a bit clearer and as a result we had to re-assemble a few portions but overall the process of unpacking and putting the cart together went well.The stainless steal top is beautiful and the the cart is just the right size for my not so huge kitchen. We needed some extra counter space and the 2 extra drawers and 2 shelves make a huge difference.It's really a nice piece of kitchen furniture for the cost. I would certainly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great purchase","review":"this is beautiful. It took a few hours to put together, but once all together it is sturdy and well made.

I would buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb quality for the price. Magnetic Stainless Steel does exist!","review":"When I began to unpack the parts of the kitchen cart I was immediately impressed with the quality of the hardwood and precision engineering. Be patient and follow the directions absolutely sequentially.Incidentally, modern stainless steel can be attracted to a magnet, so don't be disappointed. When I tried a magnet to the cart's top it hung on like a returning sailor to his bride.

I would like to know how they made the collar stand up for the picture! I ended up painting wire black and then hot glueing it to the back of the collar and dress to get it to slightly stand up like the picture.

I just hope this isn't made into a movie too, or even more fans will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much","review":"I guess Maupin just ran out of steam. He should have done the decent thing after More Tales.. and let 28 Barbary Lane drift over the Reichenbach Falls. The series started with some great books, with interesting characters he clearly felt sympathy for. By book 3 (Further Tales...) he was introducing increasingly improbable characters (Jim Jones, alive and well and living in Golden Gate Park!), but enough weird plot interest to keep me going to the end of the book. Babycakes doesn't even do that. He's made a big mistake by moving the action from SanFrancisco to the UK - he loves S.F. and the way of life there is a great theme. He doesn't get England the same way, and even gets his facts wrong. There are two really good books in this series, but this isn't one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Book","review":"I read this 4th installment of the Tales of the City series and absolutely loved it. Some of the stories seemed a little far fetched with Michael going off to England and running into Mona, but over all it was a great story. I am reading all the books in order and I love the characters. I did read Michael Tolliver Lives when it first came out on iBooks based only on watching the first 3 books in their television format. When I got my Kindle and heard that Further Tales, More Tales, Babycakes and Significant Others would be released finally on Kindle I decided to read the whole series in order. I am so glad to have read the series up to this point and the look forward to the remaining 4 books, even though I've already read the 7th book, I will read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Babycakes","review":"This book is another wonder from Maupin. It is also a very accurate description of the San Francisco gay community and what was happening with the beginning of the AID's crisis. Maupin tells a wonderful story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good read from Maupin","review":"Yet another series of adventures for the delightful characters that populate Maupin's books, this time with a bittersweet twist: the reality of AIDS. Because Maupin's Tales of the City books are generally so lighthearted, zany and playful, when the story opens with Michael mourning his lover, it hits pretty hard.Despite the slight bittersweetness, this installment of the series features all of Maupin's signature flourishes and his wonderful sense of humor.If your looking for light, breezy stories and likable characters you couldn't find anywhere but San Francisco, then buy this series of books and get started reading. You'll quickly get addicted. For those of you San Franciscans past and present who've never read Maupin, he's worth a look. If nothing else his books will make you remember why San Francisco was once such an interesting and fun place to live and what's sorely missing from it today!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It sucks!","review":"Don't waste your money.

It is based on the true story of Craig Shergold, a boy with cancer who desires to break the Guinness Record of most \\"Get Well\\" cards received before he dies. Not only does he break the record, he lives!There is a bit of inspiration to be garnered and it was worth watching once, however, I wouldn't recommend anyone purchasing it. The acting was lacking; English accents would disappear, the boy seemed to be delayed in addressing his lines and often just sat there trying to \\"look sick\\". Kirk Cameron's (tiny) role was obviously added just to get him in. I was also quite dismayed at the direction/lines given to the mother, who's faith often seemed to revolve around the cards, rather than God.

This gate is flimsy and cheap. The locking mechanism aligns with an eye clip, and you have to ensure both the bottom metal hook sits into the eye clip while at the same time squeezing the top lock to open it then grasp around the top eye clip! Not an easy thing to do...it also does NOT secure the width of the gate, it has an open sliding design so if you over-slide it you're jamming the metal gate locks into the wall.

I would NOT reccomend this gate, it's too chintzy and difficult for day to day life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"The gate was easy to install and looks fine, if a little chitzy. BUT, the latch is near impossible to do one handed, and really hard to do with two. You certainly can't do it with the light off. Sort of a drag when you have to go through it in the middle of the night. THe top and bottom each only clicks into the eye part of hook and eye set. I don't think it's that sturdy. I wouldn't recommend this gate if you have to go through it often. Lots of them are much easier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"Bought this gate for the top of our staircase... and returned it the very next day. The quality was poor - it seemed very flimsy, and I was concerned as to whether it would hold up if my 18 month old or 3 year old pushed or pulled on it. It was also extremely difficult to latch - you had to line up a hook/eye at the bottom and squeeze in and lock into place at the top all at once... not an easy task with a child in your hand.

I installed this and lined up the mounting brackets in a stud, but the screws they give you with it are so short that they cannot drill into the wood of the stud if you have standard drywall. The screws will be loose and just grinding the drywall. A child of any significant weight would easily knock this down after enough wear and tear. Also the eye hooks are difficult to work with, and again must be installed into wood (or metal), but seriously who has metal walls in their house! There are much better gates than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy, do not buy","review":"I needed a strudy, hardware-mounted gate for the top of the stairs. This product fell apart. The materials are light and flimsy. For example, the hook that actually closes the gate does not hold up to normal wear and tear, doesn't close properly without a lot of effort, and is generally a piece of junk.

Finally in September of '08 the television never fully turned on (still a power light on, but no picture, no sound.

Yet, Mintz playing transcends beyond virtuoso; it's more of spiritual and religiously.In terms of violin sound, I would slightly prefer Milstein's Stradivarius sound (I am not quite sure what violin Mintz played), but Milstein's usual faster playing style causes him to take a slower approach during some of the more difficult multi stops passage in Fuga, it somewhat looses the continuous feeling of tempo.

How Diana copes and continues filled me with such a deep respect for her and her creator.The setting is the farmlands of New Jersey where they grow cranberries is bogs. Diana arrives a day before the Cranberry Festival and meets an assortment of characters including Louisa, a woman her age but childish and selfish in comparison; Rosie who is Louisa's grandmother and who is dying from cancer and Jack, Louisa's former lover with whom Diana falls in love. The hope that it represents is everything.Terrific writing. Loved the pacing.This book deals with powerful issues but with a deftness of touch that is rare and wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"I threw it out.","review":"I have never, ever, ever in my life thrown a book out. I prize them all-paper or hardback; old and new. But this book annoyed me (dare I say angered me) to a level I have never experienced (though The Historian came close). I got to page 93 and thought why the hell am I still reading this garbage? So, I put it where it rightly belongs-in my trashcan.I second two things I have read by fellow reviewers: this author clearly had some publishing connections as a film producer or she would NEVER have gotten this dreck published. And, second, where was her editor?? Did she have one? Perhaps she doubled as both writer and editor. There could be no other explanation as to how this was ever published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring, boring","review":"What a disappointment! These were characters I could never care about or relate to and a story line so absurd that I had to put the book down without finishing. So predictable! The victimized and put-upon main character! (Diana), the beautiful, troubled rebel!(Louisa--ooh, she steals cigarettes and wears leather!), the spry and oh-so-loveable grandma(Rosie--but wait, she has a secret!), the evil ex-boyfriend--all we need now is the fairy godmother...but wait...here comes the fairy godfather(Sam), so I guess all is well in the land of cliches. This book insulted my intelligence. For a book with true spirit, humor, and spark, try Emma Who Saved My Life by Wilton Barnhardt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written...","review":"Diana Moore lives a normal, somewhat mundane life in New York city, complaining about her job, her ex-boyfriend the \\"Monster\\", and other aspects of her life that she sees as pathetic. A horrible accident sends her into a roller coaster of emotion and depression. In an attempt to escape her new reality, she flees New York and her friends and finds herself lost in her thoughts and in rural New Jersey where a minor accident places her in Pine Barrens, in the home of some welcoming strangers. Here she spends an amazing two days, half lost in her thoughts, where she finally begins to heal.This is a remarkable story, both sad and beautiful, that will stay with you for a long time to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely exquisite","review":"I picked up this novel, partly because it is partly based in NJ, where I live, and partly because when I started reading it, I couldn't dare put it down. This is the kind of novel, to me, that is so incredible, that you have to put down every few pages for a break, to allow everything to seep in. The quality of writing here is quite good, and the characters jump off the page and come to life for me. When Diana is driving down the turnpike, and gets off at exit nine, the descriptions - I know exactly what she is talking about since I live there. Despite my putting down the book every few pages, I finished it in under 3 days. This is the kind of novel you read that you want to stretch out and make last as long as possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Down to earth","review":"Kathleen DeMarco really captures the overwhelming pain of loss in this moving first novel. I found her to have a great sense of humor and to capture the \\"true\\" thoughts of women, the one's we don't usually express out loud. It's amazing how some people do truly walk into your life at the strangest of times - such were Rosie, Louisa and the rest of the Pine Barrens gang. She discovers many things about herself including what's important and what's \\"real\\". Definately a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run on Queen","review":"I bought this book the other day thinking it would be a good summer read. The run on sentences are making me CRAZY. I am losing interest by the end of the sentence rather than the end of the paragraph. The content seems to be ok so far (what I can make of it), but what type of writing style is this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood Junk","review":"If you want to read a trite, self depreciating narrative, pick up this book. I enjoy reading, and am not a critic by any means. Certainly when picking up a novel on a Saturday afternoon I'm not searching for a Thomas Pynchon writing level. I am looking for something that I wouldn't mistake for my younger sister's high school creative writing class homework. The voice is inconsistent, and the whole story is poorly written -- sometimes I wonder if the editor just didn't bother looking at it -- there are points when it is not clear who is speaking in the room.It makes me angry that there are so many talented writers out there that can't get published but this thing is what ends up in our bookstores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"I rarely stop reading books before the end, but I had to bail on this one on page 109. It was way too depressing! The perspective is that of the main character, but she is grieving and having random thoughts that were way too difficult to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blu Angel","review":"Blu Cantrell's debut cd, So Blu is one of the best debut albums I've heard by any singer period. Blu's debut single, \\"Hit 'Em Up Style (Oops)\\" put cheating men in their place. The song displayed Blu as a no-nonsense, take no prisoners R&B diva. The album tracks on this album are quite listenable as Blu expounds on love lost and found. It's R&B music at its best! I would recommend this album over her second album, Bittersweet. I hope Blu comes correct with this third album and shuts it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-Hoo!","review":"I remember getting this CD at a used CD store. I really liked \\"Hit Em Up Style,\\" so I was really expecting a lot from her album. Well, let me tell you what happened next. I listened to \\"So Blu,\\" saved \\"Hit Em Up Style\\" on my computer, took the CD back to the used CD store and got my money back. For real, \\"So Blu\\" was lousy. Too many slow songs, too many songs about some guy breaking her heart. I don't want to hear that depressing stuff. Skip this at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"pick a note","review":"okay, so Blu's hit single is wonderful with it's blues quality, but the rest of her cd is talentless. There's a difference between skatting in a jazz sense and chromatic diahrea. Too many of her songs deal with cheating, bad \\"dogs.\\" Get over it. It's reduntant and annoying. She should never have been allowed to put a whole album together. Quit while you're ahead Blu. You had a great single, now go back to your day job. Maybe, take a singing class. Do not support Blu Cantrell's pipe dreams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even Better than I Expected!","review":"I am really pleased with my purchase of this CD. I can definitely relate to a lot of the songs. The track \\"Blu Is A Mood\\" is my favorite, It has an old school smooth beat. Other stand-out tracks are \\"I'll Find A Way\\", \\"I Can't Believe\\", \\"10,000 Times\\" and \\"All You Had To Say\\". This CD is well worth the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy for Blu!","review":"I love this album! Hit em up Style has a funky jazz beat that will make you get up and dance. Blu certainly was influenced by jazz and this Providence native makes good use of it in her debut album. Every track is a winner! Buy this album if you love good R&B!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Gold digger gets an album deal . . .","review":"Blu Cantrell first sang back for Faith Evans and the song \\"Hit 'Em Up Style\\" is smooth and catchy so I decided to get the album. Too bad I didn't like any of her other songs and \\"Hit 'Em Up Style\\" got boring real fast. Don't get me wrong, she's got a good start but I'd like to see a little more work in some of the songs. Half the songs you don't know if their a dance song or ballad which is bad at dances cause you don't know whether to slow dance or get your groove on. Borrow this from a friend and decided if you like it before you buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a voice","review":"Blue cantrell has the voice of an angel and i think she will go far. She sings with a passion that takes away your breath. Good going girl.AKA Dr.Dread"},{"rating":"2","title":"BLU'esn'","review":"It is hard to exactly describe the style of this cd. The songs are fresh, new and right on point. However, with the scattin' and deeply felt lyrics, this young lady sounds like one of the divas of old. I understand her mother is a jazz singer and it is obvious that Ms. Cantrell has learned how to work a lyric from the cradle. Her voice, while unique, at times reminded me of Debra Cox, just a little bit. Strong, powerful and haunting. Good debut cd. I think she may have something here. With your talent Ms. Cantrell you'll go far!"},{"rating":"2","title":"R&B Jazz Diva","review":"Blu's album is wonderful. She has a wonderful,powerful,gospel styled voice. She has a very jazzy sound. Most of the album is beatiful ballads and jazzy uptempo songs. My favorites, are the hiphop flavored \\"Waste My TIme\\" the hit single\\"Hit Em Up Style,The straight up jazz songs\\"Swingin\\",\\"All You Had To Say \\"And \\"Blu Is A Mood\\".The heartfelt ballads \\"Till I'm Gone,\\"I'll Find A Way\\" and \\"I Can't Believe\\". The other songs are okay. But Blu sings powerfully on every song."},{"rating":"2","title":"This girl can saaaaaaaaaaaaang!!!!!","review":"I first heard-\\"Oops\\", then I heard-\\"Til I'm gone\\", and as I was driving one day-\\"I'll find a way\\"-came on the radio. That was enough for me to buy Blu's C.D, her voice is so strong, you can tell that she has been through something, her voice speaks what her heart is feeling. If you don't have it, what are you waiting for? She has her own sense of style but I must say that she is doing the damned thang with her strong vocal cords-I must give a compliment where it is due-Mary J and Faith Evans can sing songs with deep feeling and make a long lasting impression, Blu has done the same thing and I am happy to have placed her in my collection. If you want to hear her tell a story about love, pain and getting over-pick it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Debut","review":"The debut album, SO BLU, from Blu Cantrell is quite a surprise. It's a nice collection of songs that range from R&B to soul, jazz to urban, and more. Everyone knows the hit single \\"Hit Em Up Style\\", but this album has a lot more to offer. Blu shines on the ballads such as \\"I'll Find A Way\\", \\"I Can't Believe\\", \\"10,000 Times\\" and others. There are also other great songs such as \\"The One\\", \\"Swingin'\\", \\"U Must Be Crazy\\" and more. Lately with new artists in the R&B genre we have seen the same music over and over again, so its refreshing to hear a fresh new sound that will hopefully appeal to the masses. She has a nice soulful voice that wraps itself around all of the songs on here. This one's a keeper, give it a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Blah!","review":"Blu has arguably the dopest voice in R&B music right about now. However the material that she sings doesn't compliment her vocal talent. 'Hit Em' Up Style' was a great introduction, but the album is so boring. Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis production for the first time ever I can say was wack! It's sound like they gave Blu everything that Janet, Mary J. Blige and so on turned down.Blu has been continuosly compared to Faith Evans, and vocally I can say, she's got Faith beat. But the difference with Blu and Faith is, Faith is a better artist. While Faith can write/produce/vocal arrange, Blu just sings. It would be excused had Blu hooked up with good writers but that ain't the case either.Blu definetely has the potential to be something big in R&B but she's gonna have to get more out of her writers and producers in the future, or for her their won't be a future."},{"rating":"1","title":"This cd left me cold...and blue","review":"Yeah, this really isn't what I expected.I loved the cool,old-school blues vibe of her single,\\"Hit 'em Up Style(oops), so I had high hopes for this album.Unfortunately, my very high hopes were let down.EVERYTHING on the album sounds exactly the same,(with the exeption of oops).Same beat, same theme,same vocals.Oh yeah, and her voice is NOT all that great.She actually sounds pretty bad most of the time.She ain't no diva.Bur she obviously thinks she's one, since she tries and tries to hit those high notes and hold 'em, but ends up sounding like a dead cat.This is a really dissapointing debut that does nothing for the heart,head,or soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Definitely DOES NOT Hit You Up!!","review":"I rushed out to buy this cd because I thought it would be awesome. The first single was great. The rest would be too, right? Wrong!! Big Mistake!!! I'm only half way through the cd and I'm already contemplating how I can sell it back. I mean I hate to dis' an up-and-coming artist and fellow sista, but the music is so stale. The beats and the words all sound rehashed. There's no originality. I think Blu has a great voice, but the music leaves a little to be desired. So Blu is truly so blue!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitter Woman's Biography","review":"1. Blu needs to get some vocal training. She strains for too many notes out of her range which make her sound like a wet cat.2. All of her songs are about some man doing her wrong, how she's been hurt, I'm getting revenge, I opened up my heart and you stomped on it, etc. It's all very depressing.3. Most of the songs have the same beat, rhythm. I was very surprised that she could get 13 songs on that CD.4. I think Blu could improve with some vocal training and some better material, but I assure you that anyone who gave this CD more than 2 stars is trying to convince themselves that they didn't waste their money.If you want a nice quality CD, get Alicia Keys. Seriously"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank God for swinging","review":"First listen to \\"So Blu\\" is definitely a large disappointment, she steals the vocals of Toni Braxton and Janet Jackson but falls flat on her face, as with most albums the singles totally contridict the album, DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM JUST BECAUSE YOU LIKE HIT EM UP STYLE, songs like So Blu and Waste my time try desperately to save the album, however if \\"Swinging\\" was not on this album I think the best way to describe it is dead.Don't start thinking I'm a rock or pop fan that hates R&b, I love it, artists such as Shola Ama and Monica are wicked however Blu's whining voice is not r&b or hip hop it is simply screach, just hope she releases Swinging, buy that then stay well clear of the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Beats annoying background","review":"This CD is definitely not a good CD.

For that I won't become one of those bitter people who 'wish they could give this album zero stars.' But it is the ONLY song worth listening to here. The rest is made up of incredibly dull and at times just plain depressing ballads. Just save your time and money and get the Hit Em Up single."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The first two tracks (which includes the first single) are an interesting mixture of R&B and Swing. Sure, it's a couple years too late for the swing \\"revival\\", but it still works well - as attributed by the single's success. This unique combination is only revisited once more, much further into the disc. Unfortunately, the rest of this album is a bland collection of average-at-best R&B/AC-wanna-be filler including silly self-referencing tracks like \\"So Blu\\". Blech.Too bad Arista/Blu didn't have the guts to stick with the genre-bending nature that kicks off this album. It could have been great. Instead they aimed for middle-of-the-road and hit a target even lower than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A young Karen Clark-Sheard...","review":"Blu Cantrell is awesome! After hearing Faith Evans, I never thought I'd hear another voice as close to Karen Clark-Sheard than Faith Evans was. The difference is that Blu Cantrell has more vocal ability than Faith and can floooowwwww.. Keep up the good work Blu. Your album is very impressive. A job well done. It would be a dream come true to see Blu Cantrell, Karen Clark-Sheard, and Faith Evans share the stage on one song. Man, you'd have to haul me out of the place..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Afterlistening you will be anything but so blu","review":"Blu Cantrell is probably one of the strongest voices to come out in a while. Her new single is still cleaning up on the charts and now we finally get to hear what else she was saving up to do. This cd is a mix of Hip-hop, R+B, Jazz, and some 50's type of jazz music. The best songs here are: waste my time, hit em up stylee, til im gone, swingin, 10, 000 times, when i needed you, and blu is a mood. The song \\"swingin\\" is probably the most creative song on the album. It has the same vibe as \\"oops\\" but uses a 50's type jazz background mixed with hip-hop to make somethign different to what you hear all the time. If she had more songs like this I think I would give her 5 stars but 4 is good for now. If your into hip-hop/r+b and like hearing good singing?, then this cd is for you.tight!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Enough Credit!","review":"I loved this CD. It was great. There are a lot of great beats in here and shes a pretty good singer! I honestly don't think she gets enough credit for what she does.

Have fun! ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic R&B cadillac with \\"BLU\\" tinted windows.","review":"With so much neo-soul and explicit love songs being performed by the new guy/girl groups, and numerous proteges of established rappers shooting out raps and hip-hop tunes faster than Superman on Ex-lax, it was so refreshing to hear a CD that contained nothing but straight-up R&B, with no chaser. SO BLU is an example of what can be done when you're not trying to fall in with the \\"what's hot\\" catagory. Blu Cantrell's voice reminded me of Deborah Cox's on certain tunes, and while her vocals may not be as strong, her delivery carries her to where she need to be. Her slow songs are the best (heartbreak is her best feature), and the jazzy number(SWINGIN')had me bopping my head trying to learn the words and mimic her style. If you need a diversion from what has turned out to be the norm, then give Ms. Cantrell a try. Who knows, you just might like what you hear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice...","review":"Eventough I don't like R&B that much, but when I first heard \\"Hit Em Up Style\\" I knew I had to check this CD out. After a few listens this CD really grew on me. There are many uptempo and slow songs that are just great. I only own 3 R&B CD's (80+ rap CD's) but \\"So Blu\\" is my favorite \\"R&B\\" CD. If ya'll have not got this yet, GET IT because it's a very nice CD.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool","review":"So Blu is a cd I could play over and over again. It's very catchy and upbeat, and it doesn't get boring. Her voice is full of energy and it's so bubbly. My favorite song is 'Hit 'Em Up Style(Oops!'.) The other songs are great, too. 'So Blu' and 'Blu Is A Mood' are soft and pretty, and also have an upbeat feel to them. I didn't have to get used to this cd because I was hooked on it from the minute I put it in!

Though envious of a friend with an in-ground pond and waterfall, I did not want to dig up exsisting shrubs and perennials to satisfy my yen for water. Since I already grow vegetables, herbs, ornamental grasses and perennials in containers, I thought why not a water garden. This book showed me what I could do with one of my empty oak barrels. I had a lovely mini pond with running water. I added 3 fish, water plants, and bought some toad tadpoles from a nearby garden centre. I liked it so much I'm going to do some smaller containers as well as a couple of glazed pots with water lilys. The only thing is to overwinter water plants you need a small indoor aquarium with grow lights, or a helpful friend with a pond. Enjoy and experiment! P.S.

While I can buy the remoteness of Trail Stop, the idea that not one person owns a satellite phone? Two super-skilled military heroes, one of whom the heroine doesn't recognize as even really being masculine until mid-way through the book? But less believable than anything, hit men who conceive of and try to carry out such a high-profile act against an entire town? And throwing in a sympathetic hit man along they way?

Killing Time was so stupid, that I threw the book across the room when I was done with it and this one, I had to force myself to finish.The entire first few chapters in the book were nothing but a pity party for the main character. There is no real character developement in this book, it makes you kind of feel cheated in someway.I won't be buying another Linda Howard book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Linda Howard's Best","review":"Cate spends more time thinking about her dead husband than she does about Cal. It's hard to buy that A) he turns from a bumbling fool into a tough guy and B) she suddenly has a change of heart and falls for him. No chemistry between the two, and while you can develop some empathy for Cate, there's not any romance happening. Cal's personality is undeveloped and I certainly wasn't left with the feeling that I'd like to know more about these characters or that I got to know them at all. They could have been two people in a boring commercial.Story line was promising, but skip this one. I read many of Linda Howard's books over and over. This one will hit the donation box."},{"rating":"1","title":"He got trapped in its own snare","review":"First I'm going to write about the thrilling part - If it's one written in the book.

It was seeming to me to be a short story to which LH added many superfluous details. It was also getting irritating in the unrelated details:1. The \\"naughty\\" chair for her twins--plus, why didn't she have two?? The poor kids had to wait their turn.2. One hit man in a ridiculous sex scene with a pick-up named Kami that gets absurd in their threats to each other. What's the point in relation to the storyline??3. A multiple-paragraph description of the lighting in the B&B; hallway and two-sentence details about the strong flashlite Cal had (though this may be pertinent later, but still overly detailed).Plus, it's been so boring. My usual rule is that after 25-50 pages, if the book has nothing of interest, I'm done. I've persevered a bit longer because of being a big LH fan, but am grateful for the reviews here. Big relief that I have a library copy this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coulda been worse...","review":"There were things I really liked about Cover of Night. The characterization was sharp, the pacing was excellent, the motivations were logical, but somehow it failed to come together and engage me. It read like a book adaptation of a movie. I never invested in the emotional life of the characters, even as I respected their situation and the reactions they had to events. The major plot point required a massive suspension of disbelief. One thing I greatly appreciated was that the suspense was without horror elements. Too many romantic suspense books of late have relied heavily on graphic and almost sexual descriptions of violence, especially violence against children. Early in the book you learn the heroine has twin boys. Right away I'm bracing myself for yet another 'children in extreme peril' storyline. I should have trusted the author more. Worth a paperback purchase, certainly. As a hardcover I'd think twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another miss","review":"Tedious--too much \\"telling\\" and not much \\"showing\\" about pretty much everything, and big plot holes. A lot less exposition about Cate's worries about being a single mom and more about some of the other characters and plot developments would have gone a long way to making this a really good read. This isn't new for Linda Howard books, but strong leads (Diaz and Milla, \\"Cry No More\\") made up for it; not so this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would never have thought...","review":"I've been with Linda Howard since Sarah's Child and the MacKenzies. Even as she branched out and eventually switched over to suspense, I followed through Kill and Tell and All the Queen's Men. But here she seems to be faltering on the dividing line between fiction, suspense, and romance. The result? A boring tale of predictable mobsterish drama. You don't get attached to the heroine, and the hero seems to be a repeat of her last 7 archetypes. Though Cry No More moved me to tears with it's power and depth, Cover of Night had me yawning before page 20.

It went into WHY too many details about really stupid stuff and the plot made no sense what so ever. The book spends more time with the Villians than the main Charachters. The writing standard was WAY BELOW what Linda Howard is capable of writing. Very disappointed....................... :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly disappointing","review":"I have never been so disappointed in one of Linda Howard's books. The plot sounded like a good idea that she didn't quite know how to bring to life, and the ending was dry and completely without tension. The characters were lacking her usual vividness and I didn't really care about them; they were for the most part flat and undeveloped. The \\"kidnapping\\" of the town was contrived and unbelievable, the death of one of the protagonists went unexplained, and the romance was all but passionless. All in all it read like a contractual obligation rather than a storyline she really cared about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost Faith in Lida Howard","review":"What happened to Linda Howard??? This book is the last that I will read from her. She was my favorite writer until she wrote Cry No More. I thought she was having a bad book day so I forgave her for that garbage but each subsequent book has gotten WORST (which is hard to do). I am at the stage where I refuse to buy her books anymore. My advice to her is to take some time off before churning out any more garbage!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I've been a Linda Howard fan for years and she rarely disappoints, however, this was not up to her usual standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!","review":"I found this book to be very boring. I kept telling myself that the two characters would start to interact with each other but I felt nothing for them. Too much time was spent dwelling on Cate's past and thoughts. There wasn't any tension(sexual or otherwise) between Calvin or Cate. The plot was silly and unbelievalbe. I am giving this 2 stars because it is Linda Howard but she definitely needs to go back to her roots. Remember \\"After the Night\\", that's all I have to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted it to be wonderful, but it wasn't!","review":"Because I have been disappointed in Linda Howard's last few novels, I waited for this one to come out in paperback. Now I wish I would've waited to pick it up at a used book sale. Though I may be repeating what many of the other reviews here state, the plot was unbelievable, the characters not easy to relate to, and the ending much too abrupt. I miss the \\"old\\" Linda Howard stuff. Whatever happened to characters like the Mackenzies in A Game of Chance and Mackenzie's Mountain, and plots like those of Mr. Perfect and After the Night. Maybe it's time for some sequels of these well-established characters and interesting plot lines!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Awful!","review":"At first I couldn't believe I was reading a Linda Howard book. I kept checking the title page to be certain. The plot and characters were simply absurd. I really struggled to finish reading it. I kept hoping she would redeem herself somehow, but it was impossible once the silly plot by the bad guys was set in place. What was she thinking?When I first discovered Linda Howard, I purchased every book I could and loved them all, but her last few publications have been lackluster. This latest one has put me off so much, I may not purchase her work again. My favorite authors aren't brilliant every time, but this one is so bad I don't even want to donate it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing at best","review":"I'm not sure Linda Howard even wrote this book. I'm a huge Linda Howard fan and usually get her novels on the release date. Cover of night has a ridiculous plot, but that's not as offensive as the boring characters that go along with it. I'm so disappointed with this Linda Howard I'm actually returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it!","review":"Love Linda Howard, but I have to agree with others who found this plot not up to par. It makes absolutely no sense that the two \\"best\\" guys in this crime group, the two who always get the job done, would come to the decision to take a whole town hostage to accomplish their goal. Linda's had some weak plot elements in previous books, but they were wrapped up so well in other compelling story aspects that you could ignore it. Can't do it here. Very glad that I got this book from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"This book is a disappointment. Who is the handyman, the guide (why are they so good) Why did the mark leave the B& B through the window? Why did so many people have to die? Why block off the town?

I usually love this author but I want my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cover of Night","review":"Cover of Night by Linda Howard was full of action, romance and a bit of suspense. The story takes place in Idaho where Cate Nighingale ,a widow with twin boys is trying to make a home in a communitee after the death of her husband.She owns a B & B. One morning she notices one of guest has disappeared. As she checks his room she finds that everything is still there. A few days later Cate is surprised by the presence of two armed men in her home looking for the effects of her missing guest. Does Cate cooperate with these armed men?Her nightmare of survival with romance thrown in are just beginning when the town find themselves cut off from the rest of the world with no means of communication.Will Cate survive? Find out by reading Cover of Night. It is an enjoyable book filled with everything you are looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Let Down","review":"The plot seemed forced, contrived and just plain ridiculous. The beginning of the book focuses a lot on the twin boys, relying on the \\"cute factor\\" but then they just disappear for the rest of the book. Thin and unsuspenseful story line. Romantic relationship not up to par with other Linda Howard books. I feel cheated - was really looking forward to another satisfying LH book. Oh well, maybe next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good one by Ms. Howard","review":"I enjoyed this book...loved the locals outsmarting the bad guys. Wanted more romance with Neenah and the Major...ditto with Cate and Cal. Man, he was a patient guy!! Liked the intermingling threads of the story that included Goss and a possible serial killer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left me wanting more","review":"I didn't think that this book was as bad as all the reviews are saying, but it wasn't Howard's best either. Somewhere along the line, Linda Howard has gone from the best romance novelist to a mediocre mainstream writer. This book only had about 10 percent romance (which was fantastic) and 90% excessive description and suspense.The setting of the book was similar to WHITE OUT, a short story by Howard back in 1997 (a young widow in Idaho running an Inn)and Cal reminded me of John Medina from ALL THE QUEEN'S MEN, especially the way both of them loved a widow for years, before making a move (and lack of foreplay).No one writes a better hero than Howard. They are tough, sexy, and know what they want. Cal is no different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Believe the negative customer reviews","review":"I used to automatically buy the newest Linda Howard book, but since I've been very disappointed with her last several books, I read the Amazon customer reviews for this one first. I'm so glad I did. The reviews were so awful, I decided to get the book from the library instead of buying it. Good move on my part and a heartfelt thanks to the reviewers. 'Cover of Night' was so bad I had no interest in finishing it. I saved myself about $25 and that feeling of being ripped off by a former favorite writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same Linda Howard","review":"I have been reading Linda Howard Novels for years. I always looked forward to a new release by Ms. Howard and would gladly shell out the price for a hard cover. The last two releases left me disappointed to say the least. Cover of Night was just awful, the plot was way beyond realistic. Ms. Howard must have had enough typed to satisfy her editor or to fill up a specific number of pages because the book just ends with a very hurried explanation. The same can be said for her two books prior to this one. Needless to say Ms. Howard has lost a fan. Don't waste your money wait for your local library to obtain it if you have to read it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too boring for words","review":"I didn't remember ever reading this book and after the first few chapters I remembered why. So boring..no romance...no suspense...too many insignificant characters, etc., etc., Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful.","review":"The entire premise of the book is the sleepy little town with only one road in or out. Enter bad guys looking for something and when they don't get it they decide to close the town to anything incoming or outgoing. The ludicrous premise is only part of the problem. The dialogue is stilted, the characters are cartoons. You cannot possibly read this book and take the storyline seriously. A waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay book --","review":"I found this book to be merely ok.... I think Cate was a snob (she even says how in her past life she would have looked down on people who did menial labor). I did not have a clear picture of Mister Harris - he seemed so uninspired (grease/dirt stained clothes, shaggy hair) - he mumbled, blushed, ducked his head.... hard to picture him turning into a super-charged hero. I also find it hard to belive that Cate suddenly starts to notice him and within 2 days is in love with him. I really think the whole hiking incident was far-fetched and just added to the book so Cate and Cal can have sex with each other-- it did not seem to really fit into the book at all. they hike all the way up there and then have to turn back?? I did find the eyeball part at the end funny - I wonder if the woman Goss slept with was the eyeball killer - and if they will run into each other again.Generally I love to read LH books and think she is a GREAT author- - but this book is NOT one of her best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will the real Linda Howard please stand up?","review":"As promised the last time, I didn't buy this one - I got it from the library. And I'm glad I didn't waste my money. If I could have rated this under a 1 star, I would have.I'll be glad when Linda gets over whatever is making her write such dreadful books and goes back to the style that made me count the days until her next release."},{"rating":"1","title":"So very, very bad...","review":"Linda Howard, what happened????I've noticed a strange trend in the last few years, where romance plots are getting heavier on thriller/mystery content and the romance part is becoming an afterthought. I wish authors would remember that if we didn't want 300+ pages of a love story, we wouldn't be shopping in the romance section to begin with.This book was horrible. I guess it would have been okay if I had never heard of Linda Howard and didn't know what compelling love stories she could write. And if I had picked this up in a bargain bin somewhere, I guess...I'm taking Linda off my \\"buy as soon as it hits the shelves\\" list, although I still highly recommend Drop Dead Gorgeous and To Die For. The fact that those are the two most recent LH books after this one make the mediocrity of this last effort even more perplexing."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHO WROTE THIS BOOK????","review":"I AM SORRY, BUT I HAVE TO SAY THIS BOOK WAS A BIG LET DOWN. I AM A BIG FAN OF LINDA HOWARDS. I LOVED HER BOOKS LIKE \\"DREAM MAN\\" AND \\"AFTER THE NIGHT\\". THIS BOOK REALLY LACKED A GOOD STORY LINE. I MEAN HOLDING A WHOLE TOWN HOSTAGE???? I LOVED CATE AND CALVIN, BUT THEY REALLY SHOULD HAVE STARTED A ROMANCE WAY BEFORE THE BOOK WAS ALMOST OVER. AND THE END OF THE BOOK???? COME ON. LINDA CAN DO MUCH BETTER THAT THAT. I WILL CONTINUE TO TRY HER BOOKS HERE AND THERE EVEN THOUGH I DIDN'T LIKE THIS ONE, BECAUSE I DO KNOW FROM PRIOR READING, THAT SHE CAN DO MUCH BETTER."},{"rating":"1","title":"It should be called Cower in Shame","review":"Ms Howard is usually a dependable author but she really let her readers down with this one. It's OK to expect a reader to suspend disbelief every now & again but one would have to have a frontal lobotomy to buy what she is selling in this one. So disappointing, especially after her wonderful & hilarious \\"To Die For.\\" The trees (for paper) that gave up their lives for this book die for nothing this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great suspense; paramilitary guys; mountain climbing","review":"I thought the plot was a bit contrived, but LH is so damn good it's hard to complain. Except for the places where I thought 'please!' and rolled my eyes, I enjoyed it. The characters weren't as well-developed either as some of hers that I didn't really get into it.

I can't believe that this was written by her. I agree with the previous reviewer about how stupid the plot was. I was not interested to see how the plot unfolded. The romance here was barely explored. These tough guys in a dead end town secretly loving two women and waiting YEARS to even express any interest. Come on! This one needs a redo. Get it from the library if you have to read it, but this is not worth the shelf space to keep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this One","review":"This is a dull read. I was really disappointed. It has a lot of suspense but in order to get to it. You have to read halfway into the book. I mean towards the end. Which truly is the most suspenseful part of the book.

This issue was noticeable when I first attempted to load a roll of practice film into the reel, and was confirmed when I tried to develop a roll the next day. Ruined five frames out of 26.The other issue is the mounting mechanism/clamp which holds one end of the film to aid loading.

Many skills on the tape are achievable with practice for girls 6years and up. Tape could have been longer. World cup stars do make role models of themselves by not only teaching moves and backyard games but by relating thier growing up with soccer as kids and how it prepared them for higher competition. Tape uses kids what appears from 8-15 yrs old to show the beginning stages of learning moves. This might be the most benifitial aspect of the tape as taught moves are not mastered in a day. Tape does not emphasize the importance of warming up or stretching nor does it warn of the dangers of over training. All and all a great tape for a soccer coach to watch with his daughter.

In short, well down the list of great Tristans."},{"rating":"1","title":"A small voiced \\"Tristan\\" with unbalanced sound","review":"This recording is a major disappointment.

With recordings out there with Nilsson, Flagstad, Price, Vickers, Windgassen etc., why buy this version and lower one's standards?Flagtad is a magnificent Isolde. Nilsson is passionate and a true Wagnerian singer, Margaret Price is ethereal....buy theirs over this. They are much more reasonably priced too."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unworthy attempt","review":"This set is a huge disappointment. The 2 principal singers, Thomas Moser and Deborah Voigt, are in no way suitable for the parts, as they simply do not have the vocal size and emotional range for the music and the drama. Voigt, in particular, is a keen disappointment, as her high range isn't even free or shining, which is a must for the part of Isolde.I found Thielemann's conducting to be laborious and the orchestral performance doesn't move me at all. The quality of the recording is ok, but the interpretation fails quite miserably.I don't think this is a worthy recording of Wagner's great opera."},{"rating":"1","title":"A non-event","review":"What a pity, this waste of resources - and at a time when the recording companies find themselves on the verge of banishment.

The problems begin and end with the two leads, if they can be called that, but especially with the Isolde - who is NO Isolde. A pretender, yes. Listen to the vocal prowess and intelligence of Flagstad and Nilsson and you will at once realize why this Deborah Voigt is a blank space somewhere to the left of zero. The word is STUPID. The less said about the other pretender, Thomas Moser, the better. And Thielemann - he is no Karajan either. What a pity they didn't assign Isolde to Cheryl Studer - now THAT would have been something to cherish. Too bad the scene lacks a worthy Tristan at the moment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor, Unintelligent, Unnecessary : Disregard","review":"The only thing that may cause this set to be noticed is that it is Obese with Ennui.

I loved it because it is a very different love story, a story of a love that could never take place, and still, it did... The story line is simple, well developed, enigmatic and very different, in one word... BRILLIANTThis is a fantastic book, with magical but very realistic characters, sometimes loving, other times very cruel, and at all times very human.It tells the story of Sierva Maria, poor little rich girl... she never felt the love of her parents, was raised by her African servants, got bitten by a dog with rabies, and was believed to be possesed by demons.I must warn you, this is not your happily ever after story, but it is definetly well worth your time.

There's good reason - at times, the English version of the Spanish text feels like a moderately-paced plot synopsis, at others like a stack of stage directions. Surely Marquez's prose is more poetic than that.On is own merits, the book never seems to establish the right pace. Issues concerning the Marquis, Sirva Maria, and her mother (as well as other characters) are brought up vaguely and left inadequately explored. Perhaps this book would have benefited from a fleshing out of the characters and themes Marquez wanted to explore.The idea of love as a demon (especially when set against the backdrop of Spanish religious draconiansm and cruel colonialism) is compelling, but these kinds of single-metaphor investments are always a liability for onerous anticlimax.

For example, in the JSP section (chapter 12), in trying to explain expression language, functions, etc, they kept referring to taglibs, tld's, etc, as though the reader should have a firm grip on these things. But they're not discussed until chapter 15 - Custom Tags. This was just the last straw which prompted my to write this review. But the book is full of this stuff. Also, there's no explanation anywhere of the syntax of the descriptor files such as web.xml. They simply tell you how to use deploytool to set it all up.

First time through I was caught up in the action, bizarre and rational. It held my attention until the end, and what an end, quite in keeping with the author's view of war and the sacrifices it demands of those involved. Third time through, I'll probably get more of the characters, although even in the beginning, they were usually detailed, except for those who came and went before anyone even caught their names."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last 2 test kits seem to be expired","review":"I still have some of my original test kit left, which has white powder and gives an expected iron reading.The last 2 iron test kits I puchased on Amazon have yellowed powder and read zero at every test."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"I was disappointed with this book.

The fact that it was on the cheaper side made me like it even more.On the first trip I used it - only setting it up caused several holes in the fabric.The fabric is real thin and delicate it is only single layer and it is far from being durable - something we all expect from camping equipment.Unfortunately for me this was a stormy night and the whole tent kept trembling and flapping - Might be suitable for summer camping on a beach (soft surface)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as durable as my other Bosch products","review":"I am a remodeling contractor and have used Bosch for over 10 yrs. I've been (at least) satisfied, and mostly very happy, with every tool (I own about 8). I have a couple of tools on the 14.4 volt platform so I purchased the flashlight about 6 months ago.I have not broken it, but the flashlight seems flimsy in your hand without the battery. The switch works well. The swivel head is somewhat useful but difficult to aim. The light is fairly bright, but in the first 3 months I burned out both bulbs that came with it. It would be useful if the light could be focused from spot to flood.For me, the measure of a good tool really comes down to whether or not you find yourself reaching for it when you need it. Although I find that it still gets dark here on a daily basis, I set this one aside about 3 months ago. I am considering the DeWalt fluorescent worklight. I really wish Bosch would add a tough, bright fluorescent to the offering. I'd try that in a heartbeat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cuthbert Grant of Grant's Town","review":"Not a source for research, it reads like a novel not a work of nonfiction"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT ARE THE EPISODES IN THIS SET??","review":"Can someone who owns this set, please list the episodes for us, so that we can see if these episodes can be found on other Ozzie and Harriet sets?

They are indeed top-notch, but the excellent choral singing and soloists are not sufficient to redeem this performance. The pace is funereally slow, so slow that it does indeed increase the dramatic tension, but not in a manner that adds to the performance. In fact, I became tense to the point of irritability trudging through this marathon! This most magnificent of symphonies should uplift the spirit and make the hair on the back of your neck stand up! It should not irritate or bore the listener. For the best Ninth, try Bernstein, Karajan (1976) or Solti's version instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...is this Beethoven's Ninth?","review":"I LOVE Beethoven's Ninth and have heard many recordings of it. This recording is just plain boring to my ears, although it does have spiritual qualities rarely heard under the baton of other conductors. Yes, the soloists are wonderful(especially Domingo), but the dry choruses and the dreadfully SLOW tempo just ruin this performance. When the finale was over, I almost fell asleep and eventually sold this CD to a used CD store. You don't even want to hear my opinion about how disasterous the slow movement sounds. Bohm was a fine Mozart conductor, but he doesn't build momentum and energy when it comes to Beethoven. For the orchestral parts of this symphony, you will enjoy Karajan's sublime 1977 recording with the BPO, and for the finale, Solti's 1972 recording with Stuart Burrows sounds magnificent. Both of those recordings leave you with a sense of passion and fervor I don't feel with Bohm's recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST SERVICE I HAVE EVER HAD!!!!!","review":"DO NOT LET THEM FOOL YOU!

There are some great Jimmy Rushing tracks and some mellow blues instrumentals, but the band still swung like only they could. Any Basie fan won't be disappointed.Just a quick update.

However, the ceramic pieces sit much higher in the spinner than the paper would - meanwhile the \\"splash shield\\" sits at the same height, leaving zero protection against the spraying paint. Also, the paint provided is in MUCH smaller and less user-friendly bottles than the paint spinner bottles. The ceramics supplied are cheap - to be expected - but VERY cheap, and the square plates which are supposed to be hung with a ribbon through pre-cut holes do not have holes. It comes with four square plates and four very small circular plates and then - it's done.Stick with the original paint spinner and order some refills.

I have waited three years for the new album, and I was not disappointed. She really delivers with a selection of truly diverse songs. The only thing missing is more of the ballads and dance tracks for which she has an amazing talent. The album targets a more R&B, soul, and hip hop audience than the last, which is why I gave it four stars, but fans will not be disappointed. Of course the stand out songs are the two amazing dance tracks, Things Just Ain't the Same, and Nobody's Supposed to be Here, which just kick you in the teeth with the power. And the two ballads that really make you weep are Coudn't We, and One Day You Will. Particularly One Day You Will. That song is so powerful, and so very true. All in all, I think we have much to look forward to in the way of singles being remixed into dance smash hits. Deborah Cox really delivers one her sophmore album. I highly recommend this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of R&B's best kept secrets.","review":"I do agree with another reviewer that Canadian native Deborah Cox is one of R&B's most underrated singers. I was extremely dissapointed and angry at Clive Davis for underpromoting her (he even dropped her from his label J Records!) when she actually has a better voice than labelmate Whitney Houston. \\"One Wish\\" is a great contemporary R&B album featuring some Hip Hop (\\"One Wish\\" featuring Snoop Dogg), Jazz (\\"I Won't Give Up\\"), Adult Contemporary (\\"One Day You Will\\") and straight R&B (\\"Nobody's Supposed To Be Here\\"--originally written for Patti LaBelle). Her voice is phenominal. She can softly whisper like Mariah but also belt out like Celine. A lot of the songs have potential hit. Another favorite of mine is the mild Urban hit \\"We Can't Be Friends\\" featuring Next group (also an underrated R&B act) member R.L. Overall if you liked Deborah's radio hits I strongly reccomend this album. I really think it's her best. Overall grade: B+"},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Disappointing","review":"I bought this CD after falling in love with \\"Nobody's Supposed to Be Here\\". But that was a mistake - it's the only good song on the CD. Deborah's voice seems not-so-strong on other songs, and I miss more upbeat songs like \\"Who Do You Love\\" from her freshman album. If you like mediocre ballads, then I guess this is the album for you. I don't know what she's got going on with R.L., but I definitely could've done without hearing him on every track. Tamia is a MUCH better investments if you're into ballad type songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deborah Cox misses the mark again!","review":"Although she deserves props for being a successful Canadian artist...quite honestly this CD is just as sleep provoking as Brandy's never say never, which I wish I never bought....

I had never sat down with the entire project before. I am overwhelmed. Deborah Cox has a very powerful and beautiful voice. The arrangements are really nice -- they could be better, but for contemporary R&B;, they are good. Her voice is what makes the album. She is one of the best r&b; voices since the 90s. I just cant think of another singer since the 80s who is this good. Keep up the good work!!!Why on earth does she not get more attnention in the USA? Beyonce and Usher???!!! What is wrong with the US music industry?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST album of the millenium!!","review":"This album is over a year old now, and it still hasn't left my CD player.

Of Course Deborah's \\"Nobody's Supposed To Be Here\\" is the backbone to this album. Deborah, who has not been carefull with her choices of singles, has ignored the more powerful ballads, which are surefire hits. Like \\"Couldn't We\\" and \\"I won't Give up\\" as well as \\"One Day You WIll\\". The title track is also a surefire hit.Her next single, \\"September\\" is sure to do damage on the pop charts.Egerly awaiting her third albuM!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"just ok","review":"It reminds me of Angela Bofill, who sounded great when she sang at low volumes, then the song went into the dumper when she went too far over the top.

DG's mike placement and mixing leave a lot to be desired, but most of all, what bothers me is the matter-of-fact performance of these two symphonies, which are some of the most beautiful music that Dvorak has ever written. I was also bothered by some of the poor intonation on part of the cellos & bases (too sharp!!!), second clarinet (in soft sustained chords - sharp!!! - sticking out like a sore thumb, despite the poor recorded sound). All in all, not a very good performance, though the 8th fared somewhat better than the 9th, which is not saying much!

For example my version states: track 1: 9.53, 2: 11.05, 5: 11.44I find the recording lacking in recording quality (noticable hiss, very flat) as well as performance quality (again flat). Again this might be another version then presented here.Update:If you look closely at the picture shown, it shows: 'Wiener Philharmoniker', the titles for the samples however state: 'Vienna Philharmoniker'.So it's a mistake by Amazon.

Once in a while, it is evident that some of the concepts are antiquated or the sentences run on. Over all, the ideas presented are still very helpful.The main thing I got from the book was that when you are overly upset by something in your current life, you should look back to the root cause and remember why you are super sensitive to it. You will find something in your childhood that predisposed you to being annoyed with this issue. And that you shouldn't immediately dismiss it as something that was in the past. You should remember the situation(s) and acknowledge the pain that you had then. And connect the pain to that childhood frustration. And that would help you grow and be less angry and hurt in the present."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Begining","review":"This book was a start for me. A beginning that I thought I would never find my way to. I saw clearly, both of my parents narcissistic needs. There was no mistaking it.

Instead I got heavy handed criticism of \\"mothers\\" who warp their children through thier own selfish motivations. Some people may have parents who were intentionally cruel, but mine were just sad, depressed and inept. I spent so much effort defending them from this author's wrath, and perhaps anger at her own mother, that if there was any insight in this book about on how I might change my patterns of behavior I couldn't see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated and irrelevant","review":"I was very disappointed with this work. If you still subscribe to Freud's outdated theories, then this may be for you. Otherwise, you're better off reading works by newer researchers in the area of psychiatry/psychology. Im particular, I tend to respect those who combine elements of the cognitive, biological, learned behaviour, and psychoanalytic theories in their works.This book does little more than blame one's mother for the gamut of problems a human being goes through during life.

The first sentence reads:'Experience has taught us that we have only one enduring weapon in our struggle against mental illness: the emotional discovery and emotional acceptance of the truth in the individual and unique history of our childhood.'Experience has taught us nothing of the sort. This is pernicious nonsense masquerading as a declarative sentence.This sort of stuff should stay in student flats, where it can do no damage, other than to the critical faculties of cosseted and credulous middle-class children.

This is not a self help book with pointers, nor is it an easy read. Some people who read it and call it outdated or fluff, I feel sad for them that they could not see the wisdom in finding out who one really is inside.The book itself does not point you in a direction... is frees your mind to realize the direction you came from.

I think about it as much as any other piece of classical music that may enter and linger in my mind from time to time. The music flows twisting in its emotions and swirling concord, dancing like ghosts with changing disposition.

It is not the style I expected and in fact, it is exactly the opposite. I felt like I was listening to a very good young musician, very good techniques but no emotions.

Definitely try the Grumiaux version, Oitrakh or Heifetz. Personnaly i like the power and fantastic sound deployed by Oitrakh's violin in all his records, certainly the most impressive: this man had an incredible force in his arm to play so nicely and he is unique. Heifetz is different and in the fourth and fifth concerto, so emotional that you listen the records everyday with the same admiration and emotion. Then you realize why Mozart was unique, and also why he deserves that artists make the effort at least to be lively like his music was and not monotone.

Scott and the New York Times movie review crew. However, this book disappoints in several ways:1) The movies are heavily skewed towards those released in the last 10 years. The more recent a movie, the less likely I am to have \\"almost forgotten\\" it. Sure, Metropolis is in here, but very few other movies until the 1990s. What I'm looking for in a book of this title is more older movies that I am more likely to never have heard fo.2) Some of the recommended movies are pretty questionable, in my book. I understand there is bound to be difference of opinion, but I doubt that flicks like \\"Drumline\\", and \\"Freddy got Fingered\\", rank amoung the best movies I've never seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indie Film Minute","review":"We produce a radio feature [...] that recommends great indie, documentary, and foreign films to rent.

I was satisfied with the book as it fulfilled my modest objectives. However, for most dentists, the procedures presented here are those that are likely practiced daily in a general dentist office.Therefore, this is not a book for general dentists. It is a good book for dental students, for those studying to pass their dental boards, or for the specialist who desires knowlege of general operative techniques.It is not a book to learn advanced operative dental techniques.This is the 2006 edition, so it is already 3 years old.

Jubal Sackett is loved and trusted by all except the villains, who themselves have absolutely no redeeming qualities at all.

Louis is arguably the best Western novelist there is. Of his works the Sackett stories have always been my favorites. Of these I love the first books. I can get more into the early frontiersmen books than any others. Just like cowboys of today feel they \\"should've been born a hundred years ago\\". I can imagine the cowboys of a hundred years ago felt the same. To be the first white man to see a new land, a land empty of anything but its native inhabitants. Some of which are friendly some of which are definitly not. To explore these unknown places for the first time would be an enormous priviledge from God. That is what this book is all about. I can not count the number of times I have read it and I enjoy it just as much every time. This is quite possibly my favorite book of all time.

Cristina's vocals are probably the worst I've heard in any other LC album. Most of the time it just sounds like she wants to get the damn CD over with. The lyrics are ridiculous in some spots, such as when Cristina sings the line \\"I'm a loser\\" five monontonous times, and just the overall album doesn't vary much at all. All the songs sound alike. This album let me down."},{"rating":"2","title":"My First Lacuna Coil Album...","review":"Before I bought this album I had been a fan of The Gathering, Theatre of Tragedy and a few other similar bands for a while. I then heard from a friend that he thought Cristina Scabbia had the most enticing voice ever, so I listened to a couple of tracks from the album and bought it instantly. I don't regret this purchase, either, although I didn't fall instantly in love with it. Some of the tracks, like \\"Heir of a Dying Day\\", \\"Purify\\", and \\"Cold Heritage\\" make use of Cristina's voice and heartrending, depressing lyrics that go well with the light but gothic feel of the song. Some of the songs (like \\"Heir of the Dying Day\\") had a good mix of male/female vocals, but there were one or two tracks where the male vocalist's gruffness and sometimes downright screaming took away from the music. I think the music relies too heavily on Cristina's voice, as beautiful as it is, and just wouldn't stand on its own without her."},{"rating":"2","title":"slightly better than in a reverie","review":"Lacuna Coil just get better and better.

Well their's a good chance it's Heaven's a Lie by Lacuna Coil, from their album Comalies.So why am I reviewing Unleashed Memories? Why not, if you buy any Lacuna Coil album, you can't lose. They're all five star.Lacuna Coil is one of the few bands around that don't / can't improve on each new album. All their albums are superlative.Lacuna Coil's mainstay is a lovely exceptional singer named Cristina Scabbia. She is joined in the singing duties by the clean male vocals of Andrea Ferro. Their music, which has been classified as Gothic Metal, actually has a slight progressive edge to it.This band which hails from Florence Italy is in a class by itself and that includes Evanescence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible music!","review":"I am not an expert in music, but all I can say is that disc is beautiful, heavy, melodic, sophisticated hard rock music. It's hard to compare, but I can think of Korn \\"Untouchables\\" disc. Of course, Evanescence comes to mind, but Lacuna Coil is much more sophisticated musically. The voice of Cristina Scabbia is super powerful and smooth as the same time. This album compares with \\"Comalies\\" as their best. If you like heavy, emotional, metal music, but with a beautiful female voice as lead, you will like \\"Unleashed Memories.\\" To me they are the best around now. Just for reference, I also like Disturbed, Korn, Tool, Offspring, Godsmack, and some Linkin Park--but the female voice makes Lacuna Coil a genre of their own."},{"rating":"1","title":"very very disappointing","review":"i heard of lacuna coil through the grapevine, and came here to read the reviews from other listeners. most seemed to rave about the album, so i picked it up. man oh man, i wish now i never listened to you knuckleheads. this album is nothing like i expected, and it's very bad. the songs are slow, boring, and unexperimental. they all sound the same. they have no heavy side to them.

So I went out and bought the CD \\"Unleashed Memories.\\" Since then, I've been extremely unwilling to listen to anything else.I absolutely love Lacuna Coil's music. Cristina Scabbia's vocals make me think of the voice of a dark angel. The male vocals of Andrea Ferro are a decent complement to Cristina's, but it is Cristina's voice that has captured my attention and adoration. As a musical whole, Lacuna Coil has exceeded my expectations. Cristina's and Andrea's voices mesh very well together and with the guitars, bass, and drums.A lot of people call their style of music \\"gothic metal.\\" I say, \\"Who cares what it's called; this is simply the most beautiful thing I've have ever heard!\\" In other words, buy this CD.

I have to use the extension and fold part of it up.If you move around (like walking) the buds (I only got 2 sets, not 3) slip right out of your ears. Maybe my ears are too small? It's annoying. The buds stay in if I sit on the bus not moving around.The reason I gave 2 stars and not 1 is because once the buds are not falling out, the sound is pretty decent.

The Republic of Tea is too rich for my blood, but someone gave me a canister as a gift, so once a week, I indulge.The taste is more delicate than what I'm used to and the coloring is lighter. The smell from the orange blossoms is strong enough to be relaxing while you wait for your tea to cool, though the flavor is minimal, in keeping with the delicacy of the tea. On a health note, research indicates that citric acid, as found in citrus fruits like lemons and oranges, is one of the most effective common additives to tea to increase the absorption rate of the plentiful antioxidants that tea contains.

It is comprehensive and includes many neat vittles of information about many popular shows. It is helpful for someone trying to learn about TV and society at the time, or one who may not be familiar with the shows in question.For TV buffs, the information provided may not be new. Moreover, the book is replete with misinformation and inaccuracies, sometimes causing one to wonder if the author has ever actually SEEN some of the shows. The years of broadcast are often off by a year or two, character descriptions are erroneous, and the descriptions are sometimes just odd. I mean, even a casual fan of Bewitched knows that Tabitha had witch powers, but her brother Adam did not.

Just as well, because the scent is gone by morning in any case. My recent-model Jaguar has fine leather seating with the scent just now beginning to fade. So I was looking for a product to restore the interior's presence. Lane's Leather Scent in no way meets that need. I've no idea why Amazon offers it for sale here.

He must take 12 murderous convicts out of the military prison and train them for a suicide mission in France. If any of them come back, they get pardoned. Some bad language, but it's easy to remember where it is once you've watched it, so you can mute it out if you don't want to hear it. Also stars Charles Bronson as Joseph Wladislaw. He is very good in his part. Ernest Borgnine and Robert Ryan also star as Army Generals. Once the mission starts, you are biting your nails the whole time!

Definitely recommended if you like that kind of stuff.Some reviewers have commented that this movie is making a point about the violence of war, but I don't buy it. You can't make 2 hours of frat-boy war movie then switch gears in the last 30 minutes and claim to be making a profound observation about brutality. There are plenty of good war movies that do have something to say -- Patton, Black Hawk Down, Das Boot, Apocalypse Now, Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers, and Generation Kill come to mind. The Dirty Dozen does not belong on that list."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great cast, but nothing more. Am I missing something here?","review":"After decades of high expectations, I finally saw THE DIRTY DOZEN for the first time on Cinemax and was very disappointed.The film, while offering an impressive all-star cast to rival THE LONGEST DAY, was more farcical than action-packed, more silly than dramatic and in the end, not very well acted, either. It was almost like watching a two-hour movie of HOGAN'S HEROES or F-TROOP.Some have called this \\"a real man's action movie\\". Am I the only one who noticed that Lee Marvin's character acts effeminately gay throughout most of the first half of the movie???In the end, I think the only good memory I will have of THE DIRTY DOZEN is Tom Hanks' reference to it in SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE when he and his brother in-law sarcastically recall the climax like two weepy women.\\"Of course, I cried at the end of The Dirty Dozen.\\"\\"Well, who didn't.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"New DVD is incredible","review":"2 stars refers to the OLD editions of the DVD (the first from MGM in 1998; the second and third from Warner in 2000 and 2005, respectively)The new DVD gets FIVE STARS, Finally!

The transformation of malcontents into a deadly team is inspiring and at times comedic. From the intensity of their training to the final showdown with the Nazis (and the brutal method used to accomplish their mission), this movie delivers everything you could want in an action picture. This movie is worthy of repeat viewings (I have watched it twice since I purchased the DVD a week ago).

It details the efforts of condemned men (to either hanging or lengthy jail terms) to train and carry-out a secret mission just prior to D-Day, along with their commander--himself a maverick U.S. army officer. The movie gets 4 stars, lots of action, interesting plot, and just a fun movie. However, the book gets 5 stars. The book not only goes into more detail, but a few of the characters are significantly changed and are more believable and much less maniacal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still \\"Dirty\\" After All These Years","review":"No matter how many times you see it, director Robert Aldrich's \\"The Dirty Dozen\\" (1967) never fails to disappoint with plenty of slam-bang action and offbeat characterizations.

Aldrich builds the wartime suicide mission to an explosive, bullet-riddled climax - masterfully edited by Michael Luciano. Endlessly imitated, but never surpassed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"Always wanted this in DVD and I was not disapointed. The actors all did a great job and having real WWII servicemen as actors, (Marvin, Borgine, Ryan etc.) really made the movie a bit more real for me, being a combat veteran, 100% combat wounded, myself. They don't make them this quality anymore.

It has a great roster of '60's macho film stars, and gives them plenty of rope in creating a series of wonderfully entertaining anti-authoritarian scenes before the final orgy of violence where they wipe out a castle full of Nazis. John Cassavetes, Donald Sutherland and Robert Ryan stand out for me, because of the great character work.

The time period was WWII, when social /racial divides were set apart long enough to win a World War against an even greater enemy. Outstanding performances from Lee Marvin, Charles Bronson, and Jim Brown and heck, everyone else!

I just wish that Warner Brothers would have done the same kind of restoration job with their Blu-Ray release of 'The Dirty Dozen' that 20th Century Fox did with their Blu-Ray release of 'Patton'. 'Patton' in Blu-Ray looks and sounds better than it ever did in the theater, while The Dirty Dozen looks like it needs a few more trips through the 'Biz Bag'.

This book is rather a political book against Ethiopians reflecting an Eritrean's(with hatred toward Ethiopia) point of view. Her Eritrean buddy also mentions in the book, \\"the only thing he likes about Ethiopia is the money\\". I wish the book focus more on her travel experience than trying to generalize things. Any one who really wants to find the truth about Ethiopia, may I suggest you read this book, A GUIDE TO ETHIOPIA by Philip Briggs which has a very balanced view about Ethiopia.

What makes things even worse is when the heroine finds out all about it in a really long sob letter he has written to her, but kept in his desk. The guy was just too weak to care about.

However, once I started getting into the book, it actually became a joy to read as Sacks poured his enthusiasm and wonder about the world of the deaf onto every page. I was soon finished and looking forward to the paper I was required to write on the book. However, as noted in many other comments, the long footnotes were incredibly distracting, many of them turning over for three pages, after which it was necesaary to go back and re-read everything you'd just finished looking at in the main article. His repetition at the beginning and end of the book also got annoying. On the whole, though, I quite enjoyed Oliver Sacks' book and am interested in reading more of his works now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite","review":"I loved some of his other books like \\"The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat\\" and his autobiography so this was a dissappointment.

I hoped this book would provide narrative descriptions of great vacations possibilities with my dog, but, apart from a section on \\"Dog Camps\\", was only another (and not very good) listing of accommodations that accept dogs. For that, the AAA Book is better. How about a book that features the BEST places that cater to dogs and their owners (e.g. with special pet services, doggy 'day care', dog runs) rather than just tolerate them. I'd love a book with 50 or 100 great places that cater, with descriptions and reviews, rather than another list of places that accept dogs. Besides this, its just poorly printed.

Few in sealed containers","review":"The actual apricots are quite good despite an occasional apricot pit not being removed. Yes these apricots are untreated and brown in color!Basically the only problem is the packaging of the product is flimsy and the lids do not secure well. Beneath the lid is a very delicate seal, usually slightly raised with air. Secondly the individuals containers are placed into a divided cardboard box which is slightly too small. This is how I've never received a box that didn't have ruptured seals. My 1st box arrived with 2 of 6 seals ruptured, the free 2nd box arrived with 4 of 6 ruptured. For all my hassle, I only ended up with exactly what I paid for, no more and no less.That being said, I still rate 4 out of 5 stars because I did eventually get what I paid for, and I do appreciate organic at this price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindly ignore previous reviews!","review":"These are quite tasty and are just as good as other organic unsulfured apricots that I've tried.At a fraction of the price!Perhaps those reviews were relevant in 2007, but they aren't now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"Very disappointed,it taste horrible.I will stay with Trader Joe's unsulfured dried apricots, even it is non organic, but it taste much better than this(Klein's Naturals Organic Apricots)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make sure you like organic apricots","review":"I am sure this is completely my fault.

I didn't get a lot out of the book, probably because it is short and because I've already been hearing and thinking a lot about the true self/false self and self-awareness issues for a while now. The book reminded me to spend more time meditating on gospel stories and to not take myself too seriously, but it didn't expose me to anything that I hadn't already been thinking about a lot.

I started out very interested since the premise pulled me right in. A house in Scotland that \\"just appeared\\" in 1939? Whomever approaches it dissapears? Who wouldn't be hooked in. When I read it though, the house was not mentioned until halfway through the book, there were so many loose ends (What happens with the young girl? Did they all die? To top that off, it read like a first draft. I half-expected to see scribbled notes in the margins and I didn't feel anything but nearly pushed through the book. It felt hurried, forced and lacked any life. No spark, no nothing. It was supposed to be terror filled, a *horror* novel, and I felt zilch, nothin'. Save your money and skip this novel. It is not worth it in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choppy and in need of a good editor","review":"Previous reviewers have already outlined the plot of this novel, so I won't go over it again. Suffice to say that the story is distractingly difficult to follow because of a choppy plot development style and the truly annoying overuse of ellipses and em-dashes. Eliminating superfluous punctuation would have vastly improved this effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"what, where, who, what??????/","review":"This \\"novel' is all over the place. Frankly, I'm shocked that it got published at all. Elaine is its only plausible character. The rest is just a kind of schzophrenic nightmare. The \\"house\\" itself doesn't appear until you're too tired to care and the jumping from one disjointed scene to the next is just exhausting. One of the most distinguishing features of great literature is that the reader is ALWAYS drawn into a compelling storyline. Whether it's \\"The invisible Man\\" or, say, \\"Dracula,\\" the story and its characters successfully build on one another. The reader is drawn into the writer's imaginary world and carried away. I don't ever want to feel outside a piece of literature. I want to feel a part of the setting: the sounds, the light, the drama."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical Coupland and very very good","review":"Just finished an advance reading copy of Eleanor Rigby. It's very good. It has that feeling of hope in a bland world that seems to have been the theme for the last.. well all of his books. That things needs to change and that it may not be such a terrible thing. They all seem to take place in Vancouver, a place I'm afraid to visit, because what if it's not this sunny sky'ed Ikea Vision of the way scandinavia would have been if we had a better language and weather..I realise that this might be my own very personal interpretation of Couplands writing, but never mind, the book is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Quite Sure What The Author Had In Mind...","review":"Okay, if you're an avid reader you've probably read many books about lonely people, how they cope, and how they inevitably find peace of mind, contentment, true love,death,etc etc. Basically, this author takes all those plot twists and incorporates them in a very crazy fashion throughout. Many of these twists were quite a stretch - I couldn't quite understand if he wanted this book to be humorous, or just plain strange. Another problem - he writes in first person narrative as the female main character, and many of her mannerisms and ideas just didn't ring true. I have found VERY few male authors who can write well in female first person narrative - and it definitely does not fly here. I'll accept previous reviewers' testaments that this author is a better writer than this book portends - but I'll find it difficult to pick up another one of his book's in th future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made me think about what it means to be lonely","review":"This book moved me - it was one of those books that sticks with you long after you finish it. I love Coupland's other books, but I think this one definitely is the most moving.Shows how life's decisions can intertwine and have lasting effects for years and years. And artfully conveys the human experiences that we all share.Melancholy but hopeful - it's sort of an experiential book - writing a plot synopsis doesn't really convey the emotion that it can bring out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Something....","review":"I enjoy most of Coupland's writing for it's subtle (sometimes not subtle) analysis of contemporary society and culture. I felt this book was devoid of any real substance - other than a few critical parts on \\"loneliness\\", most of the book I found to be rather uninteresting and mediocre at best. At times I felt like Coupland was trying too hard with some of the plot twists and character motivations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlovable loser makes an unbelievable u-turn","review":"This is my first Coupland book, and based on it, I may not pick up another one.The main character, Liz, is the human equivalent of a potted plant. She lives a life of loneliness and quite frankly, relishes it. All of a sudden, she gets reunited with the son she had in high-school, product of a one-night stand on her class trip to Rome. Mind you, this was her first and only sexual encounter. Her son is the picture of beauty, such a gentle soul, despite having been molested in every single foster home he lived in.So as not to ruin the plot for some of you, who may want to adventure into it, suffice to say the ending was terribly unplausible from the moment she gets contacted by the Austrian police."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Coupland","review":"\\"All the lonely people...\\" is the line behind this Beatles titled novel by Douglas Coupland. Liz Dunn is a lonely, overweight, and seemingly non-descript woman to whom rather extraordinary things happen. Her story, told with Coupland's style of post-modern funk, is pretty unbelievable; however, it is one that takes readers on a wild ride across the continent and back again.Within the novel, we meet Liz's long lost son, her seemingly average family and co-workers, and her European one night stand. The story is rather mundane, but I give it 4 stars for Coupland's succinct and thought provoking ideas on loneliness. This novel is no Microserfs or Hey Nostradamus! but it's an interesting tale of life, loss, erratic behavior, and ultimately, isolation. This is a good novel for an afternoon on the couch, for certain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lonliness and redemption","review":"I went through a real phase of reading nearly everything Douglas Coupland wrote a few years back and this is one of his better books. The story centres around the life of a lonely woman who hasn't met mr right or even mr you'll do yet. Her days are spent at work and she returns home to her lonely apartment for evenings with the television and her cat. Needless to say things change for her and life becomes more complex but i don't want to spoil it for you. What i like about Douglas Coupland's books is that he sees the ugliness of modern life but allows for the possibility of hope, redemption and a sort of happy ending. He is almost spiritual in a way although not in a bible bashing sense. If you enjoy stories about lives changed and hope for meaning in life then i strongly recommend Douglas Coupland, this book is a good start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eleanor Rigby","review":"In Douglas Coupland's Eleanor Rigby we meet Liz Dunn, a lonely woman with nothing but an ordinary lo-fi life to look forward to each day. Single, older, and overweight, she divides her time between work and her bland condo until one evening she gets a call from a hospital telling her that a Jeremy, a child she put up for adoption when she was a teenager, needs her help. With the amazingly free-spirited and yet very sick Jeremy, Liz learns how to live.Coupland is by far one of my favorite authors so I may be biased in saying that this an amazing book. A huge population of American women today can identify with Liz Dunn, including myself. Her loneliness is palpable and her connection with Jeremy is magical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for AS adults who are mid-career.","review":"This book is excellent and very useful for adults with AS or professionals who work with them. I did not find it very helpful, however, for young adults who are just beginning to enter work. This book would be much more useful for adults who are already employed or have been employed for extended periods. For those people, I believe this book is excellent, helpful, easy to work through, and well-written. But if you are looking for something to help an adolescent or young adult with AS, this may contain a few tips, but it probably won't be very helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good book for those with Asperger's","review":"If you are someone who is, or know someone who is, suffering from Asperger's and you want to develop (better) job skills this is the book for you. The author has Asperger's, as is obvious from the structure, detail, and methodical nature of the book. Lots of forms - LOTS of forms. The book is designed to help the Asperger's person, their family, or a professional prepare for finding the Asperger's person the right job, get them through the interpersonal issues involved in interviewing, and deal with the demands of the job. The personal experiences of the author help color his presentation of the material and help illustrate for the reader that these things can be accomplished and the Asperger's person can thrive in the work environment with the right preparation and planning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Workbook for a Young Adult","review":"I thought this would be a workbook to help get and keep a job. Instead it is more of a self journey. Not a bad thing for someone to do, but not what is needed when the person with AS is prone to sabatoging her efforts without realizing it. It would have been nice to have had some assistance in getting the first couple jobs in life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another contender for the no star award...","review":"There was a time when I loved Chris Claremont's stuff.

Because this interminable, derivative crapfest, as written by Claremont, shows that he's ready to retire. He's obviously out of fresh ideas. Hell, he's ripping his own old stuff off, and badly! And I agree with the other reviewer about Igor Kordey. He should be arrested for gratuitous abuses with a pencil. His illustrations look like he took art lessons at the Braille school. They're not even illustrations, or drawing, even. \\"Pick-choors\\" maybe, if you're from Alabama (no offense, go Tide!)How can someone who gave the X-men his best care so little about them now.

I also felt that some of the statements made by her associates seemed to be presented in a jaded fashion.

It is a wonderful, lucid relating of the six paramitas and is a highly-practical aid to Buddhist practice no matter what is one level or school. By habit, born out of negative experiences with tracts from other religions, I am skeptical of free books and fear that they dumb down the teachings and proyseltize.

The book offers a privileged glimpse at the thoughts/processes/experiences that do indeed make the 30 featured designers so extraordinary.Extremely well-researched, beautfully written, and of course, flawlessly designed. Bucher's tone is refreshingly sincere, even kind in its approach (em dash) a big part of why I never wanted to put it down once I began reading it. Whether you're a cover-to-cover type or a skimmer, you'll find every aspect of this book extremely accessible.Highly recommended reading/viewing for anyone interested in design.

But the five melodies, which are lifted from a 1991 collection that featured three other singers beside von Otter, are just as lovely in a minor way. The standout is La Captive, with its haunting melody and cello acocmpaniment. Von Otter's rendition of the mezzo aria from Romeo and Juliet (1988) keeps the standard of artistry just as high. In all, this 63 min. disc is probably the best Berlioz vocal recital every made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Psychedelics Ruined This!","review":"Maybe if you'd seen this in the early '70s, you might think it was hip.

I note another customer ended up with greenish as well.On the plus: The cannisters arrived unbroken and in good shape.On the minus, the middle sized canister was defective in that it was out of round, and the lid (which is round) does not fit unless I remove the silicon ring supposed to keep moisture out. This wasn't any microscopic defect. The canister was so obviously out of round, it's astonishing to me this one made it past quality control.So.

Rice fulfilled all of my outlandish fantasies my meager imagination couldn't comply. When you read this saga you just move through time with it, and you never know where she's going to take you next. Events in this novel are so suspenseful, you know it is going to happen but you strictly deny it. At a point through this novel, I threw the book on the floor and chanted \\"oh my God\\" over and over again in pure shock. Then I quickly picked it up again read some more and threw it back on the floor. I read this book over and over again and I still haven't gotten tired of it. Its not for everybody, but if you want to read something by someone who's not afraid to go well beyond the norm, then Ann Rice is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"About This Edition","review":"This is the uncommon United Kingdom first edition of Anne Rice's Cry to Heaven: Chatto & Windus, London, 1990. 533 pp. blue cloth over hardback boards with a blue/purple dustjacket with gold and white details and a rose illustration of angels from Lorenzo Lotto.12.95 pounds on the flap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many words","review":"I like Anne Rice's writing. She's a master of plot and description, but in this case she over-wrote, filling page after page with unnecessary words. The relationship between the main character, Tonio, and Carlo didn't ring true. Carlo's motivation and actions weren't explained well enough to be understood by the reader. The numerous graphic sex scenes were overdone, and the character Christina was not developed as she should have been. Although the ending was somewhat satisfying, the reader is left hanging, with the feeling that serious problems lay ahead. All in all, a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely beautiful, captivating, emotional","review":"I had never read any of Anne Rice's books before. When I picked this book up, I didn't know what to expect. I became so engrossed in this novel and it became and will always be one of my all-time favorite books. I didn't want it to end! Anne Rice did some wonderful research for the story. The character development is fabulous and her description of everything brings the reader into the book and feels what the characters feel, sees what the characters see. I love this book. I think people that call this a \\"homosexual\\" book are wrong. It is not about gay people, it is about humans and real emotions, real sexuality, and the need to be loved. The book is very realistic for the era and it is very historically accurate. The book made me want to learn more about the castrati."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely gorgeous","review":"I admit that because of my obsession with vampires, I never thought I would like this book. But one day I decided to give it a chance, and man, I'm sure glad I did because i was rewarded with one of the best damned stories i've ever read. Now, I'm not an opera fan, and i usually can't stand anything historic; I'm a modern girl. But this beautiful set novel, set in 18th century Italy, about the castrati singers, is a harrowing, erotic, and ulimately sad tale of these misunderstood men, \\"worshipped as gods, yet shunned as half-men\\" PLEASE READ THIS BOOK IT RULES! Opium Poppy Field"},{"rating":"2","title":"My review","review":"Very intense book filled with love, passion, and violence. The life of the 1700's castrati was intense and the book kept me captivated as to the goings on of two main characters in this book. It is worth reading but I'd suggest the reader be an adult as it has very adult themes."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Popular\\" but profound","review":"Whatever else may be the value of this novel, it dispels the notion that whatever is popular literature is inferior literature. Rice deftly immerses her readers in the culture, arts and history of the era of the Italian castrati. This novel \\"works\\" on a number of levels--for escapist entertainment, for cultural enlightenment, and for profound philosophical exploration of the nature of evil and the role of sexuality in being \\"human.\\" By casting a eunich as the protagonist, Rice blurs the line between the sexes and explores the psychology of sexuality from a modern perspective. \\"Not to love what is beautiful and incomprehensible would be vanity, not virtue,\\" the Cardinal professes after Tonio's grand performance. Rice suggests that sexuality is a form of salvation for humans; it is the ultimate act in which we create, foster and treasure intimacy with other human beings. This is a thought provoking premise, and the novel is a brilliant vehicle for its consideration"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vividly emotional","review":"After slouging through the Mayfair Witches series, I almost gave up on Anne Rice's descriptive but very tedious writing style. Gothic is dark, detailed and emotional but never boring which describes exactly what Cry to Heaven is about. A beautifully written book and one of my favorites. The characters are so alive and so vivid in their pain and in their endurance that readers cannot but become enmeshed in the emotional aspects of the story as well as the story itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"So beautiful that I can't find the words to describe how I felt while reading it.","review":"I loved this book so much. The first chapter or so didn't exactly real me in but after that, I simply couldn't get enough. The stories of Guido and Tonio are heartbreaking and beautiful at the same time.Read the afterward too. I just love to see where she gets her research from and was amazed that she got to hear a very very rare recording of (i believe the last one and only one recorded) castrato singer.The way Anne told this story made me feel like I was right there in Italy holding my head up high, though all the cards were stacked against me. Just like Guido. Just like Tonio.Cry to heaven was a drug to me and I am still craving it."},{"rating":"2","title":"By far my favorite Anne Rice book","review":"This is an amazing decadent read. I just wanted the story to go and on. It has broken my heart to learn that my most favorite author has given up writing such incredible books.Feb 2010Still my favorite Rice book ( and that's saying something considering she's written so may amazing ones).

I look forward to many more years of reading your books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding writing, tragic story!","review":"A tragic story, only made beautiful by the words of Anne Rice. This book was tremendously entertaining, and educational to me. She writes with the courage, and the strength of a true genius.

A truly remarkable story, written by a truly remarkable woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Took me ages to get into it....but a great book","review":"I should state from the beginning, that as a counter-tenor myself, I was advised by someone else that I would love this book. Now I know why she yells \\"cry to heaven\\" when I'm singing!It took me over a year to get into it. I'd start reading it, and then just give up. Too many Italian names.;-)When I finally did get into it, I realized just how much effort went into the writing of it.She gets alot of the emotion involved in the music of the time bang on.How I wish classical music was as big a part of our lives today, or that people took music as seriously as they did in 17th Century Italy.Sure theres sex in it, but I didn't find any of it overly gratuitous.I say that if you like a good love story,however predictable, and or are interested in classical music, read this book.I admit that she does Vampires much better, but this is a great book and one that I'll be keeping in my personal library."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will fall in love with Tonio Treschi","review":"He will break your heart as you watch him endure a heinous betrayal and one challenge after another on his quest to live and love on his own terms.

The premise was intriguing and Anne is definately the one author who can pull it off, which is why the dullness of this book is such a disappointment. She piles details upon details, heaps on the prose, and drags the whole tale out. I was actually skipping ahead to see how it ends and if it was worth the effort to finish. Very slow to warm up to in the biginning, then a sagging dragging middle and finally a pretty good end. Sad, poetic, even haunting at times? Yes. Her prose is not pulp fiction, it is literary and lovely. But less is more! And this book could have been IMHO 10 times better if a few dozen pages were shaved off, a few scenes shortened or cut, and a few details glossed over or omitted altogether.I started this one on vaction--maybe the atmosphere was too light for such a zaftig book? Or maybe I am just making excuses for this latest effort by Rice?She's seen better days and so have I!"},{"rating":"1","title":"cry to heaven","review":"I read the first 50 or 60 pages of this book and was so repulsed by the homosexual act and all of the description of it that I simply could not continue reading it.

I did not know or realize this would be this kind of story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written, but at times very disturbing.","review":"I would have really liked Cry to Heaven if the \\"love\\" scene with Tonio and that girl wasn't in the book. It was really frightening the way he forced her into bed with him, and it definately made me dislike the character. And the fact that she forgives him so quickly as if he didn't do anything wrong was really unrealistic; sickening even. I'm surprised Christina or whatever her name was wasn't totally psychologically damaged after what he did to her. I noticed a lot of Anne Rice's books contain a lot of stuff. Maybe she should rethink doing scenes like that in her future books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love/Hate Relationship With Anne Rice","review":"The book \\"Cry To Heaven\\" I thought was beautifully set-up with stylistic prose and tons of eroticsm. I just love how Anne Rice adds a touch of sexuality to everything she writes; but I must admit, I could care less for her plots. \\"Cry To Heaven\\" lagged on so much and was sooooooo pointless, by the time I reached the end of the book, I felt like crying to heaven myself (in frustration). I can say the same for the other three novels I've read: \\"Interview With The Vampire\\", \\"The Vampire Lestat\\" & \\"The Witching Hour\\". Completely ... foolish; and you ask why I continue to read her books? Because she is the only author I know who does not repress sexuality in all it's glory.

An excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A predictable yet engrossing read","review":"Anne Rice fans will find much that is familiar in \\"Cry to Heaven\\", although unlike her other popular novels, there is no element of the supernatural present here. This is a book that will transport the reader back to 18th century Italy, into a world of politics, intrigue, corruption, and most of all, music. Rice's writing is as full and rich as always, with detailed settings and fully realized characters. The novel is well-researched, I learned much about the time period that I didn't know before.The flaw? I found most of the major plot twists to be extremely predictable. I won't give anything away, but every time something shocking happened, I had already guessed what was to come at least a chapter before. Maybe I've just read too many books. Regardless, I would still recommend this book to any Anne Rice fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Crying","review":"Because it was an Anne Rice book, I was looking forward to reading it.

Bernstein's tempos are perfect, all the repeats are taken, everything is infused with dramatic tension. The G minor is appropriately dark and elegant, its unbearable grief kept in check by an Apollonian temper. The Jupiter is positively...Jovian. This is, overall, my favorite recording of these two magnificent works (followed closely by Britten's and Klemperer's). A must for your classical collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meeting place of Mozart and Beethoven...","review":"Mozart's last two symphonies are interesting in that they reach a level of intensity not usually associated with the majority of his other works. I guess people love Mozart for his emotional health, cleaness, mathematical precision and utter grace. The last two symphonies of Mozart, can be seen as a meeting place of Mozart and Beethoven where Mozart's purity of form meets the angry Beethoven's sense of struggle.It is surprising that conductor Bernstein does such a fine job with the task of providing balance to these works. After all, Bernstein wasn't known for restraint, and he certainly was never considered a great conductor of Mozart.Comparisons: Bruno Walter; Toscanini"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unnecessarily quite frustrating","review":"Yes, the orchestral playing is quite impressive. Yes, Bernstein truly demonstrates his love for this music through this performance. Yes, but...After listening to both works, it was like walking onto a train at rush hour expecting the express train yet finding out later to my dismay that it is really a local train.This is Mozart. You need more thrust, or spontaneity, or whatever you want to call it. Berntein\`s tempi are too stilted for me, especially the beginning of No. 40. Although he went a little overboard in his diatribe, I believe ELN was correct in explaining the complete disappearance of emotion and urgency from the first movement of No.40 because of its slow pace (8 3/4 minutes).Sorry. All the plusses I mentioned above just pale compared to the unnecessary plodding of some of this CD\`s movements.This CD just doesn\`t cut it.

Most of these moves are hot, maybe only 1 or 2 I can't see myself doing. it was helpful to see the guys, after teaching each move, dancing with the girls with each of these moves. Part 2 of the DVD is all about dancing with the girl and turning up the heat. They also show you how to approach girls dancing and how to go from starting to dance with them all the way to grinding and all the stuff in between.

It demonstrates the principle, but its performance is disappointing. A Newton's Cradle should show the conservation of momentum and energy. However, this one is so small, and made with 'fishline' so the elasticity of the line allows the balls to begin swinging in unison--violating the very principle that it is supposed to be demonstrating. After about forty strikes, the balls are just swinging in harmony, as opposed to in opposition. Instead of showing that the energy of one ball is conserved by moving another ball, it merely shows that the energy is lost into the strings.The small size allows me to demonstrate the concept, but only as a visual reminder of how the viewer has probably seen this occur on a nicer product when they were in school. It is a valid reminder of what a \\"Newton's Cradle\\" is, even though it isn't a good one itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appearances Are Deception","review":"I bought this because I've always liked Newton's Cradles, but never really got around to buying one... I figured this would be a decent one to put on my desk as a nice distraction while I'm working...However, this product is a waste of money. The lines used to connect the balls to the frame seem to be cheap fishing line... the frame is flimsy plastic that shakes easily... and as a result of the decidedly shoddy design, the momentum of the balls is lost in a matter of maybe 10 seconds.I would advise anybody in the market for a Newton's Cradle to look elsewhere and not even purchase one of these to try it out as it'd cost you roughly half or more of what you spend on it to have it shipped back for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Newton's Cradle","review":"My dad got this for me, and I thought it was amazing! I have no idea how the balls work that way! It's really cool. I've noticed that a lot of people are saying that the balls stop moving after moving 5 times. You have to pull it just a bit higher. And if yours stops moving quickly, it's not that hard to lift the ball one more time. . .I think this item is entertaining. But the strings on the balls do tend to tangle, but that's okay.

The bowl has to be turned on it's side to drain."},{"rating":"2","title":"RF Amplifier","review":"I bought this amp to use with my RF Modulator from Channel Vision.

It's full of the things people do when they think no one else is watching, and the thoughts they rarely express aloud. \\"Man with Leafblower\\" blows his leaves into a neighbor's yard. \\"Barb\\", a high-tech refugee turned stripper, shakes her stuff for an ex-colleague. Gene Pare takes everyday processes like sex and aging and death and sculpts them into bare-boned works of art. The poems in this collection range from humorous (\\"Emperor Norton\\") to outright moving (\\"This Walks\\"). The prose is deliciously edgy. When you're reading this book, you'll find yourself looking over your shoulder and wondering if Gene Pare was writing about you. And who knows? Maybe he was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid, ugly, and mean","review":"If you want to look stupid, ugly, and mean, then buy these mittens made from the skins of killed rabbits.

Unfortunately, we opened a couple of bottles of wine and then it jammed. Amazon replaced it for me quickly and with little hassle. The next one was great.... we opened probably a dozen bottles of wine before it jammed. We had been very careful and gentle with it, since the first one had jammed. After the second one broke, I gave up and bought one at Costco for $[...] that is superior in every way. Works as well or better, much sturdier, and has opened more bottles of wine than both the Penguins we owned combined."},{"rating":"1","title":"help","review":"I just received this wine opener for Christmas and the corkscrew won't turn when you push the lever down so therefore all it does is push the cork into the bottle of wine.

Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"As all other reviews - great WHILE IT WORKED","review":"I, and my wife, used this Pinzon Penguin wine open effortlessly for nearly two years and then, one day my wife tried to open a bottle of wine by Fetzer (who now exclusively use synthetic corks) and the Penguin was stopped dead with the cork still in the bottle and the Penguin still embedded halfway down the cork/bottle.I used all my strength to disengage the Penguin from the cork so that our wine was saved but, now the handle is stuck in the down position and I cannot, again, using all my strength, pull it back up to get at the screws to see what is wrong - it's now going in the TRASH.I see many other Amazon.com customers have had the exact same experience - I'm very disappointed because it was THE EASIEST wine opener we have EVER had... before it broke.I will not take a chance on another Pinzon Penguin and will be seeking alternatives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy handle","review":"This device is an interesting, and works as advertised, while it survives.Synthetic or natural corks with a decent fit are easily removed, but tight corks require serious force. So much so, that the handle snapped off at the base. The rubber handle has only a narrow tang of steel down the middle, which stretched and finally shattered after only a few dozen pulls.Not worth buying when there are gadgets with much sturdier levers available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth operation at a great price","review":"This thing works well and does not cost much. The foil cutter works quickly and the lever to pull the cork has plenty of leverage making the cork pull an effortless exercise. It is well built and will hopefully last longer than my previous wine opener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stylish, highly efficient opener","review":"Sorry Rabbit, you're cute but we love our new Penguin even more.The Pinzon Penguin gets points for being strikingly stylish right out of the box. But the best thing about it is that it opens bottles easily and quickly and, unlike some other openers, it doesn't take long to get the hang of it. Once you do, it's a great conversation generator at dinner parties and everybody wants to take a turn trying it out. It also doesn't require any costly cartridges and the gift set includes a foil cutter, an airtight stopper and a replacement corkscrew. And at Amazon prices, it makes for an affordable host/hostess gift that's bound to impress."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing...when it works....","review":"Pinzon Penguin Wine Opener Gift SetWe had our first Penguin purchased from a local wine merchant for $65 for over a year and it worked great!

The Pinzon Penguin is going away never to be seen again!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality It's Not","review":"After receiving the item I was able to take out the natural cork from a bottle; then it started. The machine would not release the latch so I could not remove the cork. After I pushed and pulled and pleaded to the gods, the latch released and I was finally able to take out the cork and drown the experience in a good bottle of pinot. With little memory of the recent experience, wine has a tendency to do that, I cheerily tried to open another bottle and the same process began-out with the cork in stays the latch. This time gorilla frustration took over and I was able to wrest the cork free while breaking the handle. Interesting to note that the handle center is metal while the outside is rubber. Needless to say I am not recommending this product unless of course you really want frustration in your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great for a few weeks...","review":"At first, I was impressed by the design and ease of function. I couldn't have been more pleased for two months. Then, the device jammed, the lever being locked in the closed position so that operation was impossible.

I would advise waiting until the revised model comes out at some future time."},{"rating":"2","title":"mmanuel","review":"This is a FABULOUS winer opener.

Her acting is a bad joke.- The special effect is primitive.- The editing is below average. It makes the scenes look choppy.In short, this film is obviously a B movie.

Guess what- it's nearly impossible because the perforations are not very good and again, the cardboard is not very rigid.Third, once I had it assembled I discovered that the large flat cardboard separators you put between the layers are NOT SIZED PROPERLY so that there is too much room all around.

It's musically very dense and concentrated, yet sonorally very sparse, requiring the constant attention of the listener. Nonetheless, it is immensely expressive and harmonically very beautiful. To most, nonetheless, it sounds like Psycho-music, as even Webern fans must concede. Many items on this disc are some of Dr. Webern's most accessible, but highly expressionist nonetheless. As for the performances, they are astounding. The bagatelles are played with a tad bit more precision by Kronos (Winter was Hard), but not with the warmth, sonority, and energy with which Emerson plays them.

I like Boulez's clean instrumental separation; some consider it antiseptic or stringent, but I prefer to think of it as deromanticized.And, by the time he gets to the Sixth in the Mahler cycle, Boulez had developed his Mahlerian chops on nuances of tempo, shadings of volume, and all the other filigrees that distinguish good Mahler from bad. (Do be careful with some of Boulez's early Mahler recordings, though.)But, as with other reviewers, I must note the lack of fire, especially in the first movement. (That said, I'm not sure I've heard ANYBODY play the opening theme crisply enough... not just tempo, but overall crispness.)For people looking for a good more \\"traditional\\" interpretation, I suggest the first Bernstein recording, among others."},{"rating":"1","title":"A FUN JOURNEY ... BUT WITH NO CLEAR DESTINATION","review":"Boulez takes a sympathetic approach to the score, but his curious pacing leads to a rather disappointing finale. Indeed, the concluding movement of Mahler's intense, deeply personal music sounds here like an afterthought, uncertain and directionless in its mood. For a much richer, more heartfelt interpretation, try Christoph von Dohnanyi with The Cleveland Orchestra (London/Decca). You'll find the orchestral playing even more sumptuous and precise as the Viennese, a conductor with a more deep-seated place in the music, and even an extra track (the Adagio of Mahler's tenth). All told, Dohnanyi offers better listening and a better bargain."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful collection","review":"I think this book is great....wonderful photos, interesting facts from ladies from the Victorian Era (which is a time in history, not a place or country) Great buy for fun women and history buffs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"cute but not very good!","review":"I purchased this jar for my girlfriend because she buys honey in bulk and didn't have a place in the kitchen for that big bottle.

So I'm wondering why they put a Sticker on the outside of the packaging stating what the item is? Also it was packaged in a flimsy outer cardboard covering. I would not even call this a box. It had no support, was just barely taped as well. The tape was torn and you could see the contents and there is a HUGE BEND down the entire center of the item.I'm not even sure I want to give this to my son as a Christmas item anymore as it is damaged --plus the fact that the surprise factor for my son is gone with that sticker and the item being flimsily wrapped, he has obviously seen it. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"You Get What You Pay For","review":"I bought these for my sister-in-law to hold her over until she saved up for a Wusthof set. Rating of a famous consumer review organization a couple of years ago convinced me to try these, and since the price was about $20, I considered it an experiment.The knives rusted the first time she washed them and left them out to air dry. How can stainless steel rust?Every knife in the set arrived completely dull.What a joke. These can't be the same knives that were rated so highly a couple of years ago. Anyway, buyer beware.

It's a painful thing to read, though. The story moves along pretty well, then plods like an ox. It takes place in the present, the past, the future, and some weird places in between without a moment's warning, and I'd swear at times it's all four cases at once.I like Fry's humor, but this book just didn't do anything for me. I general I enjoy quirky stuff, this was just a mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"The funniest book I have read in years","review":"I am a johnny-come-lately to this book which has been out for some time. But to call this witty, is like calling the ocean damp. There are lines in here that are astoundingly funny. I cannot remember the last time that I laughed out loud while reading a book, and I did many times reading the Liar. The main character, Adrian, has lines that are worthy of any Oscar Wilde character. These are lines that if you got to say one or two of them just once in your life - you could die happy.Aside from being supremely humorous, it is also a story cleverly told with a plot that moves along like a rocket. And in fact there is more to the story than just laughs. The plot is well described in the other 35 reviews, so there is no need to recap it again here. I would simply echo the sentiments of the other reviewers, that if you are looking for a literate, funny and thoroughly engaging read - you will not do better than this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thought provoking, light hearted, hilarous read","review":"What seemed to me to be a man shy of media attention and the public eye on his private life Fry here has astounded me as to the boundries to which he has taken this book.

Really good San Francisco-based metal band that pulls it's listeners in with it's melodic, yet heavily performed vocals, crushing guitar riffs, blazing bass chords and powerful drumming. Whew! I get tired just hearing this disc. Tracks that will have you playing this CD many times again include the opener \\"Holy\\", the wailing \\"The Pieces\\" (cool video out of this tune), title cut \\"Broken Dreams\\", \\"How Would It Feel\\", \\"Hellbound\\", the in-your-face \\"Freedom Ain't Free\\" and the somewhat '80's-like \\"All Over Me\\". After hearing 'Broken Dreams', it is a bit difficult to believe this effort wasn't recorded in the early '90's. Should appeal to most fans of Soundgarden, Alice In Chains, White Zombie, Pantera, Nirvana and possibly Metallica. True metal fans will be licking their chops for more.

The final apotheosis is exhilarating but the interpretation and pacing of the work as a whole seems wanting in places; even a work this massive needs to sound cohesive, which doesn't in this case. In addition, the sound is not quite as clear as that given to Sinopoli. A good recording...but seek out others by Solti and Sinopoli for a better rendition."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was DG thinking when they released this bomb?","review":"I'll keep it short - don't waste your time. I can't figure out what Abbado thought he could add by releasing this live recording. An anaemic organ, antiphonal brass that sound like they're sitting right beside you, an in-your-face sound that totally misses the breadth of the orchestra and a choir that sounds almost like an afterthough. All together part of a methodic approach resulting in a pedestrian reading that sounds almost as if the maestro fell asleep, especially in some parts of the 2nd movement.With so many other worthy choices (Solti, Bernstein, Kubelik, etc.) why bother?

He quotes Robbins several times, but more than that, his writing possesses the same strengths and falls victim to the same weaknesses that Robbins' writing does. There is a remarkable and lyrical prose style here, and a precious sense of humor, but in the end, Duncan's wit and his clever epigrams push the story and the philosophy behind the story into a second place position. Duncan's explication of his philosophy is delivered in a cute anecdotal manner that makes it sound very pleasant but provides very little substance. The same can be said of the characters, who are amusing (I laughed aloud several times) but have little or no motivation for their development. It is all very pretty and fun, but it is certainly not one for the ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well Written, But Not My Cup of Tea","review":"Duncan does a nice job of wording his thoughts in this book.

The River Why is a phenomenal novel. The writing is darn near poetic. I've had flyfishermen and non fishermen read it and enjoy it.

So should readers interested in thoughtful, creative and honest writing; or of clever, insightful and profound character development. Gus Orviston is an enduring main character, and his discovery of his brother, Bill Bob's, unique and beautiful self, by itself, makes the book worth reading.

The ending falls a bit short of the earlier 99%, but that's just quibbling."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book","review":"Duncan dives off high cliffs in this book, exploring the big issues without ever getting pretentious.

Riding a greyhound bus, reading about fly fishing, i found myself in a whole different world. Duncan is capable of writing such a visual tale, and transporting readers to a time and place they may never have imagined themselves. I thought I was the one getting chased by the dog, or planning the perfect fishing life, or watching my younger brother ponder his knot of wood... I fell in love with all the characters, and think this would make a super movie if done correctly."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Only Book I've Read More Than Once","review":"Well that and Duncan's other novel, the Brother's K.

Don't be fooled","review":"These were admittedly a great deal. You can buy only a few knives for the price of this set. But the moment you get them you understand why. First and foremost is the monster lie being propagated here: These are not Farberware knives N-O-T. They are made in China by the Hoan Corporation. I wrote Farberware about this. The knives do not indicate on them or anywhere on any packing that they are Farberware. What does this mean? It means that Amazon is putting that Farberware label on them to move the product. I find that so offensive it's enough to make me want to skip Amazon as a source for online products. The key to any purchase is trust and they've lost mine. So, how are the knives. They are what you would expect. They are full tang and a bit heavy with plastic handles. The block is a piece of pine crap that'll likely split in a few weeks on the countertop. Mine are going back post haste with an angry note about being lied to and deceived by Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rusty and Dull","review":"Whatever you do, DO NOT purchase this *cutlery* set.

The block holds the knives very well [the slots are the exact size for the appropriate knives], and the knives themselves are heavyweight and work very well. I especially like the fact that the blade is riveted to the handle, so you know it is not going to fall apart or become loose while you are using them.The only thing I would not recommend with this knife set is to put them in your dishwasher. A few of the knives were put in the washer and the handles came out looking at little dull, so I would say that a good handwashing would do the trick.Overall I feel the quality is great.

She subsequently traveled throughout Mainland China, collecting recipes and converting them for Western cooks. Here she continues her tradition (from three previous books) of providing classical recipes with clear hints on how to make them perfectly and how to enjoy them as the Chinese would, whether as a snack or as part of a formal meal. She also provides sources for ingredients, substitutions and variations. Through it all, the writing style is clear and informal, as if Nina were standing by your side and guiding you along, while telling you how she first tasted this recipe.

The footnote? \\"Here we see Dracula in disguise speaking wonderful German.\\" I'm exaggerating, but you get the point. Another example: a passage describing Dracula's map of England (footnote: Here we see that Dracula has circled the city of X, where later in the story he will....and....and....until later....). Finally, there are even footnotes that engage the reader in conversation.

In the chapter on the Vietnam War the author displays incredible bias. His assessment relies on ad hominem attacks on the principles (only on the U.S. side though). He conveniently omits facts about Ho Chi Minh and the North Vietnamese. For all practical purposes, the author tells bald faced lies.

Stoessinger dismisses economics as a motivating factor in human conflict entirely. Instead, he insists that the cause of war is misunderstanding. This simplistic view also insults the memory of anyone who has fought for any belief, whether that belief is justified by history or not.

His concept is so simple, and yet so often overlooked. As I understand it, his basic point is that people often think of wars as being caused by factors such as religious differences, economics, etc. Stoessinger argues that these types of factors are necessary but not sufficient. You also need additional factors, particularly misperceptions.I think that he makes a pretty decent case for this, his examples are appropriately chosen, and he makes some very interesting observations. I think many of his ideas have very great explaining power and should be a consideration in any discussion of war.Definitly a recommended read, particularly if you're interested in history or political science."},{"rating":"2","title":"meet my objectives","review":"This is the second KeySafe the same kind I buy.

The Slimline has room for a couple of keys and doesn't have the keys fixed, so it's easier to use the key(s) as well.Other than that, it's a great product and looks professional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for kids","review":"This item has really helped with my teenager's.

My two boys, ages 3& 5 drive me nuts asking to play all the time. The vocbulary lessons are first rate. The music catches their attention and they sing along with the songs.

Lots of well thought out programing went into this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best Jumpstart games","review":"Jumpstart Animal Adventures is a fun, educational game. My 4 year old son loves the current music and funny music videos of the animals. The crab music video \\"Regeneration\\" (about defending your territory and occasionally losing a limb that grows back) makes me and my son giggle every time (think: a \\"clean\\" Green Day song).We have tried many many kids games from our local library before buying, and this is one of the best for the 4-6 age group. It is not goal oriented, unless you want it to be, and you can explore the world as long as you like. The information is presented very well for small children: colorful but realistic animated environments, helpful facts and games that help children remember major facts about a particular animal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for older kids, but a little too goal driven","review":"The program installed easily and had nice graphics.

Although JumpStart Animal Adventures is a very good game, it is lacking in several small ways. For example, there are two games, one in the forest and one under the sea, which are simple fighting games. Me and my sisters found these games very enjoyable, but, other then repersenting regeneration and the fighting habits of bucks and of crabs, it provided little educational value. Another downside is that once you take all the neccesary photos in a area, you can not return to that area. (The goal of the game is to take photos of animals that fit with the proper slots in the scrapbook, for example, 'Carnivore'). However, all educational games have setbacks, and this game is very fun and educational. It should probably be used for younger kids, as they would probably know less of the things taught."},{"rating":"2","title":"educational and really holds their attention for hours","review":"My daughters- five and six year old have really loved this CD.

The game has 3 levels- easy to hard and i dont think my girls are going to get bored of this one soon. I only wish the software also included deserts and the Asian continent to which we belong (we live in India).

As stated by other posters, the FM reception is HORRIBLE. There is an extreme amount of interference and static. Place the antenna straight up and away from unit helps. I suspect the FM receiver is poor design with bad filtering and is picking up electrical noise from unit itself. If you want an FM receiver, I suggest you avoid this unit. Another website claims problem fixed in units built around/after April '07. Since I wanted FM receiver I didn't test product any further.

The picture and description on the Amazon website claims that it has 2 stainless steel shelves. Do NOT believe it. When it comes to you, you will be getting one stainlesss steel shelf and one with a big cut out with a plastic cutting board. Very cheap looking. Amazon has also decided that they are going to offer different peoples different refunds. They will be offered others $20 and others up to $116. This is unacceptable in my opinion.

If you are a particular fan of this author and her style I'm sure you'll enjoy it. But for anyone else, the author seems undeveloped. Had I not seen the plug on the front cover that says she's a USA Today bestselling author I would have thought this was her first book. The main charcters are barely developed at all. The most revealing thing we know about them is that Serena, the heroine, is a supposedly beautiful 36 year old virgin. Yeah... The secondary characters are more fleshed out and likeable but still the book comes over as corny and slapstickish. If you need a really, really light read because your waiting to get a route canal at the dentists then sure, have fun reading. But for everyone else it's really not worth picking up."},{"rating":"1","title":"The 5000th growing-up-in-Brooklyn movie!","review":"If you are, say, over 30 years old, you have already seen this picture about dysfunctional families from Booklyn (or New York, or the Bronx), everyone endlessly shouting at each other over some stupid issue or other -- with other actors, other clothes, other beds, perhaps -- but still the same old stale \\"plot,\\" and no improvement on the variations.If you are over 30, do yourself a favor. You have probably already exceeded your lifetime required quota of 50 repeats, and you can feel free to pass on this movie. I was taken in by the ads, so you've been warned.I have given the picture a 2-star rating because of the one player who kept my attention -- a beautiful big fluffy cat who would occasionally make an appearance, and then quietly slink away in dismay."},{"rating":"1","title":"A squid plus a whale equals a turkey","review":"This is one of the more highly-overrated independent flicks to come out in years; actually, at 82 minutes, perhaps it's best described as a short film.All four of the main characters are deeply, deeply flawed, without redemption. Jeff Daniels in particular plays one of the biggest on-screen a-holes in the history of film. So here's my question -- why should we care about him? Why should we care about what happens to this family?And the metaphor to the squid and the whale? Jesus, can you beat that into our heads one more time, please? You know, in case we didn't get it the first four times you bring it up?????By the way, for a movie set in 1986, I sure saw a lot of SUV's tooling around.An unpleasant movie experience on many levels."},{"rating":"1","title":"So realistic it's uncomfortable","review":"This is the sad story of a divorce and it's aftermath. Jeff Daniels plays another jerk who turns his sons against their mother while seducing one of his female college students. He's the stereotypical egomaniac former successful writer who turns ruthless and hostile after his wife also becomes a successful writer. He can't handle the competition and it turns his madonna/whore complex on high gear. He even fights over custody of the family pet!If your parents are divorced this may bring back some painful repressed memories. Sadly it's the story of my generation. People with kids should watch this before divorcing. The worst part is the confustion of the boys and the distortion of the facts by their father."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible People!","review":"I bought this movie based on the trailer which made it look like a hilarious family comedy. I was quite surprised, unplesasantly so, when I watched it and found it to be a dark, morose and depressing story. While staffed by a talented cast, the characters they portrayed were in a word...horrible! Mean, spiteful, selfish and totally self involved. This was akin to watching the losers that populate reality TV at their very worst. I actually gave this movie to a friend as a birthday gift, again based on the trailer and before I watched my own copy, and I called him afterward to apologize for giving him such a poor movie. Save your money, this one is a good example of a movie that should never have been made. Horrible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"This is one of the most awful movies I've ever seen. The characters are self-absorbed, selfish, and unlikable. There is nothing that makes me care about them. The kids aren't particularly likable, either. With such unsympathetic characters, you don't care that the parents abuse the kids; you only ask yourself, \\"Why should I waste another minute on this film?\\" The end is ludicrous (where you find out where the title of the movie comes from), and has nothing to do with this disjointed story. Even Jeff Daniels, an excellent actor, couldn't save this flick. If you're interested in compelling drama, and what makes characters tick, see Pleasantville."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Movie For No Seasons","review":"None of the characters in this film has a single redeeming characteristic.

It is a near-pointless vision of truly despicable and soulless intellectuals and there's barely anyone in the movie that one can even stand to watch. The youngest child would be the one to root for, except he's busy wiping semen on everything. I have no problem with movies regarding fueding liberal families. But these people are just disturbed and cold and heartless. I was pleased that it was only 81 minutes long, and you will be too. I will repeat that it's really a very seriously well-made film. I think the critics loved it so much because besides the quality acting and cinematography, they can relate to the silly lifestyles of these out-of-touch New Yorkers. Avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeff Daniels is brilliant.","review":"I saw THE SQUID AND THE WHALE, which stars Jeff Daniels and Laura Linney, earlier this week at the Tara, and it was a very good movie about two writers who get divorced in the 1980s and the odd impact it has on their two sons. Daniels is brilliant in the movie as an arrogant author past his glory days who, when his marriage ends, sees himself as the victim in the situation and declares a passive-agressive war on his ex-wife. Linney, as usual, is good. Though the movie didn't completely bowl me over, it contains strong performances and good writing. I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The far fetched and the whale","review":"I sure see the overratings piling up here... And I know I'm a dead woman now - but! - it didn't make an impression on me. It is shallow. It is as predictable as a L M Montgomery novel. It's painfully clich��-ridden and it's too obvious. The younger son smearing semen on the lockers is odd, but not odd in a good way. It's just very forced.The \\"Rosebud\\"-like mantra of the elder son - \\"The squid and the whale\\"-memory - feels like a clich��.But the cast is phenomenal. Of course. Doesn't help a weak story though. Sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious, but heavy subject matter","review":"Don't watch with your Mom or in mixed company. But if you grew up in the 80's and you love dark, dry humor- you'll love this movie. Jeff Daniels is brilliant, and everyone else is good, too.

The lack of visual stimulation was clouded by an incredible sense of understanding provided to the watcher by the clever and hysterically sadistic script.While Jeff Daniels and Laura Linney both give the performances of their lives, the most moving performance of this awkard ensemble cast of sorts came from that of Owen Kline (Frank) who plays the younger son. This young actor tackled an incredibly complex role with the skill of a veteran. I is beyond me how a child performance like that of Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense was granted an Oscar Nomination while a truly sophositacated and far more difficult role like that play by young Mr. Kline was ignored by the Academy.I look forward to seeing more from filmaker Noah Baumbach, and Owen Kline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks Laura and Jeff.","review":"A very depressing and hopefully not a very accurate picture of our culture.Mom and Dad have had the benefit of a fine American education, exposure to the great ideas, the great books, the great teachers and this is what we get?It's easy to see how a group of young men sitting around nibbling dates and sipping apple tea could decide these people would be better off blown to hell."},{"rating":"1","title":"What they mean by sexual dysfunction...","review":"Yes, this is a movie about a divorce. It's a very boring movie about divorce. Maybe it's realistic, I dont know, I've never been divorced. There are also sexual themes that are discussed in this movie. In addition to that, there are scenes of little boys masturbating. I tried to watch this movie once, and after about 5 minutes my friend and I decided that we coudln't handle such a boring movie. I tried to watch it again some time later by myself, and got about 25 minutes into it, when it shows this little kid go behind a bookshelf in a library and start wacking off.

One memory that sticks out is the friend whose parents subscribed to Playboy for him while he was still in grade school. The always interesting Jeff Daniels & Laura Linney play two liberal, self-absorbed literary types who love their kids, just not nearly as much as they love themselves. This leads to predictable (and some unpredictable) consequences in the lives of their two sons -- one in junior high and one in high school. One thing I have to wonder is how many blue-state liberals in New York, L.A, Madison, Eugene, Iowa City, etc. saw this movie, raved about it, and failed to realize that it was they themselves that were being skewered. Beware of adult themes when considering the movie for anyone below college age."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Gain","review":"This is a case of art copying life for no apparent purpose.

I can't believe any parent would let their child act in this movie. I found it so repulsive to think that not only did he have to play this degrading scene but he had to be coached and taught and had to practice. It borders on child abuse if you ask me. I certainly can live without watching a little boy degraded in such a disgusting way.Besides that scene, the characters were awful, boring, stupid people. Why on earth would the older boy idolize his jerk of a father? If I were 16 and my dad acted like that I'd be ashamed to be anywhere near him. Both parents seem to be stuck in perpetual adolescence.

There is action and alot of comedy to keep you entertained. The art is very well done and I continue to wonder how they put so much detail in such small spaces.

They really shouldn't have changed the names around.. its the names and the techniques that gives this series the true feeling for a great manga. Instead they really screwed up the names.. i didn't read the english manga but i followed the japanese one all the way to the updated volume. I must say this is truely one of my favorite animes but i really dislike what they did to the american version.. they should have atleast kept the name of the jutsus(spells)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Close to best manga ever!","review":"I love this manga but I think Fullmetal Alchemist is better.

If anything, the manga leaves some gaps the anime fills in, especially in action scenes. And the renaming of ninja techniques will still piss off purists.

The beats by DJ Lenn Swann sound like an amateurish attempt to copy Dr. Dre's style. Everything about this album feels second-hand and just plain boring.

So you'd think I'd love this film. Nope. For one thing it is too self-conscious: it actually TRIES to be funny but isn't. For another thing, whatever redeeming qualities the first half of the film may have, by the time you get to the second half it is so repetitious that it become extremely plodding. And there is no payoff at the ending because THE FILM HAS NO ENDING! Somehow Ray forgot to give the film either any sense of resolution or some sort of shock. I'd settle for even for a poorly done shock. But no, the film just ends when it could have similarly ended after the first 25 minutes.Even worse, the prologue Ray added to the beginning of the movie some time after he finished filming and everyone had gone home manages to make the non-ending even more of a non-ending. Now THAT was an accomplishment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pornos have better production values....","review":"even homemade ones. I knew this was a bad movie, I didn't mind that.

Through the guidance of my instructor, I went into a search for performances of these songs. I came upon this CD and found that, not only were they completely different than my own interpretations, they were extremely powerful and very beautiful. I found it nearly impossible to emulate the resonance and clarity shining forth in these songs. Terfel's voice brings power to \\"The Vagabond,\\" and cries out in sadness in \\"Bright is The Ring of Words.\\" His voice draws something inside of me when I hear it. Throughout the entire recording, Terfel proves that he is the dominant baritone in the world today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terfel's voice and manner not well suited to this repertoire","review":"I expected more satisfaction, delight from this CD than I received. Terfel is undoubtedly a major operatic talent, but his voice and style are too violent, brusque, lacking in variety for many of these selections. He alternates between a crude shout and a pianissimo.

That he does so to the exclusion of all personal social matters seems not to belittle him as a person, as his goal includes the betterment of the people of Newfoundland. The descriptions of the life and poverty in Newfoundland in the early years, along with the exploitation of the island by almost everyone, is extremely interesting, but it is s little tragic that his single-mindedness of purpose precludes him from, possibly, realizing great joy and fulfillment in his personal relationships. A most interesting and readable book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A REQUITED READ","review":"I read this novel 40 books ago. I still think about it. Wayne Johnston pulled me right into his wild, stark, exotic Newfoundland, where I found two unique characters with an ever tense and often wacky relationship.

One smooth, and we're talking Ladies Man/Shaft/James Bond smooth, poreless face.I think the packaging says something about you can use it on its own. Philosophy seems to have this one wrong. Use this as a base. Use this as an SPF. Use this as a pore even-outer. But be prepared to use a little bare minerals over it.Also, did I mention it lasts forever? Because it almost does.

I come from a long line of avid Horseshoe players, so this was a nice game to play since it plays out very similar, yet it has an extra air of challenge (or ease, however you want to look at it). The only problem was that we were cheap, and I guess it's true that you get what you pay for. This product is terrible. It isn't too sturdy, although I did like the idea that the bottoms were curved so as to maintain balance without putting holes in your yard. The biggest problem was the balls. Being attached to a small rope that you toss, these balls aren't tied on very well and they fall apart with ease.

As previous reviewers have noted, other performers attempts at Beatles' songs are so often disasters.[I don't include George Martin's In My Life with these, though.]What makes this CD so successful is Sollscher's classical guitar expertise and the quality of the people writing the arrangements, which includes Toru Takemitsu, noted Japanese classical composer.Five of the arrangements are by Sollscher himself.Takemitsu's arrangement of the title track shows familiarity with the classical guitar medium, though it also features some exotic jazz chords. His other arrangements on the disk are Hey Jude, Michelle and Yesterday.Without a doubt, the most interesting arrangements on the disk are the six by Borje Sandquist. His stray furthest from the original tunes, but do this in a musically satisfying way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting!!!","review":"I want the DVD that the other reviewers got!!!

This book actually looks at Malcolm's life in three separate stages: his life up until and including being a Nation of Islam spokesperson, his transition period while he was breaking with the Nation of Islam and shortly thereafter, and the path he was setting for himself as he was killed.This book aims to prove that Malcolm was setting an anti-imperialist path, and internationalist path, an anti-capitalist path, a truly revolutionary and truly dangerous (for the ruling classes) path.I think the book proves it, and I respect Malcolm all the more for it.This book also contains criticisms of Malcolm by various people, notably some liberals, and so it's good to get an idea of where people stood, who was really afraid of Malcolm and what he was really starting to represent."},{"rating":"2","title":"More About the Cartoonist","review":"\\"A board member of the Cartoonists Rights Network, Ann Telnaes worked several years at Walt Disney Imagineering as a designer.

How Michelle can reconcile the beautiful sentiments on this release with the bootylicious songs she sings with them is between her and God!It's a great CD with great contemporary music, which far surpasses anything Destiny's Child ever put out (even disregarding the lyrical content). As a Christian it's so good to have a contemporary gospel CD on the cutting edge of current trends, and not a few years behind like most gospel artists (Trintee 5:7, Virtue, etc. - don't get me wrong, I love them, but their sound isn't \\"fresh\\").Michelle could be a powerful instrument in uplifting God's kingdom. I hope she continues on this path and leaves that secular garbage behind.By the way, this CD is great for people of all faiths. As a Christian, her message rings clear for me, but even for non-Christians, it is an inspiring CD for anyone desiring a change from the negativity playing on most radio stations (without being overly preachy)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Whooooaaaa!","review":"I recently listened to Michelle Williams' Heart to Yours and tried to be open minded by listening to all the tracks. In actuality, I skipped right on through most of the selections, because I just couldn't take it anymore! Sorry for any who might be fans, but I had to keep it real and try to inform (make that) WARN others about this project. I haven't heard singing this bad in a long time, and it surprises me how some artists can make it while others with considerable more talent can't seem to make it in the industry. Humph! Even the guests with good voices (not Mary Mary) who lent a hand on this album couldn't help the songs out. In a nutshell: SAVE YOUR MONEY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Constructive criticism","review":"Let me first say, God bless you, more r&b singers need to use the talent that God gave them to honor Him.However, this album shows that Michelle William's strenght lies in her ability to harmonize, but as a soloist she is sorely lacking. On some songs she does well when she sticks to lower octaves, but too often she sounds like a 10-year-old singer who has not grown into her full voice yet. If she sticks to lower octaves she has the potential to be awesome. But right now she does not have the power and strength to carry an entire album and her duet with Shirley Cesear shows that she is way out of her league. There is no song that truly touches me and she does not include even one standard gospel song. All are contemporary christian pieces, but she would have done better to mix it up a bit. The best song was the one she did with Destiny's Child, which is where she should stay."},{"rating":"1","title":"LACK OF SPIRITUALITY","review":"I FELT THIS CD WAS JUST ANOTHER CD BY A SECULAR ARTIST TRYING TO CAPITALIZE OFF OF THE GOSPEL MARKET.

This is an incredibly slow, quiet, mellow Gospel album that is NOT for people hoping for more of Destiny's Child or even for Michelle fans whose first exposure of her was through Destiny's Child. Extremely religious. I really can't get into anything here. I loved Destiny's Child, but despite a few nice hits by Beyonce and Kelly's \\"Dilemma,\\" I really can't draw too much enjoyment from their solo stuff. They should get back together and stay together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go back to singing backup for Monica","review":"I did not know you could jack gospel up.

Very possible !MICHELLE WILLIAMS totally misses the mark and is misproduced on a collection of tipid songs ment to inspire.A total waste of time, money and effort. A strong point with this CD is the cover art work (nice picture to look at).Unfortunately, what's inside the cd package is not as pleasing for a consumer.Ms.Williams, having limited vocal range, ventures blindly into the demanding musical realm (GOSPEL). The nature of Gospel music requieres that a vocalist projects emotion and soul during a vocal performance.MICHELLE barely manages to breathe into the microphone.Her vocal performance ressemble a pale closing number at tuesday night karaoke bar near the outskirts of town. She sounds as if she is attempting to imitate the breathy vocals of OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN in 1973.This is possibly the worst CD of 2002.

After reading some of the reviews, it's obvious that regardless of her singing gospel music (which she needs to work on), Michelle is still a secular artist, no matter what her morals may be. In spite of her love for Jesus, Michelle is still singing about being \\"Bootylicious\\" and gyrating in her music videos, and now she wants to go and sing gospel, she's only contradicting herself, and not leading the life of a Christian! After this album, she'll be back with Destiny's child and singing about things that don't pertain to Christians, she should just stick with one thing, instead of being a hypocrite and trying to be like the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Michelle Williams","review":"I bought this cd on faith because in general, gospel albums are pretty good and uplifting. The talent is usually awesome and you wonder why the gospel singer does not receive more recognition in the world. However, this one was disappointing!. It was so bad.

I just cut my cd in half, and threw it in the garbage. The only songs that were okay (mediocre) were Steal Away (with Shirley Caesar) and the joint with Mary Mary. Everything else was detestable!

I respect her for doing gospel music, but she needs to hope and pray that Destiny's Child never breaks up because this album reveals that she is only a background singer and not a lead singer. Now I understand why Beyonce never gave her any songs to lead on. Despite her weak voice, the words and music are touching and inspiring.

Perhaps someday a revision should be done to add events that took place after that, but right now it is too soon; history is still being made in Ethiopia.

And after hearing this La Valse, one would be hard-pressed to justify its title, though the performance may be genuine to Ravel's putative purpose as a statement on the early 20th century unraveling of old European mores. Though I'm certain Boulez's approach to these works has its adherents, I'd be hesitant to recommend this recording to a sheer novice as an introduction.

(At times itseemed like he was competing with Wilhelm andthen trying to drown him out.)Mr. Kempff smoothly rippled off the trills andmulti-octave scales--hitting all of the right notes.Rather mechanically pounded out the arpeggios.Laid eggs on both of the major cadenzas. And,overall, completely missed the spirit and soul ofthis concerto."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the truth","review":"I know all the players and he is not truthful...

It mentioned only 1.how to paly Maj and 7 chords/scale/Arpeggio. 2.1 baisc progression and changes. 3. examples - 3 blues(solo) songs.Though m/dim/m7b5/... could be derived from the same concept, this book only introduce how to play chord/scale/arpeggio 'by shape' over Maj and Seven.For beginner this is a guide for chord/scale system.

But with what I believe are the two greatest sets of Nocturnes ever set to record (Rubinstein and Arrau) available for about $24, this one is an also-ran. These are pleasant, well played, but ultimately faceless and bland performances - Chopin for people who buy those \\"the most relaxing music in the world\\" types of CDs. The sound, like most that DG produces for piano recordings, is pingy and lacks true depth. The 25 year old Arrau and 35 year old Rubinstein offer a richer, more natural piano sound.

Pires' playing has clarity, intelligence, control, and passion. The beauty of Chopin's work comes out wonderfully. Despite the price that one has to pay to buy this recording, it is in the top of its class. I have great trust in Pires' talent that will come to bear in other recordings that she has done that I may wish to buy.

The book has descriptions of each piece and almost all pieces of artillery described has at least one photo to accompany it. The book is easy to read and follow and should be included in anyone's collection on Artillery.

He gives the impression that this book will give you accurate information about what the druids were like.

The scholarship is outdated, though it may be of interest to those studying the druidic revival as a sociological or historical event. If you are interested in learning what is truly known about the druids, rather than an imaginative depiction, I recommend Piggott's _The Druids_ or Miranda Green's _World of the Druids_.

The only voices that are enjoyable are Bartoli's (never heard anything I didn't like from her!) who handles the trouser role of Cherubino with bravura, and Skovhus's beautifully resonant Count. The strongest part of this recording is Abaddo's masterful conducting. However, the unpleasantness of the leads' voices make this recording a chore to get through.

Apparently they got worried that they might come under pressure from the networks if they did not add such copy protection--but there is no legal reason why one cannot record one's already paid-for shows.

The customer support is most certainly a call center with employees that use scripted solutions. The idea of paying extra to have an employee read the faq from their website is ludicrous. Unfortunately for me, the 250 dollar device I bought roughly 2 years ago is now unusable. Slingbox said that they would charge me 100 dollars plus shipping to replace.

Easy to connect, just a bit of trouble finding the right remote (many choices for satellite, cable and other devices). Opening the DSL router's firewall was also a little tricky.

When it works it is wonderful. Unfortunately, that is about 70% of the time. The rest of the time I cannot connect for some unknown issue. I suppose it is come combination of my router (configured as Sling Media directed), my ISP, my home network, and the Internet in general. The bottom line is that the product is not reliable for a computer professional such as myself. The average person does not have a chance.Checkout the online forums at slingcommunity.com before you buy.

So, you go to the Slingmedia website hunting for Mac drivers only to find there are none! Not yet anyway. Apparently they're in a private beta test.That's totally unacceptable. You can't market a product for Mac when it doesn't work. Amazon - you should change your description immediately, and leave it that way until Mac drivers are available.

I did experience a slight difficulty in getting the Slingbox to sling outside my internal LAN.

It can be accessed from any computer with slingplayer software, however, only one computer can access it at a given time. Coming from a family of rabid UK basketball fans, I had envisioned family members living in areas of the county that don't recieve all of the games being able to watch the games in realtime online.

I came across this gadget one day and decided to give it a try. I hooked it up in my mother's house in the US through a Linksys router. After a few setting changes, it worked. The next time I was in Germany, I was watching American TV. Unfortunately, the DSL at my mother's house went down periodically, or so I thought, which required a reboot of the DSL modem. This was a pain especially when my family wasn't home to reset the modem. What I then discovered was that I needed to change a setting on my router for an \\"always on\\" connection versus the \\"on demand\\" setting. I have had no probems since. The picture quality is adequate even overseas. I get about 310Kbps. Good enough for me. I connected my laptop to my 42\\" plasma TV via an s-video connection.

I just purchased the Slingbox Pro only to learn that 6 monhs ago Slingbox altered its software to prevent the owner user from being able to record. This is a huge drawback as I was hoping to replace my tivo with the device by having my favorite tv shows streamed to my computer and downloaded for later viewing. Can't do that Anymore! You can only stream the content from one location to the other for immediate viewing. If you are streaming content from London to view in California, I am afraid the time delay makes this product useless. One other drawback is that if your tv or dvd recorder is located a fair distance from your wireless network, you will also need to purchase a wireless bridge which will set you back about $90. Overall this was a bad purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rarely works","review":"I've had the Slingbox Pro about 6 weeks now. As has been noted, you have to shell out more money for the wireless bridge. Unacceptable. Over the past 6 weeks, I've had to contact tech support 6 times. Basically everytime I'm not home (and not on my home network) my laptop can't connect to the Box. Every week I go back home and have to re-set the entire system and reconfigure the software. Next week the problem reoccurs. So it appears that the only time it works is when I'm in front of my cablebox and TV!! Hey, great! Guess what? I'm not home right now, and of course I can't connect yet again. Do not waste your money. This thing is going up on EBay shortly.UPDATE MAY '09: I just read that Sling will be offering an iPhone App for this. They're going to charge $30.00!

Hulu is a much better alternative that's FREE.The video quality didn't meet my expectations.

Allport","review":"There were things that I both liked and disliked about the book. Gordon W. Allport did a good job at showing you that prejudice is in your life from the very beginning till the very end, no matter who you are. Bringing up the nature vs. nurture debate numerous times made you really think about your own experiences and how you relate to the different situations he is bringing up. At the same time, the book had a tendency to become extremely repetitive and thick to read through. I felt that it got overwhelming and notably boring many times throughout the book, but when you thought back to what you read, you were amazed at what you got out of it. I don't think I would advise anyone to read this book, unless they are planning on taking the book a very little bit at a time, then coming back and picking it up again where they left off."},{"rating":"1","title":"All it takes is a little effort","review":"These DVD's seem to be a real bargain. However I gave them as a gift at Christmas and was very embarrassed. My brother has many of the commercials on VHS and the quality is far better. Why are they selling such bad quality when it is obvious there are better masters out there. There are many complaints about the sound and with good reason. With just a little effort the sound could be improved. And I am astounded at the number of commercials that are totally out of sync. That is a very easy fix. This set is cheap... in more than one way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not all that bad","review":"Granted, one should not expect pristine prints of commercials that were not intended for posterity some 30-50 years after they were filmed. However, midway through an intriguing set that includes the Flintstones Winston Commericials, Lucy and Desi's Animated Philip Morris piece, Bugs and Daffy for tang (Daffy actually gets the best of Bugs in this one), and a great Andy and Barney segment for Grape nuts, the picture flickers greatly.That aside, it's not bad. Baby boomers and Gen Xers will get warm and fuzzy over Josephine the Plumber, \\"It's The real Thing,\\" \\"Get the Barefoot Feeling with Mountain Dew,\\" the politically incorrect \\"Frito Bandito,\\" etc. However, The Malboro Man, The Esso Tiger, \\"I Can't Belive I Ate the Whole Thing\\" and a few other major spots are missing.

Wrong. The commercials are categorized in what sometimes seem like arbitrary categories... and you can only navigate from category to category. There is no listing of what commercials are in each category and you can't jump to specific commercials, but must take note (via trial and error - 2 discs and nearly 4 hours of trial and error) of which category your favorite commercial is in, then jump to that category and painfully fast-forward until you get to it.In addition, absolutely no effort has been made to bring the quality of the commercials back to their original broadcast quality or to even add closed captioning for the hearing impaired or even for those who want to know the exact lyrics to a catchy tune.This is one half-baked effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic Commercials","review":"Save your money and do not buy this dvd. The picure quality is very poor as well as the audio. The dvd was produced by copying the 4 video tapes of Classic Commercials which Madacy Entertainment produced last year. The video tapes were copied in the EP format which gives the worst video quality. The dvd is almost twice as long as the vhs tapes because some extra's have been added, but it is still a very poor product. It would be better to wait to buy a dvd with Classic Commercials until a major production company decides to release one.

I've watched Bing Crosby do a Ducks Unlimited piece, John Wayne to a Cancer Society segment and Fibur Mcgee of radio fame (so he tells us) do a plug for the National Association of Retired Persons.

When I first heard the incomparable Sam Ramey in high school, I was awestruck at the possibilities of excellence that lay before me in a future career. When I first heard this CD by Bryn Terfel, who does some of Sam's rep almost as good, I was awestruck by the responsibility of excellence that lay before me as an adult professional. After seeing him perform several times and being driven to happy laughter at his tremendous characterization of Leporello in DON GIOVANNI, I am all the more satisfied by this master class he gives all of us, disguised as a magnificent recital of arias.Bryn inspires you to run into a practice room before you even find the words to say how good he is.

Definitely worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Figaro to Macbeth","review":"Bravo, Bryn Terfel!The arias selected for his \\"Opera Arias\\" CD capture his versatile range, singing lighthearted as Figaro and later conveying the intensity required of Wagner.

I've used it for 2 weeks and haven't noticed any difference with my dark under eye circles or my wrinkles that are beginning to form (crows on sides, fine wrinkle underneath eye). I'll probably be trying another product to see if I can see a difference. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"allergic reaction","review":"After looking at many eye creams I stumbled upon this one. I saw good reviews on the product and also saw reviews saying that people had allergic reactions to it. I thought, \\"that won't happen to me\\". Well, it did happen. My eye lids had a rash and later just became really dry. There is some ingredient in this eye serum that made me hypersensitive so buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it's cracked up to be","review":"I decided to try this product after seeing a favorable review for it on a morning news show. It's spendy for only .5 oz., but the reviewers claimed it did work to reduce wrinkles around the eyes. After two weeks of nightly use, I really can't tell any difference (Aveeno was my former favorite), and I was very unhappy when the bottle appeared to be empty so soon. After prying off the top, however (I had to use a pliers because it doesn't screw off), I determined that the mechanism had failed and that there was more than half of the original amount remaining. I will not buy this product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Amazed","review":"After a visit to the dermatologist for a botox consultation, and being informed that my particular set of wrinkles wouldn't necessarily be alleviated by botox to the extent I was looking for, I thought I'd purchase some eye cream and see if that helped. I've used lotion on my face for most of my life, but never an \\"eye cream\\", so I was initially doubtful at the benefits this would provide beyond my regular regime.After about 5 days of using this product, I can say that I will continue using it indefinitely. The smile lines around my eyes are noticeably lessened by quite a bit and, while I could be happier (a product that completely removed wrinkles and smile lines would be nice), this product far exceeded my expectations for what could be accomplished using a dedicated eye cream."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"Thanks you.

It didn't sting my eyes though, unlike other products.Has a strong fragrance, too strong, in my personal opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Like a Charm!","review":"Olay hit the nail on the head with this one! Great for the dark circles under my eyes, great for reduced redness and puffiness- just overall an excellent product. The only downfall is how quickly you run through the bottle. It's great but it never lasts me long enough to feel like it's a great price for the size. I found retinol cream to work just as well on the 'normal' days of puffiness. For about 60% of the price, too! (Retinol Cream (Vitamin A) - 2 oz. + FREE St. Ives Renewing Collagen Elastin Advanced Body Moisturizer Gift Set). The stuff works the same as Olay, doesn't upset the skin, and comes in a larger package which is important for someone like me who needs it all the time!I'm not saying ditch the Olay- by all means, keep it around for the heaviest of days, but using the retinol cream regularly and the Olay only in extreme circumstances is working well for me. The combo saves my skin and my wallet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give it 0 stars if I could","review":"SO, I must first say I typically LOVE Regenerist products. I absolutely can't live without Regenerist night cream. I had such high hopes for the eye serum.I used it the day I received it - application was nice. The product was easily absorbed, and there was no noticable fragrance. However, it wasn't as moisturizing as I'd hoped. However, I woke up in the morning with my eyelids all swelled up and red, and the skin felt so raw. My eyes stung like crazy too. Figuring it had to be seasonal allergies, and not the eye serum, I continued to use it another 2 times. Finally, there was just no way to pretend that it wasn't the eye serum. The skin under my eye looked like crepe paper - all dried out and wrinkled. I'm 27 - I didn't have those wrinkles to start with! I went back to my old eye cream, and the skin smoothed back out after a few days and finally isn't raw and sore anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"reaction","review":"I used it for the first time last night and it made the lines underneath my eyes more noticible and I now have red spots where I put it on my eyes.

Although I like almost all of the Olay Regenerist products I use, will definitely give this one a pass in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"seems cheap? it's actually overpriced!","review":"I don't think this does what it claims to do. At least it did nothing for me. And the bottle is tiny like a sample. This is slightly over 10 bucks, so I thought it's pretty cheap, but now that I think about the cost-effectiveness, it is way too overpriced.I'd also say that the gold pearl in the cream serum may clog pores. I've used excellent eye creams before, and they normally tighten your skin in the eye area instantly, but this serum is way too watery to tighten your skin...All in all, I don't think this product is worth a penny. Sorry. but I'm disappointed. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"worst bottle design for product","review":"I have used the serum for over a month now. I don't think I am in the target age range, and therefore am not seeing results. That is ok with me, as long as I am perhaps preventing deep lines or sagging.My true gripe with this product is the dispensing mechanism of the small bottle. The product is too dense, so that it sticks to the walls, instead of settling on the bottom to be pumped out.I have had to shake and pound this tiny vessel and pry it open to redistribute the product, as well as just scoop it out. The bottle is by no means empty either! I still have over half the serum in there.Badly, badly designed. I will not be buying this again for that reason. Too bad I bought a two-pack!UPDATE: I have lowered my initial 2 star review to 1 star, because I developed eczema under my eyes. The only product I was using in that area of my face was the Eye Lifting Serum. I have NEVER reacted this way to any other product before. This is definitely a product with pitfalls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicously Soft Skin","review":"I've been using other Regenerist products, but lately I've been starting to have a problem with very dry, tight skin under my eyes. I've loved the other products In this line and said \\"what the heck\\", I could order it on line from Amazon, save money by doing so and by reading all the reviews I had a good idea of what I was in for.In the last two weeks I've been using this product twice a day, morning and night and while I may not notice if my wrinkles are shrinking, the skin around my eyes are noticeably softer, much less dry and tight, the pores seem to have shrunk a bit, and I've even noticed that my dark circles seem to be a bit reduced.I'm 52 years old and lets face it---the only things that are really going to work on wrinkles, lines and sagging lids, are face lifts and other horrendous things like Botox. No topical product can permanently change our skin. But for the price this is a wonderful product that does what it promises to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT HYPOALLERGENIC.","review":"No where on the label or box is this product listed as hypoallergenic.

What little fine lines I had, in all seriousness, increased. Did I always have this many fine lines and the product made it more apparent? Or did the product actually cause the increase in lines? To add on, I noticed a couple tiny red bumps appear a couple weeks after using this product. I've never had red bumps appear under my eyes in my life. The red bumps disappeared after a week of not using, but flustered because the additional lines are still there and visible. Now I have to fine another product to undo (or hide) all these new fine lines I'm stuck with.

It would work for a day or two and then, I'd have to pump it 30 times to get a little, tiny spit of product out! I turned the nozzle every which way, I shook it, I tried everything possible, but the pump was incredibly inconsistent (if it worked at all). Finally, I had to pop the top off - I have to dip product out with the other end of the pump - not exactly how it was designed, but that's the only way I can use this stuff!I like a product I can use without a struggle so needless to say, when this is empty I'm going to try another eye cream - don't know which yet, at this point it could be any brand, just as long as it doesn't have a pump!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Allergic Reaction from a First Time User","review":"I have very normal skin and I've never had an allergic reaction to anything else before, but after one application it appeared that red ants had attacked the skin surrounding my eyes.

In the Beethoven discography there is nothing comparable to this. It is so electric, so energizing and beautifully phrased, clear and clean it is in a class all by itself. If superlatives to be used for any piece of recorded music this album makes the top of the list. If you like Beethoven this is the last recording of the 5th and the 7th Symphonies you will ever own."},{"rating":"1","title":"The best recording of the 5th has a manufacturer's defect!!","review":"Without argument, Carlos Kleiber's 5th is the definitive recording. But the manufacturers of this CD have taken out a segment of the last movement. I find this incomprehensible and for me it ruined the joy of the symphony before that point. I have listened to the 5th literally hundreds of times, and such a defect is appalling."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"I just don't get it! I don't hear anything special in these performances. Perhaps that's because the sound is awful mid-70s DG, and I just can't hear past it.For thrilling performances in great sound, try Benjamin Zander on Telarc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for use in a vehicle","review":"Although well performed, the dynamic range is too great. The quiet parts are too quiet and too far out of balance with the louder parts. I listen to my music while driving. In the car I had to increase the volume to maximum to hear the quiet parts, and then found myself jumping for the volume knob when the louder parts were playing. I was constantly reaching for the volume knob. Dynamic variation is part of music, but this was not enjoyable.Very disappointing - I won't be able to use this album at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Derivative","review":"Please. If I wanted a product aimed at the lowest common denominator, I'd buy a Big Mac.

That's God incarnate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"I owned a record shop (remember those?)in the late 70's when this came out. The critics and public loved it and rightly so. Still the best 5th on the market and the 7th is nearly as good. Electric and stunning in every way."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN ESSENTIAL FOR EVERY CLASSICAL MUSIC LIBRARY","review":"Previous reviewers have extolled the virtues of these two now-legendary recordings. I would comment on one feature that previous reviewers have missed: Kleiber follows classical practice and divides the violins left and right, which reaps huge dividends in the Seventh Symphony. Listen to the coda, in which you can hear the dialogue between firsts and seconds literally leaping back and forth across the speakers. This is an astonishing effect and is aptly highlighted by Kleiber -- one of the many features that makes these performances indispensable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic readings of two of Beethoven's best works","review":"Let's be frank. There are many fine versions of both of these pieces. I have several recordings of each, including outstanding discs by von Karajan and Berlin, as well as Haitink and the Concertgebouw. The Kleiber recording, nevertheless, is very special and DG is to be commended for including both on a single disc.The performances are riveting - strong and full of energy - and the sound quality is outstanding. This is the kind of Beethoven that turns people ON to Beethoven."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beethoven's Classic Recordings","review":"This Carlos Kleiber 5th & 7th Symphony is one of those recordings which has entered the eternal hall of fame. If you like this Kleiber 5th abd 7th Symphony, then you must get Klemperer's Fidelio (EMI), Furtwangler's Symphony 9th (EMI), Richter and Rostropovich's set of Beethoven Cello Sonatas, Perahia's set of 5 Beethoven Piano Concertos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential recordings","review":"I bought this because it was supposed to be an essential recording but it didn't make an impression. My favorite still remains Fritz Reiner's with the Chicago Symphony. I have a version with Karajan (not very good), another with Klemperer (good). I had a version with Kleiberth's father (I think) on LP that I preffered. I will also try the version with Leibowitz conducting (I own the 9th and it is amazing). I will have to listen to them first in the future"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quintessential Classical Recording","review":"This is the Quintessential Classical Recording. Beethoven's Fifth Symphony is probably the most well known and well-regarded of any piece of classical music out there, and this recording of it by Kleiber and the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra is probably the best recording. It is so full of life and energy that it really reaches out to you and draws you in. Moreover, the price is very good and you get the 7th symphony almost for free which is really good in its own right. This is also one of the best old recordings I've found, so many older recordings have a terrible sound to them but this one is really good. I reccomend this CD for anyone interested in classical music."},{"rating":"2","title":"not the real original, but plus 7","review":"it is diffcult to find original, but this one not only 5, plus 7. i never heard origin, this one is OK for me. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pretty","review":"I love this CD.

I highly suggest this CD to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Censored Beethoven's 5th","review":"This conductor must have been trying to hide the truth about Beethoven's 5th - after all, it is true that Beethoven wrote parts for Gong, Wagner Tuba, and Sousaphone for this symphony, but why are they not played??? Disgraceful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfactory audio quality","review":"The performance is marred by the inferior audio quality. It seems that the engineers of this CD have not adequately limited the dynamic range, with the result that the loud passages are too loud and the soft passages are too soft. I found myself constantly adjusting the volume control. I have purchased other CDs from Deutsche Grammophon (e.g., the Brahms Symphony collection) and those CDs are fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Great","review":"As a classical music lover who have no formal musical training, I often have this puzzle in mind: what constitutes a great performance/ interpretation? I do not have a satisfactory answer myself. But for symphonic music, I would usually ask myself, after listening to a performance, whether (i) I concentrated throughout; and (ii) the different movements convincingly form coherent parts of a single musical piece.Listening to Carlos Kleiber's Beethoven 5 & 7 (and Brahms 4 as well), I strongly feel a momemtum in the music which is not forced, but with an internal logic. That logic enhances, not obscures, the beauty of the works.Having listened to other performances of these works, I am convinced that this CD is great, not just because of the greatness of the works, but also (even more so) the greatness of the interpretation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dishonest scholarship indeed","review":"As someone who was incarcerated in 1956 and later, from 1967 to 1970, I consider that Benin committed an intellectual crime when he refused to mention that we, Egyptian Jewish males above the ages of 19, were incarcerated in the detention camps of Abu Zaabal and Tura. One of the detainees from Alexandria was 82 years old! I, as well as others, were personally tortured. For instance, I was forced to walk barefoot on broken glass. Another inmate was told to face the wall, and insult himself. He had to say: \\" I am a coward Jew, I am a Jewish donkey\\".Beinin must have known about Abu Zaabal and Tura. He wrote that he was in Egypt during that period. From the names he mentions in his book, it is clear that he talked to some of the former detainees.Israel gave me a second chance at life, and helped me recover. I believe his hatred of the Jewish state led Beinin to hide the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dishonest scholarship","review":"The author is not honest when presenting the plightof Egyptian Jews. He belittles their suffering.In fact, he omits the most serious calamity thatbefell Egyptian Jewry: Incarceration and torturein the detentioncamps of Abu Zaabal and Tura between 1967-70.It is indeed dishonest scholarship, because theauthor covers the period before and after 1967-70,but not these three years. It seems that he isinterested in blaming Israel for the fate ofEgyptian Jewry, which is unfair. Israel welcomedEgyptian Jews after Egypt denied them citizizenship inin 1929 and employment in 1947 (The Company Law)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author unfair to Egyptian Jews","review":"I agree with those who condemn the book. I think Jews suffered in Egypt a lot more than what the Professor wants the reader to believe. For example, one of my Jewish classmates in Egypt, his 2 brothers, and his father were arrested and jailed for 3 years. They were beaten and tortured. These arrests happened to all Jews who stayed in Egypt in 1967. I believe the author is unjust here.Also, the author does not seem to appreciate the devastation effect of two laws on the fate of the Egyptian Jewish community: The Nationality Law and the Company Law. These laws denied citizenship and employment to 90% of Jews, and as a result, many of them left. These laws caused the flight of Jews much more than the wars with Israel."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"Joel Beinin wastes no opportunity to trash Israel, be it in the classroom, on radio or in print.

This book ignores 100% its subject, which is the 'dispersion of Egyptian Jewry'. Instead this book spends its time bashing Israel and then blaming the Egyptian Jews when they were rounded up, abused, tortured and jailed, for what crime? For the crime of daring to be Jewish. This book never mentions half the events that took place with Egyptian Jewry following 1948, which is sopposed to be the basis of the text. This book, because of its political hatred of Israel, abuses the history of Egyptian Jewry in order to lash Israel, a tragedy of history and a tragedy on the subject.Seth J.

Also, the rotisserie is almost impossible to use for chicken. Very poorly designed. The chicken constantly comes off the spit, and that's only if you were able to get it on the spit to begin with. I also don't care for the way it broils. It seems very slow and the meat comes out tough and dry.

Towards the middle of the book I understood it better and everything began to make sense. Any parents who are thinking about reading this book shouldn't bother because adults wouldn't be interested in the events involved in the plot. I wasn't interested in the book at all but my thirteen-year-old son seemed to like it; but he had said it wasn't one of the best. The reason this book is poor is because a lot of the character traits about Hannah were unknown and I didn't get to know any of the characters and what some of them were feeling when certain events had happened to them.

A friend of mine used to amuse us in elementary school days by singing that song in class whenever the teacher left the room! It was also a treat to see Boris Karloff as a rat with a bad case of lumbago! Another memorable sequence was the destruction of the Garden of Paradise. Even young children today might find it a little frightening.While not up to the standards of \\"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\\" or \\"Mad Monster Party,\\" the film is well worth seeing nevertheless.

This didn't seem to be an issue when I received the hat but when I used it I found out that this change is not desirable. The reason is because the underside of the bill illuminates slightly, creating a glair and makes it harder to see. Other than this, the hat is great for jogging in the dark. It creates just enough light to see where you're stepping while the bill of the hat can block light from oncoming cars. The battery life must be incredible.

I have also used a cap that had 3 lights - had to hit the brim switch a number of times to select the proper lights I needed. However, I like the 2-light hat the best. The 2 lights provided better light for what I needed to see than the cap with the 3 lights. Considering the every night use of this hat, the batteries lasted a satisfactory amount of time. A side benefit is that this cap is useful for seeing into the dark corners of your home at any time of day or night or in an emergency situation if there is an electricity outage in your home.

It has everything, including the beautiful 3rd movement in which piano and cello sound so graceful together; and a glimpse of Brahms' outstanding talent for composing for small ensembles and piano."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong movie","review":"The reason I gave it a two was that I got the right case but got the wrong movie. When we opened the case which was the correct one, there was an english movie Ladies in Lavendar. Since I love that movie I am keeping it. I will have to try again after Christmas for the Hans Christian Anderson one. My grandson is waiting to watch it. He is 16 and I am so happy he got into the movie when we watched it on tv. We just didn't know that it was a 2 parter. The movie came at a fast pace. Was not disapointed on that account."},{"rating":"1","title":"this film may have you comit suicide.","review":"This film is horribly depressing. The main actor plays his character like a raving lunatic and , if he acted this way in public, would have been locked up.I was hoping this DVD would be a series of shorts, like arabian nights, or even the 10th kingdom, but no. Instead it was a thinly disguised biography of han's christian anderson. In fact the acting of the main character is so bad, you do not even want to see the fairy tales. They too are gloomy and depressive.Skip this one, and if you must get a hall mark faerie tale try the following:10th KingdomArabian nightsThe Snow QueenDinotopiaJack and the Bean Stalk the true storyMerlinIn that order.Sincerely: David C.

The Morrison mystique lives on. The music captures a time when things were shaken-up and changed...when war shattered this country and \\"This is the End\\" was a metaphor for Vietnam and a post World War II Norman Rockwell fairy tale. Say what you will about Morrison's personal life, his music, that of the Doors, has always resonated with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attractive, but .......","review":"This thing didn't last a month. The key pad was bad in it. The price was great and I really liked the way it looked. Too bad, huh.I wouldn't buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Tool!","review":"I bought this grapefruiter because I have a 6 year old as well as a grandmother in the nursing home who both love grapefruit. They both need help sectioning it so I have always been on the look out for something to make this process easier and this is it. It only took me one try or two to find the perfect position to get the whole section of fruit out. It is a snap! I am buying another one as a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good for larger grapefruit","review":"Bought this on a whim, and like most things that I buy on a whim, it soon wound up in the trash. It's a great idea, but don't try to use it on anything other than rather puny grapefruit. It sure can't handle Texas sized ones. There's more waste than section."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't give it \\"no\\" stars or I would","review":"This thing is the pits. I ordered it after reading other negative reviews attributing them to operator error. Wrong. The opening is not long enough to reach from the center of the larger grapefruits to the rind so it can get the entire thing. The scoop is not deep enough to reach the bottom center, and while the mechanics work as described, I only got pieces out that meansured less than an inch in length. Two-thirds of the pulp remained in the section. I ended up returning it stating it does not perform as advertised. You're better off with the trusty grapefruit knife or grapefruit spoons."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of junk","review":"If you want to throw away half of your grapefruit - this is the tool for you. This was returned for refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing performance","review":"I'm very disappointed in the actual performance of this product, especially after reading so many positive reviews. I find it wastes a lot of grapefruit, it doesn't cut well so it takes too much work to get out a single piece, and it makes quite a juicy mess. Bummer! I'm going back to peeling and sectioning by hand since it's faster and I get more fruit."},{"rating":"1","title":"chef'n grapegruit citrus sectioning tool","review":"SORRY, BUT THIS TOOL FAILED TO BE ABLE TO CUT OUR MORE THAN 1/3 OF EACH SECTION.

I might be expecting too much from this tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing DOES NOT WORK!","review":"I can only assume that all of the positive reviews were written by people that work for the company that makes this thing. The tool is plenty sharp enough but it only scoops out about 1/4 to 1/3 of each section. After you're done using this tool on the grapefruit, you have to remove everything it left behind (more than half the fruit) the old-fashioned way. It's completely useless and I will be returning it on my next trip to Target."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grapefruit NON Cutter","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this product. I saw it on TV, & hunted it down online. It cost almost as much in shipping as the purchase price, so you can imagine how unhappy I was when it didnt work. I follwed the meager instructions on the wrapper,3 pictures, big deal. I wasted quite a few grapefruits, getting nothing but juice and mush. THEN I wrote to the company's website, & have heard nothing. All in all, I spent over $16 for a product that doesnt work. I wouldnt reccommend it to anyone. By the way, apparently you cant submit a review without at least one star, but trust me, I wouldnt even give it that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not recommend.","review":"\\"Chef'n Grapefruiter Citrus Sectioning Tool\\" I do not recommend this product. I watched every online video I could find to see if I was using it incorrectly, but nope. It is very cheaply made, the metal cutting part keeps bending and getting stuck, you have to pull the handles apart to get the fruit to come out. It mostly just mashes the grapefruit. Maybe it would work with a different sized grapefruit, but none of the ones I tried it on. I ordered a grapefruit knife and grapefruit spoons instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chef'n Grapefruiter Citrus Sectioning Tool","review":"We purchased this Chef'n Grapefruiter Citrus Sectioning Tool from Amazon before Christmas to make ambrosia.

They stopped releasing these DVDs after Volume 9. So this Vegeta Saga 2 boxset will have one DVD included, and you can buy one more DVD and that's it. There will be about 3 more DVDs that will never be released to complete this set. So people who bought this starter boxset (like me) anticipating more to come got screwed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't really beat the price","review":"I'm not a photographer by any sense of the word, but I got my first DSLR camera and this lens was one of the first lenses I got as a mid range zoom/macroI originally bought this off Ebay and paid about 35.00 dollars for it. I was fully expecting to get what I paid for... a cheap, be happy if you get any pictures at all, camera lens.What I got was surprisingly vivid details on the pictures I have taken with this. I use the lens a lot for Macro shooting and my jaw drops a lot on how much detail is retained when zooming in on my pictures for cropping. (Attached photo of the bee is a good example)My first lens was a 250.00+ prime lens but to my surprise this 35.00 lens gets more usage.From what I understand Quantaray lenses are refurbished Sigma lenses, so it may be the luck of the draw on what you get. To me, I say well worth the purchase if you are starting out and wanting to play around with what DSLR's can do."},{"rating":"1","title":"live in squalor w your turbs as others have done u major dweeb","review":"u dweeb. when others don't even get an apt or shelter for a turb go f urself.this is one nasty bitch fm n. carolina saying her turb is all that one more time, i'll give her a jesus up her ass with FURY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable","review":"It is truly incredible that a book with this many errors could be published.

Doug Hammond and Sean Odom did a great job and created a book for those with no Cisco experience. I like the imaginary CCIE character that walks you through the labs. That was cool in fact to have step by step lab resolutions. I like chapter 4 which lists all the switches and their features in bar graphs as well. I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone studying for their CCNP 2.0 Switching Exam. Looking at the comments from other I see I am not a minority either."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is great!","review":"As an instructor I use this book in my class finding that it covers every subject and has the answers to every Sylvan Test question from the Switching Exam. I read the review from the previous person and am tending to beleive it is Richard Deal posting a reveiw. #1 Odoms books is about 300 pages thicker than the Exam Cram. #2 The Exam Cram gives the basic answers to the test. The Prep takes you from knowing nothing to expert level. The books have two different purposes and are really meant to compliment each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"I have read two of the switching books out there and this is the one that I personally recommend and here is why. This book just doesn't stop at the study guide level for the CCNP Switching Exam but it also covers the the components of every LAN switch and their features. This has helped my purchasing decisions so much and everytime someone asks if a switch does something I just go to Chapter 4 and look at the bar graphs and tables for each switch. It has been a cool reference. I like the CCIE character that walks you through each step too. He makes it easy for a first timer on switches to figure out how to make the interfaces work and the configuration run correctly. This is a great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Book","review":"I must admit I am a former student of Sean Odom's and so maybe I am bias. He guarenteed me that everything I need to know to pass the Switching Exam was in his book. I passed it with a 940 after reading his book a couple of times. I now only have the Routing Exam left and I will be a CCNP!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great....except the bass drum","review":"This is a truly great recording of Verdi's emotional Requiem, and I'll not try to add to the other reviews here. However, I do have one little quibble: the bass drum solos in the Dies Irae sections are not played forcefully enough. They are a somewhat unexciting \\"boom\\" instead of an earth-shaking \\"SLAM,\\" as in Shaw's and Solti's recordings. This is, as I said, a minor point, but if you're a percussionist like me it can get on your nerves. I recommend getting the Fricsay along with the Shaw or Solti, because apart from the bass drum and the dated mono sound it is a great recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless Enjoyment","review":"I purchased Bahama Pajamas, Deep In The Jungle, Late Last Night, and Traffic Jams 12 years ago on cassette for my daughters when they were babies.

So, imagine my delight of its release on DVD.The print is excellent, and the opening theme song is great as I remember it. But this movie soon went downhill after Mother Goose left for the Moon.

He attempts to reproduce the humor of David Sedaris, but fails miserably. Burroughs even adds stories of his partner and plays the role of the selfish brute. This is obviously a reproduction of Sedaris and his relationship with Hugh. However, it does not work for Burroughs. His endless references to his drinking cause the reader to be filled with pity, not laughter. The continuous return to images of his laziness and poor hygeine become redundant. His use of vulgarity forces his writing to a rock-bottom level.
