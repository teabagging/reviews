Patronizing and condescending tone6. Exhausting to read (almost 500 pages).The book does have some interesting facts about sleep, but in the end, Dr. Weissbluth's \\"Trust me, I'm a doctor\\"-attitude could never convince me to follow his methods.

It is not well indexed, and it is virtually impossible to find information quickly and easily. The author has a rambling style, making it difficult for the not-well-rested parent to read. There is probably good advice in the book, but i couldn't find it. I highly recommend \\"THE NO CRY SLEEP SOLUTION\\" by Elizabeth Pantley. It is a MUCH better book-- well indexed, concise, and detailed. (And doesn't have to address what to do if your child throws up from crying so much-- it's not part of the method.) Only buy \\"healthy sleep habits\\" if you have the time to read a 500 page book and have a good highlighter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good research, bad approach","review":"Since this is written by a doctor it contains plenty of research. The problem is that this (male) doctor is goal oriented, it's about sleep at all costs. The main thrust of any technique given is to let your child cry until he goes to sleep by himself. Not sure if that is really a solution at all, and it certainly doesn't take into account a child's emotional development. If you are OK with your child crying to sleep then just do it and you don't really need to read a book. If you want solutions that take into account your child's emotions and feelings then I'd suggest The No-Cry Sleep Solution which contains many of the same facts found herein but then goes on to provide many non-crying approaches to sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a great read!","review":"This book is really helpful, I was doing things wrong that I didn't know were wrong for a baby.

I fully recommend this book to everyone!Only thing that would make this book better for children over 4 mths, is to also discuss the less common sleep issues, or to have a contact number to get help if needed.If you have sleep issues with babies under 4 months I strongly recommend \\"Secrets of the baby whisperer\\" or \\"babywise 1\\" (the latter is better as if you ring them [Growing Families International] they can also give you the number of a contact mum for further support)."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works and it's not cruel","review":"Despite the controversy over \\"Ferbering\\" your child (a much more extreme form of the \\"let them cry it out\\" approach to infant sleeping), this method works and if done properly, is appropriate and helpful for older infants. He suggests 4 months and up but of course every child is different. We used it when our daughter was 5 months and had her on a nap and night sleeping schedule in about a week. She became (and still is) a terrific night sleeper.Basically, his theory is that children need to LEARN how to self-soothe and fall to sleep (or back to sleep) on their own and that you need to help them do this. He stresses getting enough sleep and sticking to a schedule (although you really can mess it up once in a while).

Try the No Cry Sleep Solution by Elizabeth Pantley and you'll be glad you did. It's much more baby led and we went from a cranky, didn't sleep for more than 2 hours at a time 15 month old to a well adjusted sleeper in a matter of a few short weeks.

Anyone who subscribes to the cry it out method will find a gentler version from Ferber.I guess I'm a softie... How in the world did you allow your child to cry for 2 1/2 hours and not attend to them? If it feels wrong, it's wrong. The fact that a baby sleeps through the night is not proof enough for me that this is a good method. Anyone would eventually fall asleep from exhaustion if they were crying nonstop and no one ever came to comfort them. You'd be afraid, worried and you'd eventually cry yourself to sleep. Any method that tells a parent to go against their instinct is NOT a method for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't recommend it","review":"People kept telling me this was the book to read but I found it dry, difficult to get through, and difficult to impliment. While this author advocates extinction, I'm not comfortable with letting my baby cry it out without any reassurance. And the other options just didn't feel workable. Ultimately, I read Ferber's new book and found it much more gentle and practical than this one. My baby learned very quickly to fall asleep on her own and is sleeping very well now.

So far, so good. What I found lacking was the step-by-step strategy on the cover. The basic idea seems to be to attune oneself to the child's cues, and rush them to bed before they become overtired, but I had to wade through hundreds of pages before getting to that insight.

I couldn't believe some of the things Weissbluth was suggesting. At one point, he advocated leaving a baby alone after he had vomited: Don't clean him up, just leave him be.

I didn't realize how much of a disservice we were doing her by not allowing her the opportunity to sleep.\\" The long term benefits for the child who is taught to sleep well are innumerable.

The plan Dr. Weissbluth describes works. I have a happy, well rested 18 month old child. We've been using this book since my son was born. While I have the prior second edition, I bought the new third edition for a friend and knew I had to purchase this newer version for myself. He describes best sleep practices for infants and children of all ages. Babies and young children need sleep to promote brain development. A well rested child is a happy, easy going child according to Dr. Weissbluth. We are a happy, well rested family thanks to this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let him cry 'til he pukes?","review":"I hated this book. The tone throughout was aimed at making parents feel paranoid and guilty because their child may not be getting enough sleep. It basically boiled down to, put your kid to sleep on THIS schedule, or you lose. Nevermind if your kid cries until he pukes, just wipe him down, flee the room, and let him cry some more. And don't worry about him falling down in his crib...rushing to his aid would be far more detrimental than that bump on his head he'll get from whacking it on the crib rails when he falls. I tossed this book and just did what felt right...sure, there were days when I had no idea what I was doing and my son was \\"sleep deprived\\" because of it. Now, however, at 17 months, most days he goes down for his nap and at bedtime without so much as shedding a tear. On an especially busy day, he'll even go to his crib a little before bedtime and ask to be put in. Sans puking."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like this book :-(","review":"This book was not AT ALL helpful to me! It mostly quoted a bunch of research as to why babies must sleep X number of hours per day. I saw no practical advice on HOW to get a baby to sleep those hours. And then, it went on to say that if babies do not sleep those hours, they grow up to be sullen & bratty. This book didn't empower me with regard to sleep training my baby. It made me feel inadequate. And my 3-month old still won't take naps!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Much needed advice for parents","review":"This book was a great purchase and I'll be buying one for a friend of mine who is currently expecting so she can be prepared when her little one arrives. Our baby seemed to be very fussy and could not be put down to sleep but as it turns out our baby was overtired. We needed to train her to sleep on her own to allow her to get a deeper restorative sleep than she could get if we held her - this allowed us to get sleep too. The author reviews different methods - we chose the cry it out method (which was very tough for me) and saw results within a week. We saw some regression but persisted and now we see even more improved results (longer periods of sleep). Great resource for parents dealing with sleep issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good info but difficult to read...","review":"I thought the info in the book was helpful however it was disorganized. Overall, I thought the book was difficult to read. I found myself jumping from section to section trying to find relevant info for our situation.The guidelines are also a bit harsh. We used what we wanted and ignored the rest. I recommend, \\"Sleeping Through the Night\\" by Jodi Mindell. Her suggestions are much easier on baby as well as mom and dad. Our 11 month old sleeps 11 hours at night and takes two great naps (1.5-3 hours). She babbles herself to sleep and wakes up smiling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Info, Poor Organization","review":"The information in this book is very helpful.

No more endless rocking, crying, etc. Awesome! Changed our lives! Wish I would have bought this book months ago.However, I do have a serious complaint, which is that the information is poorly presented and organized. You need to read the chapter several times, flip back to the section on soothing and then try to piece together what he is trying to tell you. More step-by-step examples would be very helpful.

This book is great! It helped to answer many of the questions my husband and I (new parents) had about our daughter's sleeping patterns.

(Read the Look inside the book pages for a sample) I agreed with about half of what I read, but there is alot in here that I totally disagreed with. The general sleep information is good, but the technique is old-fashioned. My grandmother told me to put my baby in the crib and let her cry herself to sleep, I didn't need this book for that advice, and I don't feel good about that approach. A better choice for modern, gentle sleep ideas is The No-Cry Sleep Solution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated and insensitive","review":"This book was first written in 1987 and the approach was how things were taught back then. Even the authors comment in the introduction that he \\"helped my wife raise four sons\\" (page xiv) demonstrates the old way of thinking - that he was the helper instead of parent-partner. There is a lot of interesting material about sleep and how important it is, but the book falls flat when it comes to solutions. The author explains that night wakings for feeding is normal, and that babies do wake in the night \\"wet, soiled or hungry\\" yet goes on to promote unlimited crying (Page 159 \\"When crying is open-ended the child learns to stop protesting\\")This is to teach a child not to rely upon the parents during the night, saying \\"We are leaving him alone to forget the expectation to be picked up.\\" (page 159) I find the theory outdated and the methods harsh and insensitive. I'd recommend The Happiest Baby on the Block or The No-Cry Sleep Solution instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much crying for us","review":"We've been desperate for sleep so I bought every book I found about babies and sleep. This one has a lot of good information about sleep science but the method recommended basically involves removing the parent from the nighttime process and letting your baby cry to sleep. I didn't really find this a solution, but rather like putting in ear plugs and ignoring the problem until it goes away.I admit that I tried the plan for several nights and my baby cried harder than he has ever cried before and I cried too. My heart warned me that this was not good for our relationship, so I went on to other books.In my search I found two other books that were very helpful, The Happiest Baby by Karp and The No-Cry Sleep Solution by Pantley."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, some information I could use!","review":"My husband and I love this book. After reading Baby Wise (hated it), the Baby Whisperer (it was okay...still refer to it from time to time),Lullaby Sleep Plan and researching sleep training for hours on the internet this book finally seemed to make sense. It's basically offers an understanding of your babies sleep capabilities (developmentally) for different ages. I strongly recommend reading this one before the baby arrives and then refer to it as your baby matures. This book does not offer quick fix solutions nor does it push one method or the other...mainly it provides insight about how to help your baby avoid sleep problems by giving a good start on learning to sleep to the best of his/her age readiness. Really love this book and it has really helped us solve some basic sleep problems in our now 4 month old. Definitely worth the money and time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Advice, yet know your baby's needs","review":"I found hte advice in this book useful, and I also feel that parents need to understand the individual needs of their child. Children, like all adults, do have a natural clock. Some are early risers, and some are not. It's great to put your child on a schedule, yet don't overdo your child's schedule.Regarding the famiily bed, sometimes a child might be scared during a thunderstorm, and need the comfort of loving parents. There is nothing wrong with this. Ignoring your child during such times would only make matters worse.Love you child, yet know they are unique, just as you are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful!","review":"This book gave me ideas I never knew about as a new Mom.

I recommend it to all new Moms."},{"rating":"1","title":"methods are too harsh for me","review":"I read this book, and found that what Weissbluth recommends is letting a child \\"cry it out\\" - for three or four hours at a time, if need be - starting at ages as low as two months. This approach may be necessary for some families, but I personally couldn't do it. I can handle only a few minutes of crying, and only after the baby reaches the age of six months or so, myself. I found Richard Ferber's book, Solve Your Child's Sleep Problems, to be vastly kinder and more humane, besides explaining things much more clearly and providing many more alternatives. If you have a problem with the idea of leaving a child to cry for more than a few minutes, I would strongly advise that you try Ferber's book first, and progress to Weissbluth's only if Ferber's methods do not work for your family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't help at all","review":"This book didn't address babies that wake up during the night several times because they haven't learned to fall back asleep at all.

Despite this being a tome of 544 pages, there is only one message in this entire book, which is to let your baby \\"cry it out.\\" Sounding like an old-school grouch, this author advises you to put your baby in his bed, shut the bedroom door, and avoid returning until morning. This behavior will miraculously (in just one or a few nights) result in a happy, well-rested baby. If this type of behavior toward your baby is acceptable to you, then this is the book to make you feel justified. In a few passages, the author pays half-hearted lip service to other sleep training methods, but the message is clear - none of those work as well as what he champions, which is to just leave your baby to cry it out or you're a weakling. This book was no help to me at all, and in fact, I wish the author would've kept his hands away from his writing device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good content, hidden behind impossibly bad writing","review":"A few helpful nuggets, strewn randomly across almost 500 pages of rambling natterings. Comically poorly written book. Seems like the author did some excellent research on a worthy topic, but then felt the key findings were too light to monetize, and decided to stretch a very finite set of insights and suggestions that could easily fit on a couple of pages across (multiple!) tedious filibuster books. It pleased me to see the cheap newspaper stock of this incoherent tome disintegrate in my fireplace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me.","review":"I'm not a proponent of letting a baby cry it out. It physically hurts me to hear my baby cry uncontrollably and gets him so worked up that it takes at least an hour to calm him down after letting him cry for 15 minutes. He is 5 months old and has had severe colic so I feed him to sleep every night. I would not recommend this book for anyone who has a colicky baby. Their advice is to just let them cry it out at so young of an age I'm afraid it would damage their sense of security."},{"rating":"2","title":"WEISSBLUTH WORSHIPER","review":"Our friends did us the GREATEST favor by sending us this book BEFORE our son was born. We have a 10-month-old son who is the happiest and most well-rested kid on the block. If the techniques are followed from the beginning you will not have to endure such lengthy crying spells. There have only been a few instances when we have had to let him cry. I can assure you there has been absolutely no psychological effects. My son smiles at me as I lay him down (wide-awake) as early as 6:00 pm. He then sleeps peacefully for over 12 hours and is still smiling at me when I return to his room at 7:00 AM.

It was given to me as a baby shower present, and i read it from cover to cover. I believe this is an abusive, heartless and disrespectful way to treat a child. What exactly are you teaching your baby by breaking his or her will? As for Weissbluth's absurd contention that you shouldn't let your baby sleep in the car or stroller...how does one achieve such a thing, and for what?In most of the world's cultures, this method would be considered an appalling Western curiosity.At seven months, my son sleeps 11 hours at night and naps well during the day. It took 2 months of gentle and patient training, and there were no tears. When I began, he was waking up 3 times every night.

I highly recommend this book and the Weissbluth method for any parent who is just starting the sleeping \\"game\\" or for any parent who is looking to adjust to a very healthy regimine for a child. Three couples that we are close with have all used the Weissbluth methods with their children, and the results are invariably positive.

What a novel concept for a book. But they also need security. Forcing them to cry it out in a dark room alone is *not* going to teach them independence. Insomnia is on the rise for kjids in the 8-12-year-old age range, and lots of researchers and therapists think it's because the kids were left to cry it out (the \\"method\\" in this book) instead of learning gentle, peaceful ways to fall asleep. Of course there are going to be people who post about their great success with this method. tehre are also plenty of us who have used gentler methods to teach our kids to fall asleep without any crying, fear, and distress. It's not a choice between this and never sleeping.

First of all, I read and read, trying to get past the pages telling us how important it is for a child to be properly rested (isn't this why we bought the book in the first place? ), to find out what he was proposing. Frustrated, I skipped ahead. As an advocate of Dr. Sears, I was appalled to find testimonials in this book of a mother who had let her child cry for an hour on several occasions, to find that they no longer cried weeks later. I believe that this is barbaric! Of course a child will stop crying after his/her needs are repeatedly not met. Dr. Weissbluth also suggested slathering the child's behind with mineral oil and zinc oxide so the parent doesn't have to change a diaper in the middle of the night. Personally, I love my boy too much to have him crying in the dark in a soiled diaper. Let's join the twenty-first century for Dog's sake!..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dense reading","review":"This is known for being such a resource for research on sleep, but I had a hard time staying with it.

There's so much good information and he does an excellent job targeting each stage of infancy (didn't have to read the toddler section b/c my daughter was already sleeping through the night).I wish I had bought this book sooner when my daughter was an infant (bought it when she was 5 months old).

I have 6 mos twin boys. We have our routine down which is very important. On most days, they get up at 7:00 a.m., take about 1 to 1 1/2 hour naps after two hours of wakefulness (for a total of 3 naps a day), and then to bed at 7:00 p.m. with a feeding around 3:30 a.m. We were able to get into this routine in less than two weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Sleep Book Ever!!!","review":"I searched high and low for a sleep book when my first child was having sleep issues (nap problems). I did not find one useful bit of information online or in a book. This book was recommended to me right before the birth of my second child and it was a miracle! A gift! The single most important parenting book I read (and I read MANY)! It gives step-by-step advice which is important to a sleep deprived mom. It is very easy to follow and it gives the parent a lot of support and examples."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as easy as it sounds","review":"I read this book and wasn't comfortable with the techniques, so I visted a sleep training support message board of mothers using his ideas. I was amazed to see that so many of them were making their babies cry endlessly for weeks, sometimes months, and one mother complained that she had been doing it for almost a year. This book makes it sound like every baby will sleep after a night of two of crying but that obviously isn't true. I also bought The No-Cry Sleep Solution which covers much of the same sleep data but then provides gentle non-crying solutions, which I am more comfortable with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful.... but....","review":"Not so helpful for buying to solve sleep problems with a child over 24 months of age.

As a new parent I wasn't very sure how to even begin, what was reasonable. This book was recommended to us by a friend's cousin. I got it because it sounded like it made sense and who doesn't want a happy baby who sleeps well?We purchased it before our baby girl was born and it really gave us some insight on what to expect, her brain/social development and how that affects sleep, sleepy signs, overtired signs, bedtime routines, creating a sleep schedule, and also what problems daily overtired states lead to.As with all informational books there are some things that I found conflicting with my other reads, on breastfeeding for example. We took from it what we felt comfortable with. Overall, we love this book and are so glad we have it. Baby girl is already 6 months old and we are still referring to it, just to make sure we are still on the right track and to see what's to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"READ THIS BOOK!!!","review":"Save yourself and your child some stress, read this book! It offers practical advice and information. It does not push any one approach. You will learn about developmentally normal sleep and wakefulness patterns, and how to recognize the sleepy state so that you can soothe your child to sleep before the overtired state kicks into gear. There are too many important pieces of information to put into a review, so I'll just tell you that I have a 6 month old who sleeps in her own crib (no crying-it-out required), awakens once to nurse, and sleeps for 11-12 hours each night. She is a delightful well-rested baby. This is great gift for any new parent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would recommend to all new parents","review":"A friend recommended this book to me and my husband when I was pregnant. Best gift ever. Although most of this seems like common sense, this book makes you realize that you are doing what is right for your child. Our child is 19 months old, and has wonderful sleeping habits. He has slept through the night since 5 weeks old, and I was nursing. Now our son knows when it is time to go to sleep and he never sheds a tear. He does the same for naps. I truly believe that we have helped him develop healthy sleep habits that will benefits him for as he grows up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book","review":"Love this book.

The methods for helping your child sleep are fantastic. The only problem is that the book is so poorly written that you need to read it several times in order to get ALL the important info out. If you don't spend the extra time with it you may miss vital information, such as this method should create very little or no crying if you pay attention to your child and the clock.

Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Regular naps...at last!","review":"My daughter never showed the classic signs getting overly tired and I would repeatedly wait too long before getting her down for her naps which then in turn resulted in short naps. This book gave me a great starting point to really exam our routine and make it better. Now I make sure to follow her wake/sleep patterns and not to follow what is convenient for me. I thought the routine from the \`Baby Whisper' book which had worked up to 4 mo. would continue to do so but it didn't leave enough time for daytime naps after her feedings started to get spaced apart. Now Tessa has regular naps thanks to the advice in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"explains the importance of sleep thoroughly","review":"He makes many valid points backed up by his sleep research. There is a whole chapter on colic and sleeping that I read a few times. He doesn't explain what to do with colic babies and sleeping prior to 4 months, but does talk a lot about sleep training after that time. We haven't implemented any training yet as he's not at that point yet so I can't say if his methods are successful or not. But I agree how important sleep is to children and hopefully when we do try it it only takes the \\"week\\" that he claims it will take!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the most helpful baby gift I received!!!","review":"I received this book as a baby gift a month before my son was born - and it has been a WONDERFUL resource. I now buy it as a baby gift for all of my friends when they have babies. My son is now a year old...I followed the book's ideas starting around 4 months, and my son is a fantastic sleeper. There were times throughout when I questioned if the tips the book gave were actually going to work in the long run...but I can honestly say my son sleeps so well, and I credit it all to this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the paper it's printed on","review":"Wow.

First off, Dr. W. says that the first nap should occur at 9:00 --- try keeping your 5-month old awake from 5:00 or 6:00 for 3 hours (Dr. W. suggests keeping the baby up for only 1 hour after waking!). Don't waste your money on this. I have found that, like many other issues that test our patience, you just need to do what will work for you. After all, 30 years ago no parent read a book on how to feed, bathe, or get their babies to sleep!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't 'train' MY DOG this way!","review":"Establishing a relationship of love and trust and fostering feelings of self-confidence and self-worth in my child is, for our family, more important than 'training' an infant to sleep when and how I want him to. It does sound convenient, but I am past the dolls' stage....My son is 14 months and has just started sleeping 12 hours straight, with no training whatsoever involved. It was just time. He has no separartion anxiety, doesn't hate bedtime or his bed, is a happy toddler and, get this, a very independent child too. We would never let him cry, we respect him as a human being.Letting your child cry until they vomit is simply abuse. I feel for all these poor infants who are subjected to this cruel method, and boy am I glad Weissbluth didn't raise me!This book belongs in the garbage, with its author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuk! (wish I could give it 0 stars!)","review":"I was given this as a gift and when I read it, I nearly threw it out the window.This book discourages breastfeeding and co-sleeping and promotes infant crying-it-out and schedules...while disguising the technique as gentle and natural (and claiming not to promote schedules or crying). It actually implies that forcing your one-month old infant to cry themselves to sleep is what the baby WANTS.The statement \\"Crying is the consequence of becoming overtired\\" is repeated throughout. Perhaps the child is unhappy, hungry, or any number of other causes beside fatigue. It also warns the reader that if the techniques aren't followed you may end up with a \\"24-hour child\\"....uh, since when does parenthood stop at 8pm?"},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE DON'T FOLLOW WHAT THIS BOOK HAS TO SAY!","review":"I'd have given this book no stars if I could've. I have to admit that I didn't read this whole book. It was given as a gift to me for my baby shower. But when I turned to the page in the book where it says there should be no time limit to how long you let your baby cry it out, I'd had enough. I wouldn't treat an animal this way, so why would I do this to my beautiful son? Why would I even risk making him feel that he is alone in this big world that he's only been in for a short time when he is so loved and has every right to feel that way? I'd like to think I have an open mind, but this goes against every natural instinct I have. There are better and gentler ways of helping your child (and yourself) sleep.. please trust your intuition and find other ways.. be creative. By the way, I slept with my grandmother for my first 8 years, and I am well-adjusted with a healthy level of independence."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!","review":"Follow this book if you want to ease your mind about neglecting your child. This book contains some really terrible suggestions and may seriously damage your trust relationship with your child.A crying infant should always be attended to.

I don't know how any parent could sleep at night if they follow the advice in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"It horrifies me to think that a new parent would take this Dr.'s advice!

I hope that no child has to undergo his methods."},{"rating":"2","title":"This saved my sanity (and probably my marriage)","review":"I can't say enough good things about this book. I read it when my son was 5 months old. Prior to that, he 'napped' during the day for about 30 minutes at a time and screamed the rest of the day and night. Turns out, he was seriously over tired and all of my attempts to get him to sleep were actually adding to the problem. The day I put the advice in this book into action, my life changed. I am actually able to enjoy my son. Buy it. Buy two just in case you lose the first one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended above all other trendy sleep books","review":"I've read all the top books - Secrets of the Baby Whisperer, Babywise, Sleeping Through the Night, and Solving Your Child's Sleep Problems - but none is as effective in communicating good habits as Weissbluth's book.Although all of the books profess a schedule, Weissbluth regularly intertwines real baby problems and how to solve them. He gives examples of what works and what does not in a manner that is not highly technical, but is still research based. Healthy Sleep Habits seemed to have much more substance that the fluff in other sleep books. At that same time, it was also gentler than the controversial Babywise approach.After a week of trying the strategies presented here, I was able to get my 4 month old to sleep through the night. The bags under my eyes thank Weissbluth for this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best sleep book available","review":"After many recommendations, I bought this book and found it to be very helpful. At five and a half months, my son is going down to sleep for the night at 6pm and sleeping until 5:30/ 6:00 am. We're still working on naps, but I've found that when I stick to the advice, things work well. What's particularly useful about this book is that it is broken down by age so you understand how much sleep your baby should have at each stage and what is going on with them. I've read many others, but this is the best and most practical of them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too harsh for my taste","review":"This book is a complicated discussion of sleep science. It also advocates more crying and ignoring a baby than I would be comfortable with. It seems a major ordeal to solve a process that is natural for a baby - learning to sleep. As babies get older they do learn to sleep better, forcing them to cry themselves to sleep at a young age to speed the natural process seems overly harsh and based on thinking of short term instead of building life long trust. Think I'll pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written/Edited!","review":"This book was horrible to read. It rambles and is very difficult to follow.

Clearly there was no editor working on this project"},{"rating":"1","title":"A harsh solution for a typical problem","review":"I find it hard to believe that any parents can be led to believe that letting their baby cry develops independence, as this author suggests. It reminds me of my grandmother's theory that crying exercises the lungs. Any book that recommends unlimited amount of crying, locked doors, crib tents, ignoring a baby's needs and ignoring a child's vomiting is not one that I can trust. Perhaps there are facts here, but they are overridden by harsh and insensitive methods to acheive the goal of independent sleep - no matter the emotional toll on the family. This book is old and the theories are outdated. I'm a fan of the No-Cry method, which uses a more sensative and loving approach."},{"rating":"1","title":"CIO method revised","review":"I just received this book today and have had it less than an hour. I'm returning it and getting my money back. The online reviews that I read were in favor of this book so I thought I would give it a chance. However, after reading a few sections and skimming others I'm not happy with it. Weissbluth has pretty much adapted the CIO method and wrote his own book. I'm just not into the CIO method and wanted other's who were reading the reveiws to know what they were getting into."},{"rating":"1","title":"You know it's cruel... but erratic as well","review":"Other than the heartwrenching instructions to let babies scream for hours (his hint: apply a liberal layer of zinc oxide to baby's bottom so he won't get diaper rash when you don't go to him at night to change his soiled diaper!), this book contradicts itself in several places. In big, bold letters: NEVER WAKE A SLEEPING BABY. Several pages later: Never wake a sleeping baby... UNLESS you are trying to get him on a schedule. Huh? Which is it?Also, this author insists that you should not \\"allow\\" a baby to remain awake for more than 2 hours at a stretch. I don't know how you would enforce that edict. (\\"I command you to sleep now!\\") If that worked, you wouldn't need this book.If you're a proponent of the crying it out method, I'm sure there are better books.

I'm a big believer in the family bed and it was great to see an expert supporting that choice while helping teach new parents how to teach their babies good sleep habits. Sleep is as important for moms as it is for their babies. By the time I bought this book (baby girl was 6 months), I was desperate for some sleep and my husband was hoping to get back into our bed.

More detail is definitely needed, which I found in Ferber's book.Between these two books, I found everything I needed to have a well-rested baby who naps twice a day and sleeps 11 to 12 hours straight each night, as opposed to waking every 2 to 3 hours for the first 6 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few good points in a very long book","review":"The amazon.com review written by H. Grable pretty much sums up all the important points in this book for you in one paragraph. The book itself is a long tedious read. I was getting no sleep with my child and this book just made me feel sleepier. It talks extensively about why sleep is so important and how unhealthy it is for children not to be getting good sleep which only made me feel bad. Our basic sleep dilemma was teaching our son how to soothe himself to sleep without props (rocking or nursing). This book offered little help with that other that cry-it-out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"Our baby did not sleep! She only slept when she was being held or walked around.

Provides you with detailed information of why sleep is so important for babies, toddles, children, and teens. You MUST be willing to put forth the practices it advocates and adhere to a schedule for your child. If you want to run errands all day with your 6 month old, and you are wondering WHY they aren't sleeping through the night, then you may want to alter your lifestyle before you buy this book.

It did make some valid points ( don't wake a sleeping baby and routine, routine, routine).

But, this book was the most practical, science-based and humane way to help your child sleep well. The idea is that the baby is deprived of development if not allowed to sleep. That was key to me. The baby doesn't have the instinct to go to sleep when tired since she/he is so eager to see you and spend time with you.

I thought this was even stricter and harsher than anything I've read by other authors - I'm sure you can figure out who I'm referring to.

So important for childrens health!","review":"I just purchased a new copy of this book for my 4th child because I couldn't find my old one and it was so worn I needed to replace it. Whether you have an easy baby or a colicky baby - and I've had a few of each- parents get so much out of this book! Dr. Weissbluth not only teaches parents so much about sleep in general, he offers parents wonderful advice about how to create good sleep habits so you can avoid overtired children and excessive crying. I didn't have his book until my first - a colicky baby - was 3 months and wish I'd had it sooner! For my twins his suggestion to look for sleep cue's and keep short intervals of wakefulness worked like magic. Most of my friends agree this is a book no new parent should be without. I believe the reason my older 3 children are such good sleepers and therefore usually so well rested and a pleasure to be with is because of what Dr. Weissbluth taught us!"},{"rating":"2","title":"master paediatrician provides outstanding guidance","review":"dr. weissbluth has written a superbly accessible book for parents. although the subject matter is sleep, between the lines he gives lots of useful information... and if sleep is good then waking hours are good too. conversly, if baby sleep is not protected and scheduled properly, nearly everything is worse. on a characterologic note, if you generally believe that there are right and wrong answers to linear questions, then this book and lifeplan will be a good fit. good words from a master paediatrician. if you are the kind of person for whom effort (not result) is the point to measure achievement, then weissbluth's observations are probably a tad too direct for your style... nevertheless, the information is correct and, for all reasonable purposes, unarguable."},{"rating":"2","title":"great advice - hard to read","review":"this book was recommended by several parents. it has some great information, but the writing and overall organization of this book make it a very hard read. it would be a much better book if it were organized by age, but instead you have to jump around to try to figure out what to do for your child depending on his/her age. we have been using the information to create our own sleep 'rules' and so far, we've been successful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Baby Sleep Book","review":"I ordered this book after weeks of sleepless nights and being close to losing my sanity with my first baby. This book gave clear, well-researched information on what a baby's sleep patterns should be like. It gave me a better understanding of the importance of establishing healthy sleep in infants and how to achieve that practically. It also gave me reassurance on letting my baby cry and that it was okay because I was trying to establish healthy sleep for my baby - which is vital for her growth and development. I found this book very well-balanced and unbiased (not colored by any particular parenting philosophy -- the main emphasis being good sleep habits). The book could be a little more well-organized - there are so many nuggets of helpful advice that you have to look for. Another good thing about the book is parents' testimonials on how they got their child to sleep - they are encouraging and reassuring. Definitely order this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too much data","review":"I minored in psychology--so I am used to reading research, but this was not what I was looking for in a book to help my infant sleep.

We desperately needed a plan that would help us all sleep better since I'm going back to work in 2 weeks. I first had to get over my anxiety about letting the boys cry. Then, had to believe in Dr. Weissbluth's research. After getting past MY insecurities and sticking to Dr. W's plan, we are on the right track. It is not easy to let them cry, but I know that they will cry more in the long run had we not employed this method.This book is the best I've read on sleep training. I skipped the first section (briefly skimmed) and got to the real heart of the matter in Part II. I would highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard To Follow","review":"I found the book very hard to follow. My daughter is 6 mos. old and we are researching different opinions to decide how we want to handle her sleep issues.

Weissbluth is a genius. His monthly guides that help you as a parent understand your child's sleep patterns are essential. When I was ready to have my children learn to sleep on their own, his book was filled with anecdotes that I could use to guide me. Both of my children (3 and 4) sleep 10-12 hrs at night and 1-3 hrs in the afternoon thanks to his book. They were sleeping through the night at 3 mths (even while nursing), and they had daily nap schedules as little as 3 mths too. This book is by far the best investment we made as a family!"},{"rating":"1","title":"From a novice beader","review":"I found this book a little skimpy for the price. As a novice, I found a lot of information that was useful but still didn't feel ready to start a project. The glossary of \\"standard terminology\\" was exactly 11 items, including the information that a bracelet is 7\\" long and goes on your wrist. In a book only 44 pages long, I think there is more important information to include.I think you'd be better of surfing the web for instructions.That said, there were some nice illustrations of the standard tools and clasps, etc. Overall, this book was useful but in no way complete."},{"rating":"1","title":"I echo the above reviewer...","review":"This book explains knotting fairly well.

There's nothing revelatory about this film. If you're familiar with Tupac already, you'll see nothing new or even that interesting. If you're not already familiar with Tupac, you're better off sticking to old magazine and newspaper clippings.As far as the making of the film itself, it's just home movies and interviews smashed together incoherently, with no intent of getting a message or overall thought to the viewers.

Tupac is one of my favorite artist, but I don't see him as more, or less, than he was. Some have said that he basically invented gangsta rap. Not true. Arguably, it was Ice-T and N.W.A. who first started playing what became known as gangsta rap. Ice's first album came out around 1987, and Tupac's not until 1991. While Tupac is admirable, to utter mistruths is just as wrong as uttering mistruths about Eminem. Some kids believe he created rap music. So about \\"Resurrection,\\" there have been many documentaries about Tupac's life, and so I shall reserve my rating for this one for after I have seen it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"This movie or documentary is a waste of time...plain and simple.Tupac, what did you expect?

I am very impressed by the way this movie was put together, to have everything in his own words was a real highlight and this is by far the most comprehensive release about him. This movie really gives people an idea of who Pac was, and how he came up while also showing his motivation, struggles, ambitions and influences. I liked the numerous pictures of Pac at different stages of his life and the fact that his own music serves alot of the movies background. The special features menu is full of gems, my personal favourites are the never before seen interviews, and the section entitled \\"Remembering Tupac\\" which has music artists, family and friends recollecting. Today (June 16th) is the day Tupac was born, highly recommend getting this DVD for the collection whether your new to Pac or have followed him since his first album like myself.

The Norton Utilities don't add anything to the existing built-in tools of XP (in fact, the disk optimizer is far worse).

There were numerous complaints about this from purchasers of Norton AntiVirus, so I'm assuming this is the particular piece of the package that causes the problems.#2: I upgraded to DSL about a week after installing SystemWorks, and the trouble really hit the fan then. DSL safety also required that I install a firewall, and Norton seems to have no idea how to handle this very well.I'm not a techie, and my advice would be to find something else unless you've got some serious PC skills.

They sure have a great web site to look for all the problems you might have, but what if you are really really not in the mood to scramble through the tons of written material, or in a hurry? Try to get to the \\"contact\\" page. All I wanted was a place to e-mail a question about why the damn program would not open up, and an hour later, I was no farther along than when I started. Service, to me, means that you really stand behind your product, and want to have contact with those who are having a difficult time with it. Service to me means that you want to open up all the road blocks rather than make more. Service to me, means you want to talk with the customers, help them find soulutions to make the product work, not create problems.

So I go to Amazon and find it, but the replacement bluetooth is nothing like the original. It is noisy, lousy audio quality, no background noise silencer, and no one can hear me. Stick with other LG products, but not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I ordered two of these at the same time, one for myself and one for my wife. Neither has been satisfactory, each for its own reasons.The multi-function button on the first one was difficult to push and required too much pressure on the in-ear speaker, making the headset uncomfortable to use. Any background noise rendered voice commands completely inoperable -- not that they worked well even in a quiet room. Finally, after about 6 weeks of light use, it simply quit working ... period!The second one seemed to have none of the problems of the first, but one evening I forgot to remove it when visiting a family member. I put it into my pocket, sat down to eat dinner, and when I got up the speaker had just snapped off.Think I'll try something different this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product & very quick service","review":"Received this order in just a few days.....product was factory sealed and in excellent conditon. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly designed/no noise suppression","review":"I tried this headset for 2 days. The first day, I thought I would like it. However, the second day, I couldn't keep it on my ear. The earpiece swivel had loosened so much that it would twirl around too easy. Every time I moved, the earpiece would slide and the headset would practically fall off my ear.Regarding the advertised noise suppression, I don't think it exists. I previously had a Motorola H500, which doesn't advertise noise suppression. My callers would say that this headset was worse that the old one. Any wind at all, and the caller would not hear my voice.I returned this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it supposed to work?","review":"My brother bought this headset for me a little over a month ago. At first I loved it. I ranted and raved about it, until the 30th day or so when it would not power up! I kept trying and trying, I figured maybe my outlet had a short or something. I didn't want to thinkn it was my new headset. It finally powers up and I am in love again! Well now, it continuously disconnects itself from my phone. I have to try connecting it again and I get \\"connection failed\\", I try it again and it connects just fine. The only problem now is that I can't hear anything once my call is connected. I am very disappointed and I am past my return time on the item. I don't recommend this item at all.It is lightweight and very compact also when it works, the clarity is excellent but that is a big WHEN."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor performance, uncomfortable","review":"I bought this headset to use with my TMobile MDA and HATED it. I used it for almost a whole month, giving it a chance to operate in all conditions and environments and it never worked well - so it went back. The voice dialer was atrocious, it cold not recognizae even the simplest of commands and kept misdialing names that were not even close. The piece that goes behind the ear gets very uncomfortable very quickly as it cuts into your head behind your ear because it is so skinny. I need a reliabile headset for business use and this one did not cut it at all. Got a Jabra instead and love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I cant say anything against this one","review":"The first day i wore it i got compliments from two complete strangers (It Might be me also!)

As an adult, recently, I used the power of the Internet to find myself a copy, and I found I enjoyed it every bit as much now as in my childhood. This is the perfect \\"round the campfire\\" book. Bring it along on a camping trip and read a few of the tales aloud at night by firelight. It is nearly guaranteed to send a chill up your spine. It's interesting to me that someone else mentioned the \\"high-pitched whistle and dog\\" story as one of the most memorable. (Is that creepy or what?) It was my most memorable as well, but every story in the book entertains and spooks.

I am right there with Paula- the whistle story stuck with me more than the rest! I can hardly wait to read it again!

Those actors and actresses are so bad to a degree beyond your imagination. I've never seen any Chinese movie so bad so far until now. I want my money back but I know it's impossible.If all the movies turned out to be so bad and could still be called 'movie', then the movie business might not survived another 3 months.But one good thing might happen though if all the movies turned out being so bad:The movie piracy business would also come to an end, because nobody would buy anything anymore from the black market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spring popped out","review":"After screwing in 5 or 6 screws the spring popped out and then the screws wouldnt hold anymore.

The website is difficult to navigate; there is no on-line support other than a \\"virtual\\" assistant--no live on-line help. The company discourages telephone support: there is no 800 number. Customers must pay to call in to a west coast number, and there is a warning that wait times could be extensive. I do not find them at all user-friendly, and for that reason will not renew my subscription when it expires."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy It - You'll Regret It!","review":"I would advise anyone considering buying this useless piece of crap to avoid it like the plague.NIS 2003 has caused no-end of problems on my previously stable and smooth running system since its installation a month ago. Worst of all you can't get rid of the thing. Neither its own uninstaller nor Windows uninstaller will remove it completely and as a consequence of it burrowing into Windows registry files when you finally DO get them off, you are left with gaping holes and a wrecked OS. I am left looking at a reformat and full re-installation of Windows XP thanks to this piece of s***. I would also add that Symantec's website is useless and a premium rate support line is an insult to their customers. I will never buy anything from Symantec again. If you need a Firewall get the excellent Zone Alarm from Zone Labs. Even the free download version is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware Norton Internet Security Updates!","review":"I echo the experiences of other reviewers who have suffered at the hands of Symantec's sloppy programming and poor customer service. I downloaded an update for NIS 2002 which rendered the program incapable of displaying images on a web page. Their so-called \\"solution\\" required users to hand type long web addresses into a dialog box on a page by page basis to permit what they called referral information. Not only didn't it work consistently on a given page, every page on that same website had to be programmed for viewing individually. In other words, I paid for the program and now I have to do their software programming for them as well. I don't think so. It doesn't matter if NIS 2003 would solve the problem (I don't know). It's their insulting corporate attitude that's the problem.I bought McAfee Internet Security instead of renewing with Symantec. It works perfectly and its features are superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont buy it - I hope 2004 Version Works","review":"Install on Win ME was a living hell.

It has almose every useful feature one may need: antivirus, internet firewall and parental control, and they are all very easy to configure and use. It's really powerful and affordable, and I do recommend.The only thing I am not happy with is that it makes some internet connections much slower. The web page loading speed is OK, since the traffic for that is very little. But I need to connect to my Unix workstations using ssh and some x-win client software, which are annoyingly slowed down. Of course, this can be overcomed by turning off the firewall temporarily when you need to work in such a way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best protection offered","review":"If you realize the risk that goes with using the Internet you probably have this already.

I then logged myself off XP and logged onto XP again as this \\"Supervisor\\". Suprisingly, it worked.

Everytime I got near one I'd have to fight an elf or something, which lowered my energy so I couldn't beat bosses.

I read this with wishes that an adult novelization would come out. The book is very simple and short with a lot of adventure and action, little dialog. The book has very little character development, basically you don't get any feel for any of the characters at all. I would say seeing the movie before reading this book makes it better since you can put the actors wonderful job to the book, but without it, it's very bland. Though I would bring this book home for the young one in the family who wanted to see the movie but was scared by the skeletons, this would be the perfect thing to calm their dissipointment until the movie is on video."},{"rating":"1","title":"HATEING!!!!!","review":"Do not waist your time on this!

Even though the movie and book were exciting, they are not factual. For instance, pirates never made people walk the plank. That was invented by the person who wrote PETER PAN, I think. If pirates did not like their captains or certain crew members or passengers, they just threw them overboard. Also, most pirates did not have battles at sea, because their ships were wooden and could easily catch fire. And pirates usually did not know how to swim. Read PIRATES by Karen McWilliams. It tells the facts. Also, read The Diary of a Slave Girl, Ruby Jo that is about the time Blackbeard and 400 men held Charleston, SC hostage. They didn't torture anyone, and the book is a good story based on nonfiction facts. There are other pirate books that are good and factual too."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least it had pictures...","review":"When I first saw the trailers for the movie, I thought \\"Well, this sounds interesting, but Disney??\\" I saw the movie and it instantly became a new favorite. Then I rec'd the book. Words fail me. I recognize that it is a junior version of the story and therefore should be 'calmed down' from the movie version... but what age group was the author attempting to cater to? The writing was stiff, stilted, banal and uninteresting. Even if I had nothing to compare it against I would have had a difficult time yawning through it. Nothing captured the spirit of the movie, and the characters were all cardboard imitations. It's not worth the paper it was printed on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Altered for the worst.","review":"\\"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Junior Novelization\\" is quite a letdown. Although I am not within the targeted age bracket, I still can imagine how I would have reacted after reading this book: disappointed. Disney turned their famous ride into a fun movie, so one would think the junior novelization would have the same magic and humor. Wrong. Even though there was hardly anything offensive within the movie, the author cut scenes out. While one may think scenes were added, take a look at the \\"special features\\" on the \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" DVD, and you'll see where the extra dialogue and scenes came from. All of the memorable lines were deleted and substituted for others, which is disappointing. Nonetheless, you'll have pictures to look at while reading, so you can be reminded of the comical movie you've come to love. I do not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is Disney thinking?","review":"What was Disney thinking? After releasing such a terrific movie, you'd think they would have someone spend a bit more time and care in writing the novilization. Admittedly this book is intended for young readers, but even young readers have good taste - and that's not what they'll get with this book.The writing is stiff, unimaginative, and just plain boring. The characters are boring as well - one wonders why they even bother with the adventure.Sad to say, this book is simply not worth while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy Basket","review":"Don't buy this one.

Last time I was getting my laundry ready, I had trouble moving the wheels on the cart, only to discover one of them had already broken.

The canvas is cheap and thin. The metal frame tubing is also cheap. The worst problem however is the manner in which the components of the frame are held together.Frame joints are supposed to be held together by \\"expanding inserts\\" and screws. They simply do not work. This makes for a very wobbly frame that eventually just falls apart.

Well, there are some of these things in the video but they serve only as a background.

She spends way too much time discussing politically sensitive issues such as gay marriage and the right of natives for their land, but with very little content useful for tourists or people interested in Hawaii's sites. This is definitely not a travel guide.

Johannah stops every once in a while to explore love on a more human level with songs like \\"If Ever\\" and \\"For Better or For Worse,\\" but is always keeping an eye on heavenly things, as evidenced in a beautiful, modernized rendition of \\"Be Thou My Vision.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Mixing may be the best marriage mix","review":"A fine exploration of the dynamics involved in interfaith marriages, mainly between Catholic and Protestants.

It helps to flip them daily, but it's a pain in the butt.If you're considering buying these to use in the HCM-525 humidifier, you would do better to buy the HAC-514 from the same vendor and cutting them down to size.

In 55 short pages the author manages to remind us of all the common sense lessons that grandma gave us,while at the same time translating them into modern,everyday,scenarios that grandma may not have experienced.

It handles the job it was designed for well (home use), if you try to push the machine it just won't handle it well (and you my want a stronger machine for that). The belt sizes and disc size (along with the 1/3 hp motor) dictates the maximum stock sizes you should try to use with it. If you want to use it to sharpen tools instead of a grinder, it will do that also. Just be sure to remove all sawdust before you do, the metal sparks and filings could ignite inside the sander.

I'm an agnostic with strong atheistic leanings, but I still love good sacred or liturgical music, and this \\"Messiah\\" tops my list of such music. Unlike the usual fluffy recordings with huge orchestras, huge choirs, and huge vibrato, this one is lean and clean, with a laser-like clarity. But in spite of this reduced pomp, or perhaps because of it, it's thrilling. When the full chorus first comes in after several more subdued solo pieces, the effect is hair-raising.

Also, his sidekick Charlie Day attempts to keep him in line, but that's a tough task. It's a quick paced Film Noir with some great dialog.

I thouroughly enjoyed this game for all the reasons listed above."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is DIABLO 2 on GBA!","review":"This is one great game for the GBA, it is just like playing Diablo 2, you have 5 different characters to play, each with different abilities, powers and attacks among other things, you advance and kill/fight hundreds of enemies and get to pick up the goodies left behind like better weapons, armor, gems(which act like currency in the game) and more.You advance in levels and get experience, attribute points, skill points, you also have a screen where you can assign weapons, clothes, amulets etc to your character, also a backpack for the things you will find along the way.Fluid action is everywhere even when surrounded by orcs, the graphics are great, the sound is some of the best I have heard on the GBA using headphones, Multiplayer is also great, you can play with another player and beat the game, exchange weapons, armor and more.If you like Diablo 2, you will like Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers."},{"rating":"2","title":"an old time gamer","review":"great rpg! excellent game play and graphics. i have been playing video games since \\"pong\\" came out and this is one of the best adventure games around. combining a \\"gauntlet\\" style of play with an \\"eq\\" attribute manipulation feature is superb. i can highly recogmend this title."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good game","review":"I thought that this game was prety good for an rpg.

Therefore, I was simply ecstatic to learn that it was to be made into a movie trilogy and, subsequently, a large selection of video games. I would first like to say that I thought this was a good game. The enemies were relatively easy to defeat, but not so easy that it became boring. The addition of more difficult bosses like the cave troll and Lurtz the Uruk-hai also helped to make the game more interesting. Having said that, I also feel that the game was just a little too easy to beat; I beat it with all five characters exactly eleven days after I got the game, and I am accounted as being somewhat slow to beat a game. Also, the game has no replayability; once you have beaten it, there is no reason to go back and play it again, as it becomes very dull and uninteresting.

He would pull the lever, release the ball from the bag, it would sit right up on the tee, and he would hit away. He'd then gather the balls, put them back in the bag and start the process over.

This was followed by a couple of other science distortions before we got onto the NLP part of the book. I found the review of NLP to be cursory and incomplete. Nor were any new insights brought to light. Perhaps as much as 40% of the book (all 230 pages of it) was real or imaginary client interviews, which means a lot of white space.Save your time and your money.

For reasons not clear to me, the product began having problems in the 2002 version, and by this, the 2003 version, it became only marginally reliable. When it installs correctly, it works like a dream. But out of a dozen or so Win2000 and WinXP computers I've built in the past year, it has only installed on 5 of them. Add/Remove doesnt get rid of it after a failed install -- but Symantec graciously offers a webpage of 100 or so registry edits to get around that-- read it if you're considering the purchase as your likely future some Sunday afternoon.

It went OK until I updated using \\"Live Update\\". This brought the Win2K computer crashing to it's knees, requiring extraordinary efforts to recover - the only program that I have ever installed that managed to do that.

The program starts from windows XP and never gives you a chance to type any switchs that I could see.This is only one of 7 or 8 things they suggest you try, with the last being that you might have an incompatible network card.

Slow moving, hard to keep my attention. Watched for an Art assignment. I think it is a good movie though."},{"rating":"1","title":"SMOLDERING GLANCES AND SUGGESTIVE CONVERSATIONS LEAD TO NADA","review":"Sure, very cool. It is beautifully lit art on film, it's luminous. With dozens of scenes worthy of framing and mounting in galleries. And several artistic tropes like kitchen sinks, fluffy European countryside outfits, chillies, forgotten mirrors, color mixing palettes. Plus, some good ol' accordion music in the backdrop.All this produces the cinematic equivalent of window shopping. You can see it, but there's nothing to feel or experience. It's a chain of images of famous Vermeer works, and the historical detail is painstakingly realized.We get teasers of a budding love story, which gives us hope of an oncoming story, a theme. It never does. Oh yeah, it's supposed to work under the surface, but it ends up buried so deep that it's hard to believe. Smoldering glances and vaguely suggestive conversations lead to precious little.And then, thank you folks, it's time to go home. Which is where you should have been to begin with."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Slice of Domestic Drama from Another Time","review":"Viewing this beautiful little film, I was initially inclined to dismiss it because of the modesty of its ambition. (It provides a fictional background establishing why one of Vermeer's most famous portraits was painted.)Then, while watching the DVD's extra features, I listened in amazement as the film's producer described GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING as a \\"domestic thriller.\\" What a pretentious Hollywood ninny! That is exactly what this film ISN'T.What it IS is a slice of domestic history from another time and place, with marvelous cinematography and a great cast. And that is good enough!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely outstanding!","review":"If you liked the novel you are going to love this movie. I personally didn't see how they were going to make an interesting movie out of the book, even though I liked the book. But I was so very wrong! I was amazed by this film--quietly soulful and surprisingly powerful. The screenwriter director, art designer, and everyone else involved did a first rate job and you can really sense that it was a labor of love. The ending is subtle and amazing. Art lovers, especially, are going to be blown away by this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A picture is worth a thousand words.","review":"The beautiful setting is mesmerizing in this film. When the actors move around it's as if you're looking into a painting. Colin Firth makes for a smoldering Vermeer. His eyes and hands speak volumes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but an excruciating wait for the key scene","review":"I'm a Colin Firth fan. I'm a Scarlett Johansson fan. I figured \\"Girl With a Pearl Earring\\" would be a slam-dunk. At times though, watching 'Pearl' is like watching the paint dry on one of Vermeer's 35 paintings.I can appreciate the intelligent take on things. And, I understand about the need to set up the dramatic tension in the household and the repressed sexual chemistry between Griet and Vermeer. But not having Firth not utter his first word until 30 minutes into the film seems to be a waste of his talents, as does garbing him in an ill-fitting wig.The money shot is getting Johansson into the 'Pearl Earring' model pose. When the moment finally arrives, it's electric stuff. Without any specific effects at all, Johansson is the spitting image of Vermeer's original model. My protestations to the contrary, seeing that one moment of the film is worth the wait and the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"The only thing I thought was cool about this film was the cinematography and how much it looks like a Flemish painting of the time.Beyond that? Spoiler ALERT: there is no point to this. The movie sucked, adn after all this, they didn't even get it on??? Come on. No seriously, I'm all against gratuitous sex, but after the pain of this, it was all I had to look forward to.Oh, and Johanssen sucks. She plays the obstacle and never picks up her cues. Firth is alright, but the script sucks.I wish I was more eloquent with my language, but I don't think this movie deserves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough, Scarlett, enough!","review":"Am I the only person on the planet who's sick of this actress doing this silent-brooding-staring-into-space-or-at-the-floor-routine? Good lord, honey, lighten up. Let me know there's life in there. Is this all she knows how to do? I know this role doesn't call for \\"perky,\\" but couldn't she give some indication that she has a pulse?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Masterpiece","review":"Scarlett Johansson is a Vermeer with white powders on her face. Colin Firth is inspired by the young woman enough to star her in some of his most famous paintings. Vermeer's wife is jealous of all this attention to the young Scarlett (Greit) so she throws the common girl out of the house. That's is the plot of this movie. It's not much to drape a film about. The actors are reduced to standing around without expression in period garb.I liked the reproduction of a Dutch town with its dreary winter weather and it's conformity and modesty of female garb. Greit is lusty enough with her butcher boyfriend, but the love of her life, the great Vermeer, this doesn't get off the ground though there be much tormented bosom heaving. Colin Firth had the same facial expression of constipation in Bridget Jones Diary.Again, historically interesting, but not much to keep you absorbed for an hour-and-a-half."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vermeer in motion","review":"There are some movies where the photography is such, that we don't care about anything else. Some of Peter Greenaway's work comes to mind under that context.Take a great photography, exquisite play of light, meticulous recreation of the period, an absolutely adorable Scarlett Johanssen, and the result left me gaping for the whole time the movie lasted.In Hannibal, his nurse has this dream 'To see all existent Vermeer paintings, once\\" I now know why; I now share the same wish.The entire movie IS a Vermeer painting; the lighting is so carefully planned, from homes lit only from windows during the day, candles at night. The attention to detail, exquisite, from the knuckles on Ms. Johanssen's hands, to the manufacture of the pigments.A must for any DVD collector. I just loved this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sister Productions","review":"I've read reviews complaining about the movie's adaptation of the book. I absolutely loved both! As Tracy Chevalier said before the release of the movie, \\"[The book and movie] are like sisters rather than the same person, and complement each other rather than fight.\\" No they aren't the same thing, and yes I question some of the things they removed from the book, but this movie is still great.The casting was right on. Colin Firth is absolutely amazing in his role just as Scarlett Johansson is. Their chemistry is absolutely amazing. Additionally this movie is beautifully shot with lovely costumes and scenery. It made me look at the world differently for all of its complex colors."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Film or a Piece of Art?","review":"I saw GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING last evening. I left the theater enthralled by its beauty. I felt that I had seen a major display of the Vermeer style: the scenery, the colors, the detail of everyday living at Delft in the late 1660's and, of course, the girl herself. I thought only Scarlett Johansson could have played the role. We need more films of this quality!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Near-Perfect Adaptation Of An Imaginative Novel","review":"This entire movie LOOKED like a Vermeer painting brought to life, as if the long-ago figures immortalized by that Dutch master had somehow stepped onscreen. An amazing feat in and of itself. This is a faithful adaptation of Tracy Chevalier's novel of the same name, and it elaborates on what is known (i.e. nothing) about the model in the famous portrait, and in so doing the motion picture crafts an entire backstory to explain the creation of a haunting painting. This movie is also a skilled depiction of life in the Netherlands three and a half centuries ago, during the one and only time that nation was a world power. And let's not forget the fine performances here by Colin Firth, and of course a siren-like and yet skillfully subdued Scarlett Johansson. This is one to see!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't mind slow, but I do mind boring.","review":"Only positive was the quality of the casting- pacing was deadly slow, It took me 3 seperate tries to get through the film without falling asleep. (on a side note, if I were reviewing a sleep-aid this would be 5 stars all the way)I don't mind movies that move slowly but develop (Cohen's The Man Who Wasn't There) however Pearl Earring just kinda pokes along...This movie would appeal to the crowd that enjoyed Gosford Park in my opinion- one terrible movie in its own right. You want to see an entertaining movie out of the ordinary? The Royal Tennenbaum's or Amelie are two brilliant options for you...if you like bizarre Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind are some winners for you. I don't think the movie stunk- it was well acted, true to setting and good cinematography, it just didn't move me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unforgivable","review":"It appears that this delicious movie, made from the wonderful book, is being released as a DVD in the US (Region 1) with only the Director's Commentary and the widely seen Anatomy of a Scene.

Scarlett Johansson delivers a gripping performance. From the very beginning of the movie, you feel almost drawn to her. Indeed, she very well might have said fewer words than any actress ever in a leading role. Nevertheless, she commands attenttion in every scene. Her fawning silence envokes immediate sympathy for her unfortunate situation.

It is also very slow going.In a nutshell, a household maid becomes subject of the 17th-century title painting. There are a couple of love-triangles, and at one point, some heavy breathing in a clothed, standing position. Not much more to it than that, and it stretches out for 100 minutes. The movie is short on dialogue and big on gazes, looks, and camera movement.I like Scarlett, but there was not much material for her to work with in this movie. The others are mostly forgettable.The extras include a good behind-the-scenes \\"Anatomy of a Scene\\", and an out-of-place modern music video with Scarlett and a male musician who I don't recognize."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"The cinematography and costume design in this movie are brilliant but I got little else from it. I kept waiting for something to happen between Vermeer and Griet, but nothing ever does. I don't get what the wife gets so upset about either. Why even hide the painting from her? Nothing happens between the 2 of them! He needs to make money obviously and he does that selling paintings. His premier buyer wants her painted, he paints her. Why can he not tell his wife that? It's probably just me but I don't really get this movie. Oh and why would she turn down Peter's proposal? This movie just leaves a lot of unanswered questions and a lot left up to imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb and major artwork!","review":"It's difficult for me to be totally objective due the fact I have been all my life a hard fan of Vermeer. Her absolute domain of the color harmonies, the sharp contrast between the light cascades and his total domain of the fugue point is absolute.The film focuses around the simple but powerful anecdote , how this picture was done. Scarlett Johansson shines with her fantastic performance. Colin Firth is impressive too as the Delft ' s genius, but Tom Wilkinson is outstanding and deserves all the best comments.The illumination was made following the pictorial patterns, elegant, mysterious, enigmatic and sensual, a true visual feast, that complements a very artistic film."},{"rating":"1","title":"REALLY SLOW! REALLY BORING!","review":"obviously all the people that gave this movie 4-5 stars were asked to write positive reviews or read the book. this movie had so many wholes in it that i couldnt wait for it to end. the script was probably only two pages of diologue. you could literally watch this movie while cleaning the kitchen and doing the dishes with the sound off and still know what was going on.

First of all, you should always read the book first, before seeing the movie. This was quite possibly one of the worst reproductions of a book I have ever seen. I hate it when they do this.The novel is intricately wonderful and the film destroys it! If you are thinking about watching the movie, DON'T! Read the novel and be content with it.

Instead of coming to find out about America, like de Tocqueville, the author arrives with a bundle of preconceived notions, assorted prejudices, and a bushel of statistics. He doesn't seem to like America, or most Americans, very much. His interviews just don't ring true, and he just makes stuff up. I haven't been to Flint, Michigan lately, but I doubt you find elm trees lining the streets 40 years after Dutch Elm Disease moved into the midwest.

I would recommend watching several times in order to get a grasp of who each character is and what role they played.

Very strong movie, totally exposes Luther's thoughts, you can see from his earliest thoughts about the Catholic church, when he wasn't at peace with what he was taught there, the journey he took to rome to \\"increase his faith\\", the things he saw there and how the same catholic church pushed him to find his faith, Salvation Through Jesus Christ only, not by work, but by grace alone. (See Eph. 2:8-10)Very good movie to know about Luther and also about catholicism, the way both think.

A Christian nee Bergonian would be pleased (if such could be). However, reading Luther's writings makes any fiction about his life seem a simplification, yea, a distortion (and fiction this is).Some statements from Luther's character (such as, \\"You have laid hands on the crucifix, which could help someone in their faith.\\") will make any good Protestant question a repeat showing.It's what you might imagine from the Lutherans, Luther being the runner-up to Christ in their estimation, if not higher.

It touches upon most, but not all, the major areas of his life. It does a good job of showing how he went from law school, to Augustinian monk, to a pilgrimage to Rome, to protesting the excesses of the Vatican. It captures his stormy personality well. To get some historical insight, it is an excellent movie. It is not Terminator, no buggy chases or bow/sword fights. I doubt seriously if Hollywood could make a film like this today that actually told a story without adding excessive violence, sex, or somehow making him a new age evangelist..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Provides a good introduction to Reformation issues","review":"I enjoyed this video. It doesn't paint either Martin Luther or the Catholic church as either a saint or a villain. It does show the corruption that all churches can sink to if they become self centered and self reliant. It also has a lot of insight into how believers should thoughtfully compare either their own life or current church practises with the scriptures."},{"rating":"2","title":"True to life biography offers hope, encourages faith","review":"This old, black and white movie comes to life with no need of color or pro-logic sound. It is the story of a monk who would one day change the future of Western Civilization.Luther stands against all odds to profess his faith, and stand for freedom to believe, freedom to love, and freedom to com to God without mortal fear.

MIA, the cd which gathers together their essential output (go get germicide and all the bootlegs!!!),is a non-stop lesson in humility for anyone who wanted to start a punk band. lead screamer Darby Crash and guitarist Pat Smear were the Lennon-MCcartney of punk rock. i fell in love with this cd ten years ago and i STILL listen to it more than any other cd i have. uber-punk Darby wrote incredible lyrics and Pat wrote the book on fast, hardcore punk guitar. drummer Don Bolles brought things up to SPEED and bassist Lorna Doom kept it all in the garage, plunking away and making sure we all knew what DIY meant. i've listened to EVERYTHING, and i always go back to MIA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great early hardcore band","review":"Darby Crash had a lot of energy and this was a great early L.A. punk band.

Pat smear who later would be in Nirava and then the Foo Fighters plays guitar. Too bad about darby dying cause he was an awesome punk rock singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"essential early SoCal hardcore","review":"The Germs were, in my opinion, one of the great and essential American punk bands. Their sound was a particularly primitive stripped down three chord punk; listening to them it sounds as if they could barely play when they started. No matter - neither could other punk legends like Sid Vicious or the Ramones, both of whom were obvious influences here. The other obviously key part of their unique sound is singer Darby Crash. Darby was no poser; for him, punk was a total way of life, one to which he committed his (short lived) life. On songs like What We Do is Secret, Richie Dagger's Crime or Lexicon Devil, you can hear the power of his vocalizing; and you can also hear a deeply buried but inherent tunefulness, deep within the musical muck.The Germs may have been one of rock's more delf-destructive units, but no matter. Listening here, you can begin to understand why they mattered, and why they have influenced so many bands that followed in their wake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sick to my stomache","review":"My coworker walked in while i was playing this disc, and he said it made him sick to his stomache listening to it. rad sh*t man...hehe...in all seriousness this is a great disc, if your a fan of the old school cali punk style, raw, simple, and f**kin hardcore youll like this disc. His vocals are so raw and sometimes sickening it actually soundsl ike hes throwing up sometimes. only negative to the disc is they have a few on here that are lower quality recordings of tracks, but if that doesnt bother you then i say buy it, my fav tracks are communist eys, what we do is secret, we must bleed, and lexicon devil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Piece of PUnk History","review":"Well, this is truly one of the best Punk records ever!

It includes two of their early singles and the classic (GI) Germs Incognito L.P. along with some later recordings. The thing that makes the (GI) L.P. important is that it is the birth of american hardcore punk rock. Before The Germs (GI), there were no hardcore records (except for the Middle Class E.P.). Sure, The Germs are looked at as a punk band now, but if you listen to (GI) and you KNOW hardcore, you will be amazed by the originality of this band and their inventiveness at the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"like minor threat. hate the ideology. go with the germs","review":"darby crash is a martyr, and a genius. he's one of the most unique punk lyricists, and the germs are truly an original band. if you hate the straight edge movement you'll love the germs."},{"rating":"2","title":"IHATEPOSERS, ANTIFLAG, AND CRASS","review":"mmmm, not bad. pretty good. not what i would typically listen to. i really like em tho. although if you are looking for tech skills, you will not find it with the germs. especially live as shown in \\"sex boy\\" they are from L.A :) and they play almost pre punk stuff. they even did a chuck berry cover. i love songs like \\"what we do is secret\\" and \\"media blitz\\" good album. you really realize how short the germs lasted when you really think that this is almost everyhting they ever did.... crazy. too bad darby didn't have more self control. these guys aren't brutal tho. so idk if streetpunk fans would like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Whiny nasally nonexistent vocals over incredibly lifeless riffs.

The fit and finish is very poor. In assembly, the manufacturer stripped the socket of a set screw securing the depth stop. I cannot get it out to replace it with a new one.The shaft on the hold down is machined crooked and when you use it to hold down a board, one end touches the board, and the other end is approx 3/8\\" above the board. Overall, parts don't fit together very well at all.I made one cut with it using a 5/16\\" chisel, and it performed fair, considering the bits that came with the unit.I really hate this but it seems Delta is going the same direction with tool quality as Craftsman. Most of my stationary tools in my shop is Delta and I have been quite satisfied with them in the past.Like I say, I'm returning it Monday morning, and ordering the more expensive unit made by Powermatic. I'll be commenting on that unit when I receive it."},{"rating":"1","title":"mortiser","review":"Anyone who has setup and used a drill press mortiser would be attracted to these mortisers. That and the FWW review are why I purchased the mortiser to make doors...much to my surprise the mortiser would not accept a piece wider than 4.75\\". After fabricating some spacers to fit between the base and neck I was able to get the 5\\" that I needed. Admittedly my fault for overlooking this, but it would have been good to incorporate this capability into the design. One other problem was the quality of the chisels, very poor edge, with much difficulty was able to mortise Poplar after predrilling. Now that I know other higher quality chisels are available, that problem should be solved. Depending on your use (light duty) it could be an adequate machine with the right chisels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to setup, hard to keep setup","review":"I don't like to use Allen wrenches to do adjustments, but the Delta unit requires use of them a lot. The set screws are of poor quality, too, and have a hard time staying put. I found that the depth adjustment stop didn't stay, so soon I was mortising deeper than I had wanted. A real pain! Also, the Delta unit tended to make a lot more noise than I would expect a mortiser to make.I've seen that the Jet unit (around the same price as the Delta) is easier to setup, runs quieter, and stays setup properly.I love my Delta table saw, but I'd steer clear of this mortiser and get the Jet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works, but I wouldn't buy it again","review":"I also have had problems. I have used this tool for several projects, but the fence broke when backing out the 1/2 inch chisel from oak (I use multiple passes now, going a little deeper each time). And the set screw holding the chisel deforms the chisel so that it is almost impossible to remove from the tight fitting bushing. I have had to use a wrench to remove chisels, and then had to sand/grind the chisel smooth again to reuse. Finally, the cheap plastic grip has worn through. On the other hand, I can't fault the mortises it makes. Delta makes good tools, but I'd try a Jet on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delta 14-650X review","review":"I had three problems with this unit. First, the poorly cast fence was not square to the table, allowing the work to rock during the mortising action, yielding mortises that were not square.

And third, the chuck and key were poor quality with poor fit and rough action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating set up","review":"For some reason, I can get the 1/2\\" bit to work fine, but I've spent several frustrating hours try to get the other bits to work--no luck yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Think I Will Continue Using My Drill Press Mortiser","review":"After reading your reviews on the Delta Mortising Tool I think I will continue Using my craftman drill press with mortising atachment.

Of course, two episodes of 100 minutes each cannot possibly cover Napoleon's life and career in much detail, but this certainly hits the high points.I have only two complaints: first, the same music--\\"Viva, viva!\\"--is used over and over and over. There is an abundance of great French, Austrian, Russian, and British music from the period which would have served nicely, rather than just re-use the same piece. Second, the re-enactments were too small-scale and generally lame. License some scenes from larger scale movies!

However, at the very end, Justine drives to the Burning Man festival, and most of footage from there is completely inappropriate - lots of gratuitous, pointless nudity.

Since the dressage portion was not covered on television it is covered only briefly in this tape, with the stadium jumping given the most complete coverage. The short clips of dressage that are included are mostly ruined by a graphic strip showing olympic information, which is generally placed directly over the legs of the horse...so intricate dressage moves are not even visible. There is wasted footage of riders waving following a dressage test, when more full coverage of the actual performance could have been included.If you were looking for more complete coverage of events ignored by television, you won't find it on this tape.

It was a waste of money, because this video did not show much that I hadn't already seen.NBC obviously did not do their homework when putting this video together. What little dressage is seen in this video is mostly covered by a graphic giving the rider's stats; the upper body of the rider is all that can really be seen, not the movement of the horse. Even a novice like myself knows that the audience mostly wants to watch the horse.Cross country and stadium jumping are also included. The clips seem to be put together randomly. There was no cohesion. At the end of this video, I felt as if I could have produced a better, more interesting look at the equestrian games by myself.I hope in 2004 NBC bothers to consult someone when editing the equestrian portion of the games.

Schaeffer Trilogy: Three Essential Books in One Volume"},{"rating":"1","title":"Coming of the Abomination : agenda for Escape from L.A.","review":"Here we have Schaeffer again, but this time without a hidden agenda, but with overt nakedness. The fundamentalist has come out. Schaeffer exposes his visions, how society should be, with all puritan, Christian-only principles. If you have seen the film Escape from L.A. (1996) with Kurt Russell, and how the society, under a puritan / calvinist president is depicted, then beware and know that the forces towards this dictatorship are at work. Read this book to discover the agenda of the Christian right, and why you should not only not vote Republican, but oppose the Republicans. Let's hope Bush will not listen to much to the Christian lobby, which unfortunately already represent a strong part of the Republican party. Because after reading A Christian Manifesto by Francis Schaeffer you will know what to expect - and fear as a nightmare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essentially Wonderful!","review":"I bought this as a gift for my friend for his almost here baby.

I also love that your hands are free when you wear it and that your cell phone is easily accessible.

If I were to go out for a longer trip, I would likely use one of my other bags for the more roomy features. However, this is perfect for the 1-3 hour trips out.It is also very cool and urban looking. My husband doesn't mind wearing it. I have gotten many compliments on it and also from people who had no idea that it was a diaper bag!The one thing that it lacks is a changing pad. However, I use a receiving blanket to put the baby on instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very functional","review":"We originally ordered this bag so that my husband wouldn't feel like he was using a purse for a diaper bag. I fell in love with it too. It is hands free and there is a place for my wallet and cell phone. This bag is perfect for short trips or a meal out. All the separate compartments really keep you organized. The only problem we had was the stitching on the outer flap of the diaper compartment was too close to the edge and the material starting fraying and essentially falling apart. I loved the bag so much that I thought I would give it another try and have not had any problems with the new one. I am hoping that it was just a fluke. I prefer this bag over my other 2 diaper bags HANDS DOWN."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the desing, TERRIBLE QUALITY","review":"This is a really nice looking bag, great for short trips, but the material tears easily. I only had it for a few months and it started to tear inside.Another big problem is that the top pocket closes only with velcro that tends to open if held upsidedown.

A good thing, too, cuz Williams delivers some awesome chill-out tracks that would make them proud. Although, of course, the bad side to that is, some will accuse him of ripping off their sound--but, hey, is that really a bad thing?

Actually it's pretty amazing for the price. Other reviews have complained that the string broke, so he waxed the string right away to preserve it, and it has lasted three weeks through some pretty heavy use. The other complaint seems to be that it's hard to string it, which is true, but he learned to do it by himself by bracing it with his feet. As others have said, this is not a toy.

Yes the tips have come off some of the bolts (dug them out and back on they went). Yes, the string and plastic piece on end that holds the string also broke, but for $3 you can get replacement pieces. No you can't shot straight for more than 20 feet of so. If you are looking for a professional hunting bow, well obviously this is not the buy for you, but if you are looking for a few hours of fun shooting, it is well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"string broke","review":"I bought this at a flea market and I didn't expect something amazing but i wanted something that i could shoot at a card board box as soon as I opened it the cross bow was fine but i spent 4 hours at my grandmas trying to put the string on. the string was too short and i tried my hardest to get it on and my dad helped me and was put on half way but it was tight and stayed on. i had a hard time pulling it back but i got it so i went to shoot it out side and it shot hard. it spun in mid air but it still went far. i went to pull it back again and it snapped so i am going to find a better string hopefully dont wast your money buy a gun that has a company and don't waste your money buy a cobra crossbow pistol those are even better. if the string improved i would really like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"CROSSBOW","review":"U get what you pay for......that is all i can say really.It shoots straight for the first 5 feet but after that watch out"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fluffy PR","review":"Read more like a press release or company-paid pr fluff than a detached history of the company.

His seeming fascination with making sure that you know the race and/or religion of the characters (at least if they are Black or Jewish) seems to hover just above the strata occupied by alleged reformed sleazeballs like the KKK's David Dukes.

Sometimes, my daddy's a tree.\\") Then on the next page a great illustration of the pose and how to do it.

Be warned - this is B-movie material. Bad effects, corny acting, etc. It seems a lot of people have confused the two. It's really a shame the producers of this film would stoop so low."},{"rating":"1","title":"As a Steampunk movie I kinda liked it","review":"I recorded the movie from Satellite and watched it later on. As a Steampunk movie, I kind of liked it and it gave me some ideas for Steampunk equipment and storylines. As a Sherlock Holmes movie, it tried, but was marginal. I think it was the actor who portrayed Holmes, he was nowhere near up to the standards of others who have played Holmes. It is worth watching if you can catch it for free on one of the movie channels or network movies, but I wouldn't pay money for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guilty pleasure","review":"If your idea of Sherlock Holmes adheres only to a strict visualization of the stories as written by Doyle then you aren't going to like this movie. But if your Holmes has a little wiggle room to be young or old, manic or calm, brooding or almost affable, then you might look upon it as a guilty pleasure. I will dwell on the positives. It moves quickly so we were never bored. The chemisty between Holmes and Watson is well done. Their relationship is close without being slashy. Much of it takes place outdoors, eliminating the claustrophobic feel of limited funds for sets. The music is lively, pleasant. There's a lot of humor, especially in the banter between Holmes and Watson. And well, yes, there's a dinosaur, and other assorted mechanical monsters and contraptions (think Wild Wild West movie) if you like your fantasy on the surreal side. I liked it. It's got a heart, as another reviewer noted. I would much rather see a sequel of this than one of the Guy Ritchie film."},{"rating":"1","title":"dreadful incomprehensible steampunk","review":"This movie has an almost incomprehensible plot involving Inspector Lestrade, who just keeps popping up for no apparent reason and a bunch of mechanical dinosaurs.The visual look and tone seems to be a low budget effort to take advantage of the current steampunk craze. Nothing works here. The story is lame. The special effects are preposterous. The acting pathetic. This movie is a waste of time and money. If you want some Holmes action, wait for the much better Robert Downey Jr. movie to come out."},{"rating":"1","title":"just from the Asylum!","review":"One has to know Asylum home entertainment to appreciate such a film. Definitely dreadful but sometimes funny in its own way. I could not recommand it. Definitly not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse then expected","review":"I had hoped \\"Can Holmes save London from dinosaurs?\\" would be a rip-off of a Professor Challenger tale with Holmes replacing Doyle's other series character. No such luck. The dinosaurs turn out to be robots created by a previously unknown brother of Holmes who also cured himself of paralysis by gadgetry that would cost a small fortune today, and now seeks revenge on ex-partner Lestrade.Somehow Holmes knew this early on from staring at something on the ground.There's no denying the ending is exciting, but it has no place in a Sherlock Holmes film. It's also is too similar to the one used in the far superior \\"Great Mouse Detective\\", which really was a cartoon.I don't care if the producers were looking to cash in on the recent theatrical film or not. I only care if the film is good or not. This one is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely dreadful","review":"This in all liklihood is the worst movie I have ever seen. It looks like it was made in a high school video project; the effects are cheesy and low-budget. This has nothing to do with Sherlock Holmes and appears to have been created just to exploit the success of Robert Downey's movie. Dreadful."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a grade B version of Holmes that perverts what Doyle wrote","review":"This is a cheap science fiction story - the kind told many times - and not a Sherlock Holmes type tale, the kind that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote. It focuses upon Holmes investigating a sea wreck caused by an attack by an underwater giant prehistoric animal and the murder of some people by a dinosaur.True, Holmes makes broad deductions from small items, such as a stone, and he has a side-kick, Watson, who once served in the army and is not too bright, but this is where the similarity ends. Additionally, Ben Syder who plays Holmes lacks the wit and force of the traditional Holmes, although he does fly in a zeppelin to save England and does fight a robot. Worse of all is the identity of the villain. Traditionalists will be surprised and appalled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fasincating","review":"What's best about Blouin's style is her all-too-rare empathy for inheritors.

They have released another suchlike track, \\"Follow Me\\" which also follows this recipe of success! \\"Die for you\\" is a very nice single that can by heard by anyone and at any time! I think that especially the Europeans are going to adore it (if they already haven't)!!!The only reason I give it four stars is because I would like it to include one more remix-this time stronger! And because I want Antique to keep up the good work so as to reach the top!! They are extremely talented and have gorgeous voices! And no doubt Elena is one of the sexiest singers worlwide!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for Your Kids!","review":"This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. It is written by Rudy Ruettiger, the Notre Dame football player who TRISTAR Pictures immortalized in the film, RUDY. In this book Rudy shares his insights into how to make a dream a reality. It is based on his own personal experience with practical steps anyone can follow. It is a motivating and inspiring book.I read \\"Rudy's Insights for Wiining in Life\\" cover-to-cover in one day. Once I started reading it I did not want to quit. Share this book with your family and friends -- especially your kids. This book, like Rudy, is a real winner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Insights from the common man","review":"Rudy's book goes through material he also covers in his spokenlectures. He emphasizes the same lessons repeatedly - never give up, never surrender, and don't let anyone steal your dreams. He dissects several of his dreams in life and goes through, point by point, how each dream was achieved, and the level of pain and sacrifice it took for him to achieve those dreams.A worthwhile read, especially if you need some inspiration.Chris Penn..."},{"rating":"2","title":"great straightener","review":"This is a product I have been using for a few years and I love it. I gave my old one to my sister so I ordered a new one for myself. The teeth or comb like straightening system is great for my wavy/frizzy hair where I don't have to blow dry it with a brush. It's a huge time saver and has easy handling and care. I have used it on many types of hair and it worked great! I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"just ok","review":"I bought the maxi glide based on recommendations. I have extremely thick wavy/curly frizzy hair. It doesn't do much more than other straighteners I have tried and it costs a lot more. It seems to have damaged my ends after three uses. I also had to use a curling iron on the ends because this product left my hair like straw, ends sticking out straight, only bent when I used the steam. I am not going to return it but I wouldn't buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!!!!","review":"I bought my MaxiGlilde in 2007. I love it! I am an African-American female with long, kinky hair. After deciding to go natural, I decided to purchase a maxiglide.

Not because it didn't straighten my hair. In fact, it did an execellent job at straightening my hair. And I'm African American so that's saying alot. However, the long term consequences of using this iron is not worth it because it did take a lot of my hair out. The instructional DVD tells you not to squeeze the iron and to \\"let the MaxiGlide do the work\\". I followed those directions and didn't squeeze the iron, but the ceramic detangling pins still took too much of my hair out. I even brushed and combed all the kinks out of my hair before using the iron, but my hair still kept getting caught in the detangling pins. After using the iron once, I thought that it would be in my best interest to discontinue using it. Yes, my hair was bone straight, but at what cost? After six months of using the Maxiglide I probably wouldn't have any hair left to straighten."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"i didnt likethis product at all it doesnt worth that much of money , dont waste ur money on something like this .i brefer my (( conair__ flat iron )) 25 $ i just got the same results"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nutone not a good as before","review":"The quality of the sound in this recent purchase is much poorer than the same model purchased 8 years ago.

Side walls are very flimsy making it difficult to fill. Most all kids pools are difficult to empty. When emptied the flimsy walls easily become bent and folded randomly weakening where the fold was (like a piece of folded paper), this eventually leads to tear and a leak point after a few uses. By the 3rd or 4th time filling/unfilling this pool had several holes that were too numerous to deal with. Was thrown in the trash.My reccomendation is to skip over this product. I also reccomend when for a kids pool also look for something that is easy to empty (designed with drain)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kiddy/Doggie Pool was cracked after opening","review":"Do not get this unless you want the hassle of trying to return it and not being able to.

So there is no way to fix it, and I am having trouble returning it since it was OPENED. It came in such a tiny box im sure thats why it was cracked.

My kids were happy playing in the pool while I struggled with it, they would have given it a thumbs up, but in the end, I had them get out, and I drove up the street to a hardware store and got a hard plastic pool which they have not gotten out of! A day later after drying out the snapset pool in the sun and handdrying every fold with a towel, I cannot get the thing back in the box.

Although I only filled it about 1/3 of the way up to conserve water, they were able to learn how to hold their breath underwater and float on their backs. They also used their swim goggles to go around the pool looking for items underwater that they had tossed in to look for. Overall it was a great summer entertainment for them.We first emptied the pool using a water pump to take the water out for use in watering our plants and trees, the only problem is when it came time for cleaning.It was hard to handle to clean, rinse and flip the pool over to empty out the cleaning water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this pool!","review":"I bought this pool two years ago for my grandchildren. Granted, we've only used it 6-8 times each summer, but it's a great deal of fun for them (ages 4 and 8). Last year, when my grandson was 3, it was hard for him to get in and out, as the sides were high for him, and he did need to be watched very carefully, but it was still a lot of fun. I tend to overfill the pool, as the kids love the \\"deep\\" water, but even with filling it nearly to the top each time we used it, it lasted two summers for us. It's easy to set up (although you do need another person to help - even a 3-year old will do), easy to empty (just push in the sides), and easy to store (doesn't take up a lot of room). It did develop a slow leak the last time we used it, but I'm not surprised. As I said, I overfill it, and the kids are not gentle with it at all. I highly recommend it - a lot of fun for not a lot of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"This pool is a lot of work","review":"This pool is huge, and therefore takes forever to fill. And it won't stand up straight unless it's quite full....and that won't happen satisfactorily unless it's perfectly level on the ground.

Seems easier just to spray yourself with the hose and have done with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pool!!!","review":"My kids LOVE this pool, it's nice and big so they can both play in it and it's the perfect depth.

Thinking about returning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pool for a Great Price","review":"I live in a tropical country and bought this pool from a local store for $37.50. It took 2 adults to set it up, however, we did not get all of the creases out so it didn't sit on the bottom perfectly. The walls were bent over in certain parts to compensate for the creases, we eventually filled it about 1 ft deep.Economics - for us to drive to a creek to have a relaxing day would cost us about $15 in gas and $7.50 for the entrance fee. The place would be crowded and very noisy. Therefore 2 trips to the creek would be more expensive than the price of the pool.All in all the pool is very cheap and I expect it to last for about six months or more which means more fun time for my daughter and some relaxing nights for me after a hard days work. Of course I may have to change water every 2 or 3 days but its worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this pool!","review":"This pool is very easy to set up and take down.

I was a little concerned at first from the other reviews about using for a dog. However, I decided to take the risk because I wanted him to have something to play in and cool off. The price was inexpensive enough to risk. I set it up and he played in for 45 minutes the first night. The pool is huge (much bigger than I thought it would be). It was a little challenging setting it up because it was only me and to help hold up the sides, I used 2 lawn chairs. I do recommend at least two people, but one can do it. I put in a small waterfall pump to keep the water moving so the water didn't become stagnet and attract mosquitos. I am overall very pleased and my dog loves it. I am not sure if I would want to use it for a puppy as it could easily become a chew toy and puncture it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wind? Dogs?

And we couldn't keep up with the slime that started growing on it, even with a shot or two of chlorine bleach thrown in.Then it sprung a teeny leak -- dogs or the sand underneath, I don't know.It was big enough for me to sit in.This year we bought a small hard plastic pool."},{"rating":"2","title":"love this pool","review":"this pool holds up well and is big enough for two kids and two adults to fit in it. perfect for the little ones not too deep but shallow either. we love it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Big but cheap","review":"This pool was large enough for 4 kids ( and occasionally a few adults) to splash around in for a few weeks.

However, under no circumstances would I ever use it in my dining room with my good china, for a formal dinner. These glasses, at least (my set)have tiny air bubbles throughout the entire body of every glass. There is also a very noticeable seam that runs up the side of every glass. These glasses may sound as if there produced in Ireland due to the name. These glasses, are in fact made in China. They have a defined thunk sound, as opposed to the usual ting sound one hears when one does the finger flick test on crystal. I did not purchase my set from this vendor.

No, these glasses aren't crystal in what most people think of the traditional sense; they are much heavier than the more expensive stuff. These glasses are beautiful to display and you won't be upset if you break one or two, though I think you'd really have to put a hurt on them to do so. There are a few seams in my set, but given the amount of cuts in the glasses it's really not noticeable and I personally do not care because of the great price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"packing so so","review":"The product was beautiful.

We have had bad experiences with other reportedly \\"high quality\\" glassware which ends up going through the dishwasher on a routine baisis. These look as though they will stand the test, only time will tell, as many glass formulations tend to become more brittle over time as they are cycled through the heating and cooling characteristic of a modern diswashing machine.

For example, in the first chapter, the word \\"particular\\" is used 16 times on three pages, and the word \\"interplay\\" is used 10+ times. In fact, a single sentence had \\"particular\\" written in it three times... It truly seems like the author is trying to sound smart, and in doing so, is sacrificing precious coherency. What could be an easy read in terms of content, is made that much harder through redundancy/usage of complicated words(over and over and over again).It's not the worst book I've read, but it'll make your life as a student that much harder(especially if you're taking 16 upper division units like myself.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't review if you never received the book","review":"It's been over a month and I still have not received the book.

I don't expect something published in 2005 to refer to cardiac troponins as a new test. There are abundant references to streptokinase which I guess is acceptable but most new grads finishing an er residency will have never heard of LDH1/LDH2 ratios and most certainly lovenox has become more commonly used in practice since this books last printing (the only form of heparin mentioned is IV).

When discussing Danny Moder's extramarital affair with Julia and subsequent divorce, the author's main source seems to be the National Enquirer.

The main character seemed almost idiotic in her method of solving the mystery. Other characters were loathsome. Also, the plot seemed to be a poor excuse to get the main characters in bed with each other. Nobody acts their age, and the way the characters behave seems unrealistic and convoluted.

To me, the romance between the main charactors was appalling. An attractive prosecutor falls for a foul-mouth cowboy old enough to be her father, and who had sexual relations with mother. It's the first time I ever skipped over the romance scenes of a novel! Brown is the best storyteller for a great mystery, but in \\"Best Kept Secret\\" the build up of who-did-it ended with a big let down.I suggest reading another Brown novel. My favorites (in order): \\"The Witness,\\" \\"Exclusive\\" and \\"The Switch.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best","review":"I thought Best Kept Secrets was all right. It was definately not a page turner like most other Sandra Brown books. I would recommend this one for a rainy afternoon when you have absolutely nothing else to do.

I did manage to finish it, but it was definatly not the best I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Character flaws abound","review":"Envy, also by Sandra Brown novel, was great. I only finished Best Kept Secrets, however, because of my need to complete what I start, actually tossing the book in the garbage when I was done. The heroine is a successful attorney, described as strong and intelligent; her behavior, on the other hand, is unbelievably passive and stupid. Logic had to be suspended in order to accept that she would allow a suspect in her mother's murder, who potentially could have been her father, to virtually assault her sexually in a variety of scenarios. Freud would have had a field day with this one.

Excellent story and writing by Sandra Brown yet again. I highly recommend this book to all of Sandra's fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not her best but good","review":"This was not her best book but it was a page turner. The mystery was great. The romance between Reede and Alex was even interesting. I was not bothered by the 18 year age difference. In real life people fall in love that have that much of an age difference. And Alex is 25, it's not like she is 18. My two biggest problems were with the characters of Junior and Reede. Reede was just mean most of the time but his history is revealed and so you can understand that. I just didn't like the character of Junior. He was nice to Alex but he always had an ulterior motive. At least with Reede he was honest about not wanting her there and he made his feelings to Alex perfectly clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"I thought this book was great. The plot was great with lots of twists and turns. I thought it was a little creepy that Reede was instramental in making sure Alex was born though.

It definately wasn't one of Sandra Brown's best, but it's not the worst thing in the world to read either. I would recommend this one for a rainy afternoon when you have nothing else to do.

It just seemed to drag on and on about the same thing over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy","review":"Yikes...what a horrible book! I can't imagine that the author actually thought a book about a guy who is first involved with the mother and then 25 years later sleeps with the daughter would be remotely appropriate.

This book should have been kept secret.Still grossing out in California...."},{"rating":"2","title":"train commute reader","review":"I did enjoy this book. I found the characters very intriguing, expecially Celina's. Though, the relationships Alex developed with the other characters were a little unreal at times. (Alex, a lawyer investigating her mother's murder, goes into this quite blindly, with such a lack of information to begin with. It makes me mad that the very people she supsects, she socializes with as though they were family friends. Even goes as far as to seek \\"special\\" comfort and throw herself at her mom's old flame who happens to be a suspect?????) Given that, when reading the book you can all somewhat understand where 'most' of these characters are coming from. I guess I liked it more for the mystery of Celina's character and drama, don't get me wrong, the romance scenes were mucho caliente. If I had liked this Alex character better, the book would have gotten 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appallingly bad !","review":"I'm normally a Sandra Brown fan but this is just TOO bad.How a supposedly intelligent young woman could ever find an oafish boor like Reede attractive is beyond me. Alex's mother had died a scandalous death in this small West Texas town 25 years previously and now she's back in her role of A.D.A. to reopen the case and discover her mothers murderer.The premise of the story is ok. but when the hero is portrayed as a man 18 years her senior who grabs her hand and places it on his crotch shortly after meeting her, the feeling of the book turns not to romance but to just plain lust and general nastiness.Could any woman find this behaviour appealing?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some secrets are better left that way.","review":"I don't know what bothered me more about this book. It could have been the fact that the lead character \\"fell\\" for the same man her mom did, or the fact that she was supposedly this strong woman who ended up looking anything but that as the story went on. I found myself getting more and more frustrated as the story went on for not walking away and throwing the book in the garbage. But, I got to a point where I was too far into it to give it up. This really was a pretty bad book. The characters were so superficial and you didn't know who to root for. The premise was a good one-Alex trying to find her mother's murderer, but there was no development to it, and the story could have been so much better than it was.A bad book, with bad characters and a very stupid plot. I need to find out what is wrong with me that I keep reading books by Sandra Brown. She is just not that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book not worth the time it took to read!","review":"I usually like Sandra Brown's books for both the mystery and romance. That being said, this book was awful. When you don't like any of the main characters it is a challenge to finish the book.The other reviewers have summed up the \\"premise\\" of the book. The love triangle between Alex and the two men her Mother was in love with (either of which could have been her Father) was disgusting. Reede, who was her Mother's true love and also Alex's was selfish and untirely unlikeable. It took me forever to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monotonous and Boring","review":"I was surprised to see that everybody that read this book liked it so much. This entire book could have been written on 200 pages instead of the 425 it was written on. Page after page was all about Junior loved Celina and Celina loved Reede and on and on and on...I thought Alex was a little too full of herself and I can't see how Reede liked her the way he did when she kept accusing him of murdering her mother, but she trusted him enough to put herself alone with him time and time again. It wasn't realistic and I thought he was just a bit too old for her. I did finish the book, but got to where I would skip over all the conversations about Junior loving Celina and Celina loving Reede. It was just the same thing over and over again. And I knew who the killer was from the beginning. I think a good Sandra Brown book is either Mirror Image, The Alibi or Breath of Scandal, all of which were very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystery & Romance","review":"Sandra Brown keeps you in suspense & sex.

I started listening to them in 1978, when this album came out, and rapidly got the previous album \\"El Patio\\", very difficult to find even in Spain. I think the originality of this band lies in the fact that they sound absolutely \\"Spanish\\" (or maybe better said \\"Flamenco\\") while at the same time reminiscent of prog British bands like King Crimson, Pink Floyd or Genesis. Arguably one of the best Spanish bands at the time, they suffered from poor technical facilities both at the studio and live but nevertheless managed to push Spanish rock music to maturity. While \\"El Patio\\" suffers from a poorer sound, it is absolutely superior to \\"Hijos Del Agobio\\", which on the other hand benefits from a richer sound and more careful presentation.

Nevertheless, the rest of the story about the police looking for a serial killer and as always going after the wrong guy was a bit too contrived for me.

This isn't what anyone was looking for. The 1st album is a great piece of work. The 2nd is much less so. Still it's pretty interesting for them to have so completely bucked expectations and produced full of twangy bible-banging songs. The idea of challenging their fans with material that met some of the bands own needs was both an affront and a surprise; but foisting Southern religiosity on people was more than they bargained for. You couldn't convince anyone who was dissappointed and hated this, that H.G. had merit when it came out. And the Femmes were off; charting a course for middle-age single-hit rockers, instead of some more worthy destination. The 1st CD made us rock. The 2nd made us laugh. That wasn't I was asking of it but there it is. The rest of the Femmes output continued the collapse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally available again!","review":"Finally after being out of print for years, this album is available again. I actually ran across this by accident. How fortunate. I'm definitely ordering the CD (used to have it on cassette). This album is phenomenol. At the time (1983), there was nothing else out like it. It seemed so strange in comparison to other popular bands at the time, ie. Hall and Oates. Very advanced harmonically and lyrically. Great, unforgettable songs - Country Death Song, I Hear the Rain, etc. I would highly recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not for everyone","review":"Hallowed Ground may just change music for you. The Femmes are a great band, inconsistent and passionate, an imperfect collective of 3 diverse musicians. This album will scare you with haunting story telling, teach you gospel or the American blues, take you from the country to the streets. It's hard to explain, but somewhere in the darkness of the album and its shifting genres (blues? punk? bluegrass? rock?) you'll find something true, honest, haunting, and spiritual. No other album by any group I can think of can produce this much raw emotion without sounding like pompous jackasses. These Femmes...they're funny guys, ya know?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth a new look now that Internet businesses are picking up","review":"I'm working for a .com company again! I don't believe it. I picked up this book for a good idea of what it takes to remain competitive in this space. I was pleased and surprised to see that the lessons are still useful. Maybe even more so now that ROI and other basic business practices are being applied to online businesses. I liked this book a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hope it helps me remain competitive","review":"I recently lost my job at a tech company, so I read this book looking for tips on how to remain competitive in the downturn. The funny thing is the book was written in 2001 just as the .com meltdown was heating up. Thus it starts out optimistic about the future of the net, but points out why many companies will fail. He was right about that, but I'm not sure I share his optimism that downturn cycles tend to last three years. It's worth a read though because it has good insights on how to remain in the game when times get tough. And times ARE tough right now. In general, I might have given this one four stars because it's good a bit over-detailed and of course derivitive. But I decided to give it five because it turns out to be very relative to what's happening in the marketplace today. If you're still unemployed by summertime, take this one to the beach with you."},{"rating":"1","title":"1st review not from a family member","review":"I have never felt more cheated by any purchase I have ever made in my life.

There was not ever one example of a winning grant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"For those true fans of gymnastics (or even those who just like the flying leotards) this video is not satisfying. Not one full routine is featured; instead of the professional commentary, a narrative voice (by some guy who probably doesn't know anything about gymnastics) discusses little about the routines. I would pay good money to have the full nbc coverage of the gymnastics events, but instead i get this sliced-together-at-the-last-minute-let's-see-fans-waste-their-money piece of .... seriously, do not bother purchasing this unfufilling video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the competition","review":"Surely Amazon.com can offer videos of the 2000 Olympic Games produced by other countries.

You can control the thermostat by turning it down when it reaches the desire temperature and it will automatically turn on to maintain that temperature, so it does not shut down completely unless you turn it off.

With the chisel inserted all the way into the machine, the drill bit is several inches short of the chuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad machining","review":"This mortise bit was supposed to fit a jet mortiser - it was oversize slightly and would not go into the chisel holder.

Of the kit, I am happy with the quick detailer (which I have used the most), the NXT Car wash (okay, I guess). I have yet to use the NXT Wax. This product, the insane tire shine is the weakest of them. It gives an \\"insane\\" shine when first used, but by the next day it is gone. I was scratching my head wondering what I was doing wrong - perhaps my prep? my washing method ? Finally, I had the opportunity to use another product (a well recommended tire gel) and a week gone and the tire still shines great. I paid about $15 for that product, somewhat higher than this one, but I am very happy with it so far.Not the best effort from Meguiar's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make sure you buy the 2nd Edition","review":"Most of the reviews here seem to relate to the first edition (which was admittedly kind of short). The book has been updated, and the second edition covers new stuff like XSD Schemas, Diffgrams, SOAP Virtual Names, and all the other SQLXML 3.0 features. I found the book really useful, and easy to read. The examples are great and the concepts are all well explained. Definitely worth buying if you're planning to use SQL Server's XML functionality."},{"rating":"1","title":"A blatant ripoff","review":"There is little here beyond what is in the Microsoft documentation. And $60 for less than 300 pages? Even with the big price and the scanty page count, they still find it necessary to refer you to the CD to see the code.

I am a sucker for red---so I also LOVE the color!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO SHORT FOR THE BUCKS","review":"I was disappointed when I found only 3 tracks on the CD.

The book is really what the word parent is all about! The words are filled with love and the pictures is wonderfully illustrated. The first time I read the book I cried. You can tell that the authors was speaking from their heart also the book is really fun to ready over and over again because it rhymes. When I purchased this book my daughter who is 3yrs would not let it go. She slept with it, watch T.V with it, and wanted the book to go in the bath with her. I recommend this book for all types of families not just families with two moms. I'm looking forward to reading more books from the Authors Kyme and Susan Fox-Lee."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the meaning of the word Parent.","review":"I'm a grandmother who is raising my grandchildren and I love the way the authors included all families. Parent is a word that describes \\"love\\", someone who is willing to do all the things that is necessary to raise and care for a child.

I only wish that I could have seen this book when I was growing up. Kyme and Susan Fox-Lee are to be applauded for their heart warming portrayal of families of millions of kids who the media denies exposure or acknowledgement.

Great record anyhow!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Boston's Best","review":"This is not only the bands best album but one of the best albums to ever come out of Boston. IMHO this album is as much as staple as Dark Side of the Moon or Led Zeppelin IV. Incredible range of emotion in the lyrics and the music. It's a true rock tragedy that they never took off but then again if they hadn't then we never would have gotten the Thief series, Guitar Hero or Rock Band, since most of the band went on to work in the game industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mythical Album","review":"Just recently started listening to Tribes two wonderful CDs after several years of neglect. God they were good! Incredible live as others have noted, but this doesn't diminish the quality of their recorded work. Every song is a gem. This band had the misfortune to come along at the wrong time. Polished hooky alt. rock/pop wasn't \\"in\\" during the early/mid 90s grunge era. Too bad, or we might have had more music from this mythic Boston band. I'd give this six stars if I could. Their follow-up, by the way, was really just as good as Abort. In contrast to what others have said. It's a somewhat darker album, but a perfect creation as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rocking and Deep, Surreal and Powerful","review":"This album will always be a favorite.

There is no minimum level of lead in a pregnant woman's bloodstream that does not lower IQ in her unborn child. Do not buy lead crystal for drinking glasses and if you buy it for vases, wash your hands after you touch it.Note: do not let Amazon forget that we are upset that it uses the equivalent of a nuclear power plant's worth of energy--much of it dirty diesel--at a very inefficient rate (see investigative report by NYTimes).

I bought this to replace several that have broken over the years and there is a dramatic difference between the old and new. As others have mentioned the luster and sound of the glasses have degraded with new ones but I also found something else that is interesting. The old glasses weigh 14.3oz and the new ones weight 12.8oz. I am a little concerned that they are counterfeit and because of that I emailed Godinger with that question. They never returned the email.

My last set of crystal was Italian, and was purchased for about the same price 4 years ago. I must assume that Godinger is making an astronomical profit, duping and excessively charging the unsuspecting customer. Comparing the two side by side, it is obvious the chinese molds are inferior. The detail is rounded, larger and less crisp.

What Elephant doesn't know is that Sam has only gone off to get Elephant a special wagon full of the food Elephant loves. And isn't that what life is like?

The author includes review sentences that he wrote himself which would be much more useful if he included an answer key. There is no answer key for the Septuagint sentences, either, which differs from the Hebrew text, as the author himself admits. So I am puzzled why he would leave out English translations of those sentences, unless one has the LXX translated in English. A student must use an English translation of the Bible to check the New Testament examples. I cannot recommend this book, although it is much better than Vines book.

I love both books. Of the two, I like the approach here of having the three types of exercises: author generated sentences, readings from the LXX and NT. My only suggestion would be to include practice in reading extended passages. As it is, each sentence is a new beginning rather than a continuous flow of language. A short narrative or passage at the end of each chapter or extended readings as a companion (graded) reader would offer the language in context rather than as isolated examples.

Really looking forward to my copy. I hope Anchor Bay plans on reproducing the two sequels to this movie.A group of teens decide to party at an abandoned funeral parlor on the outskirts of town on Halloween night. It turns out to be the one night that the demons within the funeral parlor are free to roam.

Got this one.Was eager to hear the next great folk singer. Turned down the lights, lit acouple of candles, and put the CD on. This must be a joke! Some of the mostwretchedly terrible singing I've ever heard in my life! Water-thin voice, hardlyever on pitch, diction so terrible you can't understand half of the words! I couldgo on, but really, it's a waste of time. It's a shame, because the instrumentalaccompaniment has a certain, simple, almost primitive appeal.

I really like them, and feel that they capture the energy and obnoxiousness of FNM. I would like FNM as much today if they had kept Mosley instead of picking up Patton. And honestly, while Mosley isn't up to much these days, Mike's other projects haven't been so hot either. Chinese Arithmetic is where its at."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't get past Mosely's vocals.","review":"My title sums it up...I purchased this just to complete my Faith No More collection. A little hesitant, I had heard the track \\"We Care a Lot\\" before and thought it was decent. Sadly to say that's the only track I could really get into. Mosely's vocal seem to basically ruin every track. Buy this if you're a completist like me..otherwise save your $$$."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great faith no more album. No patton?","review":"Well sure we all know Mike wasn't in the beginning of Faith no more or in the first two FNM albums. But even if Chuck Mosley wouldn't come close to Mike in a million years, he was still awesome. The album is a blend of metal, punk and funk. Songs that definitely belong to Chuck are, Anne's song, and Introduce yourself one of my favorites. You must own it, wether you like Mosley's singing or not, you should still give it up for the rest of the talented band. Besides, how many great singers come close to Patton right? I love the vocals and banging to this great 80's hard rock metal album. No need to rate songs because It's still Faith no more greatness and i assure you, you'll love it even without Mike Patton the god!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mosely?","review":"Obviously, Mike Patton is one of the very best vocalists out there. But judge this album on its own merits and not by comparing Mosely to Patton.Mosely clearly isn't a very good singer in terms of skill or talent. But his vocals on this album somehow work although they really shouldn't. On this album, the band has developed its unique brand of pop/rock/funk/metal that would see itself on the next Faith No More album, the much acclaimed \\"The Real Thing\\". Mosely's lethargic vocals are mostly at odds with the rest of the music. But it still works, as he emits a new wave/punk vibe, which makes things connect in an odd way.There are great songs on this album and this should certainly be part of any Faith No More fan's collection. It will appeal in particular to anyone who appreciates that intangible fun '80s vibe that you loved. All this while the album is generally steeped in a dark, brooding mood which shifts between the foreground and the background."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd but i'd personally wish they'd have re recorded this with mike patton.","review":"this is a great cd the sound was lacking abit but at the time for the money,A+ but I've heard mike patton sing these tunes along with a couple from we care alot cd(as the worm turns) and they are much better.this cd is possibly the second best cd they did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"inspirational","review":"You know i feel bad for the rest of the critics on this album, because they failed to GET \\"we care a lot\\".Don't worry about the vocals so much, they go well with the music which is sort of like a urban hip-hop/punk mix that no one made before this, NO ONE. The king of nonconventianal music (Mike Patton) was the reason FNM became so commercial. This is the real faith no More.Good album very good the only reason they are getting 4 stars is because they did a lot better with \\"Angel Dust\\". :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"For FNM fans only. This album is too weird.","review":"A lot of good keyboard work here by Roddy Bottum, but basically this is the worst album by one of the greatest bands ever. Mainly because of the horrible singing of ex-lead singer Chuck Mosely (does he sing like that on purpose or is he really that bad?) If you're interested in hearing FNM, I'd recommend Angel Dust. Still, besides having the worst FNM songs ever written, this album just has something about it that I like. They know how to write great hooks that make their music so addicting and despite having terrible lyrics, Introduce Yourself is probably FNM's most amusing album. The title track is one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get down with Mosely!","review":"Don't hate on Mosely just because you are used to Mike Patton. He has his own style and it fits right in with FNM's off the wall style. Don't fool yourself into thinking he was trying to record some american idol grammy winning vocals here either. To me it almost sounds sarcastic and it enhances his tounge-in-cheek lyrics. He sounds just the way he meant to sound and once you get used to it there are some absolute FNM classics with Chuck as the frontman that you really shouldn't miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"hahahahahahahahahahaha!!!!!!","review":"Now I'll admit that this album has good musical quality, BUT CRAPPY CRAPPY VOCALS!!!!! Chuck Mosely can't sing for his life. He sounds like he has down syndrome or something. I'd would like this album if i was raised in the 80s. This album is so retro it's sick. get Angel dust."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Patton no Way","review":"Mike Patton made Faith no More (even if he wasn't in the abdn originally). his unique vocals made the band good, this Disc on the other hand is just horrible.

After 3+ years of using the stock Intel fan/cooler I finally decided to upgrade to a quieter model. The Intel fan would just get too loud at times, and got very annoying. Based on the reviews on this site and elsewhere, I decided on the Big Typhoon. Installation was a breeze, and I had the Intel fan out and replaced in about 20 minutes total. I was very happy with the results of the Big Typhoon. This thing is QUIET, and does a great job of keeping my temps down. I have the fan set to the lowest setting, and cannot hear it at all.

Saying too much about this would reveal the plot. But I can say that Weisel takes the narrative and moves it back and forth in time. He builds up suspense, a sense of unwinding knowledge, and impending action, layer by layer. There is also a surprising twist of character development toward the end that completely re-frames the novel.Wiesel is rightly labeled a novelist who writes about the Holocaust. This is his almost exclusive theme.

It is a great idea, but something is missing.

However, I have noticed a few critical mistakes that Jack Zufelt has made and that he makes his point as an absolute, as if everyone else is wrong.

There really is not much differentiating this book from all the other \\"self help\\" books that i've read so far...except for the fact that it's not one of the better ones. The examples of \\"success\\" are not very compelling, and the one part of the book that I really wish Zufelt would have elaborated on was _very_ skimpy -- ie, the part where he defines how to figure out what it is that you want. I was expecting this book to help my along my journey to finding the inner truth -- deep into the caverns of my mind to find out exactly what it is that i'm looking for.

I mean the multiplayer aspect is fun, but the network codes really sucks. I get kinda laggy on my cable modem and could barely even play it on my girlfriends 56.6 modem.But don't let the lackluster multiplayer stop you, for 20 bucks, you'll have a blast in single player mode, and if your feeling alittle adventurous, then you can build your own levels with the included software."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is great for all out shooting......","review":"The graphics are some of the best I've seen. Couple this with some of the environments and I looks like a his res still picture instead of a game. I agree with another reviewer that is can get old fast but when you get rushed by 100 or so creatures, you get into it again. The only complaint I have with this game is when you get trapped in a room and they send hundreds of creatures at you to kill before you can proceed. It became predictable after a while. I would like to thank them for not putting a level where you have to jump from platform to platform level to where you can fall to your death type of situation. THAT gets tired quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seriously Fun!","review":"If you enjoy intense action FPS games, buy this! There is NO down time in this game. you are constantly doing battle with multiple creatures, which get larger and more difficult as you move closer to the end. The AI leaves a little to be desired, but that would be my only complaint. This is a great game to play after work if you need to blow off steam and become totally absorbed in some mindless, shoot-em-up fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a Great type of Game!!!","review":"Serious Sam is great, because it breaks down boundaries. It puts more emphasis on action than plot than any game out today. Virtually no puzzles, if you can call them that, and straight up action. This is great, those gaming companies are learning that there are a lot of gamers out who like this type of game. I personally recommend this game and one other game, Mortyr. Buy Mortyr, it rules. It has terrible reviews, but if you like this, you will like Mortyr, trust me, it won't disappoint.

It's a cheap thrill like... well, suffice it to say that Serious Sam is one of those quick and dirty pleasures in life.In the spirit of Doom, SS throws dozens of monsters at you at once. You use an impressive arsenal of weapons and a plethora of ammo to blast them into little bits. The levels are well-textured but in the end are merely excuses to get you to the next room full o' baddies.Multiplayer has some bugs, but I'm sure they'll be fixed in upcoming patches. For [price], this is worth it for almost any FPS fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Game","review":"I admit I was skeptical at first about Serious Sam, but it was a fun game. The graphics are superb and the game is pretty fast paced. It even has a decent plot. But the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of the full 5, was that I found the game lacking in it's challenges. I mean when you have to find something in this game like a key or an object to trigger a door, it's usually in plain sight and easy as pie to find. I was impressed with the sheer volume of enemies I had to face though they were all dumb as bricks. In one spot you face around 140 enemies at one time. I had to use the godmode, otherwise this game is near impossible to finish because of the sheer number of enemies coming at you. Over all it was worth the ($) I spent on it, but I wouldn't pay full price for it. But I enjoyed it for what it was. A pure shootem up to win game. Basically Doom with better graphics"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't let the low price fool you!","review":"Just because this game is low in price does not mean it skimps in quality. The game engine is new and one of the best I have ever seen. The graphics are outstanding and the maps are large and set in a combintion of outdoor and indoor enviroments. Multiplayer could use a little spit and polish, but I think that can be fixed easily with a patch. I am using a Voodoo5500 Agp/Athlon 850/256megs ram and the framerates and stability of the game are one of the best I have ever played. The best way to describe the type of game is throw a little Unreal,Half-Life,Duke-Nukem, and Doom in a pot and you get S.S.The only complaint is the sound settings keep reverting to the default instead of being saved when I change them. I have to reset it every time I start the game. Very minor problem and probably fixable with a little tinkering. Buy this game now! FPS fans will not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old School Shooter","review":"Loved the emphasis on non-stop, senseless action throughout. Could not believe the outrageous numbers of baddies flooding my screen. I haven't enjoyed the shotgun so much in a shooter since Doom 2.

I say low-budget only because the characters and the animation have a Saturday morning cartoon appearance. The cast is all-star, which might be the problem. All of the money was spent on actors!Snow White and the Prince are ok characters. There is an owl voiced by Ed Asner that could have been cut from the story, nothing against Asner. The owl is a perpetual cigar smoking violent character,nothing good there. The villan is the usual carbon copy villan with nothing new to add to the story.The movie had promise with the number of quality actors but fell short due to the writing and directing. I'm glad we borrowed this instead of buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst princess movie ever made","review":"The same animation / plot / storyline can be found in the Little Mermaid cartoons. It's too scary for anyone under 5, and has virtually zero plot.

A massive hit in Britain, the film was somewhat ignored by audiences when it released here in early 2000. The film is exceptionally funny, and it's great to see a comedy that actually has a good deal of emotional substance... they're far too rare. The subject material is fairly original, and the film is carried off much better than the similar \\"My Son the Fanatic\\". I admire how the film succeeds in making its point subtly. By focusing on the specific, arbitrary rules of a Pakistani, the film showed how arbitrary most parents' ideals can be."},{"rating":"1","title":"huh","review":"To Whomever It Might Just Concern:Your review format already got it wrong .I rated it one star but in fact it cannot play it on my equipment and I have returned it to the seller.

It deals with the problems, they have with each other, because the children are more english, but the father wants them to be like pakistanis.

I would recommend it highly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"IUC - Indian Urination Camp","review":"This movie is an IUC (Indian Urination Camp), there is nothing Pakistani in this movie, all the cast which is palying charachters mentioned as Pakistanis are being played by Indian actors. I am 100% sure that the director, producer and writer of this movie never visited Pakistan and neither they studied a Pakistani family very closely before making this movie. This movie is a perfect example of an Indian product having Pakistani label on it. In other words, they labelled it Pakistani but every thing in it is Indian. When ever they want to show bad side of Indian culture or some thing insulting about it, they label it as Pakistani.In simple terms, this movie is disgusting and if you really want to watch a bunch of Indians urinating all over the place and you have enough money to waste to see people urinating then you should purchase this movie.\\"Indian Urination Camp\\" would have been a more suitable title for this movie instead of \\"east is east\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst ethnic movie EVER!","review":"I am simply amazed by this movies' ratings! How could people give such a junk movie 5 stars? I would have given it a ZERO. Why? Beacause it is a movie made by ignorant folks who have no knowledge of the Asian community. It is a highly offensive movie. It demonizes men as wife beaters (like nobody else on earth beats their wife), tyrannical father who \\"all in all\\" in the family and barely literate. Folks that made this movie, have absolutely no idea how Asians raise their kids in Asia and abroad. There are of course families that feels more attached to their roots and there are those who feels more connected to the new settlement. However, in this movie, it appears that the illiterate demon (the father) reamins a demon even after living 25 with an English woman. Watch this movie with \\"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\\". You will see how racially insulting this movie is. Even you might feel ashamed that you have watched it. I know I am."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it really funny?","review":"I don't think this movie was funny. It was more like a tragic drama where director went to limits to create funny situations by making fun of a particular ethnic group. At times he was successful but the situations seemed far from reality. For example who would like to have his good looking sons marry one of the ugliest girls available. C'mon, we have seen people from SE Asia and arranged marriages. And I have yet to see a British women getting slapped by a Paki husband. Those people who do not have any understanding of Islam and Pakistanis in general may find this amusing, others would wonder what Islamic culture director was trying to ridicule. No wonder it did good business in UK. Such controvercial topics are always good money-makers. Most of the people watch such movies out of curiosity...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny with some serious Bits","review":"I had the opportunity to see the film at cinema here in the states.

It's about a family in which the Pakistan father of a large group of children, whose mother is English. The father is trying to keep with tradition of Pakistan and arrange his sons' marriages. There was very little humor in my opinion, I laughed maybe four times in the entirity of the film. The acting was pretty good, but it was so sad how the father treated his family especially his wife. It was disturbing to me how it ended. I don't recommend this movie at all, it was fair."},{"rating":"1","title":"A filthy and disgusting movie","review":"This is a filty and disgusting movie for anyone who knows about pakistani culture and pakistanis living outside the country. No matter how liberal a pakistani family is, brothers and sisters never have this kind of understanding. And if there is a family living out like depicted in this movie, then they are worst than any non-muslim and non-pakistani. We, in Pakistan, have a deep cultural heritage and family values, which are unique around the world. This movie shows the worst kind of family. I am feeling so disgusted after seeing this movie.I can understand that the movie is showing a cultural clash. But I cannot imagine this kind of family, who has a pakistani father."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever!","review":"This has been the worst movie ever, look at what the characters are eating in the movie. BEACON. What is bacon made of? PIG. One of the major rule of islam is never to digest anything with pig ingredits, if this movie was a comedy then WTF are the producers doing by dissing a major religin.Another aslpect of the movie was the idea of the screwed up family, the time frame isn't right for one thing if the first kid dropped the engagement then the whole family would have been thrown out of the community and shamed to harshly that would be looked on as a lowlife. There would be no way to set the second and the third wedding. This movie was a major turn off and a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny Movie","review":"I love The Movie East is East.

I was able to complete levels 1- 7 and 10, but I never could complete levels 8 and 9. The 3-dimensional picture and smooth, quick, and realistic movements make it appear as if you're really there. The critters are all so cute, even King Thorax. This game is like totally cool. They should make a movie of it! Now I'm telling you- you're gonna just LOVE this game. Bugdom ROCKS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bugdom Nightmare","review":"My 6 year old son learned about Bugdom in kindergarten, on their Mac computers. He loves the game, and pleaded with me to buy it. I bought the Windows version for our family computer, only to find out after much aggravation, phone calls and wasted time, that Bugdom doesn't work on Windows XP Home Edition. It has something to do with the Windows 2000 drivers that are in the Windows XP Home Edition. I'll have to return the game. Don't assume, as I did, that if Bugdom Windows version works with Windows 95/98, it'll work with XP. While my son whould rate this game a 5 , I have to rate it a 1 since I could never get it installed. Maybe it's time schools started using pcs instead of Macs, since those are what most homes and offices use."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Technical Support- too bad for a great game","review":"After great expectations the software arrived and the files areincomplete- Errors abound as we try to load- No help file- no oneanswers the help line after 5PM on Weekdays and nothing onweekends.

A real bummer."},{"rating":"2","title":"China got problems","review":"This was an excellent series, although it would have been nice to have special/extra features included. The overall feeling was that China will have to deal with a lot of consequences of its economic reforms that will be very damaging to their culture, people and enviornment. It is amazing that this country is still running...how long the Communist will last? It seems power, corruption and money is what's holding this country up. Sad to see that the majority rural people are suffering the most to appease the smaller percentage of city dwellers. Chinese people need to think more for others than for themselves, as their ideology says one thing and does another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funniest movie ever made.","review":"There, I've said it. Carl Reiner's ode to the stage and his youth is a hilarious journey for this viewer. Reni Santoni plays David, a high-school kid who takes the plunge into the world of stage acting, but whose talent, while impressive at home in front of his bedroom mirror, falls short into episodes of nervous stammering and the reading of stage directions (\\"Enter: laughing\\").Sparkling performances from the entire cast, which includes real memorables from Jose Ferrer, as the play's director, and Shelley Winters, as David's mother. Contrast Winters' performance with the one she gave as a mother in, \\"A Patch of Blue\\".Rob Reiner has a part as a hopeful during the audition scene. Don Rickles plays the cratchety boss of the voluptuous secretary that David is sweet on.This is a very funny, often poignant comedy that accomplishes what it sets out to do, which is to make the audience laugh out loud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exit, Stage Right","review":"Except for a few scattered laughs, painfully unfunny adapation of what was reportedly a pretty funny play. Almost worth watching just to see how writer/director Carl Reiner manages to waste a great cast that includes Jose Ferrer, Elaine May, Shelley Winters, Jack Gilford and Janet Margolin. A few chuckles here and there, including unintentional guffaws inspired by the awful production design which awkwardly weds a 1930's story to 1960's fashions and soundtrack music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Delight","review":"This wonderfully written, engrossing book explains differences in human and canine communication, without using confusing scientific jargon. Even someone who spends a considerable amount of time with dogs can gain insight from this book. Nor does it only work on puppies, like your average training book -- dogs of any age understand their own language! My 7-yr-old is responding beautifully to my attempts to communicate with her better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read for all dog owners","review":"\\"The Other End of the Leash\\" is facinating reading for dog owners as well as non-owners. Easy reading and lots of eye opening facts about why dogs act like they do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dog lover's book","review":"This book was the first one I read when we got our new lab puppy. It started a bit sloggishly, but then started describing things I could relate to and caught my interest as I read on. The author's love of dogs shines through. Pictures would have helped me at some points, like when the author is describing the commissure of dogs, I could not visualize what she meant as she described the tale tell signs of a dog ready to bite based on the description of commissure. Perhaps more experienced dog handlers are used to this term, I could only guess what she meant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for dog lovers!","review":"I have been around dogs all of my life. In the process of training my dog, I ran upon this book and could not put it down. It is siply one of the best books about dogs that I have ever read. Dr. McConnell is extremely knowledgable and writes in a way that keeps you stuck to the book. I feel like a lightbulb turned on, and I now finally get why my dogs are doing what they are doing! I FINALLT get it. Thank you for this magnificent book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great reference book!","review":"After getting this book from the library 3 times, I finally bought it.

I want to read the next publication by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Book about relating to your Dog","review":"Very readable.entertaining book to start with. The author's accreditations are very substantial. and this gives authority to the advice offered. The book interprets the many anecdotes soundly and from experienced that is easy to relate to and recognize. Guess I loved the book because it backed up many of my own intuitive beliefs of getting along with dogs and explains why this would be so. I feel much reassured from reading it and hope that it will benefit many other dogs and handlers to happy, comfortable relationships."},{"rating":"2","title":"ideal book for multi-dog households","review":"Of all the dog behavior books out there, this one is the most concise and to the point. For example, one of the tips she gives is to walk AWAY from your dog when you want her to come. It works. I can tell you, I have never felt more confident about reading my dog's body language and letting him interact with other dogs.She clarifies the ideas of dominance and leadership, and explains why those words have such a negative meaning. The best part is, you don't even need to touch your dog(s) to get them to respect you. It can be done through positive reinforcement. Her claim is that dogs will have pack-like behavior when they are getting high quality food from a central source (you). The idea centers around how dogs behave in a multidog household, as opposed to how they behave in a scavenging feral dog pack."},{"rating":"2","title":"New way to think","review":"I loved this book, it showed a wonderful way to behave around our best friends. It opened up ways to train and what to look for in pets. I loved her stories that she shared and the examples that she gave. For me it became one of the bases for my training classes. Wonderful read and very informative."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Other End Of The Leash","review":"A wonderful book for anyone wishing to learn more about dog behavior. Your dog will be better off if you read this book and practice what she recommends. Worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is one of the best books I've read on the subject. McConnell's book is not a \\"how to\\" training book, but rather an insightful, well-written book about canine behavior. (She's an ethologist and a certified animal behaviorist specializing in aggression.)I also highly recommend the enormously useful book \\"Understanding 'Dog Mind,'\\" by Bonnie Bergin. This is perhaps the single best book ever written on canine behavior and training. (Bergin pioneered the \\"service dog\\" concept and founded the first and largest organization training service dogs for the disabled.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The book all dogs have been waiting for!","review":"For those of us who love dogs and enjoy working with them everyday, it is a real joy to find a book that shows so much respect for dogs as intelligent, observant, thinking beings. If every human would read this book, the life of every dog on earth would be easier and happier, and, of course, the humans would enjoy considerable benefit as well because they would understand their dogs so much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"McConnell does a good job of increasing your insight of your dog's behavior. More important, it helps you understand what our actions communicate to our dogs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real eye opener to understanding how dogs think!","review":"Love this book, it illustrates just how flawed some of the prevailing wisdom of \\"alpha status for owners\\" should be done! For the most part, my German Shepherds (2 - a male & female) are well behaved BUT there was one area in particular that I needed help with (greeting visitors) after reading Patricia's book, I put her suggestions into practice and was AMAZED at the instant results!! I have spent YEARS (literally) and allot of money with dog trainers and training classes with very limited results. Ms McConnell explains to us how dogs interact with each other as well as humans and she backs up her ideas with many references to animal behaviorists case studies....... she emphasizes that as owners we should be our dogs \\"benevolent leader\\"..... her methods are sound and gentle, I highly recommend this book if you want to understand how your dog views the world!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"I got a lot of useful advice from this book and a few laughs about how true much of it sounded."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must-read to better understand your dog's perspective","review":"This is a bit longer read than most of her other books. However, if you have the time and would like to understand how to better communicate with your dog, this is one of the best books you will find. McConnell is a Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist, which means she has a Ph.D in animal behavior, so she really knows her stuff. This is one of my all-time favorite books, and I highly recommend it! Note that this is not a training book, but rather a book to help you better understand your dog - which, in my opinion, will really enhance any training you do with your dog."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books on dog behavior!!","review":"I LOVED This book. I've read many books on dog training & this one is truly wonderful. It provides tons of great information on dog behavior & on dog-human interactions. Very easy to read & understand. McConnell is also a very witty, entertaining author. This is truly one of the best dog behavior books I have ever read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended!","review":"I'm new to dogs and trying to communicate has been frustrating for both me and my Beauceron. This book is helpful in so many ways. I find myself remembering and applying its nuggets of wisdom every single day. It is highly readable and endlessly useful. If you're reading this to see if it's worth buying, don't hesitate!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"I am truly disappointed after reading all the great reviews on this book. The main point she tries to drive home is that canids and primates communicate differently, hence our trouble in communicating with our dogs. Fair enough, however this could have been done in the first chapter instead of ad nauseam throughout the entire book. I GET IT...we communicate differently. Quit telling me why and tell me step by step how to communicate with my dog correctly!Most of her personal examples relate to her own dogs and sheep herding. This is great if you are trying to get your dog to herd sheep but for me these were just a tedious stories I had to muddle through in an attempt to get to something worthy for me to learn. I never got there. After getting tired of her anecdotal explanations and constant references to her PHD, I put down the book half way through it. The first book by Caesar Milan was much more interesting and informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much talk about primates","review":"It would have been a better book if there weren't so much talk about primates. I want to read more about dogs and their owners, not so much about how humans are so much like monkeys."},{"rating":"2","title":"McConnell is a GREAT teacher and a GREAT dog trainer!","review":"I own all of her books, though I have not read them all YET! 8-}But I read this one and LOVE it! It is THE book to give people who have a dog but do not cherish it as a member of the family yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining Though Light","review":"I found this book engaging and entertaining, however was led to believe by the promotional materials that it would be a bit denser with information. If one edited out the personal anecdotes, endless references by the author to her own credentials (yes, yes, you have an advanced degree as does a substantial percentage of the population, please on to the information now) and \\"chimpanzees lite,\\" the book would be a leaner (50+ pages maybe) read rather than the slightly bloated tome it currently is. Perhaps this is the publisher's fault.Read it for the insightful and charming stories of the author's own well loved pooches. For information on primatology, go to the horses' mouths (primatologists - many fine accessible books available). For information on dog behavior, perhaps there is more out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear, fun and very helpful","review":"This book is a must for any dog owner. Ms. Mcconnell writes the way she talks (I've heard her radio show for many years); clearly, with a great sense of humor and loaded with helpful hints. She explains how dogs think and compares it to how humans think. She shows where we miscommunicate with our pets and in that way also shows us how to communicate better so our pets can do what we really want them too. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Other End of the Leash","review":"The book presents some interesting concepts about life with your dog, Thought provoking at times.Presents a different view of dog ownership when establishing your position as the pack leader. While I found most of it enlightening I do have some differences of opinion on a few points."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Other End of the Leash","review":"I admit it, I'm an addict when it comes to books on dog behavior. And I have to say that Patricia McConnell is one of the best authors out there -- she is funny and easy to understand and offers some wonderful insights into canine behavior. This book will make you think twice about how you interact with your dog and teach you how to open up the lines of communication using body language, vocalizations (sometimes less is more here!) and so much more. If you love your dog, you owe it to him (and to yourself) to pick up this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful Study of Dog and Human Behavior","review":"The Other End of the Leash is a delightful, thoughtful, and thought-provoking study of our canine friends' behaviors. The author uses her experience as both a behaviorist and a dog owner to shed light on the often-misunderstood actions of dogs. Her book also enables us to learn how we can best interact with our dogs -- basically, in a compassionate fashion that takes into account their individual personalities and the genetic inheritence of their species. The Other End of the Leash includes practical advice. You'll learn how to \\"speak dog\\" by using body language, how to help your dog understand that strangers and other dogs are part of his \\"family\\" and to take them in stride, also, and what NOT to do while training your dog. Plus, you'll become fond of McConnell's dogs as you learn their wonderful quirks and habits! I found this book's wisdom and emphasis on kind, compassionate dog training very impressive."},{"rating":"2","title":"The dog owner's bible","review":"This is perhaps the best book we have found on dog behaviour. It is a discursive book and takes time to digest, in fact it takes many readings and lots of dipping to absorb the profound insights it contains. McConnell's writing style is warm, compassionate and funny but underpinned by her scientific training and background. The 'science' is perfectly balanced by anecdotes, case studies and by her stories of her own pack. Highly recommended to all dog owners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, happy, sad, enligtening!","review":"If you have a dog, you need to get this book. McConnell points out so clearly why (many times) it's not poor innocent us, suffering through with a nutso dog... in fact, it's the stuff WE DO that's making the dog nutso. I have three dogs and am so glad I read this book. Wow. Well-written. Happy in some places; sad in others. Very enlightening. I learned a lot from it- about me, and about my dogs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A WONDERFUL BOOK for dog lovers!!!","review":"As owner of three dogs... I am constantly trying to understand them. :) This book is such a fun, interesting, intelligent guide to \\"THE DOG\\". Perfect for any dog owner, and would make such a great gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"expands on a few concepts","review":"The basic idea is good, that dogs and humans communicate differently and that we sometimes think we are expressing affection but our canine friend may not interpret it as such.It seems to me that the description was however somewhat oversimplified and there was little on how to put it to practical use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Lots of anecdotes with no resolution (what ever happened to Domino?) including a racist one depicting Mexicans in Texas as all drug dealers. Unimpressive really. My expectations were high. The part about primate behavior (what we and chimps do) as compared to canid behavior (what dogs and wolves do) was interesting. I'll stop patting my dog on the head and in exchange he'll let me hug him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ongong Jibberish","review":"I bought this book and was looking for some insight of what one can do to help with my dog's behavior due to trauma from her past owner and dog walking issues and social issues. This book was so boring to begin with. The Other End of the Leash, this book didn't even go into any training techniques, Patricia Connell just was so into her own dogs, that I felt like I was reading a expose' on her dog's lives. Did I gain any insight on remedies to help me along with my dog I rescued who has trauma and is an alpha female dog and can't walk on a leash or socialize with other dogs/people. No, I ended up giving the book away before even finishing the last chapter. Enough of Ms. McConnell's writings, my time was wasted and I could not use any of what I read in her book to my situation.I would not recommend this book for anyone's reading if it is to solve your dog's issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"A solid disappointment","review":"I'm not understanding the rave reviews as it read like ablog and the bulk of this info is obvious if you've everowned a dog. Excessive references to being an Applied AnimalBehaviorist with a Ph. D. was annoying. Mom would be proudbut it got old. I suppose if you never had a dog in yourlife and you were curious it might be useful but..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good information but a little too wordy","review":"There's a lot of comparison between how humans are like apes and how different we are from canines... a little too much comparison I thought. I appreciate all of the insights and I can understand her wanting to make a point but I found myself wanting to skip all that and just \\"cut to the chase\\".There's a lot of interesting information about dogs it's just kind of hard getting past the other stuff to get to it.McConnell has a booklet called \\"How to Be the Leader of the Pack\\" which I'm hoping is the shortened version of \\"The Other End of the Leash\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is really great!","review":"I just finished reading this book and I have to say, I loved it! The tone of the author is personable and not at all condescending. She has some fascinating ideas about primates and canids and uses amazing sources to back them up. This is not a training manual. I see it as more as a guide to dog and interspecies behavior that should accompany a training book and some real life classes. I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great book for dog owners","review":"This book is really great. She understands how dogs think, and by explaining it to you, you can understand your dog. Then you can train your dog with positive methods."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best on dog behavior","review":"I love this book! Patricia McConnell brings a very human touch to writing about dogs, reminding us that while we are not perfect, neither are our dogs. This book should be read by everyone thinking about getting a dog, since it really gets into the way a dog's mind works.I found this a very enjoyable read. I liked the real-life examples McConnell uses and how she isn't the \\"perfect\\" dog trainer and lets us know that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthwhile reading","review":"This book was recommended to me by a professional trainer, and I have gained a good deal of insight on dogs from it. Everyone who owns a dog should read Chapter 8 -- it's everything you need to know in a nutshell. I personally could do without all the references to primate culture and the study thereof.....I bought the book to learn more about my dogs not chimps. But it explains nicely why people do what we do, why dogs do what they do, and how we can better communicate with each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works in Hours","review":"Within a few hours of finishing this book my dog started barking outside. My husband thought that perhaps the dog across the road was out again. so I looked outside at my dog and told my husband that it was the kids not the dog that were out across the street. the dog was showing the come play with me attitude not the dominance display, and I finally got the signals!Wonderfully intutive and a good read. Full of lots of fun stories and information in an easy to read format that really helps with all dogs."},{"rating":"2","title":"READ THIS BOOK","review":"I found this at the library, loved it so much I had to buy my own copy.

I use it in my trainer wheel so I can't give much feedback on real road conditions, but it's great on the trainer.My only warning as echoed by other reviewers is that the 32mm valve length only sticks out ~20-25mm (1 inch) from my rims which are fairly shallow. With a deeper rim it could be difficult to have enough of the valve for your pump to attach to."},{"rating":"2","title":"yes!","review":"So far, so good!

(oh, and it's also a fire hazard)","review":"The Amazon product description lists the Inspiron 1100 series as one of the products this adapter is supposed to work for. The \\"good\\" news is that it does indeed plug into our inspiron 1100. The BAD news is that the transformer brick overheats and after a couple hours of use it is almost too hot to touch, to the point that the label is starting to blister off. The product we received is definately a MAJOR SAFETY HAZARD. We are not going to plug it in again and are going to try to return the product.What is potentially the problem? Although the description lists the 1100 series, and the plug fits fine, the technical details DONT list the 1100 series. This makes it look like the adapter / laptop battery are potentially mis-matched voltage/amp-wise. There's no telling what damage this did to our laptop battery. Hopefully, all the carnage is on the adapter side."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"Did not fit my Dell Inspiron 1100. Kept falling out of the power jack when I put it in.

The production is on top. This album was originally released online which finally kicked PE off Def Jam. It would later be released and i'm glad. There are alot of good political songs. Favorites include Are You Gonna Go Our Way???, LSD, Here I Go, Crash, Crayola, First The Sheep Next The Shepherd?, Last Mass Of The Caballeros, What What, Kevorkian, and Swindlers Lust. Highly Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't try and compare it !","review":"It's really dumb trying to say that this album isn't as good as say 'Nation' or 'Fear'. After their last few releases, especially 'Muse Sick', it's good to see Chuck D and the boys back on track. This album may not be as challenging musically as some of their previous efforts but lyrically it is literally louder than a bomb. Chuck D is one angry MF and he doesn't hold anything back here. This album reaffirmed my faith in PE. OK so it's not as good now as 'Nation' was then but you could argue that there hasn't been a hip-hop release since 'nNation' that's even come close to the mark. Do you wanna go our way? Yes please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fight the power in another way","review":"Listen to this sound and you will learn a lot for the life .

This album takes some time to get used to, but is one of PE's best yet. Buy this CD!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very positive","review":"the noise is back, well, sort of. PE get back to winning ways with a little bit of retro noise and rap. Chuck vocally strong as ever, Flav is the usual Flav with maybe just a litle bit more maturity in his own raps. The beats are strong and powerful with a funky feel, that prove PE have meandered between hardcore and a more funky feel, which they failed to carry off on 'Muse'. To me, it just lacks the punch which drew me to them in the first place, the power only evident in a few tracks, most notably 'Do You Wanna', a cut in which all good things PE are in view. Overall, a welcome return to form for Chuck, with a tidy album which suggests even better to come. Yeah, very good effort, but don't ever compare with 'It Takes...'

The first three to five tracks are OK, and then the disc falls flat. The last couple of songs bring it back a little (hence 2 stars instead of 1), but compared to \\"It Takes a Nation of Millions\\" and \\"Fear of a Black Planet,\\" this album pretty much is a loser. In the short space of eight years, Chuck D has gone from powerful and informative to paranoid and pathetic. PE (and the Beasties) should stop mailing it in, or hang up the mic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment Yo!","review":"Yo, this is maybe the worse attempt by the band yet.

I will probably avoid any more Dean Cain movies after seeing this one. Seemed like a lot of bit part semi-stars that I see in a lot movies and TV shows, but it really lost me.

While it is full of stereotypes, it is done in a way to get laughs, and it is very much an homage to \\"Shaft\\" and other films of the 70s of the genre. The Hebrew Hammer is a Jewish PI; he was bullied as a child when he went to a Catholic public school, and when he grew up, he dedicated himself to making life better for other Jews and doing what he could to help Jews be proud of who they are. When a new Santa Clause takes over, one who is set on destroying Hanukkah, The Hammer joins forces with the Jewish Justice League and the Kwanzaa Liberation Force in order to save Hanukkah.

Change is good when it includes cleaning the sheets and birth control (after the fourth child to an unwed mother).One must own this movie to review the one-liners over and over. Everytime I watch it I find something new and whimsical. The accents are also sometimes hard for us Americans to understand until we hear it a few times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just gets better with each viewing","review":"Our family loves this movie.

There are no negatives to this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"The period costumes are amazing.","review":"This is a great movie to introduce to bookish teenage girls. It's very English and very period without being creepy as in BRIGHT YOUNG THINGS; the cast is perfect and the clothes are fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"highly overrated","review":"I don't know what the other reviewers who gave this film a good review saw, but I was extremely disappointed. From the excellent reviews I'd read about how hilarious this film was, I was really excited when it arrived and when my family and I got to see it. Perhaps they were more used to British comedy, but I did not find any of it \\"hilarious.\\" Some of it was humorous, but nothing in this movie was side-splittingly uproarious, as I had been led to believe.My family and I like British comedies from the 1970s and later,such as Are You Being Served? and The Last Of The Summer Wine, so we realize that they have a different sense of humor. Perhaps the fact that the book upon which this film was based was written in 1932 explains why the comedy was much tamer or more droll than what we had expected.The film could be called amusing, but I would warn viewers that they should not believe the hype it received from some of the most favorable reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ahh, the country life","review":"I like to find movies in which current \\"stars\\" were not yet household names. I enjoyed Kate Beckinsale in such recent films as 'Underworld' and 'Van Helsing' and this plot line of one of her earlier films, sounded humorously entertaining.Kate plays an orphan, Flora Poste, who goes to live with your long lost cousins at Cold Comfort Farm. Flora likes organization and finds very interesting ways of making her cousins see their true paths in life (often leaving the farm to do so), while simplifying and keeping her life organized. She's a very charming control freak. The film has a true, understated British humor and charm with many great one-liners, but I can't say that I found the film to be \\"hysterically\\" funny, nor worth the repeat view. I strongly suggest Greenfingers (Clive Owens) and Saving Grace (Craig Ferguson and Brenda Blethyn) as alternatives in the category of \\"not yet a household name\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bit Too Twee For Me","review":"Cold Comfort Farm spoofs the gloomy British novels of the 18th and 19th centuries, by dropping a modern-minded young London lady with her efficient ideas about how to tidy up life (Kate Beckinsale) into the middle of her \\"Wuthering Heights\\"-like country cousins. This movie requires some knowledge of those \\"it was a dark & stormy night\\" novels (Thomas Hardy, the Bronte sisters) to get the humor of the premise, and is probably best appreciated by people who know that genre very well. Otherwise, it comes off as a well-acted little story about a clever girl from the 1920s straightening out her weird, ignorant relatives down on the farm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful cast","review":"This movie is an absolute delight. It's one of my favorites. And the cast is stellar!

Kate Beckinsale'role very similar to her role in Emma."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold Comfort Farm","review":"I purchased this movie based on a friend's recommendation and the positive reviews. I found the movie to not be as funny as anticipated and I think others need to know that there is sexual content in this movie. This was not stated and for a \\"PG\\" movie the extent and explicitness' of the sexual content was extreme. This movie should be rated \\"PG 13\\" for language, and sexual content."},{"rating":"1","title":"well, I suppose it was meant to be funny","review":"Bad writing, bad acting, one cliche after another. It takes a very clever writer to satirize bad writing, and very good actors to satirize bad acting. These folks weren't able to carry it off. Too bad, I really like Joanna Lumley and she didn't have much scope in this program. Well, it wasn't all that bad, but I wouldn't recommend that anyone actually buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Completely Charming British Hoot!","review":"I'm all for the Brits and Cold Comfort Farm is hilarious!It starts off with Flora Poste traveling to the raggedy farm of her distant relatives. When she gets to her destination she meets some strange people she wished she could forget. Similar to the film \\" Pollyanna \\" Flora breezes into people's lives, making them happier than they've ever been. Kate Beckensale is beautiful, charming and loveable in a film everyone will enjoy. This is a quirky little comedy of intelligence. The perfect film to accompany afternoon tea. A comedy must see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must See","review":"This film is not just a \\"chick flick\\". You are drawn in by the bizarre characters and can't help but laugh at the absurd idiosyncrocies of \\"Cold Comfort Farm\\".

It was witty and humorous, but the book is so much better. Stella Gibbons' prose is a delight to read. Read the book. I guarantee you'll love it if you enjoyed the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harpsichord vs paino","review":"There are lots of piano transcriptions (sic) of the Goldberg Variations, but Goldberg did not play the piano. Neither did Bach. Lots of Bach is wonderful on the piano but this work really needs the harpsichord. There are few recordings available (Wanda Landowska, for gOd sake!) -- and the hunt is made more difficult because the Amazon description does not tell you what sort of instrument it is performed on. But this is a damn good performance and worth hunting down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"Among the countless recordings of these masterworks this version is certainly no gem. I find Kenneth Gilbert's technique dry and uninspiring and coupled with the harpsichord which lacks any dynamics makes this rendition an exercise of utter boredom. The overall pace of these recordings are static. There is no motion. The tempo is kept at an even walk for both the preludes and fugues! The impression I get is that Mr. Gilbert is simply bored and finds playing these pieces a chore. If one had to settle on a single version of The Well Tempered Clavier one can certainly do better than to choose this set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Software too old, cannot be used","review":"Besides the 2 newer laptops that I have, I still have a PC with floppy drive, using window 2000.

Where as I didn't care for it others thought it was great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"I give it 2 star because it was humorous. It was not a romance novel....it did have some emotionless sex scenes but not once Max said the love word ......and the ending was terrible. For the heroin at least....this was my second book from this author and the last one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartfelt feelings are expressed","review":"At first, I didn't want to see this video, but I watched it with a friend. Sandra Bullock portrays an alcoholic unwilling to quit her erratic behavior. She learns who she hurts, and how, and ends up learning how to help herself with her addiction. I thought this movie showed a lot of the real life aspects of being an addict of alcohol. It's not exactly a family movie, but if you're into movies that make you think a little, you might enjoy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gwen Is Not a Lesbian","review":"Funny, yet still has its moments of sobriety, no pun intended. A pretty honest look at rehab, but in the form of a comedy, it is both interesting and entertaining. Definately worth renting at the least. Fans of Sandra Bullock will like this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Predictable","review":"Sandra Bullock gets into a car accident, is sentenced to 28 days in rehab, goes to rehab, everyone hates her, she might get kicked out, then everyone loves her and she leaves rehab all happy and her problems are long gone. This formula is so predictable, yet so wrong. This movie tries to add a few laughs with a gay character, but I don't think this is the type of movie that should be generating any kind of laughs. I didn't like this movie from the start and ended up laughing at it instead of walking away from it knowing that I've learned something."},{"rating":"1","title":"28 Days comes up short...","review":"First off I'd like to say that I'm a very big fan of Sandra Bullock. Her quirky nature and cute antics usually brings life into a movie. HOWEVER, 28 Days was absolutely terrible. It's a shame that Sandra couldn't turn this movie around, but it's not her fault. The plot is lacking, and full of holes, and the characters in the film have absolutely no depth. The movie had very few comical scenes, and the dramatic sequences were drawn out. This movie is very predictable, a 5 year old can figure this out. If you don't believe me, go rent the movie, and when you try to figure out why you wasted 2 hours of your life on this lackadaisical film, you can e-mail me and tell me that I was right. 1 star for this movie, and if there was no Sandra Bullock, this movie wouldn't even get 1/2 a star."},{"rating":"1","title":"28 Days DVD","review":"I have never received the product. I ordered it March 3, was informed it had been shipped, guaranteed delivery within 15 working days, and my credit card was charged.

Because it protrays 17-year-old girls in such a negative light. I'm almost 17 years old and I felt disgusted that adults think that all teenagers do is smoke and do drugs and drink when they really don't.In real life, teenage girls don't do that kind of stuff. I think Hollywood producers should make movies about girls following their dreams and finding themselves rather than they do drugs and overdose and die. It's so disgusting that the media presents teenagers like this to the public and then adults think that's what young girls are like. I don't think I have ever seen a movie about a seventeen-year-old girl like this ever. It's the worst movie I've ever seen in my whole entire life and I shouldn't have seen it to begin with. I'm sorry I wasted my time watching this piece of crap. I love Sandra Bullock, I think she's a cool woman and an great actress, but this piece of trash is too horrible for words. It's sick! Don't watch this at all!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrifying!","review":"What was supposed to be a romantic evening with an attractive lady friend became an evening of sheer horror after seeing this film. While this movie may be billed as an upbeat comedy about a big-city newspaper columnist who is forced to go into rehab, it was anything but. First of all, Sandra Bullock is only in the film for about 2 minutes where she devours a screaming man and is cut up with a machete. The rest of the movie deals with a few people who are fighting for their lives against people going through sever withdrawal issues (rotting skin, vomiting blood, and trying to eat people's brains, etc.). The group fights their way out of an apartment building to find help from the military only to have to then fight off the soldiers who attempt to rape the women of the group. This movie literally left me shaking in tears and I never heard from my date again. Stay away from this move AT ALL COSTS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bullock is fantastic","review":"This film shows what it is like to have a alcohol problem. Bullock plays an alcoholic that crashes her sister's wedding and has an accident that lands her in a rehab center. She goes through withdrawal and ends up finding a friend or two at the rehab center. Her boyfriend is also a alcoholic and does not understand her when she turns her life around. When she finally gets out she ends up helping a friend in the real world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my first choice...","review":"I rented this movie because Sandra Bullock is my all-time fave actress and she is great in all that I have seen from her. But I have to admit, this movie was a bit of a disappointment. The storyline was pretty sloppy, and the ending wasn't really an ending. It was a bad place to leave off. It gave me an inside look of what goes on with people in rehab though, so in that way I did enjoy it. But if you're looking for solid storylines, this may not be the movie for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sandra Bullock once again pulls it off!","review":"All I can say is that this is probably Sandra Bullock at her best. She normally plays sweet, somewhat innocent characters, but here she is an alcoholic and heroin (or was it cocaine?) addict. She comes to rehab to see pathetic alcoholics chanting \\"Together, together, no drugs!\\" and singing with the classic \\"Lean on Me.\\" She is more accustomed to \\"Joy to the World\\", by Three Dog Night, and spending her nights at parties instead of liver inservices. I will not give away the end of the story, but it is very sweet AND moving. It certainly makes us think about certain everyday things we take forgranted. This is definitely a movie for all to see, but I think the rating is wrong. I am almost sure this movie was R, even though this says PG. Even if you don't buy it, at least take the time to rent it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly new or inspiring.","review":"The biggest accomplishment was being able to skirt the real issues of drug dependence in a film about drug dependence. Just think, that in 28 days you too can become a happy, well adjusted, strong, and clean person! Some of us know better."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"Although Sandra Bullock does a pretty good job considering her limitations as an actress, I found this film essentially boring. The romance angle is unconvincing as well as are the meant to be colorful members of her AA froup. It's been a while since we've had a propoganda vehicle for AA, e.g., \\"I'll Cry Tomorrow,\\" \\"Days of Wine and Roses,\\" so to me, the picture seem dated in that sense. AA is not as successul as motion pictures would have us believe. although it surely is better than nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie seems as long as the title would indicate.","review":"Sandra Bullock \\"vehicle\\" in which chemical dependency -- and the associated problems associated with it, like familial disassociaton, depression, suicidal tendencies, withdrawal, mental illness, even the \\"psychological roots\\" of the addiction -- are breezily resolved in 90 or so minutes. Of course you got your cute guys (Viggo Mortensen) and your assorted, harmless nuts for \\"comic relief\\", if you must call it that. Steve Buscemi's counselor-character threatens to become interesting, but he's sort of forgotten about pretty quickly, because Bullock must never, never, NEVER get upstaged . . . or allow anyone else to shine even for a brief moment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Flick","review":"I first saw this movie in a \\"Substance Abuse Theories\\" class. I liked it so well that I wanted to see it again and purchased a copy for my home. It is a realistic, yet comical look at drug/alcohol rehab. It is enlightening as well as entertaining. Sandra Bullock is convincing and believable as usual. It is well worth the price. Denise Massey"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good film, great extras","review":"The breezy rehab story of Gwen Cummings(Sandra Bullock) and her 28 days towards the road to recovery isn't a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination, but it's definitely enjoyable.The key points to the DVD that may warrant you buying it are Betty Thomas's directors commentary, three character testimonials that were cut from the final film, instructions on how to make a gum wrapper chain like the fiesty heroine,theatrical trailers,and talent files. But the best thing, and possibly worth the price of the rest of the disc, is the hilarious 26 minutes of \\"lost episodes\\" of the fictional soap \\"Santa Cruz\\" that everyone at the rehab center watches.That alone is almost as funny as the movie, with the actors playing their scenes with intense seriousness amid ridiculous plot situations even more far fetched than the average soap."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Revolving Door?","review":"I like this film, which can be a cleaner version of drug and alcohol addiction. Sandra Bullock and Viggo Mortensen are terrific but the film can be unrealistic regarding drugs and alcohol and becoming clean in 28 days. It follows the AA model and clearly a \\"white\\" addiction and fails to address the revolving door that any addiction can resume and lacks the prostitution aspect. However, the film displays usual facets of addiction recovery which can be relationship development, sabotage and a lack of the impact with family system development by only blaming the addict, and not addressing the vital forces of trauma, mental illness and co-dependency with addiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary, informative, enlightening","review":"This was a somewhat accurate protrail of an experience in a treatment facility. While many things were dramatacizerd, it was fairly true to life. It is great when people actually get help for their addictions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgetable Film","review":"My actual rating for this film would be 2.5 stars.The film was based on a woman who was sentenced to an Addictions Center by the Court. The most talented actor in the film, Steve Buscemi had a comparitively small roll. You tend to want to compare it to Michael Keaton's 'Clean and Sober', but in reality there is no comparison which is disappointing. All in all a very forgetable film. The Theatrical trailers had little to offer as far as insight. Just Actors and Directors patting each other on the back.If you want to see a film that explores this type of content with a little more realism and understanding of a complex subject, purchase Clean & Sober."},{"rating":"2","title":"great...","review":"WHOA! all the great ones are here!

First off, i don't know why the lady sounds like she has a frog in her throat when she sings. Man she sux! Also, the keyboardist obviously doesn't know how to play drums, because he doesn't. The hip-hop influences on this cd are obvious, and the guy from Linkin' Park adds a helping hand with some singing. This helps.Overall, you must buy this cd, but don't waste your money on it because it sucks soooooooo bad. You can if u want tho. Maybe you're like me, and money grows on your ankles. (but maybe not?)FINAL WORDS: This album may have been good if it came out in the 90's, but for a 2003 cd, what's goin' on guys?

The only band that comes close is the Ramones, but they only sing about horror movies on a few songs (They're still an excellent band, though) Definitely the best Misfits CD--with Static Age at a close second. I really can't get into their new stuff. It's just not the same without Danzig. That voice...its just perfect for the band. Every song is awesome, but my favorites are \\"Hatebreeders,\\" \\"I turned Into A Martian,\\" and \\"Astro Zombies.\\" Oh, and who couldn't love the less-than-a-minute-long \\"Braineaters.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The Misfits At Their Greatest!","review":"This is an amazing powerhouse of an album. Featuring several tracks that made the Misfits famous with their short and unbelievably addictive songs, this is simply a CD that you can't pass up. Songs like I Turned Into A Martian and 20 Eyes will have you singing and humming along for hours on end. My personal favorite on the album is All Hell Breaks Loose. This short catchy tune is played loud and fast and leaves the listener with a charge of energy that they didn't previously have. The album also features a very rare live performance of Mommy, Can I Go Out And Kill Tonight? that you're not gonna find anywhere else.

Plus, as Frank Kogan said, \\"real punks don't wear black\\". That said, this lp does not hold up all that well - having heard this stuff since 1985, I don't really ever feel I need to hear it again. The first few songs rock, but the approach and \\"whoas\\" kind of sound lame after a while and the lyrics are pretty dumb. Even a dumb \\"Anti- Reagan\\" band was usually a little more interesting than this in the having something to say department.

Definitely would not recommend and wish I could return."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for everyday or travel","review":"I bought this to use as my \\"essentials\\" purse inside of a bigger handbag when I went on a trip recently. I usually carry as small of a purse as possible, but I decided to by as big of a purse the airline would allow and got this bag to stick in it to hold all the stuff I must have with me. It fit all the basics: Phone, camera, keys, cash, cards, lipstick, sunglasses, etc. allowing me to leave the huge bag in the trunk when I went site-seeing and shopping on my trip. I really like the adjustable strap so I can wear it across my body and keep my hands free. It has tons of places to keep things and it has become my everyday bag now that I am back from my trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"A useful man purse, European carry-all or satchel","review":"I need to carry lots of keys and small items back and forth to work. I was given one of these small bags as a gift about 10 years ago. Although I was not a fan of it when I first got it, I grew to use it regularly. Yes it can be considered effeminate to carry a bag for a man. I use it with out the strap and find it very helpful to carry all my junk. I am one that hates to carry everything in my pockets. So this small bag fits the bill. I affectionately call it my \\"Man Purse\\". My wife gets a kick out of my name for it, but agrees with its usefulness. I purchased this to replace the 1st one of the same brand that lasted 10 years. I would buy this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baggallini Works","review":"I purchased the Bagallini prior to my trip overseas. No space is wasted in this purse. I was able to carry most of the necessary items I needed for my trip. Perfect zipper compartment for my passport. I was even able to fit my digital camera inside. The adjustable shoulder straps are a plus. Loved the double coin compartments which kept my U.S. coins separate from my Euros. The only complaint I have is that the pockets where you keep your credit cards are not sturdy. The material is too flimsy and my credit cards and driver's license kept falling out. Other than that, the purse is constructed well and is very convenient for trips, tours and a day at the County Fair. Wish I had purchased this item a long time ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As good As the Last Album","review":"Where do i begin with such a horrible album.

It might take a minute to get used to the environment because Ragnar needs to climb up, down, diagonal, and do a few inhuman jumps. The graphics are brilliant particularly the magic runestone effects.But then there is the multiplayer online mode. This is worth the price of the game alone!

After I ordered this tape, I read the accolades for Bud Greenspan, NBC's Olympic video producer, and got ready to relive the moments. I was disappointed, to say the least. I wrote a letter to NBC excoriating them for actually cutting out the middle of the 800 meter races (they're only 2 minutes long, for Pete's sake!), among other things. I never heard back. You would think that they could use their extensive footage of the Games for something, but no. Although the coverage of the women's 400 meters and Kathy Freeman was great - a truly inspiring story there, as opposed to the Marion Jones overplay - this video is not worth the 5 cents it cost to make, and Bud Greenspan should be ashamed.

Eventually I threw it away and bought a simpler nozzle and was happy for some time. However it did not last long. The vacuum cleaner became unusable again and forever. The problem was that one day the retractable cord disappeared inside the cleaner and could not be retracted any more. I attempted to take the cleaner apart but failed to do it without damaging its body. That was it. It was my last try.

When it arrived (very quickly, by the way - excellent seller) I opened it inside my house. I immediately moved it outside because the smell was horrible! When I picked up the ball, my fingers came away covered in awful smelling gunk. I noticed that the entire ball was covered in it. I inflated it and realized it was big enough for me, NOT a two-year-old (even though it was described as the \\"small\\" size - I can't imagine what the \\"large\\" looks like).

They are very detailed and beautiful and easier to handle. However, I am a bit confused because I have seen several different Tinker Bells, and now two different Firas. The other Fira has a much more colorful costume and different hair - I wonder why the variation? Disney should just stick to the illustrations in the books. Despite the design confusion these dolls are lovely and it is wonderful to have wholesome sweet dolls for my daughter to play make believe. I have read other reviews where dolls fell apart, but so far these dolls are sturdy enough for gentle play; however they are more delicate than your typical barbie-type doll (the wings and costumes will probably rip if played with roughly) so the child must be old enough to understand how to handle them properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"As a parent I am very disappointed in the quality of these dolls. Our first was Bess. On the way home from the store her leg fell off. We turned around and returned her. The next doll was one hour old and her head fell off.

The person who attends a live concert probably does not even think about what is involved and the rehearsals the artists have to do before a performance when the musicians are local talent and do not travel with the artist(s).

Harrison's story of this alternate history involving Viking and Saxon contention for 9th century England is extremely well written. A definate page-turner. It's rare that I find a book so enthralling that I (literally) can't put it down . . . but that's exactly what this book did to me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read for Avid Fantasy fans!","review":"I first read this book back in High School and now, over a decade later, I still remember it as being one of my favorite books. In fact, I now own the remaining two books in the trilogy! Harry Harrison (HAHA...how can anyone forget that name) evokes a dark and vividly exciting world set in the medival ages; during which time the Vikings are prowling the seas and have created a fearsome, unstoppable force. The story itself centers around our protagonist who begins from humble beginnings. And through a series of events guided by his otherworldly father, places him in a league with a splinter faction of the fearsome Viking warmachine.Harrison does a great job of keeping the reader enthralled and entertained with plenty of action and a plethora of locales. This is a must read for any avid fan of fantasy books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent reading material","review":"I loved this book, brilliantly written, the characterbuilding is very strong, the twist of history is very realistic. It seems Harrison has done his homework."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"This book was terrible. I stuck with it, always hoping it would get better. I didn't care an ounce about the main character. It was really just one battle scene after another, throwing in a new weapon each time. The story wasn't very interesting either. Good concept, but not enough was said about the gods and their roles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too aggressive against Christendom","review":"I thought that this book was way too mean on Christians, who are nice people, fighting against enslavement in various places.Really, this Mr Harrison must be mad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brutally realistic, yet idealistic, historical fiction.","review":"Being both a historian and a fantasy fan, I loved this book. Harrison's recreation of the brutality of the so-called Dark Ages adds an element of realism sorely lacking from most fantasy novels. Moreover, he's gotten most of his history right. On top of all the brutality, though, is the desire of Shef and his cohorts of \\"the Way\\" to create a less brutal, more human society, all the while being manipulated by the various gods of Norse mythology. For those who liked this book, try \\"A Game of Thrones\\" by George Martin. The story line takes a lot from the War of the Roses, and Martin is Harrison's equal in depicting the brutality of medeival life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great start to the trilogy","review":"This was a great trilogy. I enjoyed Harry Harrison's Stainless Steel Rat series, but that's a lighthearted, comedic series. It made these books quite a surprise. They follow the life of a boy named Shef and his impact on the medieval european world. It melds together vikings, english, romans, galls, germans, arabs, jews, and almost every people of that time.The series has a strong religions message that doesn't really come out in fullness until the end. Maybe I mean religious philosophy - it doesn't really endorse any particular religion as much as examine how absolute belief without question can be dangerous.The books are quite gritty and realistic. There are lots of battles and fights, and the character development is great as well. The characters are deep and the plot is unpredictable. If you like gritty fantasy, read this trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've lost count of how many times I've read this book","review":"From the beginning you are caught up in the viking age, and the story of Shef, who changes the course of history through the help he recives from the Norse Gods in the form of visions. As an ametuer historian, I found this novel exceptional, and as someone who personally followes the old norse gods, I was not dissapointed. The Gods and Goddesses are portraied truly, I get the feeling the author has had experience with them himself, or at least the input of someone else who does.This is a long book by itself, full of action. The two books which follow it only get better."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've seen better!","review":"Whenever anyone criticizes the Suzuki method, I always raise a red flag (review previous to this one). It's been around forever and has done a world of good!! The Suzuki method books include very mature pieces.As a teacher, First Lessons, just doesn't have enough warm-ups. The ABCs of Violin is better--it's a longer book and includes more material--great selections of pieces, excellent warm-ups. The Suzuki books have minimal warm-ups, mainly pieces, but excellent selection of pieces.First Lessons is an ok book as a supplement just in the beginning, but the Suzuki books and the ABCs of Violin have books you can move on to. Suzuki, Books 1 through 10 and the ABCs of Violin, Books 1 through 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best I've used","review":"I loved this book and CD combination. The CD makes it fun to play the exercises because you can play along with a full accompaniment. The songs are beautiful, and unlike the ABC violin book mentioned by other reviews, they are not songs written by the author, but rather timeless songs known by everyone.This book and CD set has really helped me learn to read music, and has vastly improved my sight reading on the violin."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"The book was good.

However, this double stroller completely lacked. Its the heaviest, bulkiest stroller I've ever seen. And to make matters worse, the steering was horrible. You must use both hands to steer this, so you can forget talking on the cell. I live in a neighborhood with a lot of gently winding roads. I never thought anything of it with my other stollers, but after taking this one for a stroll I felt like I just spent two hours at the gym working my back and arms. I used it for maybe a month and finally had enough and got a double jogging stroller. I gave this one to a friend who was having her second child. She, too, used this stroller once and had enough.

Second, the wheels were making it easy to ride but after a while the wheels lost their rubber and make it very very hard to push it as they got stuch at every turn or corner. i wish i never bought it and wasted my $130 on such useless double stroller.

At the time when I read this diary, I was suicidal and could not stop the things in my head. In these pages I found someone I could identify with, someone who had felt my pain, and who had come out the other side.

I keep reading about the \\"Geniuses\\" who somehow manage to get their Visor's locked up, and it defies comprehension. Here's a hint: On the Visor you will notice a little box with a little picture of a house. It's the box on the top left. When you are done using your Geode, use something (i.e., a stick, pencil, elbow, whatever you can manage) to press that little house. Suddenly, the Geode software will stop running and you will see several little icons on your screen. At this point, it is OK to secure power to the Visor (i.e., turn it off) and remove the Geode.

The maps are too big! You can only add about two maps onto your PDA"},{"rating":"1","title":"Geodiscovery is practically out of business","review":"The Geode has high accuracy because it uses WAAS. But release 1.3 (the latest release) draws maps slowly, does not support color and does not use the industry standard NMEA interface (necessary to use the Geode with mapping software not made by Geodiscovery).Release 1.4 is just a beta and it greatly improves drawing speed and does support color. But the NMEA interface rarely works and this prevents use of the Geode with 3rd party mapping software.Also, the battery life is poor -- only about 3 hours -- and the MMC slots do not work.Perhaps what is worst is that Geodiscovery support is not functional at all. They do not return phone calls or emails. So if you have a problem, you are out of luck.I think that the Magellan Companion ($150) is the best bet right now. It does not use WAAS. However, if you really want the 2-3 meter accuracy, you can get the Sky Golf GPS (looks a lot like the Companion and costs $400) which does use WAAS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is Geodiscovery?","review":"This product holds a LOT of potential. Unfortunately that's all it is right now - POTENTIAL.The released software doesn't support color, routing, searching/finding, MMC memory cards, topographical maps.

They don't answer their phones and I even know of a couple of people who have obtained RMA numbers, sent their Geodes back to Geodiscovery, Geodiscovery has signed for and received them but has NOT returned their money (for over a month now).If I thought I could get my money back from Geodiscovery, I'd be returning mine - it doesn't work as advertised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this product!","review":"Not only is the software abysmal, GeoDiscovery accepts your return, but will neither provide the promiced refund nor reply to your communications.

Maas's genius is how he puts you with his subject to the extent that you are not even aware that he's guiding you through the story.

Now he is independent and records with Chandos. Nowhere more he appears scarily demonic then here in Vivaldi's Four Seasons. I actually discovered this cd much later from other Archiv cds (with Pinnock): to my surprise it proved the best version as I could hear the violinist under the shadow of excellent Pinnock wonderfully conscious of his presence. Pinnock and the English Concert-as always-conveys the unerring sense of vitality somewhat different from Hogwood's. Early digital recording nevertheless sounds better with the authentic instruments. I really highly recommend this cd not only to Vivaldi-Pinnock fans but to anyone who are interested in Vivaldi's Four Seasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Recording of the Four Seasons","review":"Undoubtedly this is the best recording of Vivaldi's four seasons available. The timing of the soloist, pace, sound, and performance is so exact the English Concert must have practiced these concertos a thousand times. I have listened to others including Perlman's version, and I still believe this is the best. I believe one of the reasons why this is such a high quality performance is the English Concert performers are familiar with each other and have been playing together a good stretch of time. Therefore they are able to bring out the best of each other. This is a must for anyone interested in Baroque period violin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Throw away your other \\"Four Seasons\\" recordings","review":"So you already own this work, you say?

I feel as though the artistic quality is removed when Vivaldi gets over polished. I'm not a fan of the Phillips recordings for that reason, even with Mozart. I have heard some really great recordings from the English with Mozart. When you try to over polish Vivaldi it dies. Vivaldi should be left to the masters of Concerto Italiano and Rinaldo Alessandrini, and the Venace Baroque Orchestra and Andrea Marcon. The purchaser for this would be someone who enjoys the substance of very polished classical interpretations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another period instrument version","review":"One day musicians will learn that how they play is more important that what their strings are made of or what the tempi was supposed to be in Vivaldi's time (based on the free interpretation of some obscure period letters anyway).

Some of the reviewers (under the DC-380 planer section) mention the difficulty they've had connecting a 4\\" dust hose to the 4 and 7/8 inch connector. My solution was to buy a standard metal reducer at the hardware store (5\\" female to 4\\" female) and drill out the rivets that hold it together. I squeezed the reducer down until the big end fit on the Delta dust chute and the small end fit INSIDE a 4\\" dust hose. Reassemble with inexpensive aluminum pop rivets and you're good to go.

Detective Inspector French of Scotland Yard is wondering \\"why war conditions had not been more widely taken advantage of by criminals\\". Just such a crime then comes to his notice. Coils of wire and boxes of hand grenades are reported missing from a Home Guard ammunition store at a Cornish coastal village. Soon after an explosion on the beach nearby kills an old man, and later there is a similar murder.This is a grimmer, more static mystery than Crofts usually provided, no doubt reflecting the harsh \\"war conditions\\" in which it is set and written. One of the characters is a writer of detective fiction. He provides illuminating views of the craft of which Crofts was a master."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound, big improvement.","review":"Mounted the DB1001 tweeters on the electronics box (T-top) on my boat.

Throughout most of the book, the main character constantly whined about her evil daddy and how unfairly he treated her.

Things, however, are not as they seem in 19th Century London, with spies, double agents, anarchists and revolutionaries having a field day...In short, the acting is surprisingly average (!), the setting is pretty good, while the dialogues and the plot are below average.The movie has that Sherlock Holmes feel about it, but without the \\"magic,\\" meaning that in the end you are left... numb, and wondering: \\"Was that it?\\"As for the rating, it could have been PG-13.Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off.

The result of scanning a photograph is dissatisfying, and the result of scanning a transparency is simply unacceptable. Scanned transparencies come out unclear and without true color, plus there are always disturbing lines down the middle of the scanned image because the transparency light reads and records imagery from the internal scanner parts which are located right underneath the area where it is necessary to place a negative/transparency.

The sound is pretty good: nice bass, clear highs and overall high end sound. Polk made a new loyal customer here.Shame on me, I decided to buy Infinitys Kappa 62.9i for the front doors just to see if they were any better that the Polks, but what a disappointment.

It took about an hour of driving around to find a place that sold them (autozone) but of course they didn't have just a box of 22ga connects, I had to purchase a whole assorted kit for 10 bucks. (so add 20 bucks to the purchase price b/t gas and connector cost.)I don't recommend these for jeep sound bar application. I don't think they were engineered for the stress of the upside down mount in a jeep.

The problem is that the big black transistor I guess, on both of these broke off at the solder connection. So I had to buy an iron and soldered them both back on and they worked again. However now one broke off again and unfortunately its right where the thin black wire goes into the transistor itself so I don't know what luck I will have getting that fixed.

I first replaced the stock radio with a Sony MEX-BT4000P (decent stereo) and a couple of new Kenwood speakers (KFC-1654S) for the rear. So far, so good.Then I put a Polk DB651 in one of the doors and turned on the stereo. The Camry's stock Fujitsu 15w 4ohm speaker in the other front door sounded clearer, had more bass and had a fuller, richer sound. I tried several stations, the aux in and bluetooth as audio sources, but the Polk sounded tinny in comparison. I cranked up the stereo so it was very loud, turned up the bass on the equalizer, but the old Fujitsu sounded better. The rear Kenwoods KFC-1654S also sounded better than the Polk, but maybe not as good as the Fujitsu speaker.

The bass is very muddled and can not be adjusted via the bass and treble settings on the unit. Added a 50 watt/channel Alpine amp. They sound better on the highs, but are very bright and the treble needs to be turned down for most music. The bass is still horrible. There is no low end clarity at all, just a low droning sound (listening to radio personalities with low voices is unbearable and the bass has to be turned almost as low as possible, music requires adjustment for almost every song). I rechecked the wiring, thinking I did not install them properly, but all is wired correctly. I am considering reinstalling the OEM speakers (while keeping the amp) as they produced overall better sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value For The Price","review":"I've had these speakers since April, 2011.

Most of its products are pretty good and are worth using, but not the shower gel. This stuff doesn't actually clean your body like a body wash will, and while it has the axe scent of its corresponding body spray type, the smell wears off after 3 minutes, and not because your nose gets used to your fragrance, it never happens that quickly! Furthermore, 'Unlimited' is easily the worst axe scent, it smells like a cross between a sweating fish, a pomegranite, and an eye clinic. Stay away from this, just use some soap or body wash to keep your skin clean in the shower, and keep your axe collection strictly restricted to the body spray and/or dry deodorent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Panic attacks are treatable with proper professional care.","review":"The author of this excellent guidebook is a board-certified psychiatrist who has, himself, suffered from panic attacks. He endeavors to inform his readers of the biological basis for panic attakcs and phobias. These illnesses can be treated, with a high degree of success, usually with a combination of medications and talk therapy. The treatments are carefully explained. The author stresses that both the diagnoses and treatments of panic attacks and phobias require the attention of a fully qualified psychiatrist. I think he makes the case convincingly. No one confronting these illnesses should attempt to resolve them without understanding the psychiatric perspective that is skillfully surveyed in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Odd, brief, and unoriginal.","review":"This odd book begins with the author, a psychiatrist, telling the tale of his inability to diagnose his own panic disorder, and then running off to the hospital repeatedly for useless EKG's thinking he was having a heart attack. Then in one of the more glaring non-sequitors ever typed onto a page, the balance of this thin book is a rant against non-MD mental health care providers, psychologists and MSW's especially, who shouldn't, he believes, be used to diagnose panic attacks, an ordinary disorder this psychiatrist himself couldn't diagnose. He does make some good points for the use of benzodiazepines, but errs repeatedly in his self-myth that the disorder cannot be cured. Something behavioral psychologists do daily. There are many books available that give the reader a good picture of both how one has acquired this disorder and how one may get rid of it.

One of the best of 2005."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusual Story","review":"I'm not sure if I enjoyed the story or writing more.

I feel that this character spends too much time in one place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing, boring","review":"i give the book two stars because the writing is exceptional compared to many other books I have read. However, I could not get through it. I found it very boring and depressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best memoir I have ever read","review":"I loved this book! The writing is amazingly interesting and every bit of sarcasm and wit comes shining through. The beginning of the story isn't unusual in itself...a young boy being brought up by his struggling mother without a father at home. He's desperate for some male leadership in his life and isn't simply fulfilled by his colorful extended family members. What is unusual is how fun this book is to read considering it's a memoir, at least in my experience with memoirs. The bar comes alive in your mind and you can see why this boy is entranced with the men that work and drink there. His descriptives are clever and entertaining the entire way through. I gave this book to my husband to read when he had to go out of town and he absolutely loved it. This coming from a man who rarely reads unless he's plopped on a beach somewhere, and even then doesn't care for too many books. I eagerly anticipate the author's next published book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book of all time","review":"This is my favorite book ever. Great writing (very smart), endearing, witty, sensitive yet funny. I thought perhaps I was so touched because I am a mother of two small boys and found his love for his Mom to be so touching. However, everyone I've ever recommended this book to also loved it. I wish J.R. would write another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"My father recommended this book to me.","review":"My father tends to read only nonfiction historical books, so when he said I had to read this book, I was surprised and then, of course, being a good daughter, I read it. It is a beautifully written, highly evocative story. JR is a gifted writer. He is also painfully honest. I thought I was joining the boys club at times. At other times, I was peering into a soul that was desperately searching for understanding and meaning--something men and women can relate to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Through Rose Colored Beer Glasses.","review":"Where I was thoroughly enjoying the first half of this book by the end I found the author a whine of inaction. Yes, I get it - your name is JR - they are not your initials - your father left you - you have an identity crises. But do I need reminding every ten pages? Where the bar sequences are fun the book is ultimately about nothing. The author feels sorry for himself but doesn't act. After years of loving his time at the bar the writer has a sudden and not very well explained turn from his haven. Why?Also, all those years of heavy drinking with no consequence. Really. No consequence to any fellow customerS. Really?I'm also tired of writers and filmakers now using 9/11 as a self discovery tool. It is both cliched and insulting.The book committed the worst sin of a memoir - I stopped believing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"nicely done","review":"This is an outstanding memoir written by a native New Yorker, revolving around a colorful local bar in the neighborhood where he grew up. Moehringer impresses me with his fluid prose, self-effacing style, and sense of humor. There are also wacky characters galore in these tales, some of them so outlandish you'd think they came out of a movie. Such a pleasure to read a positive memoir instead of the annoying parade of pity-party, woe-is-me books that tend to end up on the bestseller lists. This one celebrates life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeper","review":"This is a top 3 all time favorite book.

I'm 75% in right now and hoping, before the end, that J.R., for his own well being, has an epiphany about there being a down side to bars.

Most of the book is an account of this young Ivy Leaguer's pathetic on-again, off-again, puppy love tryst with his college age heart throb and his \\"struggles\\" to get passing grades. Such insipid writing is not worthy of note. Are we supposed to cry over this? I had enough but I kept waiting for more. I kept reading to the end hoping that some depth might develop. Unfortunately the book retained its shallow treatment page after page. Bring on the violins."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can this be true? disappointing","review":"I kept waiting for some emotion, or trial, or addiction, or something remarkable to happen. This book is about a kid who spends lots of time in a bar with lots or people who drink too much and none of whom seem to have any problems. The kid has some difficulty in determining a direction, has some difficulty in getting good grades, has some difficulty with romance, and has many hangovers. I did not find anywhere in which the overindulgence in alcohol caused anything but minor damage and one is left with the perception that his somewhat difficult development years had little or no negative effect on his adulthood."},{"rating":"1","title":"No more Kindle","review":"I've downloaded books to my iPad Kindle app many times.

I loved this book for its simplicity of character and setting, and at the same time its complexity and care of the emotions and feelings within. Simply beautiful. Thank you for sharing the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Memoir that gave understanding.","review":"I have always loved the atmosphere of a bar, and appreciated Moehringer's memoir of life in the bar. I found myself talking to JR as I was reading. I cheered when he got into Yale and could not believe, and nodded in disapproval when he dealt with the girl in his life. This book had it all.I also realized what it is about the life in the bar, whether drinking or not, that makes it the place to be. JR Moehringer gives understanding as he writes about his life in the bar. i wanted to keep reading and i want to visit Publicans soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching personal tale","review":"The best treat is a book or movie you fall in love with unexpectedly. This book did that for me.I had no expectations for this book. I got it out of the library 3 times before reading it and didn't hear of it until 3 years after it's release. Imagine my delight to pick it up (finally) and discover a very personal, touching, charming book. The writing is so vivid and emotional, the scenes play out in your mind as your reading them. I can still picture little JR in front of Grandpa's house waiting for The Voice or carrying Uncle Charlie's girlfriend Pat home after the Mets game. Love the writing, this book is a gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"East Coast Stienbeck","review":"I read many of the reviews of East coast readers that commiserated their experiences of growning up and visiting Publicans, etc. To know that others felt as he did, added to the realism of the story.. The comparisons to the McCourts and other memoir writers rang true, but as a west coaster, I found his style and the characters reminding me more of John Stienbeck-Cannery Row, etal. A great read! It was hard to put down and for the book to come to an end. I hope he will continue to use his great talent to write a novel whether fiction or non. Thanks JR."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read!","review":"JR's life in The Tender Bar has nothing to do with my upbringing except that I was born not too long before he was in North Shore Hospital and spent a lot of my growing up time in Manhasset. It's the whole New York state of mind that he captures so well. Who hasn't played pub- and deli-league softball their whole lives? His post-9/11 experience is one that many Long Islanders lived. I have a friend who was the Manhasset Fire Chief at the time and I know it changed his life in a very profound way. My sister was a LI preschool teacher out east and one student (these are four year olds) lost his NYPD father while another lost her businessman father. We all wanted to reconnect with our roots afterwards. JR Moehringer captured the experience in a very readable way. He wasn't very likeable through most of the book but he is very real."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watching Someone you Care about Grow Up","review":"I enjoyed reading this book, especially when J.R. talks about the book he wanted to write, especially the chapter in which J.R. includes a number of anecdotes & jokes he meant to include in the book he imagined. I enjoyed the process aspect of this book--the process through which we see Moehringer realize his insecurities and identify his alcoholism, problems with women, and the role the bar plays in his life. It's a little bit like watching someone you care about grow up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Having read Sutton by J.R. Moehringer, I was looking forward to his earlier work, a memoir entitled The Tender Bar. Unfortunately the book failed to download properly and I've been unable to read it.

I found it boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"the local bar and the prople in it","review":"This was great book, interesting conversation about growing up in a modern family without one parent and who it effects everyone around them. It is based around a local bar and the stories of the people in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whining Wino","review":"Greatly looked forward to this one as i'm a big fan (the only one left?) of the confessional memoir and (literally) bought into the hype on \\"The Tender Bar\\". After finishing it yesterday i wanted nothing so much as to pop this whiny, self-indulgent mama's boy right in the kisser. ironic to think that the author's alleged tavern upbringing could produce such a self-indulgent, solipsistic bore. Apparently the only thing this baby took from the bar was a cliched alcohol addiction-jeez, where have we heard this before...or should I say where haven't we heard this before?? i never once felt sorry or empathetic for this guy and the so-called hurdles he's overcome just come across here as narcissistic twaddle. He earns a star, tho, only because i do think he's a talented wordsmith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to like it--didn't.","review":"The sentences were so well crafted, if only they'd come together to reveal a story worth the read. By the middle of the book, the author's self-loathing whining had me wishing I could just stop reading it. Alas, I work in a retirement community and had to finish the book--it's this month's book club book. I really tried to like the book, but it was hard for me to get through the endless (and disjointed) nights at the bar. And the author's inability to stand up and be an adult was tiresome in the end. I think the sequel to this would be a much more interesting (and much less whiny) read. I lost interest midway through and skimmed the rest so that I could lead the meeting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suprisingly Disappointing","review":"I write this negative review reluctantly, as I was so looking forward to this book. The blurbs, the reviews, the idea of it, seemed so timely, so great, foolproof really and right up my alley. But...The writing -- on a sentence-level, was so poorly executed I could barely get through 50 pages. I understand Mr. Moehringer is a Pulitzer winner, and I'm sure in the realm of journalism he is on top of his game. And perhaps my standards are way too high and unreasonable reading mostly fiction as I do, but I do expect the craft of storytelling to be employed in some artful way, whether \\"memoir\\" or not. Simple reportage, as this reads, in the long form, seems unacceptable and incapable of holding my interest at least.I'll stop since I don't want to get snippy. But I had to comment on a glaring aspect of this book that most reviews seem unwilling to discuss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Word Slingers, Sauce Servers","review":"I found the book to be captivatingly perspicacious on the subject of Life. You don't mind if I use the word \\"perspicacious\\" do you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Washed away by too many through the day","review":"This guy is a skillful writer though in a way I found depressing. He tells the tale of his broken and dysfunctional family to where you think your heart will break. He then proceeds to glom onto this bar scene where all the patrons are of a sub-Runyonesqe quality. In my view, a bar is usually filled with many troubled and addled people and this one is no exception. J.R M. trades his requisite alcoholic haze for access to the easy male camraderie of his new found friends. Unfortunately, the galloping neurosis of the typical patron provides a dark backdrop to what appears to be a festive scene. The part that sucked me in was his love relationship with his girlfiend Sidney. I wanted him to \\"get the girl\\", but his drinking and lack of ambition did him in. It was sad. He's a clever woodsmith and turner of phrases which makes his book worth reading. The man has talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comforting, Enjoyable, and Oftentimes Comedic","review":"At the risk of repeating what's already been written, I'll make my review short and to the point. This book was a pure joy to read. A *tad* bit slow at times, but what book isn't? The author's ability to share his life's journey with the reader is as enjoyable and warm as you'll ever find. There were moments during this book that I desperately, desperately wanted to go back in time to join JR during his ventures. Or at least observe from a far. I'd give anything to visualize his Uncle and his Uncle's bar buddies while frolicking at the beach or going belly up at the bar. I'll give nothing else away, but I will tell any potential reader that you won't be disappointed. Reading this book was like eating a really, really good steak. You just take a bite, put the fork down, and slowly chew each piece savoring it's flavors and appreciating it while you have it....because soon the steak, just like the book, will be finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"Generally, I like to stay away from nonfiction it usually bores me. Fortunately I did not stay away from this book. It was amazing! This book will stay with me for a long time, with its humor and its tragedy. As soon as I finished this book I shoved it into my mothers hands and said read this, she loved it just as much as I. I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone interested in a great story this is wonderfully written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smashing!","review":"The Tender Bar is a great read, whether or not you came of age in a saloon. You can relate as JR travels through the gin mill of life. I have a definate prejudice for the subject matter and characters since I tended that particular bar under the Dicken's banner. I worked with Uncle Charlie, Joey D and Colt. JR Moehringer's storytelling, humor, and fine wordsmithing do indeed place him with the ledgends of the game. Back up your friends with this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"good concept, bad game","review":"i got this game because i am a pre-med student very interested in emergency care. unfortunately, this game did not live up to my expectations. instead of learning how to use certain tools, you are just expected to know what to do. if you use the beginner mode, it tells you exactly what to do, but it doesnt tell you why. this game needs a tutorial to teach what the tools in the tray are (how are you supposed to automatically know that clicking the magnifying glass means visually examining the patient?) and how to use them. also, points were taken off for stupid things, like asking questions (which is never a bad thing in real life) and doing the correct steps in what was supposed to be the wrong order. the paperwork section confused me as well. this could be a very good game if a few features were added, but overall it did not live up to expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two great albums on one disc","review":"This disc has two amazing punk albums for less than the individual discs cost, and the sound isn't compressed like on the \\"remastered\\" versions, which I'd bought before this version."},{"rating":"2","title":"A timeless and seminal album(s) for any genre","review":"Who cares what kind of music you call it? This album is fresh and original even 20 years later. It takes you on a musical journey through the LA of that period. At once punky, and classic in its songwriting/storytelling, X does for LA in the 70s-80s what the Doors did for it in the 60s-70s. \\"Wild Gift\\" is an incredible album that is honest and straight-ahead. \\"Los Angeles\\" is a shocking story told to a soundtrack of hard-core music. Whether it turns you on to X or otherwise, this is an essential music catalog piece that conveys a time and a place that will never exist again. For me, this album is a perfect 10, it is raw, powerful, and intriguing, and unfortunately, there has been nothing like it since. Buy this album and listen with big ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give Me The Clash and the Sex Pistols","review":"I listened to Los Angeles/Wild Gift recently; I had heard a lot of praise for the cd. After I listened to the record, I tried to figure out exactly what part they were praising. Los Angeles is definitely the better album, but it still came off as disjointed, screaming, bash your brains in sludge. Sometimes that's okay, if the artists are talented. This sounded like every other punk band. London Calling, The Clash, and Never Mind The Bollocks are true blue punk cds, brilliant but still full of aggression and energy.

This became an expensive ordeal, considering I could simply take the digital images to a local store and have them printed for as low as 17 cents a copy. It does take up space in the suitcase, with carrying the printer/powercord/USB cable/ink paper and tray. I used it very little and it recently started to print on only one-half of the photo paper!

It is less than an hour long and starts out with a commercial for one of the Olympic Sponsors. I figured for the price the tape would have 2 to 2 1/2 hours of Olympic Wrestling. Wrong.There are 16 weight classes- you can imagine the depth of coverage with a tape that's about 50 minutes long when you subtract the commercials. A few weight classes were skipped and several US wrestlers were not mentioned.It seems the tape was edited by someone who knows nothing about wrestling or what wrestling fans would want to see on a video of the matches. What I can't figure out is why be so skimpy on the length of the video? They already have the content. A more expensive two tape set that included more actual matches instead of this compilation of quickly edited scoring moves would have been a better value. This tape is so short it is just irritating."},{"rating":"1","title":"The oldest competitve sport and still TV does not understand","review":"This is a poor attempt at making money for NBC.

I coach highschool and after struggling to keep up with and record the coverage i was so pleased to find this tape to share with my team, I didn't even bother Because I was so dissapointed.I recommend... recording college level stuff instead.

The scoring moves shown on the tape don't show the setup that got the scoring move so the tape misses the mark for anyone who wrestles.

It would also be good to have athlete interviews etc. I was very disapointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than an hour long!","review":"I was very disapointed with this video. They were definately not marketing the video to amatuer wrestling fans. It is frustratingly short. The video starts off with a refrigerator commercial. The entire video (including the commercials), is 57 minutes long. 16 weight classes covered in under an hour.The coverage is very fast and very heavily edited. Several wrestlers on the U.S. team were never mentioned. Most matches are picked up in the last minute or so. Very similar to the actual (very limited) wrestling coverage by NBC.The video does include the awesome throw by Garrett Lowney and the Gardner/Karelin bout.I would have gladly paid $50 to $100 for more comprehensive coverage.

It has aged beautifully and sounds completley timeless and mindblowing even now. A gorgeous record. I pull this CD out constantly and listen to it... I always seem to be in the mood. It's just really, really, really great.I wish 4ad had put the \\"No Motion\\" track from the \\"Lonley Is an Eyesore\\" compilation at the end of the original LPs 9 tracks here, rather than 4 select tracks from the first two EPs (which are available, with 'No Motion' on the recent 'Soundpool' CD) - but beggars can't be choosers! I guess that's what CD burners are for...A great album with fantastic production and complex, ambient, wind-chime, jazzy sounds... will put you in a great mood. Timeless!Why did they break up so fast?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Art Rock from the Heart of the 80's","review":"Dif Juz apparently didn't remain together much longer after the release of the \\"No Motion\\" track which appeared on the 4AD compilation \\"Lonely is an Eyesore\\". This is truly unfortunate because the track reflects a band beginning to peak and show incredible promise.This album is entirely instrumental, comprising tracks from previous Dif Juz releases. Deceptively complex, the music lies somewhere between progressive rock and mid-career Cocteau Twins (or imagine a softer, dreamier version of Mogwai). For an album that is now 17 years old it has aged extremely well and still bears repeated listenings on my CD player. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music, Questionable Production","review":"In the early eighties, Dif Juz released a series of brilliant, instrumental EPs characterized by a muscular, cold-wave guitar and rhythm section gliding through gorgeous sonic landscapes. Fortunately, prime examples of this alluring music fill out the final 1/3 of this release. Tracks 1-9 are the band's sole full-length for 4AD. The album material itself is wonderful (especially Twin and Earth, Last Day, Marooned, and Echo Wreck), but it suffers from heavy overproduction by Robin Guthrie, who seems intent on presenting the band's seminal post-rock as though it were new-age, coffee-house background music. Put down your latte, listen closely, and you can hear the masterpiece that might have been.Dif Juz's sound more compelling and distinctive when they stick to their minimalistic roots, as anyone who has heard the absorbing Soundpool compilation can attest. I did like Extractions. I guess I just expected a little more (or less)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing resource and teaching tool","review":"This book is filled with striking, thought-provoking photographs that portray differences in material wealth as they exist throughout the world.

After the initial encounter with Smith, this movie went downhill fast. The acting was great from everyone, but Smiths role as a con artist became lost in a stupid, pointless drama. This was an absolute waste of talent. Smith had a role that could have potentially given him an oscar nomination, but the poor storyline and plot ruined that idea.

Etta James is one of this country's unheralded treasures and everytime I listen to this album, I am reminded of how much we need true artists like her to keep good music from going bad. No serious music collection should be without this one because it IS essential.Note: also get Bobby \\"Blue\\" Bland's 'Two Steps From The Blues' and play it back-to-back with Etta James' 'At Last' for an R&B; listening experience like NO OTHER!

I have not blended ice but on bananas it did not require any effort. Generally you have to spoon the bananas down so the blade can chop them and typically lumps remain.

They used to recommend a Kitchen Aid but the quality must have really gone down hill. The KitchenAid KSB580CR was the only blender to fail part way through the test (the blade loosened and the rubber gasket failed). The two they liked the best were the Vitamix and the Breville Hemiphere Control. The only negative of the Vitamix is the price (but it is the one they have actually used in their test kitchen for years). The Breville supossedly does well but the motor is half as powerful. Even so, the Breville does pretty well. They are keeping it for a long term durability test.Cooks Illustrated used to recommend the KitchenAid but they have gotten a ton of complaints from their members regarding breakage so they gave it a rating of \\"Not Recommended\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"stay away from this blender","review":"i have to admit, the endorsement of cook's illustrated was all it took for me to shell out far more than they are asking now for this blender a year and a half ago. and it really knocked my socks off. well this weekend i filled is will some tofu and peanut butter and other fun stuff for making cookies, and it couldn't blend it. so i took everything out, and when i turned it back on the button lights are all randomly blinking. the crazy thing is, it didn't stop on me or even sound like it was struggling. called kitchen aid they told me i over loaded it, and that it was dead and i am over a year out so no warranty. this blender is far to expensive to just crap out, and that's what it did. she offered refurbished models on their website...no thank you. i already have a broken blender."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cracked after a year of light use","review":"I've had this blender for about a year.

It starts leaking slowly -- you think initially it's just a little overspill from the pitcher -- and then eventually crumbles and the thing is like a sieve as liquid dribbles out the bottom. I called Kitchenaid but it's warrantied for a year, they said, and it was past that. I asked about a recall, or a replacement given the very high rate of failure of this design. The service rep suggested I buy a replacement pitcher for thirty percent more than Amazon charges here for the pitcher and/or a new blender. They obviously get a lot of calls on this product but bravely, and perhaps expectedly, stick to their phone script. As another reviewer noted, either buy another blender (my recommendation) or be Zen about the defect here, stifle any irritation with Kitchenaid's corporate stonewalling, and be okay with buying a new pitcher on a regular basis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Leakage","review":"I got this blender as a wedding gift. It worked great for the first couple months. However, after about 5 months it started leaking. Slowly but surely the leak got worse and worse. The blade on the bottom is loose so when I make smoothies, they just pour right out of the bottom. I'm very disappointed in this- especially since it was supposed to be a really nice blender."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BOTHER","review":"I was so excited when I bought this blender. It is attractive, light, easy to clean and available in many colors. When making smoothies, the blender left big chunks of frozen fruit, I would have to turn it off, stir the smoothie and blend again. The biggest complaint is the design of the connection btw the base and the jar. My daughter was making a smoothie and the strawberries were not blending and she nudged the jar to stir it while the motor was on and it stripped the couplings. The drive coupling on the base, can be replaced for about $6 for the part but inevitably the the male coupling on the jar will strip as well and it does not come apart from the base, so you have to spend another $35 for that part. I have had the blender for 1 year and 1 month and it is not worth it. Not covered under warranty!

Now we Americans get to buy all the cheap imported junk...and pay top dollar for it. Hmmm...what is wrong with this picture?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great for a while then LEAKS horrible","review":"Like many others, we're experiencing terrible leaks from the jar when using this blender. We primarily use it to make smoothies with frozen fruit. The blender does an excellent job of making smoothies, but after about 8 months of use, we began to notice that there were drops of smoothie UNDER the bottom of the jar after use. This has steadily grown into a STREAM of smoothie pouring out of the bottom of the jar, all over the blender and onto the counter every time we use it. We've tried to tighten the hex nut that is on the bottom of the jar and it works to stop the leak for maybe one use and then, poof, the leak is back, worse than ever.Avoid this blender at all costs unless you relish the idea of wiping down your blender and counters every time you use it. Terrible design."},{"rating":"1","title":"comes off the track","review":"Each time I use this blender it works for a few seconds then becomes unhooked or off track from the grooves in the base. You have to take the jar off the base and reattach, often several times to get it working again. It will work again for a bit then go off track again. I can't seem to get it to run correctly for more than 25 seconds. I have become so frustrated I just purchased a new blender from Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for kitchen","review":"We purchased this blender this year and I will have to admit that it surpassed our expectations.

As yet we have found not a single job it hasn't handled with ease.

After a few months of use, the pitcher began to leak slightly... nothing big, but it did require cleaning *under* the pitcher after use. However, after several more months of use with minor leaks, the pitcher began to leak uncontrollably. Literally pouring my smoothie out of the bottom of the pitcher where it would accumulate. After picking up the pitcher, the smoothie would spill/pour down over the top of the blender. It takes upwards of 10 min to clean the blender base and the counter. The blender base is starting to smell bc the smoothies have leaked into the mechanism itself and are no doubt rotting inside. Disgusting!See my pictures in this review for more graphic detail.To KitchenAid's credit, I called and they are sending a free replacement pitcher, even though I'm out of warranty.

BUT the reason I bought a Kitchen Aid is because I wanted it to last a lifetime. This surely is not the blender I thought it was. Right after the manufacturer's 1 year warranty, the bowl started leaking, and leaking and leaking. We tried tightening the bolt but it just kept getting worse. The company did replace the bowl (as a one-time courtesy). But it looks like I will only have about another year left on it before the bowl goes out again.

All 5 pitchers leaked almost immediately, I still use it after 2 years now (I think), but it leaks.Left my inital review below, it is amusing to read (for me at least) as at first I thought I had a good blender.As with many items on amazon, way cheaper than buying in a store. That said, the only disappointing thing is the \\"slow start\\" could be a little slower.

Now I wish I had learned from others' experiences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away From this Mixer","review":"If you intend on making smoothies with ice you need to stay away from this mixer- Believe me! Within a few months of purchase the plastic top started leaking fluid. Then the teeth/gears at the base (it's made of plastic) that moves the blade became stripped because it could not handle the ice. When I called up customer service in January 2011 they told me they would send me a new mixer no problem. After a 4 month wait I called up customer service to find out why the delay and I was told that the Chrome base was back ordered but I could choose another base. When I choose another one, I was told I would have to return the broken blender. When I responded nobody told me 4 months ago I had to save the broken blender they told me I would not get a replacement.Again, stay away from this blender and KitchenAid. It's not worth the aggravation and if you use much ice the blender will break and their is no guarantee you will get a replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Bomb\\"","review":"This blender is \\"the bomb\\".

It seems to be very high quality for the price, although the black plastic is a little flimsier than I would like. The boar bristles are plentiful and seem to be firmly in place. I have another high end English detangling brush that cost 7 times as much--I've had it for 11 years and I absolutely love it.

Truly dissapointing :(Sure, some of the playing and singing is nice...but c'mon, period instruments and forces simply don't work and don't cut it for Bach's Mass in B.For don't take my word for it, compare the Gardiner to other truly Great interpretations like Richter, Enescu, early Karajan, Scherchen, Guilini, Munchinger, and of course...Klemperer.Gardiner is no match for these guys, his rendition is like a little stream along side a mighty ocean!"},{"rating":"1","title":"monteverdi must be...","review":"Monteverdi must be turning over in his grave when he hears the \\"choir\\" which has assumed his name butcher the Latin in this setting of the mass!In reviewing this on the Borders website I noted that the opening of the work is presented thus: KEARRRREEEEEAYYYYY AYYLAYYEEEEESAWN. Not even the most refined Georgia belle could add so many vowels and diphthongs!The apparent attempt by the director to present most movements as a dance plays to the popular notion that worship music should be \\"lively\\" or \\"joyful.\\" This is done without regard to the ideas being expressed. This up-tempo approach comes home to roost in the movement \\"cum sancto spiritu\\" when a lively tempo seems appropriate.

Snipe is a problem but can be corrected by shimming the in/out tables. One HUGE problem though, when I tried to change the knives for the first time, the little hex screws that release the knives round off. This happens even if you use a real wrench instead of the cheezey one they provide. And when the wrench slips, your knuckles go right into the blade. Once any of the 14 screws rounds off, that knife cannot be removed. And since the screws are buried in the cutting head you can't get any other kind of tool in help release the rounded screw. Along with most other models, the 12-1/2\\" Delta model has a MUCH better design. Now I have to take mine in and have it repaired so I would have been money ahead by buying a better model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what they say it will","review":"Deciding between this machine and the 560 was somewhat difficult but am happy with my decision. In retrospect, the small amount of snipe on longer boards isn't severe and not paying the extra amount for a lock down cutter isn't a regret.After a minimal set up period, I was planing old barn lumber and was very pleasantly surprised at the results. If you don't try and take too much at one time, the feed rate doesn't tax the motor too hard even with 8 - 10 inch lumber. The knives are double edged and can be sharpened as well. There was an an extra set in the box so I don't think I'll be needing any in quite a while (baring unforseen nicking)"},{"rating":"2","title":"For the money","review":"This is a money saving machine.

We tried again the next night, and the rash became worse (she stayed dry all night both nights). We tried using the Goodnites a few nights after that, putting a pair of underwear on her first and then putting it over to protect her, but the Goodnite caused a rash anywhere it touched her lower back where the underwear wasn't protecting her. Just want to add that my daughter has never actually had an allergy to anything before that I know of, and we've used a lot of different brands of diapers.Also, don't be fooled that this will look like underwear in any way, this looks like a soft fluffy pull-up. When we took them out of the wrapper, my 2 year-old said \\"that's a diaper! that's a pull-up\\" and my 4 year-old was only willing to wear it because there is a picture of an older girl on the package."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!","review":"If this is your first trip to Kenya, this might be helpful for general information - locations, maps, etc. I bought the newest edition to update the 2009 and so much of the information is totally inaccurate.

The novelty of this collection is the use of original instruments: we are not accustomed to listen to the sound of a fortepiano in the place of a modern piano in works with full orchestra. Bilson gives a very refined interpretation of all the concertos but sometimes the sound of the fortepiano is smothered by the orchestra, in particular by the wind instruments (you can examine for example the concerto k449): maybe it is the only shortage of this recording. Gardiner and the English Baroque Soloists are very good and their performance gives us the possibility to listen to these masterpieces like Mozart conceived them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mozart piano concertos","review":"This collection is no longer in production. so it was nice to find an unused set.

Her point is extremely weak and grounded in a notion of a utopia that never existed. Her attempt to emasculate pre-christian Europeon religion fails, even with all the pictures of the pretty swirls and big-breasted Venus figurines.

Beautiful music, and unlike Purcell's semi-operas, Dido and Aeneas has a dramatic integrity that gives the work real direction. This is one of Purcell's last works. This is a fine performance with excellent orchestral and vocal work. My only reservation is that while Von Otter sings Dido very well, her singing lacks the fire of Lorraine Hunt's performances. Purcell died in his mid-30s. A real pity. He was already a master of traditonal Baroque forms and apparently beginning to change his style under the influence of Italian derived innovations. Another decade or two of life might have resulted in more works like Dido. A nice bonus of this recording are the particularly good liner notes describing the sources of Dido, its interesting early performance history, and the fact that it was probably intended in part as an allegorical warning to King William."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nasty tasting","review":"I threw all of these away today.

The end of the chute is 4\\" and the reducer end is 4\\", they don't fit together they just butt up against each other and I couldn't find any kind of 4\\" splice. The solution for this is to use a dust collector hose but they are expensive so I bought a dryer vent hose.

One problem: the hose is directed straight up in the middle. This design is very poor. The 13\\" inch planer has an angled port which guides the hose easily to the side. Because it is in the middle you have to tie your duct to the side to keep it from hitting your board as it exits the planer. This is not a problem if your hose comes from the ceiling. It is for me because my ductwork was designed in the floor so that it would not be seen.

For those of us restricted to using a circular (e.g., skil) saw, using the CMS is a giant leap forward. Compared to the other models I looked at, I like the built in extensions, the horizontal position of the handle, and the trigger release for changing miter positions. I rarely use the work clamp, but it is a nice feature to have when you need it. Dust collection is acceptable.I could have used the extra capacity of the 12\\" model a few times now, but it wasn't in the budget, nor in my opinion, worth the extra cost. Instead, I just flip the work piece over and make a second cut. Not exactly a joiner quality edge, but adequate for my purposes. My guess is that if you need a precise miter cut on a board the 10\\" model can't handle, you probably ought to be using a table saw anyway. Don't get me wrong, this saw is plenty precise, but double cuts aren't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Saw!","review":"This saw did a great job. It was easy to set the angles accurately even after tightening down the screw (some saw's angles move after you tighten).

The power was good, and I never got bogged down even when trying the saw on thick wood. The \\"D\\" handle is also friendly on the wrists. I finished all the chair rails and crown molding in my house with this saw with no complications.

The 36-225 saw seems to strike a nice balance between weight and stability.Do not buy Dewalt blades for it . . . I foolishly bought two in a package on sale, and I should have bought one Freud blade instead. That'll learn me.

Many of us have experienced a break in the lower guard, which is plastic. You really don't dare use the saw w/o it. Way too dangerous. They have discontinued the part. Perfectly good $200+ saws get added to landfills. I hate to guess how many guys are out there trying to use their saws w/o the guards. Like I said way too dangerous, but you know Delta knows people will do that. Completely irresponsible for a corporation to do something like that. I'd look for a different brand.

There is nothing in the listing that will give you rankings of the school nor recommendation so its just a reference and a list of all the schools.

This new album is even better than any of Above the Law's albums, for the simple reason that it is put together so brilliantly. Kokane combines with 187um to put down melodies remeniscent of Parlaiment over smooth, mindblowing funk. Other cameos such as Xibit and Saafir, only enhance an otherwise superb album.

Setup with my ISP (Cox in southern California) was a breeze. I was up and running in no time.Wireless connectivity, however, has been an absolute nightmare. None of my devices (laptops, bridge, print server) will stay connected for any length of time. When the router is performing well, I'm lucky to stay connected for an hour. When the router is performing poorly I can barely stay connected for 15 seconds.The Linksys forums are crowded with other users reporting the same problem.

Same essential issue everyone else is reporting - ~2-10 times per day \\"something\\" happens such that a complete re-boot of the gateway is required. It seems to do a little better when only a single device is connected wirelessly, but once there are 2+ computers going, it doesn't have a chance. If you're willing to tolerate it, I've gotten probably 2ish years' service out of it.

My first unit waited 20 months before giving up entirely. I paid Linksys $20 for expedited shipping since I need it for work and it took ten days to arrive. The replacement unit started dropping connections three or four times a day on its second birthday. Linksys offer no software downloads or updates - the driver is dated 2004 - and of course - the replacement unit is not covered under the three year warranty since that started with the purchase of the original unit.

The wireless connections will randomly drop, then will refuse to correctly connect, despite the fact that nothing has changed.

Good luck with that. Almost everyone reports a major hassle and hours spent trying to get through the outer tier of customer service reps to someone who actually has a clue. And, no, it's not user firmware upgradeable. Apparently neither Linksys nor the cable companies are taking the initiative to resolve this for their customers.

In the short 6 days I had the unit connected, it reset itself over 30 times, according to Comcast.

My ISP is Comcast (in San Francisco). Although hooking up the unit and configuring it was fairly hassle-free, the unit very quickly showed its principle weakness: it loses the connection to the internet *very* frequently, necessitating a power shutoff.I figured that calling Linksys tech support would solve my problems. Dealing with Linksys tech support achieved nothing other than convincing me to never buy a Linksys product again. Their so-called tech support was an insulting, infuriating waste of time.Bottom line: the WCG200 is defective by design, and Linksys tech support is a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Firmware Problem with Comcast","review":"I just spent many hours with Comcast and Linksys tech support. The gateway drops the connection after about 30 minutes and must be rebooted.What happened is that the cable companies made a change to their system. The gateway no longer worked. Linksys fixed it in an update to their firmware version 2.0.3.9.31. The earlier versions will not work.The problem is that the cable systems control all updates to firmware. Even if Linksys were to update the firmware the cable system would overwrite it with the version they currently support.I am a Comcast customer and they will give no indication as to if and when they will push out the update. Consequently, this gateway cannot work on my cable system.Be very cautious before buying this. I suggest getting a separate modem and router. I understand that the CM-100 cable modem has relatively few issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"locks up and crashes often","review":"I made the mistake of purchasing 2 of these units in the mistaken belief that the first unit's misbehavior would be fixed by the replacement.

Signal quality is very important for a cable modem to lock onto a frequency.In many homes the coax is either old or of poor quality and is probably split multiple times.

If you can do it with less cables HOOAH! BUT.... it is another linksys disappointment. This is the third linksys product we have owned. Like the others, it drops 6-7 times a day. I contacted comcast about the issue and then told me to call linksys. Linksys stated it was comcasts fault. I spend 6 hours on the phone trying to resolve the issue. We have internet phone.

Try a different model."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUGE mistake","review":"got this one at best buy and i was happy with it because the unit is a combination of cable modem and a wireless router in 1. bad part is that it disconnects the internet if you do simultaneous wireless connections/downloads. it has nothing to do with my internet provider. all my wired devices can download multiple files without disconnecting. it is when i connect my pc via the wifi that the internet connection is being disconnected. I even tried downloading just 2 podcasts simultaneously and then the internet goes down and you have to power cycle the modem.so, if i were you, i would not even try it. oh yes, it will be good for 30 days. but after that, i wish you good luck. hehehe"},{"rating":"1","title":"STAY AWAY","review":"This would get zero stars if that was an option.This router is absolutely useless for wireless.

Basically, to read all the news stories I need to in the morning, I have the option of either rebooting between six and 10 times or plugging directly into the modem.This thing is junk. The only thing worse than this modem is the technical support, which is strangely enough unable to \\"support\\" for \\"technical\\" issues, such as, the modem crashes a dozen or more times a day.If you don't mind resetting your modem several times a day, restarting downloads and not being able to watch videos or stream audio, then by all means, get yourself a WCG200.

As it turned out, the unit they sent was manufactured in 2007 and I was replacing a unit made in 2009.

Each piece contains piano and vocal parts as well as chords for guitar; arrangements are easy to play yet sound great. As an added bonus, each song includes a summary of its history, information about its composer, and other such information.

This movie doesn't for one second belong in AFI's Top 100. It is overly long (right at 3 hours) and is only compelling for a few minutes of the 180 long ones the viewer must endure. It takes an almost an hour and a half to get from PA. to Vietnam. Yes we meet the characters but do we really need to spend so much time learning who they are. The wedding scene last longer than some weddings I have been to in real life. And I'm sorry, they could not have picked a more disturbing theme on which to base a movie.

It's also one of the most overrated movies I've experienced. Why does Cimino spend so much set-up time in Pennsylvania? The wedding is quite unremarkable, and maybe that's worth telling us, but there must be far more concise ways of achieving that objective.And in what sense is this a realistic war movie? Of the 176 minutes of this movie, fewer than five are spent on scenes which have anything to do with combat or the wartime existence of the soldier. And of the thousands of Americans who went to Vietnam, how many were forced to play russian roulette? This film does not depict the Vietnamese people well.That said, there is some great acting here, particularly in the most traumatic sequences. The roulette sequences have stayed with me ever since I first saw them back in '78 or '79, but frankly the movie has not improved over the years. I suspect my copy of the DVD will gather dust.

It features one of the best ensamble casts in cinematic history- DeNiro, Walken, Savage, Streep all give intensley dramatic performances.

The portrayal of a group of rowdy raucous steel-workers in a Russian part of town does seem to go on and on (and on) and wasn't sure I completely bought their friendship. There's only so much machismo I can stand as well. As for the Viet Nam scenes, don't know if they bore a lot of historical accuracy, but they get the point across (on lack of value for human life). Good movie for those with an interest in Cimino's work or the work of Deniro and company though personally I found it kind of boring and depressing - subject matter being what it was. I wouldn't watch it again - I'm thinking it won all those awards mostly because of the social significance and the time it was made. Overall I think this is a somewhat overrated film. You couldn't call it bad, but then again, it didn't really move me."},{"rating":"2","title":"definitely not an anti war movie","review":"I don\`t regard this film as anti-war at all. Its the charachters that are the key here not some overiding message. I don\`t buy that for a second and the people who accuse the director of lacking in vision are being unnecessarily critical in my opinion. The Deer Hunter may appear slow paced at first and one might ask why the first half of the film wasn\`t condensed into 30 minutes. This is done deliberately and once the film reaches its conclusion, it becomes clear that the director was more concerned with the charachters and how their personalities were altered by their harrowing experiences. It was necessary to prolong the first half of the film to enable the viewer to fully appreciate the emotional ties, that were about to be put on the line by the war, and to create a sense of realism that would only increase the level of tension in the second half of the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Deer Hunter","review":"The Deer Hunter took us from the streets of a steel town to Vietnam and back. It was an interesting piece on what happens to people who are subjected to constant stress. The story itself is probably not plausible but the stress levels that are depicted in the movie are real. I served in Vietnam for a year and a half and I can tell you the feel of the movie is spot on. If you haven't seen The Deer Hunter, please consider doing so by purchasing it on Amazon.Com. It's well worth the price of admission."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"In one scene, this movie took me from sheer terror to sheer ecstacy. I got up and shook my fists in joy when DeNiro turned the game of Russian roullete on those commie jerks. I also cried like a baby at the end. It was the second biggest tear-jerker of my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feel sorry for the poor Americans.","review":"'The Deer Hunter' has some really powerful and moving moments, but the entire movie is just a bunch of bologney. The story is about a group of steel workers who go off to Vietnam, and because of the war, their lives are destroyed forever. The idea is nice, but the movie protrays the Americans as good-willed and noble, while protraying the Vietnamese as money-grubbing, mean-spirited devils. Many parts are extremely long, drawn out, and flat out boring.I wonder why the film doesn't show anyone protesting the war in America. I also don't remember hearing or reading about U.S. soldiers being forced to play Russian Roulette..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"The Deer Hunter is one of my favorite movies of all time but its not for everyone. The characters and their development ARE the point of the movie rather than strict vietnam authenticity which it lacks. Every scene has a purpose so if one has trouble concentrating during the slow parts, you may miss the subtle and powerful underlying theme of friendship...the point of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"You cannot really understand the true meaning or feel the true impact of this movie unless you lived during the Viet Nam Era.It was a time when an entire generation was thrown head first into a war 10,000 miles away to a country that most of them never knew existed and to make matters worse the culture and climate were completely foreign to them in every way.It was a time when the youths of America stood up against the status quo. We had love ins and sit ins and cope outs and walk outs.The characters in this movie represented the hundreds of thousands of average Amrican males that we lost by way of death by bullets, booby traps, drugs, Agent Orange, etc. and many who still suffer from post tramatic stress disorder, and various illnesses.Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now, Platoon, and Full Metal Jacket touches my soul and are testaments to those to so gallantly put their lives on the line in tumultuous war."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clipping my toenails was more entertaining!","review":"Oh my, where do we start! One long and tedious film. Who wrote the script? It seems to me all actors were just ad-libbing their lines. Don't even ask me how itwon best picture. Was 1978 that bad of a year for movies? This film is only for die hards of De Niro or strange war films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz..............The critical acclaim of the Deer Hunter once again proves the common wisdom that if you produce an utterly boring movie, devoid of plot or substance the artsy crowd will fill it with imaginary attributes. In a nutshell this movie is zzzzzzzz.......... There was nothing in it anywhere that relates to my experiences in Vietnam or its aftermath, nor any relation to the lives of other vets I know. If you think it's art, fine. But don't think it has anything to do with the real Vietnam War. Chop it to 90 minutes and it might become watchable. Deer Hunter most resembles one of those Italian or French films where actors stare into spce for 5 minutes of dead screen time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake me up when its over.","review":"ZZZzzz Good morning o i just woke up i puit on the deer hunter and must have fell asleep. First of all this movie is too funny for a war drama, the first hour is the guys messin with each other, playin pranks and joking around. Secondly there is russian roulette not action, so when walken shoots himself at the end its not sad, its just predictable and stupid. Thirdly the is only about 10 minutes in vietnam, and the rest is talking and russian roulette. This movie was one of the most boring pointless movies ive ever seen. 1 out of a 10. Watch platoon instead way better."},{"rating":"1","title":"too slow","review":"This movie is just too slow and makes you bored.Except of some scenes (in vietnam)i can\`t find something to keep my interest.Classic but......."},{"rating":"2","title":"WORTH WAITING FOR","review":"This film takes an investment of attention that most modern films do not require. The payoff however is unique and lasting.In the story we follow a group of friends, some who go off to war in Vietnam, some who stay behind. The characters here are not flashy, but they grow on you as people do in real life. We get closer and closer to who people really are without relying on a hero. Solid performances all around.The contrast of the mountains and the town and the struggles in Vietnam are startling. In all three places, people decide, each in their own way, how to deal with a season of madness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slooow","review":"I watched this in the theater in the late 70's and had nightmares about it, but I have memories of liking parts of it. Watching it recently I could not find much to like. It was slow. I expected more action and less character building or something. It is now in the garage sale collection... free to a good home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Vietnam movie ever made","review":"One of my all time favorite movies. Incredible story, amazing acting - especially Deniro and Walken (Deniro was robbed of the best actor award if you ask me, although Jon Voight was great in Coming Home too). Can't wait to see the deleted scenes and extended scenes. The slapping and hitting, by the way, is real during the Russian Roulette scene at the POW camp. DeNiro wanted them to really hit him so he get more emotionally involved in the scene. Amazing! Great movie and a must see. It's on AFI's top 100 movies of all time for a good reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good But Too Long!","review":"I just couldn't get into this because of the length. As noted dozens of times, the wedding scene was just ridiculously long. My other problem was that the movie didn't flow... it just jumped from scene to scene leaving the viewer wondering what just happened. I'm glad I finally saw this, but what a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"where is the Cimino commentary? UK only?","review":"...so this is available in the UK (I purchased an import) with a commentary by Michael Cimino..in the US we get the cinematographer?he IS a great cameraman but why is the director commentary not included domestically? The second disc in the UK has an interview with the ever-strange director as well as with theaformentioned Vilmos Zigmond and actor John Savage! It really puts this \\"special edition\\" to shame!the US edition the LEGACY edition..has 16 minutes of deleted/extended scenes in poor condition with no commentary and the trailer on the 2nd disc...what a scam! There is no need for a second dis for such ...nothing! The UK edition has sooo much more to offer....I'm thrilled to own it and enjoy a true SPECIAL edition...send Universal a message and boycott this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A geographical horror","review":"Nobody will like this review because it treats a great movie with a certain criticism: that Pennsylvania should never have been transformed into Switzerland or Montana or New Zealand.The magnificence of the \\"pennsylvania\\" countryside truly detracts from the movie's power by offering a more magnificent landscape than the story's reality. The real Pennsylvania, or its likeness, would have sufficed to give the viewer a moderate view of the characters' background rather than suggesting that they evolved from geographical grandeur into snivelling consciousness."},{"rating":"1","title":"totally unbelivable and unintresting","review":"THis film hardly does justice to vetrans of the Vietnam war becaues it exploits what happend to them and then plays it in complety unrealistic ways( I know becaues my father is one) Above from the story unrealistic tones, the film is hardly intresting in any cinematic terms. Every scene is draged out way to long and every charter is carboard or worse. THe film musical score is equally hokey. The film also is done in by weak writing and genrally bad acting. ( espacilly di nero which is shocking) Wlakens ok but nothing speical. The story telling is badly disjointed and tells a secen from one to many angles. Any one who claimed they went throught a similar story has bowed to waht the media thinks hapend in vietnam.

TOO SLOW!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very strange and twisted","review":"I usually don't give reviews like this but here goes. This film $ucks! I am a De Niro fan, but not this film. It is very strange and twisted. It is not an action film. This is not a love story. This is not a fun movie. There is no good scenery. I don't consider it a thinking film. Any film where the primary characters play Russian rullet is not a thinking film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless drinking to mindless killing","review":"The wedding scene. What's with the hour long wedding scene that goes nowhere? My time is worth more than listening to a senseless script. Maybe the plan was to show senseless American life of roughhousing, drinking and merrymaking next to senseless burning alive Vietnamese? If that's the point than I find this movie lacking.I can get that hollywood thinks that American's are a bunch of rednecks in under a five minute scene. There is no need to paint a degrading and mindless hour long intro picture of the brave men and women that make up the vast majority of this country as being rediculous drunks.how is this an Oscar winning movie?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll keep this simple...","review":"This is definitely one of, if not the worst movie I have ever seen. It is horrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Masterpiece of Cinema.","review":"Classic poetry is harder to achieve with a film than with words. There is obviously a great deal more involved. But The Deerhunter is one of those rare cinematic masterpieces that achieves it. Everything comes together and speaks to both the intellect and the heart. The haunting and beautiful musical score and the perfect casting of actors who are working with the freedom and flexibility of material and attitude (that eventually becomes completely stifled in cinema by the onset of the censorious dogma of the late20th/early 21st century) enables them to portray characters who seem so utterly real, three dimensional and enchantingly unique. A gift to the history of cinema."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotional","review":"Stunning, but depressing, depiction of before, during, and after Vietnam with the main characters being a group of steel mill working buddies who live for drinking it away at a local bar after work. Outstanding performances, particularly by De Niro, Walken, and Savage. A bit overlong, but overall an outstanding motion picture. The last scene is very tearjerking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another WAY overrated 1970's flick...","review":"what was it about movies made in that decade? Was everybody so high that they thought anything controversial made for \\"great art\\"? This movie was mind numbingly boring for the first hour, and felt like a bunch of pieced together demo reel's for the second two hours. I had heard many people compare this to \\"Apocalypse Now\\" (one of the greatest movies ever made), this movie was not even close. The cinematography and audio (including the musical score) was some of the worst I have seen/heard in a while. The ONLY good thing about this movie was it's grat cast of actors. At the end of the flick I had only one comment \\"well that's another 3 hours of my life that I'll never get back\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"HD DVD Not Any Better Than Standard Version","review":"The Deer Hunter (Universal Legacy Series) is just as good as the HD DVD version.

If you can read zone 2 DVDs on your computer or DVD set, you can buy one of those editions (in English with optional subtitles) on amazon.co.uk or amazon.fr, and I bet you will prefer that.2) Though I really love Meryll Streep, I feel bad that her picture has replaced John Savage's one on the cover of this edition. Doesn't make sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge letdown!","review":"I finally rented this movie, 26 years after it came out. I always thought, this must be a great movie, but for some reason I just never got around to seeing it. God was I wrong! The first hour is so boring, you just want to shut it off! The rest of the movie is just pointless and stupid. Over and over you keep seeing people play Russian roulette, to the point where it's just ridiculous! If you haven't seen this movie yet, and you're expecting to see a movie that was worthy of winning five Academy Awards, think again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sappy Sewage","review":"Look, I was in 'Nam and this movie captures nothing but a few tears from weepy card burning hippies who used to throw eggs on us back in the day. This film naively chose to focus on the sad aspects of war, like watching your buddy go crazy. It neglected to display the great aspects of war, like you and your buddy being able to legally kill people. I mean, you can call me crazy, but until you've actually been in that position you don't know how exhilirating it is. This movie is unrealistic, melodramatic, and highly overrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take some No-doze","review":"This one took two hours to get going.

It does cover the war, but it covers the effects of the war on people and communities; very little of the film takes place in Vietnam.The bulk of the movie takes place in Pennsylvania where we see the friends going through bonding and anticipation as they prepare to leave for the war. After the war, we see how they bring parts of the war back with them and how some can't leave it behind.Christopher Walken and Robert DeNiro give great performances. The change in Walken's character is very noticeable and well portrayed by him. The change in DeNiro's character is much subtler.I would highly recommend seeing this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect movie","review":"It's a perfect movie. Every single scene, every dialogue, everything is exactly where it should be, exactly how it should be, even the scene of the marriage, often considered too boring and long. All what happens in this scene is useful to understands characters deeply. this movie is shocking, it expresses in a perfect way the sense of deep desperation and lack of hope of these people. The war is described exactly as it is: an horrible, not human thing. And those who come back from war are not human: cold, mad, ill and disappointed, unable to walk, or speak (see the scene with Walken in Hospital). An amazingly great performance by Christopher Walken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't quite see the appeal","review":"This movie is loved by so many. But I personally was never able to connect to it. I felt it was a bit too \\"hollywood.\\" The grit never made it through a certain dated sheen. But I did, however, really enjoy the beginning Steel Belt portion of the film ... a real sense of ethnic heritage, class portrait, and a specific if unremarkable moment in US cultural history. That to me was actually more captivating than the main Vietnam portion."},{"rating":"1","title":"An overlong, bloated film.......","review":"The Deer Hunter is an overlong, bloated film consumed by a sense of its own self-importance.Giving it a best picture oscar was one of the worst blunders ever. The film is practically pointless and rambles on and on. A great anti-war picture? There are far, far better ones (Paths of Glory, All Quiet on the Western Front). Is Deer Hunter anti or pro anything? You bet. It is anti-intellectual and pro mindlessness.A self indulgent three hour symphony of incoherent sentimentality, inarticulate dialogue and congratulatory posturing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some holes in the plot, but very good nonetheless.","review":"There were gaps in this story wide enough to fly a helicopter through, and that distracted me a little.

Don't see this if you insist on taking everything literally though. It doesn't work that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes a point.","review":"The details in this film are a bunch of crap.

She loves it for many reasons. It's so slim, she can put it in her back pocket and take it anywhere. It's easy to use and she has gotten a lot of great shots with it. She doesn't print out many of her photos, but emails them back and forth with her friends. Her best friend has a canon elph and the pictures don't look any better than the shots my daughter takes with her new Casio. The only problem we have ever had with it is one time the lens wouldn't close when she turned it off. We had to take the batteries out and them put them back in. Then it worked fine. This only happened one time and she's had the camera for about two months now and uses it pretty often. I think this is a great little camera. It takes a nice picture and wasn't too expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after warrenty ran out cost to fix $150 same as new one!!!!","review":"This camera was good until the warrenty ran out. It broke with a lens error and I shipped it to Casio (Time Machine) to repair...They sent a card back saying the repair would be $150.00 with shipping. The same as a new camera not to mention it cost me to ship it insured to them. I can have it back if I pay 15$ more for them to return the broken camera to me. So they get to keep it and they will repair it at cost so they can resell it to some poor unknowing person. I will not buy from Casio again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basics are easy but long learning curve","review":"I purchased this camera for the pocket size and the great reviews. I remember seeing a movie (can't remember which) where the hero hands a gun to the heroine and she says she doesn't know how to use a gun. \\"Point it at the thing you want to kill\\", he says.OK, so I can point this camera at the thing I want to take a picture of, but what are all the icons on the screen? A User Manual does not come with the camera (only a quick reference), so I go to the Casio website and download the 250+ page manual. I am a technophile, so it's entertaining to me to explore the features of this camera, but I've had it almost 2 months and I still don't know many of the major features. WIth time and study, I'm sure I'll finally understand my Casio Exilim."},{"rating":"2","title":"good camera, but battery sucks","review":"I bought this camera on amazon back in 2007 and it still works like new.

It is very attractive and small, and I loved the large LCD screen. Unfortunately, after using it for a month without a problem, I made the massive error of putting my computers on the computer. After removing the camera from the USB - and yes, I did it safely, I'm not new to this - the camera would not turn on. I recharged the battery, let it sit, and said prayers - nothing. I exchanged it for another one, which worked fine for a month. And then guess what happened?Yup. It died.So, I gave up, got a refund at Target and bought a Fujifilm F470 (which is working perfectly - I highly recommend it.) In short, this camera takes beautiful pictures and looks great, but in my case, it was a real lemon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks are more important.","review":"This camera is definately a eye-grabber.It's skinny, pretty , and black, which makes it look even slicker.

There is a setting for this scene, but no matter what I do, the shots come out almost unreal looking. Pictures of people come out great! :)The software is useless unless you have Windows 98, but the camera itself works without the software on any higher programs like XP.I was hoping to make larger prints from this camera, but I'm beginning to think its not going to produce anything larger than an 8 1/2 x 11.

After about 2 weeks, the lens door started to make a clicking sound and stopped opening. I returned it to Casio for warranty repair. Called 8 weeks later, and learned that they had sent me a letter, which I never received. After two requests, they FAXed me a copy. It said that the camera had \\"corrosion,\\" which was not covered by the warranty. Repairs would be $135 (cost was $200).I had the camera returned unrepaired, and carefully opened it. There was no sign of corrosion anywhere inside (examined it with a 10X lighted magnifier). I then exchanged E-mails with Casio Customer Service (an admittedly nice lady). She said that all I could do was to send it back for another exam by the same techs as before! I guess \\"the customer is always right\\" doesn't apply to Casio. Would not recommend this camera, or any other Casio product, based on this experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for taking pics on the fly!","review":"I bought this camera for my son to take on vacation, but when it arrived, I kept it and made him take the old digital camera! It's small, slim design makes it super easy to toss in a purse of backpack, allowing me the freedowm to take pics almost anytime. (I did purchase a little case for it). It's features are easy to use, but the instruction book is kind of pointless beyond setting it up. Blogs helped me more. The screen is sufficient in size, clear and bright. I do wish it would take more than 3 pics at a time using the fast shutter (like for capturing a golf swing in motion), but for day to day use, it's really perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coud Be Nice if It Didn't Break Everytime You Breathe...","review":"I bought this camera about 7 months ago, then for some reason when I woke up one day, it didn't work. I went to the store where I purchased it and was very fortunate that they replaced it for a brand new camera. I had the replacement camera for only one month and all of a sudden the camera stopped wanting to retract and zoom properly and constantly says LENS ERROR. Now I have to ship this camera away to get it repaired. If you are looking at spending 150-200 on a camera, do not buy this one. It has decent picture quality and looks nice, but it breaks without you even knowing why or how."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful Form but Dissapointing Pictures","review":"This camera has a beautiful and comfortable form factor but it takes terrible pictures. First off, the barrel distortion at the top of the screen is so pronounced that you can see it easily of the 2.5\\" LCD. Then, even with the high ISO settings, indoor pictures without flash leave a lot to be desired. Pictures were blurry without the image stabilization on, and the images lacked a lot of detail if the image stabilization is on. Honestly, my 2.5 year old Kodak DX4530 takes better indoor pictures without flash.Outside pictures are good, but still suffer from the lens distortion.After 3 days, 400 pictures, and a call to Casio, I am returning this camera. The tech support knew little more than megapixels about the camers and did not have any remedies. I plan to try the Sony W50 and hope for better indoor and optical performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"quite large, wrong print but good product","review":"The quality and material are great, super soft cotton, no crinkly plastic. But I was quite disapointed that they sent a different print than ordered (sports instead of cars), as my child is really into cars and I thought the print would get him excited about them.

Wow, what a revelation.It obviously outrages Barlow that people who defy the Canadian left's groupthink are still allowed to own newspapers in this country. But if Barlow wants to examine bias in the Canadian media, she should start on the left. Some examples she might have considered include the Atkinson family, the Liberal party apparatchiks who control the Toronto Star, Canada's biggest and dumbest newspaper. I'm sure it is mere coincidence that the paper reads like a Liberal propaganda sheet.And lest a socialist like Barlow attempt to pin the blame for this kind of bias on capitalist ownership of the media, let's not forget the CBC, Canada's government-supported broadcaster and a leading manufacturer of at least two kinds of red ink and so howlingly leftist that it has lost any semblance of credibility for reporting anything beyond hockey."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the Worst the Could Happen?....Watching this movie","review":"This is one of the worst movies I have seen in recent memory.

You have been warned. Do the right thing and stay away from this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst that could happen? Watching this film.","review":"Five minutes in, I was cringing. Fifteen minutes in, I was in pain. It rates one star because the cinematography, lighting, sound, and other techical crews did competent work -- and because it's the lowest rating on the form.If you love a good comedy caper, read the Donald Westlake book this atrocity was based on. It's clever, thrilling and hilarious -- everything the movie ain't. If you *must* get your comedy capers in movie form, get The Hot Rock instead. On the other hand, if your idea of brilliant humor is the stuff that cracks up 12-year-olds when they think they're being naughty, hey, this may be right up your alley."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formula Martin Lawrence comedy","review":"Film students, listen up: the formula for a typical Martin Lawrence film goes something like this. Find a comedy script and remove anything that smacks of cleverness and genuine humor - we don't want to upstage Lawrence's own 'natural ability' to provide laughs simply by showing up and looking cross-eyed into the camera. Add to the cast a sexy black woman/love interest who in real life wouldn't give Lawrenece himself or the character he's playing the time of day. Create lots of scenes that defy any semblance of reality and let Lawrence mug his way through with half-assed imitations of Richard Pryor, Eddie Murphy, and just about any other black comedian you can mention.Speaking of which, I can't imagine Bernie Mac actually found this script funny enough to make an appearance. Believe me, you won't either. Everyone's obviously in it for an easy paycheck. Do yourself a favor and don't encourage them any further."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of a good story","review":"A big fan of Donald Westlake, especially the Dortmunder series, this adaptation of one of his funniest was ruined by allowing the likes of Martin Lawrence. Matthew Chapman, responsible for the screen play obviously didn't understand the Dortmunder character. As usual a good story is chopped and hacked deviating from the story line and loosing the real purpose behind the events that lead to the final confrontation with Max Fairbanks. What a disappointment. At least read the book, you'll enjoy it better and you're intelligence won't be insulted by the fast, smart mouth talking of Martin Lawrence, who by the way is one of the executive producers. Go figure.

I was not thrilled with the story line either, but the supporting role, played by GQ, the up and coming star, was one of the best aspects of the movie. He added some comic relief when I was on the verge of falling asleep, and his charming face made it worth staying for the rest of the movie. I cannot wait for him to be in other films. So overall, go to the movie for the smaller parts, not the main characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is the worst that could happen","review":"The premise of the movie is this: Martin plays a thief who meets his match when a crooked billionaire(played by Danny Devito) steals his ring in a botched robbery attempt. Martin goes out of his way to get his ring back by making a fool of the billionaire.My opinion: The movie is Saturday Night Live dull. Martin as well as Danny Devito(who should have known better than to go along with this tedious movie) are not funny. The effeminate cop was hilarious and that is about all the laughs you will get out of this dumb movie. I watched it when I was visiting a cousin who stayed in Trenton, New Jersey and rued the day I was curious enough to see this wreck. The movie was about as dry as the Sahara desert and should be a shoe in for a razzie award. If this doesnt make your worst movie lists then I am at a loss for words. Have trouble sleeping?

Martin Lawrence, who is normally a funny guy, just isn't on his game in this flick. Danny DeVito is better, but the material doesn't give him much with which to work.There is a lot of talent wasted on stereotype bits that are more insulting than comical. William Fichtner's flamingly effeminate detective would only be funny to homophobes. John Leguizamo's Arab imitation is less humorous now than it might have been before September 11.The only really funny bit in the film is a strictly visual gag by Stephanie Clayman as the sign language interpreter. Without virtue of a solitary line of dialogue, she single handedly produces all the most hilarious moments in the film.This film is a dud. I rated it 3/10.

There are also some other respected actors here, like Stacy Keach and Geoffrey Lewis. Like Bo, they too do a good job, but unfortunately, the script is what kills the movie. It felt more or less incomprehencible. It would have been fun to see Bo together with these good actors in a good movie. But \\"Sunstorm\\" is not good.

The story is convoluted.I seem to recall a series of films by someone named Andy Sedaris or something. MALIBU EXPRESS, etc. They starred Playboy Playmates who always took a break from some ridiculous spy story to take showers or lay out naked by swimming pools or something without clothes on. They were lame and badly-produced but guys watched them because they provided some visual stimulation.SUNSTORM feels like one of those movies...and they forgot the visual stimulation, if ya know what I mean.

There are explosions and fistfights aplenty. The trio of babes are bargain basement Charlie's Angels. They fight! They were bikinis and fancy dresses during fight scenes!

Even though it was 90 minutes, it still seemed long and boring. Lots of people running, driving, fighting and chasing all without much purpose other than to cause another poorly done fight. The saving grace is the four sisters are all pretty. Save your popcorn and find another movie. Oh, Bo Derek has a minor role and not worth it. I do not recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, if seemingly lesser known films","review":"This review will require an update in due course, as I've only watched two of the four movies (The Way to the Stars, and The Malta Story) to date. But if these are representative of the entire set, then you're in for a treat. What's particularly noteworthy is the sense of realism (including genuine footage in some cases, such as the Malta Story) and well-acted performances (and impressive casts). Neither of the two films I've seen is \\"over the top\\" in their presentation, and while there are romantic aspects to both, these do nothing to detract from the quality of the broader stories told. If you've seen (or own) other British films along the lines of In Which We Serve, The Cruel Sea, or the Battle of Britain, then these make fine additions to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please, you must ignore the comments of the misinformed!","review":"This is not a comment on the album actually listed for sale itself, but about the misinformation listed by two reviewers who are grossly mistaken about this artist in particular.

I was surprised to see this released over 30 years later! The 1st cut was actually a demo that we used as an \\"audition tape\\" to secure bookings (we otherwise would only do paid auditions). Joe Buser became our manager and produced our records. The other songs on the 2 volumes were by other Long Island bands whom Joe Buser also managed.

Our daughter is only two but she loves puzzles, although she gets a little upset when trying to put these together. The bird is by far the hardest in the set. These are different from regular puzzles where the pieces connect one to another, most of these pieces are held together by the frame. The paper inserts are incorrectly offset so they tend to add confusion to the proper placement of pieces.

My only excuse is that I needed some guidelines for decorating in buttercream, and after reading the reviews, thought this book might do the trick. I was mistaken.I have given 2 stars, as the recipe is good (I have used it to create buttercream flowers learnt from other books), and the few colour photos look beautiful. However, as a teaching aid, there just is'nt enough detail to help the reader achieve what is shown. What is there is sketchy at best, with no clear instructions to help overcome problems a learner would face. The book is too thin for the price...it just feels like everything is condensed and crammed in.This book may help if you are already an accomplished buttercream artist, like the author, but definitely not if you're looking to learn something new. Winbeckler is'nt into giving away too many secrets in his book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I believed what the other reviewer said","review":"Wish I could have seen a few pages that were in the book.

Generally they have taken a dramatic, free-wheeling approach to Vivaldi and at markedly up-tempo speeds. The dynamic and emotional range and observation of accenting has become far more acute as a result.BUT ..............There is still no real substitute for this relatively plain and level-headed account played and recorded supremely well. If that sounds dull then the first paragraph above should be reassuring. This set oozes sheer musicianship at every level.I would therefore suggest that among the many pearls of Vivaldi's music available on disc today this still holds its metaphorical head up high. If the program appeals I would suggest that this disc warrants very serious consideration indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Breathtaking","review":"A Vivaldi fan for years, I have listened to many tapes/cd's including the more famous Four Seasons.

The only redeeming virtue came in Cuba Gooding's \\"show me the money\\" line. To save my life, I'd pick him as the only thing good about this horrible movie.

I loved the story of a man who has lead what society views as a successful life, but he wakes up one night and realizes he has a \\"lifesyle\\" built on a sleazy charm and shallow values instead of a real life. The story of his courage in sticking with his decision to change, even though it seems that \\"no good deed goes unpunished\\", is one that kids should see before setting goals for the rest of their life. It's too bad, really, that Hollywood and Mr. Crowe included those (in my opinion) totally unecessary scenes. They don't add anything to the story and could have been done much more tastefully.

I was reluctant to watch it, but a group of my girl friends on my floor in the dorm invited me to watch it with them. Around 2 hours later, I'd found yet another movie that made it to the top of my favorites. When I first began collecting DVDs, Jerry Maguire was one of the first I bought. This is a wonderful movie with incredible acting performances throughout. It made me laugh. It made me cry. It made me feel and every single time I watch it, I feel yet again. If you have not yet seen this movie (I imagine maybe there are 5 people left in South Dakota or something who have yet to see it) you are missing out. It is absolutely amazing in every way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Great acting, great script. Has all sorts of emotions. An awesome movie that will make you smile, laugh and cry.

I think this and Rainman are his best works by far. Jerry Maguire (Cruise) is a top sports agent but when he does a memo stating his firm should be more human, he gets the sack. He leaves taking the goldfish, his one client Rod Tidwell (An excellent Cuba Gooding Jr) and one of the accountants Dorothy a single mum (Renee Zellweger) This film is suberb and really deals with people's emotions. Tom Cruise is exceelent as the confused Jerry Maguire. Cuba Gooding Jr is both funny and sweet as Rod Tidwell and got a well deserved best supporting actor oscar (Show me the money!) Renee Zellweger is very god as Dorothy who is hoplessly devoted to Jerry. All in all this a good, fun film to watch and I must admit I had a tear in my eye at the end, and the 2 little boys in it are really cute."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHOW ME MY MONEY BACK!","review":"Who would have thought that Tom Cruise would play the all-american-loveable-but-vulnerable-goodlooking-diamond-in-the rough-worldly-yet-naive-all-around-hunky-good-guy? So, for everyone who has seen this film it's no shock that Cruise is back here doing the same old thing, only for even longer with more annoying co-stars (his love interest and her irritating son are appalling!) Cuba Gooding Jnr is great and is responsible for both of the stars I gave this film.

Clich�� directing, acting, romance, predictability, happy ending, bad character changing into a good one, everone overcomes greed to become a real happy family, a sad conflict where the family doesn't quite work out is quickly erased by the small resolution to the tiny conflict, and the worst part is the kid who is simply in the movie to draw \\"aww isn't that cute\\"'s from the audience.

I think (as many before me have contended) that Tom Cruise really doesn't act in this movie - he's just himself. But he does play that role well. He's a jerk in Jerry Maguire, I don't think he really loves Dorothy (is that her name?).I like Dorothy (Renee Zellweger) much more, but that just might be because I'm a guy. I think she's doing a wonderful job, although I never really understood why she fell for this Jerry Maguire hot-shot.

Found myself fast forwarding it quite a bit because it seemed disconnected, dragged and very boring. In fact, it was one of the worst movies I ever saw. Maybe it's because I don't care that much for football, (though that was a small part of it). I think it was because the story line made absolutely no sense. And Tom's grinning off and on all the time for no reason didn't either. It appeared he seemed drunk all through the film. It made Renee, the gal who falls for Tom, (why?) appear off her rocker. Tom C. and Renee Z. should stick to better scripts, which Renee certainly has since she made this film, only Cuba G. kept it going."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jerry-rigged?","review":"If only the film had maintained the same level of inventiveness of its opening sequence, this film (or should I say films?)showed promise. Unfortunately, it swiftly becomes a structural nightmare: a romantic comedy nested inside a storyline about a businessman/lawyer who finds his conscience (is that an oxymoron?); a buddy picture (an interracial one, at that!),etc. The talented Mr. Crowe would have done better to remember the admonition of Raymond Chandler: do not mix genres. (Perhaps this is a reason why Chandler's sometime collaborator, Billy Wilder declined to play the small role of sports agent Dicky Fox.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a film worth spending money on...disappointing","review":"When I saw Jerry Maguire, I was in a word, disappointed. The plot was weak and, as were the characters. The one positive part of the movie was the comic relief provided by the little boy."},{"rating":"1","title":"So What?","review":"A predictable love story with an ending you could see coming with the opening credits. Cruise plays, well, Cruise, as only he can. (The man can't truly act his way out of a paper bag-he is so one-dimensional.) Zellweger carries her role well, and Gooding is excellent. I bought the original DVD version at my wife's request (and she now wonders what she was thinking). At least I didn't waste even more money buying the SE version. I give it 2 stars - one for Zellweger, one for Gooding.That's another thing that frosts me with this industry. They hype the new release, you buy it, and later come out with the SE version. If it's a movie you really want to add to your collection, you get your pocket picked. So, the moral of this story is clear. Don't buy the first version - rent it and wait 6 to 8 months for the better version.Regards to all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old Cruise character - Show me the ending!","review":"How many movies will Tom Cruise's character be down and out, and then to our suprise come back to win it all in the end?

Complaints about the lack of Chemistry between Cruise and Zelwegger.THINK: As Maguire simply put it...\\"great at friendships, terrible at intimacy\\"There wasn't supposed to be any chemistry, that's the whole point...one of the main themes was that love can grow on you.Throughout the movie, Maguires relationship with his wife was juxstaposed with the Tidwells.I think that it is that which built us to the climax of the movie...when Maguire finally realizes that he loves her.2. Complaints about how this movie is \\"flat\\".I will not even touch this...well, now I'm lazy..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly, this movie has some heart","review":"I think some of the popularity of this movie stems from the way that it is able to successfully integrate elements of romance, sports, and humor so that it has something for everyone. We really feel for the characters involved, and the plethora of subplots all manage to garner some interest.

Jerry Maquire (who Tom Cruise portrays in his characteristic intense style, as if intensity were the hallmark of great acting--the same way Billy Joel will hammer a keyboard in search of applause) bets his career on another down-and-outer. Along the way, he finds support in a secretary with a moffit-looking son. He marries her, falls out of love with her, then proclaims his love for her with some phrase about \\"you complete me.\\" It is as if this movie became a cliche of cornyism as soon as it was released."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"I really doubt whether I could dislike a movie MORE - one of my least favorite actors performing the role of a SPORTS AGENT (I really doubt if there could be any job that I could dislike more) in a movie that ends up becoming a terrible chick flick.

'Gunman's Hand' mixes two b-movie genres into a single theme, that being westerns and werewolves. 'Tunnel Vision' will scare anyone whose ever visited a dark cavern, and 'Pierced' should be avoided by all those who fear snakes as much as I do.The last reviewer sounded as if he never really read the book at all, as the plot and characterizations in this book are top notch.

I thought it was suppose to be a praise of the christmas message. Gardiner has got it wrong. His very \\"forced\\" conducting makes you think that he wants to improve on \\"the old bore of christmas music\\". If you want it right you return to Richter's good old Christmas Oratorio - which sounds much newer - even by technical standards than Gardiner's. And you get it at bargain prize. Richter's \\"Jauchzet, Frohlocket\\" is full of praise - mighty music. And the words are so nicely phrased by the M��nchener Bach Choir. I wonder if the Monteverdi Choir knows what they are singing. Do I need to say that the singing of Janowitz and Ludwig is by far superior to that of Argenta and von Otter. And that Wunderlich and Crass are so much better than B?r and the funny noises produced by Blochwitz that you sometimes doubt if it is the same music."},{"rating":"2","title":"an essential part of my yearly Christmas experience","review":"It surprises me that a number of people here have given this splendid recording negative reviews, but that is , I guess, proof that people's tastes and expectations are different.What I expect from any Bach performance by (Sir) John Eliot are forward-moving tempi when they need to move forward. Natural tempi in the slower music, always allowing the singers to breathe and phrase easily. I expect crisp, energetic articulation and immaculate intonation from the chorus, and snappy, alive playing from the orchestra. I also expect from Sir John a deep experience of what makes Bach's choral music \\"tick\\", what makes it sound best. I get all this in spades from this recording of this most delightful music. Additionally, I get an excellent group of soloists, one of whom, von Otter, is completely splendid.Add to this an ideal sound balance in Archiv's terrific engineering, a most beautiful cover and a good price, what more can one ask for? Merry Christmas!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bach Beautifully Done","review":"This is an excellent version of the Christmas Oratorio, beautifully played and sung. Gardiner's approach is more reserved than Jacobs's (Harmonia Mundi), and Gardiner's choral and orchestral texture emphasizes cohesion and blend rather than pursuing interest in individual inner parts. The overall tone of the performance is quiet and peaceful rather than exuberant. The vocal soloists and choir are superb. The recorded sound is excellent, though it does tend to facillitate Gardiner's emphasis on blend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for me--in distressed blue!","review":"A friend bought me a pair of sand-colored, regular-height Uggs for my birthday last year, and I love them, especially in this nice fall weather. They're so warm, soft and comfy ... perfect for tramping around the neighborhood, admiring the changing leaves and winter scenery.Since I never tuck my jeans inside the boots, I saw this shorter length and decided they would be even more practical. I was already sold on the comfort, so decided to go for variety of color.I chose distressed blue--perfect complement to jeans--and when I strolled over to the park, I was the envy of all my friends. I hope they make these in pink, like the regular height. I can't wait to get another pair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality for a high price","review":"I thought with a price tag UGG has, it would be pure heaven on my feet. Why is this brand popular? I suppose over the years they've slacked on quality. but I'm generally comparing a pair of sheepskin boots from Chooka I purchased over 7 years ago. Chooka are sturdily made, thick, non-shedding sheepskin, durable soles and withheld inside and outside.

Because my wife uses them as house slippers. (We live in Seattle, Washington State.)We keep our house fairly cold (62 degrees) and heat with a wood stove.The slippers are warm and, having composition soles, they allow one to go outside (as to bring in wood) in rainy or, occasionally, snowy weather.The ankle height is much better than that of conventional slippers for keeping feet and, importantly, ankles warm."},{"rating":"2","title":"UGG Classic Mini","review":"The most beautiful boots I ever had - comfortable and lightweight, even on bare foot, indoors and outdoors.

My quibbles are few, but I do have some. First, I take issue with the division of alto/counter-tenor solos. I think it should be performed by a counter-tenor with enough range. I have heard any number of fantastic counter-tenors who can pull it off. It was written for a man, after all. Speaking of which, this was written for a choir of men and boys. The pretension towards authenticity, with period instruments etc, is nothing more than that -- mere pretension -- without a boys and men choir. Finally, I agree with the amazon.com reviewer in the criticism of the bass soloist; he is the weakest link in the recording -- boring and mushy-sounding. But all in all, a great recording. Better \\"Messiah\\"s are out there, but they are certainly few and far between."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?","review":"There are a few good things here, like the distinct sound of the harpsichord, and the beautiful voices in the choir. Von Otter does her part well and Aug��r is OK, but just barely. She has two voices, one of which doesn't work here.The list of bad things is long, though. The choir sounds unspired, the alto lacks both depth and clarity and the orchestra's timing is off. But all those things are just nitpicking. Then there's John Tomlinson. Honestly, he sounds like a drunk who's swallowed a fog horn. The yoke is easy, but this a joke.A solid 1/5. Is it really that bad? Well, if it wasn't for the basso, it would be rather enjoyable, albeit a bit dull and uninspired, but as it is, it simply doesn't work at all.Listen to the mp3 excerpts.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like soloists","review":"Handel's Messiah includes my favorite aria for bass and on this CD it sounds bad: \\"The trumpet shall sound\\" is completely butchered by Tomlinson.

The conclusion I have reached is that Bartle has written one of the two best books on real analysis that I have seen. (Maybe even THE best!!) The other book that I would say might be it's equal is \\"Real Analysis and Point-Set Topology\\" by Donald and Mildred Stancl. Both of these texts give excellent introductions to the ideas of metric and other topological spaces, which I think is essential to a proper understanding of continuity and, of course, the heart of analysis itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Analysis in Euclidean Spaces","review":"This book does a very good job of teaching real analysis in Euclidean spaces. The development is orderly and rigorous. Every important concept in real analysis is included. It provides visuals for abstract concepts and proofs that are complicated. A good feature of the book is that for some sections, it provides projects that lead to additional results.This book is a bit wordy. Some of its definitions are nontraditional and seem superfluous. Its focus is on real Euclidean Spaces only, which, in my opinion, is its major drawback as far as the sections related to topological concepts are concerned. The theory becomes very concise and elegant when metric spaces are employed, but this book doesn't cover metric spaces. Consequently, this book is not for those who wish to have a broader view. I recommend Rudin's book for that purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Comfortable","review":"The only problem I have is that the super-thick tongue makes it hard to get the shoe on easily; a real struggle.

It is a tough, accurate and vibration free saw, equally at home with construction as well as finish work (a lot depends on the blade). The vertical D-handle is a bit awkward for left handed use but the cast iron base does an excellant job of damping vibrations. It is also HEAVY....at over 50lbs, it barely qualifies as portable (unless you can get one with a fork lift). All in all, I would highly recommend it as a stationary shop saw but would look at Makita for a lighter, more portable, mitre saw. Cheers, John"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent value for stationary use, not very portable","review":"This saw is a great value. It cuts smooth (especially with a new carbide blade) and cuts anything. Miter works well, compound adjustment ok. Dust collection (even attached to vac) is poor.

Delta was unresponsive to emails, letters, and appathetic on phone calls. Repair cost exceeded that of a replacement, and I couldn't replace it with the same (didn't feel it would last).

Krakauer is a good author but he definitely seems to be guilty of padding this one. Due to a lack of specific material to make a novel he continuously inserts long philosophical quotes and excerpts from his own wanderings and anyone else he can think of that had a similar journey.

Like Captain Ahab shaking his defiant fist at an overwhelmingly undefeatable Moby, Chris the so-called supertramp goes down to a meaningless and wasteful death. This book does nothing to salvage his life's squandered value. I wasted my money on this one hoping for another Into Thin Air."},{"rating":"1","title":"More than McCandless","review":"This book began in an interesting way, but fizzled out at mid point. It was difficult to follow because it is not completely linear in its time line and often a location is mentioned without naming the State it's connected to. I was interested in learning what happened with McCandless or a possible reason for his lack of rational. Unfortunately, the story begins to discuss other people who have done similarly foolhardy things and this is where the book became a chore to read. I would not recommend this book unless it is a strong topic of interest to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO damaged!","review":"The book said it was in good-great condition however the cover was completely bent and so were the pages, it wasnt too bad but it really wasnt good or great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Into the wild","review":"I didn't really enjoy this book. I couldn't believe the lack of knowledge this young man displayed to venture into the Alaska Wilderness unprepared and alone. Living in the North I know the dangers and power of mother nature.

Not much suspense!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"Why would I read a book that basically tells me the plot and resolution of the book on the cover? Way to keep readers engaged with the summary of the novel on the cover. I knew what happened without even opening the book, and when I was forced to read it, I found it quite dull and pointless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Into the wild not Into thin air","review":"Into the wild was intersting but slow. Into thin air is much more riveting. There's probably other action books more worthy of your time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"IT'S CRAZY WILD\\"","review":"Into The Wild I feel was a very good book, reading through and learning more about this man Chris McCandless. People wrote that they felt it was slow and boring. I really don't think this was supose to be an adventure book. If you think about it how can it be? A man is writing a book on knowing nothing he has to piece together everything that has gone on that has to do with this book. So how can it be that adventurous if a man is not writing the book from his own expience or from an expierence that he just heard about adn couldn't even talk to the person. I feel this nook is very good because of the way it is written. To think about what Krakauer went through to write this book, I think that is pretty wild itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is not for everybody.","review":"This book is about one man's search for nature and true freedom. A life so far removed from mainstream society most people will balk. If you dream of escaping to a world of nature and adventure you will love this book. If you are content with a stable predictable life, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"get out your highlighter pen for this one , you'll need it.","review":"This book is for anyone with an ounce of adventure in their blood. Not everyone is willing to forgo the comforts of their favorite armchair to brave their own neighborhood streets , let alone burn their money and stick out their thumb! I was mostly impressed with the passages quoted from such infamous writers as Muir, Tolstoy, London, and Thoreau. These are the books that spured McCandless' imagination and gave him the fortitude to pursue his dreams, no matter how wild or dangerous. After I read this book I sent passages to a couple of friends that seemed in a rut. I made sure to highlight those parts that I thought applied to them. Then they went out and bought the book for themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"This guy did what most of us only daydream about!","review":"When is the last time you abandoned all of your \\"worldly possessions\\" and took to the road? To me, the most tragic element of the story was how close he actually was to civilization during his trip into the \\"wild.\\" While I enjoyed the premise of this book, it's (somewhat) lack of focus was annoying, switching back and forth from similar adventures of others, including the author's own experiences. Anyone who has thought of really living life should give this one a try. It is very clear to me that, as a civilization, we have progressed to the point where, if faced with the similar rural environmental challanges as our ancestors, we'd be exinct in no time at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep Details and Misconceptions","review":"Into the wild by Jon Krakauer was a well thought out piece. It did a great job of explaining what Chris McCandless did and suggesting why he did it. False conclusions and misconceptions can be made about Chris without having read this book. Krakauer's mountain climbing background gives him more credibility as the author of this piece. I liked the book and the deep detail that went into understanding the thoughts and motivations of Chris McCandless.

Definitely gives you a greater appreciation of his story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Krakauer is wonderful...McCandless I do not understand.","review":"I thought Krakauer's writing was very good. A great read. As for McCandless, I spent the entire book unable to get a handle on his way of thinking. We can't expect to be uplifted every time we pick up a novel and we can't expect to understand every message. If nothing else,the book shows a human being on the run...away from a life that had boundaries...away from relationships. Most of us are running toward a relationship. I'm torn between reading fiction and non fiction novels. We know were McCandless is headed, but what we don't know is why he took such a path? We know the ending...there is no sequel. An author who writes fiction will leave you wondering what happened to the hero...after the final pages are turned. As for Krakauer, he had no choice. We, as readers, are left with a sadness. Krakauer did his job...and maybe, if nothing else, McCandless did his as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Into the Wild","review":"I had to read this book for my AP English class. I found it to be a very interesting account of a very tragic story. Towards the end it did seem a little repetitive, but other than that Krakauer does a very good job of retelling the sad story of Chris McCandless. He also has a variety of different sources for the telling of the story so the reader can get the full experience that McCandless did."},{"rating":"2","title":"T.H. from Wyoming","review":"In my opinion, the story of Chris McCandless, told in Into the Wild by Jon Krakauer, is an extremely interesting story. Living in Wyoming, this account has a large personal inpact. It is easy to imagine what Chris McCandless' family was going through during the time when Chris was no where to be found. Jon Kraukauer picked a very interesting topic on which to write. Kraukauer's portrayal of who Chris McCandless was and what he stood for helps the readers of this story to appreciate the power and the forces of the wild."},{"rating":"2","title":"A moving true story","review":"I feel that the journalistic account \\"Into The Wild\\", by Jon Krakauer, was well researched and written. The plot of the account was constantly changing, so the narrative was as unpredictable as Chris McCandless' life. Chris McCandless, the subject of the book, is motivated by very powerful feelings. I believe that his sense of adventure was a force that drove him harder than any of his other senses. Jon Krakauer captures this sense of adventure in an organized and captivating way. His interpretation of events flows evenly and methodically with the actual events undertaken by Chris McCandless. Overall, this biography was superbly written, researched, and gave the proper emphasis to Chris McCandless' exciting life and tragic death. DO in Wyoming"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read!","review":"I just finished reading this book, i loved it. I felt it was well written, so easy to read and very difficult to put it down. The biography of this young man alexander supertramp is tragic story, but having read this book i found out a lot more than i ever knew about him."},{"rating":"2","title":"A haunting tragedy","review":"It's too easy and lazy to label Chris McCandless as an ignorant young man who should have known better. His motivations were much more complex than that of youthful idealist, and don't forget that we wouldn't be reading the same story had he not made one or two mistakes right at the end which took his life.I believe this story gets under our skin, or in my case kept me awake at nights, because many of us recognize a little bit of Chris in ourselves. To come of age trying to make sense of this contradictory world; to question why some people choose to live the way they do in obvious quiet desperation.Furthermore, if you were moved by this book, then I definitely recommend the film of the same name. Some of the best cinematography I've ever seen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A LITERARY AND SPRITUAL MASTERPIECE","review":"Upon my first reading of Jon Krakauer's \\"Into The Wild\\", I was profoundly moved in a way that no other book has even come close to. The depth in which Krakauer describes the events leading up to the tragic death of Chris McCandless is poetically stunning. I found it very difficult to put down and wished it had continued longer, as I felt like I was part of his incredible journeys (I only wish). I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who, like me, is fed up with the constraints of modern civilization and has ever considered escaping into the wild."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book with No Adventure","review":"i thought this book was boring and even though it was supposed to be adventurous i found the book to be very boring. it is a great story but poorly written."},{"rating":"2","title":"So good, I read all 206 pages in one sitting....","review":"This book grabbed a hold of me, shook my emotions around and then placed me back down to earth wondering what just took place....that was my adventure. I simply loved this book..and read it in one night. Chris' story is both amazing and tragic...it makes you wonder what made this bright kid tick and why he would trade a traditionally comfortable life to chase the (more) fiction (than non-fiction) of Jack London and/or Therou. What is even more interesting is how close he came to making it Either way, its a great read. As an aside, I actually wrote the author, Krakauer b/c the book moved me so, and he responded w/ a hand-written postcard answering my questions.,,....seems like a class/regular guy...I was very impressed. Anyway, I hope you like it...."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book","review":"Jon Krakauer has been very lucky with his assignments with Outside Magazine. Granted, getting stuck in a blizzard on Mt Everest isn't what most people would describe as lucky; however, he sure has profitted fom writing Into The Wild and Into Thin Air. This book is very well researched but does tend to drag at points, especially when he brings in his own personal accounts. Over all, I would say he's an alright writer who has benefitted from being at the right place at the right time. This book is definitely worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Matt R. Check out this book, it is a good read","review":"This book was a great read but there was a few chapters that i disliked very much. The book seemed to skip around very much. I have read one other John Krakauer book, it was called Into Thin Air, it had some similarites but over all it was a diffrent style of writing. A couple of things i liked about this book was that it told the story of a young man living off the land, with nothing but a pound rice and a couple of bucks. His name was Chris Mccandless and he was a very well educated man but wanted to get away from civilazation. Mr. Krakauer tells the story of Chris's journeys all through the U.S and beyond. Everything was going fine intill Chris's starved body was found in Alaska on the Stampede Trail. I recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure and drama."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book about an ill-fated adventure","review":"A fine, although depressing, book about a very idealistic young man who ventures up to live in the wilds of Alaska, without any companions, food, equipment. A good scenario of the old \\"man vs. nature\\" theme"},{"rating":"2","title":"Into The Wild","review":"Into the Wild is an excellent book which is written very creatively by Jon Krakauer. Jon Krakauer does a great job of portraying Chris McCandless's life and relating the lives of other adventurer's like Chris to his life, giving the reader a better understanding of such a strange and bizarre life Chris decieded to live. I really enjoyed reading this book because it is written very differently and is an interesting story. Not only is Chris McCandless's story an interesting story but all the lives of the other characters the author relates his life to are just as interesting enhancing the book greatly. It is exciting to read and makes you really want to keep reading all the way through. I recommend this book for any type of reader, because anyone will enjoy reading about the interesting life Chris and other characters deciede to live."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too Great","review":"I was disappointed in this book. As others have said, it should have remained a magazine article because there really isn't enough substance, in my opinion, for a book. I think the main character was part immature (for a 24 year old man) and part crazy. I had some difficulty following the time-line. It was never real clear to me just exactly what this guy was searching for."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was well-researched, yet seemed very biased.","review":"After reading \\"Into the Wild,\\" by Jon Krakauer, I must say that i have been somewhat enlightened by the tale of a boy that set out to seek a dream. I enjoyed this book, but I felt strongly that it's tone was greatly influenced by the author. The late Chris McCandless is definitely someone who i admire. He had a desire to go out into the great vastness of our country and seek out what he was missing. Although I do believe that Krakauer glorified his character a little too much, the book was well written, especially dealing with the chronological events that took place. The research done was obviously intense - to go and listen to the stories of all these people must had taken a great deal of time. I feel reading the book was well worth the time it took, and i would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a story of inspiration."},{"rating":"2","title":"The unpredicatable explorer with below par social skills","review":"The most appealing aspect of Into the Wild was the debate if Chris McCandless deserved the respect of everyone who read about his journey, or if he was the most contemptuous person people had ever known. From page to page my oppinion of him changed. When he spends an entire summer away from his home and comes back two days before college I was thinking, \\"He is truly an explorer.\\" Several pages later, however, the reader learns the way he treats those around him. This happens throughout the book, and you are wondering after the final page is read, \\"Do I like him or hate him.\\" It's quite similar to picking petals off a flower. This is the essence of why I turned the pages until the book was finished. It is a story that reminds you of a shock disc jockey: You just want to know what he'll do next."},{"rating":"2","title":"INTO THE WILD is a story about freedom and persuit of life.","review":"Into The Wild, is a story about Chris McCandless, a young man with the desire to live an untamed life. Krakauer does an amazing job in adding such detail, it is over evident that his research was very extensive. Krakauer's ability to relate and inclusion of his personal story show his credibiliy and reliability to be accurate on such a subject. McCandless did something that everyone should follow. He lived his life as he thought fit, to a different standard than that which was set for him. To break away from society as we know it, and live outside of the premade notion of life, takes a brilliant person, not a crazy one, and McCandless was just that. I would of liked to met him if he had made it out alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"After graduating from Emory University in Atlanta in 1992, top student and athlete Christopher McCandless abandoned his possessions, gave his entire $24,000 savings account to charity and hitchhiked to Alaska, where he went to live in the wilderness. Four months later, he turned up dead. His diary, letters and two notes found at a remote campsite tell of his desperate effort to survive, apparently stranded by an injury and slowly starving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting mix of first and third-person exploration.","review":"_Into the Wild_ is a good read, but frustrating. It is partconfession, part narrative, and part meditation on whatmotivates people-- generally young men-- to makehigh risk journeys. Krakauer is at his best when he isable to suspend rumination, and make the imaginative leapinto the queer, bright, grandiose mind of Chris McCandless,who starved to death in Alaska after choosing to neglectalmost every common sense measure for wilderness survival.Krakauer's own autobiographical chapters illuminate his ownlong entanglement with risk, but tend to break up the mainstory. As with Krakauer's articles in _Outside_ magazine,I wished for a strong editor, and one good rewrite."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappearance of a young man","review":"i gave this a 2 rating because i felt the author tried to take his very good newspaper/magazine article and expand it a bit too much into a novel. at times this book went to places that really never held my interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating and disappointing","review":"I was very disappointed by this book. If you take away all of the pages of text detailing what Chris M. *might have been thinking* or *might have done* you are left with little more than what you could learn from newspaper accounts of his mysterious disappearance and untimely death, and it is obvious that this story should never have amounted to more than a magazine article.

I just could not wrap my head around the absolute sociopathic selfishness displayed by Chris McCandless. We should not label him as an admirable hero. He is a whiny middle class white male who is given every opportunity to change the world, which he claims to want to do. Instead of utilizing this opportunity he squanders it to challenge the authority of his parents. It seems to me that wanted people to talk about his adventure, about how courageous he 'seemed' . . .

I guess. It seems to meander about looking for something to say. In addition, I don't trust Krakauer as a chronicler, as it is my understanding that he played fast and loose with the facts in both \\"Into Thin Air\\" (to the fury of some of those who were there) and \\"Under the Banner of Heaven.\\" My biggest problem with the book is that I found Chris McCandless to be a juvenile fool. Despite his alleged superior intellect, he behaved and wrote like a 14-year-old. I really see no reason for glorifying this idiot. His demise was nature's way of purifying the gene pool of a little lunacy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and easy read","review":"Very entertaining for about 3/4 of the way in, lost interest at the end.

It had an interesting story, but I couldn't help thinking the only reason it was being written was because the kid died. There is nothing particularly great about the story. I was very irritated on all the side stories (including the author, talking about himself) within the book, which didn't add anything except pages in an already thin book.

His whole journey is to make it to Alaska and live off the land it has to offer. But when Mother Nature hits him hard the cold climate takes his life in a bus out on the stampede trail.

I really enjoyed Into Thin Air, but this was an overly long boring whiney account by Krakauer. Definitely not worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Into the whining","review":"Anyone who likes this book has not read it. Krakauer spends more time whining about his troubled relationship with his own father, and complaining that Jack London was an overweight city slicker, than he does addressing the story of a young man who was extremely interesting. If you have seen the episode of Millenium about this, or saw it on 48 Hours, you will have gained more insight than Krakauer's incessant whining. To put it into perspective, when I saw the book, my wife (who had read the book) said I would be very disappointed. I was more than disappointed.

The story of the main character is one of recklessness and youthful aspirations taken to an extreme degree, and yet Krakauer--using his strong narrative skills and personal experiences--makes it so easy to identify with the main subject.It's a short read, but well worth the trip.I haven't seen the movie yet, but I wonder how good it could possibly be without Krakauer's stirring narrative prose to provide the elaborate and stunning background information found in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"great story","review":"a well written account of what could have been a coming of age tale. it's a great story and jon krakauer is a master author. due to the authors objective style everyone who reads this book will come away with something different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short story with lots of filler.","review":"The main story is a good one and deserved to be told. However, the book is padded with so many other tangents to fill out the covers that it pissed me off. I found myself wondering when would we get back to the subject and why is he telling me about all these other people who have nothing to do with the storyline. I'll tell you why...because the story about the main character is, at best, a short story. Hope the movie is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlike any other book I've ever read.","review":"I found the book to be somewhat interesting, but I do not agree with McCandless' ideas about life. Throwing away all your possessions and marching off into the wilderness unprepared is just plain foolishness, and from the other examples that Krakauer cited, usually ends in death. How fruitless is that? Although it is interesting to learn about McCandless' adventures via Krakauer's book, it would've been better to learn about it from McCandless himself, had he been more prepared to walk into the Alaskan interior and survive to walk out again."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put this one down.","review":"Jon Krakauer's personal passion and extensive research made this book a winner. The only let down was being left with the knowledge that I'll never be able to meet Chris McCandless. I'm sure that Mr. Krakauer has the same regrets. I've never been so intrigued by a personality that I've merely read about. Thank you Mr. Krakauer for introducing Chris to us, and allowing us to glimpse some of the splendor of nature that both of you have experienced. God bless the heart you put into your work."},{"rating":"2","title":"What was he looking for?","review":"I didn't think anything could compare to Into Thin Air, but Krakauer has proven to be a great auditor of the unusual adventurer. I know people who went to high school with Chris McCandless, and none of them could beleive that he just walked into the woods of Alaska one day. That is the most interesting, and disturbing thing about this story. Krakauer does an admirable job of getting into McCandless' head to see what was there. With his usual attention to detail and fascinating descriptions, I was taken in. A good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wilderness inside and out...","review":"\\"The heart has reasons that reason knows nothing of.\\" (Blaise Pascal)\\"Into the Wild\\" is Jon Krakauer's account of how a young man, Chris McCandless, sought to transcend his time, his society, and even himself by journeying on foot into the Alaskan taiga with no more gear than he could carry on his back. Though the country he entered eventually overcame him, his story is one of triumph, of meeting the world cleanly, with most of the gauzy interface of civilization ripped away. Krakauer's telling of the young man's final months on this planet is beautiful and eloquent. Most of all, this narrative shows us that Wilderness, while powerful in the extreme, pales in comparison with the vast and unknown territory that lies within the human heart and soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Moving Story","review":"When I first bought this book, I bought it not because I wanted to but because I had to read it for my English Composition class. The cover of the book already intrigued me and I could not wait to get started on reading the book. After reading the book, I feel like I've gotten to know the main character, Chris McCandless so well. This book is a must read for all the adventure seekers out there for it shows the extreme side of the word \\"adventure.\\" Chris' story forces the reader to question himself in so many countless ways that it boggles the mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I ordewr the book after seeing the movie. It arrived in perfect condition and I enjoyed the book as much as the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Display of intense courage to be respected","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book and could relate to McCandless's story. I admired his courage to step out of a set and expected plan for his life. He wanted to challenge himself as to whether he was strong enough and possessed enough desire to leave society and face his true self and surroundings in nature. Some think he is foolish because he gave up money and what is viewed as the \\"good life\\", but what makes one person happy doesn't necessarily apply to the next. Society is so focused on money and technology and it was a huge step for McCandless to turn his back to that in exchange for what he truly loved. I don't think he should be criticized or called crazy simply because he wanted to explore what many people never find in their lives: the power and beauty of nature and the strength and independence within himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um, Interesting, I Guess","review":"Well, this book is different, I guess. My 6th grade teacher made me read it, along with many other books. I don't think that that the character deserves to be glorified. He had no respect for his family, his life, and the wilderness. He actually believed that he and a bag of rice could brave the Alaskan wilderness. As always, the wilderness overcame. He got what he deserved. The best part was the little paragraph on the back cover about the author, because I couldn't wait to get there. The book was very slow. There was a lot of gobbely-gook, and the writing was nothing special. I would recomend this to someone who has read every other book on earth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better to burn out, than fade away?","review":"Rich kid finishes college; decides there is dignity in leading a simple life off the land; crashes around the USA for a couple of years living off the kindness of strangers; heads to Alaska; dies.Krakauer wants us to find some meaning in this.

Other than that, I thought it was great and informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst books","review":"Into the Wild was one of the worst books I have ever read! It's horrible to read about someone intentionally killing themselves the way this young man did. To call this book an adventure, would be incorrect. There should be a disclaimer to advise ppl what they are about to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well... not what its \\"krauk\\"ed up to be","review":"MY English teacher loved this book... but i do not see why.I believed that the story line was good, interesting enough to follow (and it helped it was real.)I thought Kraukauer did not do a good job writing it. He did do a good job with McCandless's story, but he veered off him in EVERY single way he possibly could. I can see why he related all the other stories to McCandless's, but i thought there was just too many other stories. He even found a way to put HIMSELF into the book (what a biography. half biography and half auto.)I thought it was ok, but not great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Into the Land of Arrogance","review":"I saw the movie before I read either book about Chris Mccandless. I was moved by the movie, both by Chris' spirit and determination. I did not like this book at all. I felt that the author ridiculed Mccandless' journey, and probably caused a lot of grief for his family, the way he called him ignorant. I really did not like how it was a book that was supposed to be about Mccandless, and more than 3/4 of the bookare about the author's own experiences, and how he feels he's better than Mccandless. It oozed with arrogance, and it angered me that the author had no problem tarnishing the good memories people had of Mccandless. but then the author goes on to brag about his own adventures, and how he was/is better than Mccandless.I would recommened this book for people who did not like the movie. If you loved the movie like I did, please read the original book. It stays truer than this rag did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"This book is about one of the dumbest blokes I have ever heard of. He wants to be all \\"Walden\\" or out there. Althought the whole time it rants about him leaving all the comforts of \\"normal\\" society behind, he relies on quickie marts to get his drinking water and puts it in a mass produced milk jug. Not only is kid a complete hypocrite, but he is a foolish boy who hasnt yet grown up. It honestly is a book about a complete fool. Somehow he has been glorified, because of his idiocy. I just don't buy it.Why did I give it 2 stars? Because it was entertaining reading about how utterly ignorant this kid was."},{"rating":"1","title":"ew......","review":"this is not even a book, its so hard to understand and there at least 20 different people that are focused on, this is just a huge essay, DONT GET IT!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"how stupid can one person be","review":"what kind of idea is it to go out into the wild with out a compass, good wheather clothes, provisions, and a good gun. did any of this go through his mind when he was dying. it was him against the elementals of nature. how could he have survived, he did not have that much food and he had no tent or sleeping bag no compass map nothing, and especialy in snow come on man i think atleast he should win a darian award for his thick skull that was aparrantly to dumb to realize that its much harder to survive when you don't have anything that might help you suvive at all i don't care how good an idea it was it was stupid to go through with it. what he thought to be his heros were made up characters from books. its easier to read about survival than to go out there and survive on what you you have. You might last two three days but for a couple of months no way, never."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Extremist","review":"I read Into Thin Air by Jon Krakauer ten years ago and was captivated by the idea that people would readily embark on a journey under such extreme survival conditions. Krakauer is a brilliant writer who builds a character like Frank L. Wright would a structure...one within the environment.Into the Wild describes another radical life style but this one is a boy, Christopher McCanless, just out of college with more advantages than most. McCanless rebels against his privileged family life and embraces one as a transient hitchhiker who dreams of surviving in the Alaska wilderness. I struggled to find meaning in the life McCanless chose, despite Krakauer's attempts to justify. The book pulls you through his travels, intrigued, exhausted, and finally spent at the end. I found myself asking, \\"Why\\"?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply stunning","review":"I loved this book. I thought it was just so engrossing--it captured the lost soul in all of us, wandering around trying to find where we fit in. I often think that Chris looked at his interactions with people much like he did with nature--to not leave a footprint. But he did on every human being that came in contact with him, and I'm just sad that he didn't realize how impactful he was on so many lives. This book is great for personal reflection, understanding of the human condition, and just about who we are in relation to the world. Everyone will have their opinion--about who he was, what this journey meant, etc.--but I will reserve mine because I think that many can say that the book written about them might be different than how they perceived their life. Just a phenomenal story and writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"The guy was an idiot","review":"I don't understand why so many people are celebrating the stupidity of Christopher McCandless. While I understand his goal, to live an untethered life, the idiotic way he went about it is mindboggling and what is even more confusing then that is people are making him out to be some kind of great man. Chris is not a great man or even avid explorer, Chris was just another unprepared, undereducated person whose ignorance lead to his demise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I feel the same as one of the other reviewers; why summarize the story on the cover and tell me what happens?I couldn't get to the end of this book, to be honest, I couldn't even read past page 55ish. I tried, I kept reading as much as I could and as far as I could, but this book isn't worth my time.I will not finish the book regardless of how strongly I feel about finishing everything I start. And, I would never recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is useless","review":"Krakauer is a competent writer, keeping the story interesting and moving along. However, like many similar writers, is infatuated with his subject and can't see the forest through the trees. McCandless was a young idealist who was DUMB! However bright, personable, and book smart he may have been, he couldn't handle the simple fact that the world was eplored and settled long before he was born. the Therefore, he created his own wilderness to discover by intentionally making life difficult, burning his money, ditching his car, and refusing to look at maps. It was this that got him in trouble. Who goes into the Alaskan winter with 2 lbs. of rice????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much here","review":"There isn't much of a story here. A Pilgrim goes into the Wilderness totally unprepared and dies of starvation / food poisoning. Not in the same league as \\"Shattered Air\\" by the same author. The author has to really stretch the material to make 224 pages out of it. I haven't seen the movie, but considering the known facts, it is likely to be mostly fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and haunting","review":"As one of the few living people who has actually read Moby Dick unabridged from cover to cover without skipping a word, I know that a large portion of that novel, which so many of the rest of you label the greatest ever written, is a very dry treatise on marine mammals and whaling. So one only shows one's ignorance of great literature when one criticizes the author of Into the Wild for including so much text devoted to extreme outdoor experiences unrelated to that of the story's protagonist, Chris \\"Alexander Supertramp\\" McCandless. The book does a fine job of telling its story. So did the movie and yet they're entirely unalike. So there.Anyone who tells you otherwise is either a fool whose breadth of knowledge of literature could be contained within a copy of Cliff Notes; or someone who holds a grudge against the protagonist, the author and/or any other young person, who like the former, had the cojones to attempt what they were too punk to ever try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an interesting read","review":"Krakauer obviously thought that his Outside magazine article on Chris McCandless would make him a few more bucks published as a book.In a nutshell: An idealistic, nave young college graduate who has neither survival training nor any practical experience in the outdoors rejects his comfortable middle-class upbringing, gives all his savings to charity, re-christens himself with a new BS name (Alexander Supertramp), and after wandering around out West for a while hitchhikes to Alaska, hikes into the Alaskan wilderness alone and starves to death.Not really worth your time to read. Krakauer's other book, Into Thin Air, is far better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This book had a great plot and a good author. I thought it was too short. It was a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of almost 15.00","review":"This is a terrible book and waste of money! Half of the book is about the author's dysfunctional life, and the rest glorifies a messed up kid who did something stupid. And paid the ultimate price. There wasn't half enough of a story to write a book about, so the author threw in his life too.....DON'T waste your money on this book......"},{"rating":"2","title":"To test oneself daily against ...","review":"Chris McCandless was a person who could see through the lies of consumerism and society with its fake comforts. He believed in the beauty of nature, and lived by the code of something wilder than a suburbanite rich kid. He was a Thoreauiste and tried to lived to that standard.Happiest by hisself he set out to live in the bush of Alaska, being unprepared he died. The book gets a little bogged down in the middle talking about other thrill seekers and why they did what they did. I don't think Chris was a thrill seeker,maybe just disgusted with society overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"the story wanders as much as the topic","review":"Sections of the book are great but most of it wanders around other topics and people. Could have been much more focused."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignore the fluff","review":"If you can ignore the fluff, this is an interesting examination of a young man with \\"issues.\\" Krakauer's writing is too flowery, the information on himself is gratuitous (I didn't even read the chapter he wrote about \\"his\\" experience) but the book is a quick read. I found the story about the rich brat fascinating. When you come down to it, he either had deep self-hatred or he had something to hide or both. There is nothing wrong with questioning authority (in this case, social mores, American society and materialism) but when done in a self-rightous way, it comes off as arrogant. Yes, there are personalities out there that want to conquer and test limits- bungee jumpers, Everest climbers, avalanche skiiers- but Chris was a downright egotistical misanthrope on the brink of being a recluse. I find that fascinating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent story with one irritating quirk.","review":"I loved this story, and finished it in one sitting. How many of us ever dream of just dropping everything and going off, exploring nature and taking in the landscape around us, instead of the steady day to day rat race of life? I grew up into the area that Chris did, and can understand the pressures of competition, the hassle, and the need to just crawl inside yourself for awhile and be alone.My only irritation with this story was the fact that the author cut in with his own. I see the author trying to compare his experiences in understanding Chris's thought process, but it was a deviation most distracting. It made things feel out of order and even took some of the punch out of the ending. I didn't feel the need of the authors interruptions and musings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliche Adventure With Some Insight About Life","review":"The boring details of McCandless' adventures are a punnishment to the reader. While his philosophies on life are interesting, a recounting of each person he met (and basically each new person is once again won over by the educated ascetic) becomes rather dull. Also, an insert of the author's own adventure is both vain and not essential. He tries to draw comparisons between himself and Chris McClandless that are both disrespectful to Chris's eventual plight and to his family. This would have made for an excellent short story used to support the ideas of H. David Thoreau, not an entire book that rushes to the top of the superficial bestselling lists. I might add that the book already includes an advertisement for his next book which was due to come out the next year."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book does not work","review":"This was the type of book that makes me want to wach paint dry. It drowns on about a self-absorbed CHILD. That he went into something with alomost no idea what he was doing. This was the type of person that would have got lost in a closet. The writing was like a bad news article from a tabloid. It glorified a sad ture story of someone that was vastly unpreppared for what they were doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unfulfilling!","review":"I could never understand why Chris was making this journey. You have a kid who died trying to make a point about what? Humans can survive without necessary evils? Pointless! People starve everyday in America, what makes \\"Supertramp\\" so different?"},{"rating":"1","title":"McCandless was a very selfess towards his life.","review":"I feel that McCandless was a very selfess person. He made people fall in love with him and then left them high and dry with only a couple of letters before his death. Did he not realize the hurt he was causing other people by risking his life? Did he not understand how important and special life is? He seemed to only care about his own feelings about his life and not how others were emotionly attached to his. Since he knew how much he was risking his life, he shouldn't of gotten everyone so emotionally attached to him. Others cared for his feelings so they let him go on with life like he wanted to, so shouldn't he of cared for their fellings back and not ended his life so rudely like he did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Into The Wild is very much written like a magazine article","review":"I feel that Into the Wild was not a very good book. It was written as a magazine article with dialogue written very poorly. After Krakauer ran out of ideas on McCandless's death, he rambled on about other people who died in the Alaskan wilderness. Overall, this book was not a page turner and I do not like Krakauer's style."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Mixed Up","review":"I found this book to be intriging yet confusing at the same time. I felt that the way Krakauer organized the information was very jumpy and made the book difficult to understand. Krakauer also included a lot of pointless information about other people that had gone out on adventures and never came back. I feel that took away from the whole point of the book which I thought was supposed to be about Chris McCandless. If Krakauer would have stayed focused on the life of McCandless, I feel the book would have been more effective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall a pretty good book.","review":"I thought that Into The Wild was an overall interesting book, but I found it hard to follow at times. I think that Krakauer did a good job portraying the McCandless character, but the set up of the book was a little choppy. I rate is as an 8, because I feel that Krakauer did in excellent job including all that went on throughout the long journey of McCandless."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my Favorites","review":"Definitely one of my favorite books. A very gripping tale of a disenchanted young man looking for more. Krakauer does an incredible job of making McCandless someone easy to relate to, even though his attitude and actions were ones that hardly anyone would ever share with him.I have read this book 4 or 5 times since buying it a couple of years ago. I tried to watch the movie a few months back but turned it off halfway through. Garbage compared to Krakauer's story. Do yourself a favor and read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful read!","review":"This book is fun to read. It makes it much more interesting that it's all based on a true story! It's hard to imagine someone doing all the things that happened in this story. Makes you turn the pages constantly to find out what happens next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-provoking book! I enthusiastically recommend it!","review":"I don't think Chris McCandless an idiot because he died in the Alaska wilderness. He was a smart, young man who had a deep desire to shed the modern luxuries of life in order to live as he wanted. Thoreau did the same. McCandless obviously did not lead a life of \\"quiet desperation\\". How many of us can echo that same statement? He lived out his dream and I respect him for it. As the group Rush sings in their song \\"Losing it\\", ....\\"Some are born to rule the world, to live their fantasies. But most of us just dream about the things we'd like to be.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Krakauer makes you forget that he wrote it","review":"This book tends to make you forget that it is an author's work. Moreover, the story of Alexander Supertramp consumes the reader's mind. It's tough to say whether it is Krakauer's excellent prose or the young man's life that makes it so intense and easy to read. One thing is for sure. The reader cannot help but come away with a desire to let everything go and search for adventure. Naturally, the book appeals much more to young people because they can afford to \\"drop everything\\" and seek adventure. Chris McCandless is easy to relate to, but you find yourself asking whether or not he took it to the extreme. Krakauer does an excellent job of presenting the information so that the reader can decifer the answer to that question. The book is a must read, and the kind of book that can change the lives of impressionable youths."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story","review":"A story that hit close to home and shows how actions of one person can affect many people. Definitely a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Into the wild","review":"This book was a excellent true account of a boy who did not like the human society. I liked the fact that Krakaur interviewed all those people who Chris/Alex came in contact with. It was an exellent accout of a young man who wanted nothing but an adventure in Alaska. Krakaur spents his time in this book defending Chris as not bieng suicidal. He believes that Chris went in the wild with the intention of never comming back but he did have the intention of surviving out there. It was a tragity that he died apparently before his pilgrage in a way was finished. He had the heart and potential to survive and it was very unfortunate that he did not survive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I loved this book and the story of his odd adventure. I always wanted to run off to Alaska also. So sad that his death was probably avoidable if only he had prepared himself for the unforgiving environment."},{"rating":"2","title":"INTO THE WILD, An awesome young fellow","review":"This is a detailed account of a young man's journey, as imagined and actually replayed by the author, with a \\"been there, done that\\", feel. Jon Krakauer got into Christopher McCandless' mind as to why this \\"walk alone\\" person searched the unknown wilderness - -From this account, I believe he was looking for his own soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating story about one man's determination to survive.","review":"John Krakauer is able to piece together the pieces of John McCandless' life in a way few authors could. If you are interested at all in learning more about the poignant story of one man's struggle with society and nature I would definitely reccommend reading the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing and rambling, with a few great moments","review":"If you liked \\"Into Thin Air\\" this book is worth a try, but it is not nearly as cohesive, spectacular, or absorbing. Krakauer feels the need to reiterate the dramatic far too frequently... \\"McCandless was a smart kid, but not smart enough for the tough Alaskan wilderness.\\" Most of the book is filler, stories culled about other failed solo expeditions, and even a self-aggrandizing chapter about the author's own ascent of an Alaskan peak."},{"rating":"2","title":"A boy too intelligent for us to understand","review":"Many people believe that McCandless was somehow stupid or idiotic.I thought of this myself after reading the first four chapters. Then, I read a quote in the beginning of one of the chapters and it set me off to really think deeply about why McCandless had isolated himself without the right tools.\\"[He] believed that wealth was shameful, corrupting, inherently evil...\\" This is absolutely true. Most of the world's sins are committed on the basis of greed or selfishness. If we learned to live life without our useless trinkets, not only will we be absolutely happier, but our society wouldn't have as many sins as it does. The happiness that people feel from a large amount of money is false. It is, in fact, just the feeling of your greed being satisfied. McCandless knew this and that's why he decided to go off \\"into the wild.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Why was this book written, let alone published?","review":"A tragedy, yes. A smart kid with many problems. But what do we learn from this? What insights do we achieve? Simply a kid who in his arrogance and because of his inability to address the real issues in his life \\"flew too close to the sun\\" and died tragically. Unfortunately, this happens all too often. Krakauer is an extremely gifted writer, but his talents need to be focused elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"reader from ny","review":"I guess I expected the book to follow the journey of the doomed main character, Chris McCandless, but a large portion covers the adventures of the author and other stories.The paperback version is very thin even with the author's introspective ramblings included. The story was originally reported as a magazine article and probably should have stayed that way.If you are looking for a non-fictional adventure story,keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real page turner","review":"This was one of the most fascinating books I've ever read. However, I think Chris aka Alexander Supertramp was an idiot for travelling into the wilderness without such basics as a map, compass, and waterproof boots. Personally, I have trekked into the wilderness in the Eastern Sierra for various lengths of time, so I know what it is like, and I know the attraction of the solitude. Of course, I am always prepared for any weather situation. I also think that Alexander Supertramp was less than a man when he failed to keep in contact with his family. As Bruce Springsteen wrote; \\"A man sho turns his back on his family, well, he just aint no good.\\" None of the foregoing should detract from the fine writing and research done by John Krakauer. In summary, it is a story of a misguided idealist, who plunged himself into the harsh reality of the Alaskan wilderness, paid the ultimate price, but probably had no other choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insight","review":"While the movie was inspiring and the soundtrack superb, they portrayed a romanticized version of events. This made for a great movie that moved me and had me thinking for some time. Reading the book (usually I read the book first see the movie second though not this time around) you get an insight of what made Chris/Alex tick. Well researched and written you get to know what Chris and other adventurers like him were made of and what may have drawn them to take the actions they did. A great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I saw the movie, wanted to read the book too","review":"The book arrived quick and easy, thank you!I liked reading the book, and usually I always like the book better than the movie, in this case it's actually different. The movie is so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Jon; but this one was no good!!","review":"Seemed that there was not enough of a story to have a book written about this young man's death."},{"rating":"1","title":"skip this one","review":"I am an avid adventure story reader. I was looking forward to hearing about Alaska and living on the land, instead this book is about a young idealistic man who is pitiful. I was disappointed to hear of this person's total disregard for the forces of nature who actually allowed himself to starve and perish through his own non efforts. Everyone dreams of an adventure,luckily most of us are more realistic in pursuing it. I could not even finish this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Okay","review":"Interesting for the most part -- I liked reading about McCandless's life, his younger years and family life, but the long chapters about Alaska, rock climbing and Krakauer's experiences were long and boring. I was happy to get to the Epilogue -- finally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I enjoyed reading Into Thin Air but this book felt slow and simply depressing. This failed to capture my imagination and had too many tangents that felt like page fillers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just didn't get the hype","review":"While reading this the same words kept popping into my head - why do I care? I kept waiting for the big \\"ah-ha\\" moment and it never appeared. I thought the book was choppy, the author was selfish for including his own story of his life and much of the book is just the author guessing what happened, where he went, and what he thought. I just didn't get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgiving Nature","review":"Into the Wild has left me looking at my own life and thinking about what is really important to me. Chris McCandless, the main character, shows people what life without material possessions gives to society and also what these possessions take away.Chris' story had much more effect on me knowing it was true. For myself, coming from a strong family life, much like Chris', i find his changed outlook on life, and his adventure across america with no money and no plans, very hard to understand. Living in a broken down bus in the middle of the Alaskan woods does not seem like an improved lifestyle, but to Chris, it was. Jon krakauer does a very good job describing Chris' expedition and the harsh reality of wilderness and it's unforgiving nature. I found this book very moving and confirmed my own feelings as to what life should really be about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not as good as into thin air","review":"This book is a bit slower than Krakauer's other. And the main character is not likeable. It's just tough to sympathize with a middle class kid who does a really stupid thing. The book would probably be better if you didn't know the ending going into it. Of course, Krakauer is a wonderful writer and his books are always entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"A compassionate rendering of a tragic tale","review":"I found myself so wishing that things had worked out for Chris, that he had gone through his need to find whatever he was looking for, and returned alive and the better for his search. Mr. Krakauer has written a book that should touch the seeker in all of us. It should encourage us to have some compassion for those who look so hard to find meaning in this life and yet can fail tragically in that search. One does not have to go all that far to find such people. I do wish there were more people like Chris, a man who took his life seriously. I am grateful that there are people like Mr. Krakauer who enable us to remember Chris and hopefully learn from his life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely compelling reading","review":"I happen to think that Krakauer has a wonderful writing style evidenced in this and in Into Thin Air. I am only surprised at 2 comments which showed up in some of the negative reviews. First is that, at a modest 207 pages, the book could have been shorter! I thought it was by no means too short and everything that was in the book added to the whole. Second, I sensed that some people felt that experiences like Chris' are so commonplace that they're hardly worth mentioning. If so, I haven't read a whole lot of accounts like this one. I would unreservedly recommend this book to anyone"},{"rating":"2","title":"Into the Wild","review":"I liked this book a lot, though it really is different from most books you'll read. As a non-fiction work, this book follows the life of Christopher McCandless through interviews with friends, family, and acquaintances. I can relate to this individual on multiple levels as he went to high school just down the road from me. He ran cross country in high school, as I did. He died in Alaska and I was born and raised there. Krakauer does a very good job of bringing to life someone that we actually know relatively little about. Chris's story is sad and yet poignant at the same time. It's hard not to respect not only his intellectualism, but his drive to understand the truth in life. While this ultimately cost him his life and is in retrospect the result of decisions few of us would ever make, it does strike a cord with me. This is one of the few stories that I actually find myself reflecting back on long after I finished reading the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good and Bad","review":"I liked the book while first reading it, it was interesting reading at first. However because the author wanted to make the book longer, he starts filling it with a bunch of things that don't apply to the story. The several pages where the author describes his own mountain climbing was stupid and was like a commercial in the middle of a movie. It was also boring and I skimmed over it just to get back to the story. The story wasn't just about Chris dying in the wilderness, there were a few stories of others who died in the wilderness and then the author tries to compare them - which just did not work. But I did finish the book (aside from skimming over the author's mountain climbing experience)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as engaging as Into Thin Air","review":"Krakauer is such a talented and engaging writer is it hard to put this book down. The stories he tells can be so heart wrenching and sad but they don't make you feel terrible. You realize that the people he writes about are doing what they love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost in the Wild","review":"This book shows an excellent illustration of a true, young man that comes from a well-off family facing his life after college. Jon takes you on a wild journey all across America, from Georgia to California to the Dakotas and to Alaska. It is a wonderful book, and falls a close second to one of the greatest books, Into Thin Air."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not put together in a good way.","review":"Jon Krakauer first start this book out really good I thought because he starts out tell that poeple fond Chris McCandless in a bus that was use by hunters. Then Jon goes on and tell you Chris's life story and how he end up in the bus in Alaska. If Jon want have stay will the stroy adout Chris and not throw in other stories that were like Chris. Then thing that really made this not a good book to read is that went he starts talk adout a other story like Chris and when he was done with and pick up with Chris life he talked about what he aready say in chapers before. This was not good because poeple like me who want to get back to Chris story and stay on it for the rest of the book. Then Krakauer when poeple to think of to because he put his one story in andput it up with Chris life. Have the story not in a row and have more then person story in to it made it a bad book. To make this book better is to tells Chris story then the other ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Into the Wild","review":"Into the Wild is the true-life story of Chris McCandless who tragically died in the Alaskan wilderness in August of 1992. This is no secret as it is printed on the cover. In the book the author, Jon Krakauer, decides to concentrate on the character development of Chris McCandless. There are many theories as to why Chris McCandless, an intellectual young man, leaves a happy home to travail out west and live a simple life and the book tries to sort them out. While the book does not give concrete answers as to why Chris McCandless ends up dead in the Alaskan wilderness, it does give powerful insights as to where Chris McCandless screwed up. As a young male reader I found this book very interesting and thought provoking, even though the book does have its slow points. The author, who also wrote the article in Outside magazine, is an outdoors type person himself and has done his research for the book. Overall I was impressed with the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Senior Term Paper in Disguise","review":"This book might have gotten an A as a highschool term paper which is how it reads. It was one of my least favorite books of the year. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, so I don't have any objections to Krakauer's take on Chris McCandless. My problem with the book was that the writing was so obvious and clumsy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely forgettable, disjointed and uninspiring","review":"What a disappointment. Self-indulgent loner commits suicide by burning his cash and wandering into the Alaskan wilderness so that he can punish his parents for something (I'm not sure what). The writing style is disjointed and uninspiring, full of meaningless details about landscapes (who cares) and pathetic characters. The only emotion this book elicits is sympathy for those people who were unfortunate enough to cross paths with \\"Alexander Supertramp.\\" What a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"I read this book standing up at a bookstore in Anchorage. \\"That was a waste of time,\\" I mumbled as I walked off to look at the magazines with pictures of pick-up trucks and hot LA senoritas. Why people think this book is a good one is beyond me. I guess I'd be more interested in the psychological problems of trust fund babies if I hadn't spent ten years selling them bicycles in California. Since Sean Penn made the movie I've read the book two more times, and I even bought a copy. I honestly don't see why anybody enjoys reading this lightweight piece of trash. I've heard the movie is great, so I'll buy the DVD one of these days. But the book is a quick read with, as far as I'm concerned, no redeemable qualities."},{"rating":"1","title":"DYING IS EASY. IT'S THE LIVING THAT'S HARD.","review":"I have sympathy for a life wasted and it's cost to those who loved him, but this kid should have read the poems of Robert Service.How about this from \\"Lost\\"Somebody seemed to whisper: \\"Fight to the last, my boy.\\"Fight! That's right, I must struggle. I know that to rest means death;Death, but then what does death mean?--ease from a world of strife.Life has been none too pleasant; yet with my failing breathStill and still must I struggle, fight for the gift of life.Robert Service wrote about real ordinary heroes-that is ordinary men who struggled and fought for life in that very same wilderness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I nominate Krakauer for the Overrated Author prize. He took an article and padded it ad nauseum to make a thin book filled with junk. Into Thin Air also was not one of the greatest adventure stories ever written, either. Boring Boring Boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most boring books ever!","review":"I had to read this book for Freshmen orientation... and I was so bored with the book. And I never got bored of books hell I'd read the same books over and over and never gotten bored. The book to me was clinical and lacked personality. If I'm having to read a book that's biographical I have to feel more for the character than boredom and annoyance. I think the only time I've touched that book since 1999 was each time I've had to pack up and move. For all of you who have read it and loved it good for you... maybe I'm just one of the few who didn't like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written, but McCandless was an idiot","review":"Basically, at this point I'm looking forward to the part where McCandless dies a miserable death because when you get right down to it, the guy was a douche. Krakauer does an admirable job of trying to explain why this dumbass did what he did, but underneath it all it's basically a story about a spoiled naive rich kid who was too stupid or too arrogant to plan properly for the task he undertook. Can't wait to reach the end of this book, because it'll be a good laugh, and who couldn't use a good laugh these days?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-written. Too self-defensive. Too much justification.","review":"Christopher McCandless. Yes, I think his actions were foolish and reckless. Yes, he tried to live his dreams, but he could do so for only short periods, before he had to return to the life he liked to complain about. Yes, I would not have the courage to walk off into the Alaskan \\"wilderness\\" with a bag of rice. If one used this as one definition of \\"courage\\", it would have to be cross-referenced to \\"stupidity\\".Jon Krakower has glorified this kid by featuring him in a book. Well-written, but in the end a waste of time.McCandless did not live long enough to achieve anything near his goals. This kid lived off the kindness of many people including his parents. When those people weren't around, he died. Basically un-impressive. One can only feel sadness for all the people he left behind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stretched to the point of breaking","review":"Simply put, there was just not enough relevant material to warrant a book. In order to fill out his original magazine article to book length, Krakauer takes bird-walk after circuitous bird-walk with mind-numbing redundancy. How often does one need to emphasize \\"it was his last (fill in the blank)\\"? Beyond the first and final few chapters, the rest is irrelevant fluff that verges on deification of a pretty standard disillusioned youth searching to find himself. The story is interesting in a way that a car accident on the side of the road is, little more, but Krakauer treats the subject with such reverence that you would think him a latter day saint. Save time and read the Outside magazine article."},{"rating":"2","title":"spencer","review":"One of my favorite of favorites. It should be a five star in every rating. I have read it alteast 20 times and in my youth opened my eyes to the literary masters, such as Tolstoy and Thureau, both of which are quoted extensivly from the man himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enigma well described","review":"This is the best of Krakauer's books to date and a wonderful exploration of the inner mind. Krakauer's haunting prose really details his own efforts to understand the motivations and actions of a young man lost in the wilds of Alaska, and perhaps lost in his own identity and life. Among other things Krakauer depicts himself in a very honest way as he projects his own fears and insecurities on the story's protaganist -- a foreshadowing of \\"there but for the grace of God go I\\" that comes home with special force in his writings on Everest in \\"Into Thin Air\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the read, even if you are not a \\"nature\\" books fan!","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It gave me a lot of insight into why Jon Krakauer wrote both this and \\"Into Thin Air.\\" Krakauer spends two chapters talking about his own Alaskan adventure where he nearly died. So it shouldn't be surprizing that he takes a sympathetic view of Chris McCandless and his fatal Alaskan trek.He also delves into history and writes about other people who have died as they tried to get closer to nature, or were just plain ill-prepared for what they got themselves into, not giving Mother Nature the respects she demands, sometimes at the price of our lives.My favorite part was toward the end where he critiques his own \\"Outdoor\\" magazine article about McCandless and talks about where he was wrong, and then suggests how he thinks McCandless actually died.In depth and facinating. Worth the read. I loved it and I don't usually read nature-y type books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle edition has no text-to-speech","review":"The main reason I am willing to purchase Kindle books, rather than check them out from the library, is to listen to them. This book has text-to-speech disabled. Just wanted to warn others before they waste their money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every parent's fear?","review":"\\"Into the Wild\\" is a very interesting book about the life of a young man who decided to get rid of his normal, mundane life, move to the wilds of Alaska and live in nature. It follows his story, using interviews awith key friends and acquaintances, of how he travelled around the United States in search of his real truth. In the end, he ends up dying in a remote area in the Alaskan wilderness, all alone and malnourished.Did he die of starvation? Was he sick from berries he ate? What was his mindset during his last days?The book, and the movieInto the Wild, hauntingly tell his story. It's a story that every parent wishes their idealistic 20-something children don't try to live themselves. It's captivating and interesting, however.Krakauer is a great writer, who creates even more drama and suspense here than it may warrant. I also highly recommend hisInto Thin Air (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition), one of my favorite books of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"This book is a very good book that I loved to read. I can't wait to read another Jon Krauker book."},{"rating":"1","title":"bleh","review":"I just finished this book and I feel icky. I feel like the author went into writing the book with a closed perspective of things. He describes Chris as idealistic and young. He is asking \\"why?\\" why was Chris compelled to enter the wilderness, why have others been compelled to? as if its some exotic strange thing, when in fact it is more natural than anything. there is nothing strange about wanting to live how humans are supposed to live and how we have lived for millions of years in comparison with living against nature for only about 10,000 years. although he says that he doesnt want to belittle Chris' experiences and passions by saying he was arrogant, i feel like this is implied anyways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"Krakauer, a renowned climber and outdoorsman himself, does more than just tell a story in this book--he examines the psychology, the motivation, for the actions of the protagonist. Why would he leave a large sum of money and almost certain material success behind in order to challenge nature? Also of note is that Krakauer does not glorify the decisions of the protagonist, rather, he tells the story objectively, appealing to reason, even empiricism. However, that having been said, the book certainly does not read like a scientific journal, more like an adventure thriller. As the events are recounted and pieced together, they assume a kind of mystery feel, as readers become compelled to know the outcome of the story. This book is a fascinating account written by a man who understands his element."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wanderer's Tale","review":"Many people may write off the subject of this book, Christopher McCandless, as a crazy, ill-equipped dreamer who got what he deserved, but I think that the kid had a lot of bravery to do what he did---and do it all alone. He followed his dreams which ultimately he paid a price for. He was young, naive and alone in the wilderness, but it was also his choice and his fate. Jon Krakauer did a tremendous job in trying to get inside McCandless' head and show us how and why he wanted to explore nature on his own. Krakauer manages to make his subject accessible and sympathetic, even though in real life it seems he had no use for human interaction. It's an excellent, tragic story."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Drives A Man To His Demise?","review":"Naive? Stupid? Brave? Psycho? You'll think of all of these descriptions as you follow the \\"hero\\" through his travails in the cold, lonely back country of Alaska. One thing that can be truly said is that this is a sad story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brave New World","review":"I have come to realize that Alex may be one of the few souls on this planet who understands the meaning of life. Does having a 9-5 job and owning all the newest possesions mean that you are alive? He was a brave soul who looked beyond the consumer life of America, and lead his life how he wanted. This was truly a beautiful book written by one of my favorite authors. Always remember, \\"All men die, but not all men truly live.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A book about nothing","review":"From the moment I read from many aspects false Krakauer's report on the Everest accident called Into thin air, I disliked his way of writing, thinking and false self-absorbed reporting. I still decided to give him another go with Into the wild. A mistake. I spent the first 3/4 of the book waiting for Alaskan trip of the boy to begin. And had to endure author's accounts of anything he could even remotely connect to the story (including one of his own solo climbs, oh yes that's how cool he is).Apart from the dislike I have for the author, coming from a part of the world still suffering consequences of a brutal war, I have little understanding for a rich kid with not a single problem in life but a troubled mind that leads him to suicide.What a bad book to sellect for my first Kindle purchase. I wish myself more luck with the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kids do the darndest things.","review":"Attention would-be \\"hermits:\\" Alaskan winters are still very cold. Krakauer illustrates quite clearly the consequences of being an idiot in the woods. Nature, romantic notions of it notwithstanding, can and will kill you. Beware. Decent work by Mr. Krakauer, but the story left behind by Mr. McCandless remains at best as a good example of a very bad idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok","review":"I was interested in the story of the main charaction.

The book arrived on time and in good condition. That is all that I asked for, thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"recommended reading for my daughters school","review":"This is a book that was needed for my daughter to read in school.I have always had positive purchases from Amazon as well as delivery when stated."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Is A Well Written Book","review":"This novel is well written. One could sympathize for the main character. One could really get inside of his head to understand why he was the way he was and why he chose to do what he did. This was a decent book, and I would recommend it, but it was not my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Reading","review":"I anctually watched the movie prior to reading it. I would suggest reading the book first, then watching the movie. It goes into further depth and explains a lot of obscure parts of the movie in more detail. A lot of people have said some harsh things about Chris Mccandles in their reviews. I can relate to his story. In each generation, there are always a group of individuals who feel disenfranchised from our society. Our culture has become morally corrupt, and that is why Chris did what he did. It's about true freedom, and separating ourselves from the socialistic aristocracy that our country is on it's way to becomming. Without getting into a huge heated political debate, this is truly an American classic in nonfiction. Chris was a modern day Thorreau/Kerouac, it's a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"True-life Jack London or Thoreau without the embellishments","review":"Into the Wild is an excellent read, telling the tragic tale of Chris McCandless's ill-fated journey to the heart of the Alaskan wilderness. Krakauer clearly did his due diligence when it came to researching the book, and the inclusion of his own time in Alaska draws interesting parallels between himself and McCandless. Many young men have journeyed to the wilderness in the hopes of find themselves (Thoreau, McCandless, John Muir, Krakauer), and many have narrowly escaped death in such expeditions. Unfortunately for McCandless, he was not afforded the luck to ever walk out with a new sense of purpose in his life. Thankfully for us, Krakauer does a fine job of reconstructing his multi-year journey, and analyzing the circumstances that ultimately led to his death."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Interesting Book","review":"I was very moved by this movie, and the book does highlight some of the things that were missed in the movie. The only thing that really didn't interest me was what the author needed to add his two cents worth, when he was growing up.About Chris, it broke my heart, that he really wanted to get back home and the little mistakes that were made prevented him from doing that. What a heartache for his family.I had a husband \\"disappear\\" and he died in 1987, so I believe I can relate to a \\"what-if\\" scenaro."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mcandless was very childlike in his actions.","review":"I did not like John Krakuer's book Into The Wild. I had trouble following Krakuer's feelings on McCandless's journey. I feel that Chris McCandless was an angry, self absorbed individual, who believed that if he journeyed into nowhere he would be able to show his parents who was boss. Instead his selfish act backfired and nature showed McCandless who was boss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moving!","review":"This book depicts a person who tries to change himself into a new man. In the process he finds a new way of life. When it seems he is coming to his end, he tries to change back to his old ways, only to find his death. Good book and an easy read. **Jason R.**"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's moving, in a few ways.","review":"Great book. The story surely touched alot of people as there's well over 1000 reviews. I'm sure it saddens some people, inspires others. Like most people I kinda knew the story going in, but this was much deeper of course. The author is a great writer, really good at descriptions. Good vocabulary. There were many moments I felt like I was right there, on a train, in the cold, or on the bus. Some people no doubt think this kid was an unprepared moron, some feel he had the right idea. I think it's best to agree with a bit of each side and find a realistic place in the middle to exist. Sometimes life needs to be simplified, just not this much. Overall his travels were quite an adventure, as is the book. I'd almost call it essential reading for any traveler, or dreamer. Read it, see the movie, and get the Eddie Vedder soundtrack. All three are good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting and fascinating.","review":"Yeah, I know Krakauer is a writer of magazine articles...but he has the heart of a great storyteller. I bought this book after finishing his tale of Everest and was not disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an incredible story","review":"I thought the book was amazing. A guy who gives up everything to follow his dream. He sees things he's always wanted to, he encounters people and touches their lives. Krakauer does an excellent job sharing the accounts of his friends and family, comparing him to other travelers, and expresses McCandless' character in a very personal way. An inspiring story in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tragic, not Foolhardy","review":"Truly a modern Greek tragedy that will puzzle many forever. Good parallel by the author in trying to show that each generation produces a fair number of free spirits that refuse to conform with the majority. A very good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I never really got it.","review":"I very much enjoyed Into Thin Air and I recommend Krakauer, but I never really got an understanding of what he was getting at. I think it was a very personal thing. He saw something of himself in this kid. The best part was Krakauer's own recollections of going to Alaska to climb a pinacle alone. I felt that part redeemed the whole book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jumps Around Too Much!","review":"This book has too many flashbacks and flash forwards. I was expecting the gritty, hour by hour terror of the author's Into Thin Air. I was sorely disappointed. I suggest you read Into Thin Air, instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angry in Minnesota","review":"this book kept me turning the pages, even though we know the outcome. i thought the author did a good research job-even if we will never quite understand why a person seems compelled to go to such extreme measures to find him themselves. i also thought it completely stupid, and kinda egotistical to think you can go into the wild totally unprepared and survive. i think he got what he was asking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting story, bland book","review":"The story this book follows is an interesting story, but honestly I couldn't finish the book. I found that the author spent too much time compareing the kid Chris to himself, which made the book really bland. I enjoy reading about adventures in the wild, but alot of this book didn't even talk about Chris. The fact that the kid was so niave wasn't even the problem, it was how far on a pedestool the auther seems to hold his (chris's) ignorance. I hope the movie turns out better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A devastating book","review":"\\"Into the Wild\\" is not so much a book about the wilderness, as it is a book about what happens to mentally ill people. Chris McCandless was a very, very sick man. This was the feeling I had when I first read the article in Outside magazine nearly ten years ago, when I was in the midst of my own psychological turmoil. Now that I can read it with the perspective of a man who has finally settled into the bliss of domesticity and mental health, I see it as one of the 20th century's primary documents about the heartwrenching devastation of mental illness. For that, the book is worth a resounding five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre adventure book","review":"I myself have often thought about escaping society in much the same way that McCandless did, so I read this book hoping to understand what he learned and felt. You don't get his personal feelings and thoughts though, but instead just an adventure story of what he did. In part, this is due to his sparse journals which don't reveal his thoughts and feelings. Krauker tells the story in a confusing non-linear plot which left me trying to piece together the parts into a coherent journey. Mixing in the tales of others that have gone on isolated journeys did not help much. Overall, the book is confusing and does not help to reveal the deep spiritual meanings McCandless was searching for."},{"rating":"2","title":"True but alarming","review":"Being a 9th grade English student, this was a very intriguing book. It caused me to reflect on my life. Some people condemned this book because Chris McCandless showed pure stupidity and arrogance by going into the middle of nowhere in Alaska. He entered with little sustenance, a bag of rice, and a book explaining edible plants and berries of the surrounding area. He dropped everything he ever knew and started a new life to fulfill his dreams. Chris gave 25,000 dollars to charity, he abandoned his car and burned all the money in his wallet. Yet people called Chris foolish for fulfilling his dream, but they don't have enough guts to do it themselves. In this book Krakauer also talked about a mountain ascent preformed by a man, the same age and with little preparation. At the end of this book it became very emotional. This book is not just for the avid lover of the outdoors. It is a good book for just about everyone. I would recommend reading this book if you get the chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful, sad and uplifiting at the same time","review":"Thankfully Chris left behind his journal and postcards, letters etc. so that Krakauer was able to put this book together. It really does feel that the author was able to paint a pretty good picture of what Chris was feeling. Loved the book, but felt it could have been shorter. I could have done without Krakauer's own stories, although I did enjoy the stories about other free spirits that disappeared or died \\"in the wild\\". Definitely worth the read before seeing the movie.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a modern odyssey","review":"It was interesting reading about the transition of a normal surburban life to a confused youth in search of true meaning in life. Chris McCandless was a youth like any other, one that children of the modern era can relate to in fact. Despite this commonplace up bringing, he found reason to search for truth in nature, based upon the writings of his favorite authors, one of which was Henry David Thoreau. The book is good in the sense that it helps us gain insight into a young man's transition from what we call \\"normal\\" to a recluse searching for more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adventure With Too Much Filler","review":"Although I enjoyed the storyline itself (about Chris McCandless' life leading up to and going into the wild), Krakauer added too much \\"filler\\" using his own life-experiences and boring quotes from others. He seems to have done his homework for the most part, but the book would have only been around 100 pages without the added garbage. Also, Krakauer uses words that are above the average reader's comprehension, thus making for more difficult reading. I plan on giving Karkauer a second chance by reading a book about his own real-life adventures and seeing if my opinion changes any."},{"rating":"1","title":"What exactly was the point of this book?","review":"Jon Krakauer's organization in his book Into the Wild was jumpy and confusing. It doesn't seem as if the author ever settles on a style of organizing his writing, and just writes what comes to mind about whichever interview is on top. Then the author suddenly begins to write about other people who have died in the wild before even finishing the first story! The author's interjection of his own experiences show the reader how to relate to what Chris was feeling, yet as before, the his story isn't even finished at this point in the book.. This reader feels that it is confusing to hear opinions and reasons for the actions of Chris McCainles before we even knows what all happened to the boy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written. Odd but interesting story.","review":"Krakauer has an impressive writing style and an amazing ability to piece together clues to a puzzle for which there is no certain conclusion. Much like Junger/Perfect Story, Krakauer uncovers amazing detail as he follows the odd journey of a lost young man that mysteriously walks into the wild one day and never returns. Much different read from Krakauer/Into Thin Air as this is not a first-hand account and the subject is far less inspirational. If you like Krakauer though, you will like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didnt expect a documentary style read","review":"My fault, just wasnt what I was looking for. Too depressing to chronicle the death of a young person with such potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Into the Wild - incredibly awesome!!","review":"Excellent book, one of the best I have read in a long time. Krakauer's vivid descriptions allow one to feel as though (s)he is walking right along in the wilderness with Chris McCandless. The dialogue between Chris and the folks he meets helps one obtain a better insight into his frame of mind, almost like reading his diary. I found it sad yet understandable how a young man could embark on such a life-altering jouney that would unfortunately end in tragedy. Highly recommended read!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"This was a great book to read. I hadn't been too much into reading for several years, but it was a very interesting read. The plot line was easy to follow and the insertion of actual letters that were written really brought the story to life. It was a much better book than the movie (which I really liked as well). Definitely worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't want to put it down.","review":"I originally purchased Into Thin Air and was going to read it first, until I saw \\"other books written by the author\\". I love Krakauer's writing style, it puts you right there in the action. It does just what reading is supposed to do. It helps you visualize, use your brain, and imagine the situation.I love the outdoors, and wouldn't imagine doing what Chris did. It was a romantic idea picked up on from the adventure books he read. This story also shows what can happen to a person who is unprepared to live in the wild, forced to live off the land.As I said at the start, when I learned of the tragedy on the Everest expedition, I read everything I could get my hands on about the incident. This type of obsession is probably what caused Krakauer to write this book. He had to tell others the story, and I am thankful to him for telling it to me.Oh yeah, is everyone in Iowa reading the same thing at the same time?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very compelling view of life from an intelligent young man","review":"I picked this book up in an airport and could not put it down. Chris McAndless' life simply amazed me. How could a bright, intelligent young man consider a hard, knock-about life on the road, that would eventually lead to death. Did the extensive reading of \\"deep\\"authors trigger this type of behavior; was he living out what he read? This book was excellent. I also enjoyed having the author tell about his journey; one similar to Chris'. This is one of those books that totally envelope you in concentration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Explore your boundaries by examining Alex Supertramp's","review":"Leading a life few in America even know exists, one is fascinated how a college educated, bright young man turns his back on money and explores America to find himself. While the publicity of his death hogs the headlines, the highlight of this book is his travels in the Southwest and the friendships he made.Another masterpiece by Krakauer who is probably better suited than any American writer to write this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Krakauer is a wonderful writer","review":"Krakauer is a wonderful writer - His style is similar to Tino Georgiou. I've just blown through this book as well as The Fates (Tino's novel), and for me - their writing is the kind of stuff that makes for late nights and tired workdays. I can't pay him a higher compliment. This one was a bit different than his other efforts in that Krakuer plays more the role of detective/sociologist rather than an an insightful expedition biographer. However, the story was as rivetting and perhaps even more powerful. I'm anxiously awaiting his next one! Also, if you're one of the few who missed Tino's masterpiece, go and get yourself a copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used","review":"It's a really great book, had to read this for my summer reading, their were two issues though:1) it took over 2 weeks to arrive at my house, and that time really made it difficult to finish on time for school2) be careful when ordering to make sure you order a new copy because the used ones are VERY used, as in you can still read them but my cover was all bent and curving upwards"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dull","review":"I am in the middle of this book and I will probably finish it, but I am skipping large sections and it doesn't seem to matter. The book is boring and pointless. I don't care about Chris. If he was worthy of a book about his life, then Krakauer missed the mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"McCandless is a strange, strange man.","review":"Jon Krakauer's book Into the Wild is a wonderous story about a mans ability to do what ever his heart desires. The main character Chris McCandless was an adventurer that too often didn't think before his actions, he went on impulse, whick lead to his death in the wilderness north of Mt. McKinley. Krakauer's writing and organization in this book was confusing. It is very jumppy and hard which made it hard to keep interest. The book was not only about the McCandless story but what type of person Krakauer thought him to be. McCadless was definately had a screwed up head. Why in the world would anyone throw away all their money, and roam the world. What is even weirder is that he thought that what he did was noble in his own sence. Krakauer points out some instences in his childhood that could have contributed to his mental state. McCadless was mentally deranged to do what he did. He should have done more smart planning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good!","review":"I took this to read on the planes this last weekend. It was really good. after reading that first part on the first page I actually gasped and my stomache clenched up. by the end of my trip I had 3 people saying they were going to buy this when they got home. Very interesting book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Man with a Dream, fulfills it to his Death...","review":"Jon Krakauer portrays the life of a young man with a dream to go \\"Into the Wild\\". This book was an amazing portrayal of just this. After writing an article skimming the topic in an issue of the \\"Outdoor\\" Magazine, he was moved, and decided to recreate the life of this man. He researched through family, and friends of Chris McCandless. And succeded in putting all of the gathered knowledge into one horrifically true novel. This is truly a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting book, good read, would recommend it to others.","review":"I enjoyed this book and finished it quickly. The author gives his own personal insights which I found interesting. Not sure if the question is ever answered on whether this young man was foolish or just idealistic. I bought the book not having read other reviews and was pleased with the purchase, interesting. Some bigs words I didn't know and I consider myself pretty good with language."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best independence growth books ever.","review":"I have never read any book that effected me in this way. Alexander Supertramp may be considered a fool by others, but those people need to get off of their butts and do a tenth of the cool stuff that he did. I almost dropped out of school while reading the book to embark on an adventure of my own. John krakaur you have become my favorite author after reading Into Thin Air and Into The Wild. Send me a copy of Eiger Dreams."},{"rating":"2","title":"compelling, haunting, and wonderful","review":"This book was most definitely one of my favorite reads, once you pick it up it is hard to put back down. Makes you want to throw away the bonds of society and live in a romantic world of man and nature. I am somewhat disheartened by the apparent misreading of the book by some people, I think McCandless' story is misunderstood by people who can't comprehend leaving our materialistic-industrial society for nothing but peace of mind. Three cheers for Krakauer who made us aware of this amazing story, also the author of the incredible \\"Into Thin Air,\\" a story of the tradgedy of a climb up Mount Everest in 1996."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I listened to the unabridged book on tape (Books-on-Tape, Inc). The book was riveting and it was often difficult to get out of the car and away from the tape player. I often took short unnecessary trips just so I could hear the next few minutes of the book. I had first seen John Krakauer on MSNBC with Tom Brokaw last winter. My interest was triggered then by his interview. I know a physician who successfully \\"summitted\\" Everest after two previous failed attempts. He had told me some of what the experience was like, but the book made it seem even more terrifying, dangerous, and foolhardy for novice climbers who happen to be able to afford to take such a trip. After reading the book I know that climbing Mt. Everest isn't something I would want to do on a whim. I can't imagine walking across two aluminum ladders tied together with rope traversing a cravass while wearing crampons."},{"rating":"2","title":"A profoundly moving book","review":"At the beginning of this book, I was angry with Chris McCandless for his ingratitude and the anguish he had caused his family. By the end, I was saddened and haunted by the loss of such a promising young man caused by bad luck and stupidity. The book remained with me for weeks. Any parent of teenagers or grown children will be moved; my 75-year-old mother and I rate it the best book we read this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Personal Odyssey A Hallmark Of Youth","review":"I have been haunted and rejuvenated by the story of Chris McCandless. K's style is lucid and interweaves larger topics, such as the personal odyssey youth seeks. Pure luck has saved many of us who pursued similar misadventures in our adolescence. K is adept at scraping at raw nerve endings. On one hand, McCandless suffered from hubris, but that characteristic might very well be an indicator of someone with \\"risk genes.\\" If McCandless had survived by a whisker, we would have admired his \\"cool.\\" It appears his style was to live on an edge that the Walter Mittys of this world will never fathom. There is more to life than growing old. My thanks to Jon Krakauer for generating a body of work that acknowledges a tragic tradition. One that can be traced back to the \\"5,000 year old man.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Page Turner!!!","review":"In Jon Krakauer's book Into The Wild it takes you into the mind of Chris McCandless. Chris ditches almost all of his possessions then he hits the road traveling around the west coast. But still with his goal in mind to live off the land the land of Alaska.This book besides the story of Chris McCandless gives the reader other peoples thoughts of Chris, people who met Chris and opinions of what he did. Krakauer also puts in passages from many authors such as Henry David Thoreau, Paul Shepard, and Jack London just to name a few.This is a sensational book written about a tragic event that took place out in the terrifying wilderness of the Alaskan bush.This is a must read if your into the outdoor adventures that have twist and turns every time you turn the page.It's a real page-turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Into the Wild, a interesting book by Krakauer","review":"Into the wild is a great book by Jon Krakauer. It is about young man, who gives up his family,car,and money to go live in the wild with nothing really. He had a good education, fresh out of colledge and seemed to have a good life. But he was found dead up north around four months later by a moose hunter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alaskan Wilderness","review":"I loved this book! I enjoyed and had a great learning experience about the wilderness up North. Very Interessting and exciting! I wish i could do the same thing as Chris someday"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoy","review":"Krakauer does a fine job examining McCandless's journey into Alaska, and in exploring the psychological reason's for his doing so. This book is well worth the read. It is true human drama - sadness, humor, and, in the final outcome, the inability to understand what motivates people. It's an easy read. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I bought this book when I lived in Fairbanks Alaska . I loved it. In fact I loved it so much I have read it in the last year 24 times!. Everytime I read this book I become more involved. Its always like reading it for the first time"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book!","review":"Into The Wild was one of the best books that I have read in a long time. All of the plots and the sub-plots make this book a great book to read for leisure and if you need a book to read for school. The main Character in this book is a young man name, Chris McCandless. Chris brings a great twist to this book. He was in graduate school, but he drop out to become a nomad. Chris burns all his money and cuts off all contact with everyone he knows and hits the road on a wild and adventures journey. I would suggest this book to everyone interested in reading a good and adventures book. This book is easy to read and is also easy to understand. So Into The Wild is going to make you want to read all types of books that are similar just go get this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book takes you on an adventure and is a wonderful read","review":"I was drawn into this book from the start and didnt put it down until it was finished. If you have ever wondered what life would be like with no strings attatched then this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A young mans search of life","review":"\\"Into the Wild,\\" is a fantastic book. The author, Jon Kradauer, does a great job telling about Chris McCandels struggles in the wild. Kradauer raises many interesting points about McCandels life. Such as, why does a young intelligent man leave behind his whole life to risk death in the wild? This is the sixty four thousand dollar question and what makes this story so intersting. Many people die all of the time in the wilderness, hunting, fishing, hiking ect. But, few people give up there entire life, money, possesions, and family to explore the wilderness. This is an excellent book that, even if you like it or not, will spark your mind and make you think about how some people percieve life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How does a book like this become a best-seller?","review":"I did not like the book. I read it once, and the first time I read it, I only got half-way through it because it didn't seem to grab my attention. I like the wilderness, however, the idea of some rich kid, giving all his possesions away and hiking out in Alaska till he dies, does not thrill me. Krakauer told more about himself then the main character fo the book. I mean it is an interesting story, but not something I could picture a lot of people trying in real life. A kid is rich, hates his family and decides to give it all up to go die in Alaska, no I don't think so. Maybe next time Jon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent story.","review":"The author does a wonderful job reporting what's known about Chris McCandless' life and death in the wild and detailing the thoughts and risks a young man is willing to take when competing against nature. I heard Jon Krakauer's interview on NPR's Fresh Air a month ago and couldn't wait to read the book. It really is a fascinating story. I really felt for Chris, because I believe every young man has this thought that they can live off the land and survive, without help from anyone else. It's a nice, quick read that I would recommend.Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wild Calls to Us","review":"I enjoyed every word in this wonderful tale of a terrible drive to try to make it in the wilderness. I believe we all have this desire. To go somewhere on our own. To see if we can survive. Something pulls us to the unknown. Maybe it's what allowed humans to settle the globe and perhaps eventually even space.Kraukauer is a terrific writer.Into Thin Air: A Personal Account of the Mount Everest Disasterwas also a page turner hard to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring Read","review":"This is one of the best books I have read. Chris's story inspired me so much and I was truly moved by the book and movie. I walked around in a daze for a while after reading just pondering his life and the events that lead up to his death. He will also be a hero to me and it's a shame that his life was cut too short."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling story, well written","review":"Krakauer's writing style has always agreed with me. Clearly his tendency toward writing his own impressions and experiences into his books is irksome to some readers, but I find that it works well here. Whether you feel that McCandless was a courageous explorer or just a damned fool, I think anyone interested in stories of true adventure will get a lot out of this book. It's not a \\"just the facts\\" narrative, but involves side-tracks into Krakauer's reactions to the main character and the reactions of others. It even strays so far as to compare McCandless to other adventurers whose travels--either through bad luck or poor decision-making--ended in death.I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"lonely [and unfair] search for innerself","review":"it's been a couple of months i saw the movie 'into the wild'. at first, it has really touched me and i got fascinated with young irresponsible runway-from-everything-and-everyone chris macandless. as soon as i could i bought the book which i just finished. while reading it, i had the opportunity of learning the cruelty of a young mand who just woke up one day and found out that he simply didn't fitted into any place. albeit i'm still enchanted with 'alex', it should be remembered the suffering he imposed to his parents and, most of all, to his sister, who seemed to be the best proof alex could get of the very existence of all he tried to reach and to prove. who's right? maybe alaska.. but the story is great indeed.andr�� g, Brazil"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written, and not interesting","review":"This book is nothing but a sloppy, unorganized string of quotes, journal entries, and other meaningless crap. Chris McCandless's life is uninteresting, and his \\"wild adventure\\" to Alaska is nothing but a feeble suicide mission. He was ill-prepared, and I believe he suffered from a mental illness. He is not a \\"hero\\", or a \\"soul-seeker\\", but more of a dopey kid who decided to plunge into the wild with not much more than a ten lb bag of rice. What a moron...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Glorify This Stuff?","review":"I was horrified all the way through this book. The man described was clearly suffering from a mental illness. The book was written as if to glorify an irresponsible way of life. This was not an adventure, it was about a man who could not cope with life, and tried to escape into a fantasy land of no people. And, his feeble and naive attempt killed him."},{"rating":"1","title":"This kid was just plain stupid","review":"Sorry folks, why are you trying to sentimentalize a young, rebellious kid who was hiked into the Alaskan woods without enough planning or provisions? That's not brave or adventuresome in my book. Where I come from that's just plain stupid. I'm still at a loss as to why Sean Penn made a movie about this dumb kid. Now don't get me wrong, I'm truly sorry for the loss of his life, and my heart goes out to his parents. But for God's sake, he did a stupid, dumb act in the name of getting back to nature. There's nothing more to it than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read, but without the romanticism of the movie","review":"I saw Sean Penn's excellent movie adaptation of this book first. By comparison, the book contains more information, particularly around background and context, which I found very valuable. However, its drier tone - and the avoidance of too much creative license - means that the powerful (and, some would suggest, overly romanticized) atmosphere created in the movie was not nearly as prominent in the book. Nevertheless, I found this a thoroughly engaging read - and one that added to my enjoyment of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"About as smart as hunting at night.","review":"Not much Maria Ford.

Of course this poses problems, since when their approach doesn't work it fails pretty disastrously. What I have in mind especially are the first movement of the sixth concerto, and the outer movements (especially the last) of the third, that are taken far faster than logic allows, the results being downright unmusical. The advantage is that, whatever faults you may rightly accuse them of, MAK are never boring. My own personal tastes in this music are for a much more peaceful, humane approach, but try as I might I can't deny that often the music making here has incredible joy and sense of purpose. In the end, if you listen to this recording in it's entirety with an open mind, I think you'll discover a way of approaching these works totally different from anything you'll find elsewhere, and really, isn't that something to be treasured? Vive le difference!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bach: Brandenburg Concertos/Brandenburgische Konzerte/Los Concertos Brandebourgeois","review":"Bach: Brandenburg Concertos/Brandenburgische Konzerte/Los Concertos Brandebourgeois~ Johann Sebastian Bach is such a fine recording that I was totally enthralled whilst listening to it. It is executed by such fine musicians and Reinhard Goebel is such an amazing conductor. This must without a doubt be one of the finest recordings that I have ever heard of the Branderburg Concerto. The book-let is also meticulously selected and the essay written by Goebel and translated by Ms Whitall is very informative. In fact I can not say enough good things about this recording. I find it to be so sublime that I wish I could give it 6 stars. Alas I can only give it 5 and it verily deserves so much more.

I noticed quite quickly that although it was good in most other respects, it has a rather bad battery life of about 7 minutes. It doesn't quite go 18 mph, more like 12, but it is still very fast.After a few days of using it, one of the suspension springs got stuck. A few weeks later it snapped off so the back of the car hung down and the front wheels spun endlessly.

Nor can you buy some decorative tubing to cover the cord up, because the light switch is attached to it.

It is true that a student should have a fairly good grasp of The Calculus and Differential Equations, but most students will already have such knowledge by the time they take this class. I feel it is a positive that the authors did not feel obliged to explain the small mathematical details necessary for each example since to do that would have weighed the book down with unnecessary redundant information.

Their problem solving approach is the best I have seen. I haven't been able to work out a end of chapter problem myself, however (full disclosure). Calculus is there from the start. From what I see, Pritchard didn't add much other than interesting tidbits here and there, and he has watered down at least one example: in the 2nd ed, you discovered Gauss's Law in the 1st example, but Pritchard gives us the scenarios for plug and chug.

I found this book to be amazingly helpful. The thing it does better than just about any book I have seen before is example problems. They are numerous, and make sense.

It was a fascinating book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sacrificed plot for graphic, sensational sex.","review":"The use of art therapy as a central element in the plot development of this book was fresh and fascinating. Unfortunately, the book degenerates into a graphic description of violent sexual acts that detracts from the plot. More \\"detecting\\" with the art therapy and less focus on sadistic acts would have made the book a better read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerizing.","review":"As seems to be the status quo, I picked this book up from a bargain bin - in Acme of all places! The title sent a little shiver down my spine. And once I started reading I absolutely could not stop! This book is horrifying and so well-written that you feel you are in the room, in the woods, in the water, in the truck, experiencing everything with Davey and/or Celia... When I audibly gasped at one point my co-worker came around the corner to see what was wrong. When I explained what had taken part in the story SHE was hooked! I had to give her a blow-by-blow summary each afternoon of what happened next! A horribly scary, scary book - the suspense is palpable. A definite recommendation - but not for the faint-hearted! And don't read when you are alone!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More plodding than suspenseful, annoying in its wordiness","review":"After reading so many good reviews, I was really looking forward to this book. Unfortunately, I felt the book did not live up to the glowing reviews. It was plodding and cliche'-ridden to the end. And speaking of the ending, I pretty much had it figured out about halfway throught the book. I did like the insight into art therapy and how it is used in child abuse cases. Other than that, I'd have to say that this \\"suspense\\" novel was more annoying than suspenseful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ick!","review":"This guy writes a good thriller, but this one was too disturbing and harsh for the likes of me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Metal from Norway","review":"This is the second CD from Norway's Mactatus.

If you love \\"Enthroned Darkness Triumphant\\" period Dimmu Borgir part of this would greatly appeal to you. In my opinion it doesn't sound like Dimmu, althrough you will hear comparisons, but there are similar techniques used. The vocals are evil and suit the music very well. Starting with songs, like \\"Excellence\\" and forward this CD is great. The first four tracks are just not as memorable, but four great songs that you play over and over again is worthy of 5 STARS in my book. I think this is better than their last effort, \\"Suicide,\\" which I also have. This is black metal that takes you on a journey. I know the cover art looks a bit ridiculous, but it's the music the counts. If you like this band, check out Dark Fortress \\"Stab Wounds,\\" it similar to this but even more evil.

I've found portions of transcripts online and in a news magazine that were far more interesting than those published in this book.

It wont play most of my store bought movies. Today I tried to watch my 2nd season of the Gilmore girls, watched the 1st disc, when I out the second one in, it kept saying disc error. Or it would show no disc at all, tried with 3 and 4 as well, same problem. This has happened on several occasions with many different movies.

First, the manual is terribly written and the on-screen hyroglypics are horrible. Very user un-friendly. After first hooking it up, it wouldn't recognize ANY disc; R, RW, or pre-recorded concert DVD's. Finally, I got it to recognize everything except recorded +R's, so I tried to record something using the timer. After supposedly recording the programs, I couldnt' get the machine to turn on! I had to unplug it to get the disk out, and then there wasn't even anything on it. I tried it again...saw that it was recording...and when it was done, still couldn't get it open! Very frustrating...so I'm taking it back ASAP!.

Yes the interface sucks and the manual isn't much better, but once you figure it out, it rocks. So, why only two stars? The unit began locking up and refusing to either record from the timer, or eject the disc. After calling Customer Care, I was informed to send it back for repair. What I got back was a dented, scratched unit with missing parts that has now been labeled \\"renewed\\" (even though I bought it brand new) and the warranty has been shortened from 1 year to 90 days.

A couple of days later I finally figured out that you have to hold down the chapter forward/reverse buttons to search through the DVD. The manual is difficult to read, so it contributed to the problem.More importantly, I tried to edit out commercials using the \\"hide chapter\\" feature, but they showed up anyway when I tried to play the DVD back on my good Samsung DVD player. Also, while the recordings play back OK on this machine, they periodically skip on my Samsung DVD player, which normally plays DVD+R disks fine when I create them on my computer. Disks seem to play OK on an older Toshiba DVD player, so it is probably hit and miss whether or not the disks will play on other devices. I'm not willing to put up with this, so I'm going to pay more for a Toshiba with a built-in hard drive and can really edit out the commercials."},{"rating":"1","title":"Help Please!!","review":"For the life of me I haven't been able to get the edited DVD+R's to play its edited version on any other machines but the recorder.

It came with no power cord which was easily purchased at a local electronics store. However, when I arrived home, the remote was no where to be found. Since we just moved I thought I might have misplaced it. After a week of searching, I decided to buy a universal remote which might work AFTER you get past the initial installation process (!?!) However you CAN NOT get past the original set-up without the original remote. I didn't read the reviews on this machine until I got home because Magnavox is typically a pretty good brand. My mistake. I'm going to take it back and stick with my original decision to buy the well-reviewed non-brand.So in summary, who knows how the machine really works.

Suffice it to say that Pinnock's version is totally adequate.My real interest with this release is the Scarlatti Dixit Dominus which is quite worth hearing. We hear very little of Alessandro's sacred music, and if it is all of such high quality I don't know why. While it is not near as daring or energetic as the fantastic setting by a young Handel, none the less it has plenty of original ideas, beautiful melodies and inertia. All of the movements are ear-catching, and there is some very clever counterpoint, particularly in the concluding chorus. The performance is very fine, and I have no complaints with the string band, chorus or soloists. While it may not be very well known or appreciated, this Dixit is definitely the highlight of this disc to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging Religious Institutions","review":"I'm a columnist and a media critic and have reviewed this book...I think it's brave, smart, and very important. Beaudoin challenges religious institutions to get inter-active and get onto the Web and do so real ministering, rather than just spout dogma. And more interestingly, he finds plenty of spirituality and religious iconography in popular culture. This is a very fresh look at religion and at what it needs to do if it is to reach younger people, help them and provide some spiritual context for their lives. I doubt if many Church leaders will take Tom Beaudoin's very smart advice -- they're too used to spouting dogma. But they sure should."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helped me to identify better with this generation","review":"Before reading this book, I had assumed that Xers were irreligious or indifferent towards faith and spirituality.

I am only ten days younger than Tom Beaudoin. The many parts of this book were like reading my own life story. Tom hits the nail on the head with many things discussed. I would have liked to have seen some more work with some other mediums. He seemed heavy on the music video genre. He uses many good sources in explanation, but I would have liked to have seen more of his own opinion on a few subjects. This seemed very evident in the section on Tradition and Traditionalism. He tended to go from one source to another with little expression of his own. On the whole this book is written very well and tells about the Generation X population, and how we struggle with our religious life and expressing ourselves theologically."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beaudoin hits home with relevant book on Spirituality","review":"Beaudoin has taken the events of his life, and of many other Xer's lives, and interpreted them in the scope of \\"what it means to be spiritual or religious in the 1990's.\\" The book results in a fascinating examination of what we Xers have usually taken as commonplace or just plain old pop culture, and placed it under his theological microscope. His answers or suggestions in drawing parallels between our lives in pop culture and our lives in religious culture are ground-breaking and breathtaking.

It's really sorry that only a select number of people have had exposure to this film. References inside range from the brilliant William Burroughs to Mickey Spillane.

However, this film is just not that good. The acting is pretty mundane, no real allstar performances, with the possible exception of Heather Graham, whose character dies off halfway through. And the dialogue is atrocious. For the most part, it's extremely cliche (much like the characters) and boring, and fails to progress the plot of the film. There are moments, but they are few and far between.Van Sant's visual style, however, is a small redeeming factor. The natural grittiness sets the mood well, and his ability to linger on a shot (though not as dramaticly as he would in films like Gerry) is noteable.It's really just not that great of a movie. The concept is a good one, but poor acting and dialogue really slow the film down and bore the audience, something a drug movie should never do. I'd recommend Trainspotting or Requiem for a Dream far before I would Drugstore Cowboy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ohhh, how clich��...","review":"Hmmm.... Very familiar.

I had hoped for some words about the different locations in Portland and other tidbits about the actors. I can't even recall a single instance where either one said anything about Kelly Lynch which I found bizarre.What they did talk a lot about are things like the wardrobe and how certain footage (like the closeups) were filmed later by another person, not the director.

The book is a semi-autobiographical story by a guy, James Fogel, in prison. This guy was/is Bob and he wrote Drugstore Cowboy about him and his friends in Portland, Oregon. What surprised me most when reading DC was that most of the best dialog and screens from the movie are word for word out of the book, like Bob describing the ants doing their thing.

Dillon excels as the quick-thinking ringleader of outlaw drifters--superbly played by Lynch, LeGros, and a young Heather Graham--whose only immediate goal is getting their next fix. With stylish camerawork and black humor, Van Sant depicts the ravaging effects of drug abuse on this dysfunctional family, while Dillon's voiceover adds a twinge of sadness. And who else but William S. Burroughs could make such a convincing dope-addicted priest?

You have to wonder why the publisher dredged this nauseating racist garbage up in 1986. Don't buy this poison for your kids.

Whenever that has happened throughout history, tensions arise, and the American West was no different. The reader has the joy of seeing the main character (a white man raised by Native Americans) struggle with his own identity as well the notion that neither side of this particular fence is better than the other; that life is not so clear cut. I read it aloud to my 9yo son, and we both rejoiced in the main character's ability to survive in the harsh surroundings of the old American west, especially when compared to the relatively subdued nature of the settlers.

After hearing Bostridge sing so much Schubert, and then a smattering of other art songs in other languages, I wondered if I was in for same-ol', same-ol', or if it would lack the artistry that characterizes all his other work.Quite mistaken, indeed! His interpretation of Schumann is, contrary to what someone has said, enjoyably tangible, his execution of Schumann's beautiful melodic lines rich, and his obvious understanding of both the music and the language irreproachable.

In addition to his beautiful voice and the accomplished singing technique, Bostridge, only 33, has earned a doctorate in history and philosophy, written two books, and won two major Gramophone prizes, including the best 1998 solo vocal for the recording you're looking at.

At least if your interest is the inside nature of football as played by Tarkenton. In many ways, it is more a book about the role of religion in the life of Tarkenton than it is about football. There are no long descriptions of intense moments in a football game, in many ways it reads like a diary. Throughout the book, Tarkenton repeatedly states the depth of his religious faith, including praying for divine guidance at a critical point in a game.There is an insert called \\"Tips on Quarterbacking\\", eight pages of photos with captions that are designed to help the budding quarterback play the game better.

The Gary Numan cover rules though."},{"rating":"2","title":"NIN has come back from the Perfect Drug","review":"An excellent remix of what was an excellent 2 part album. Every remix is great. Definately pick this CD up. It is a STEAL at $7 One of my all time favs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not Trent's best","review":"This is not NIN's best remix album (Fixed is), but Things Falling Apart is still very good. The best tracks are 1,5,9,10, and of course Metal, the best song on the album. You won't like it the first time you hear Metal, but within a week, you'll have played overplayed it. Unfortunately, this remix album had the same problem Further Down the Spiral did, too many remixes of one song. Three versions of StarF***ers Inc., is too many. Trent should have saved space for other songs from the Fragile. But Metal easily makes Things Faliing Apart worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best NIN remix EP, but serves a great purpose","review":"For some reason it took me like two years to not only find this cd but to purchase it for some weird reason. Well I sure wasn't disappointed when I heard it. The new manipulations off The Fragile are nothing short of spectacular, even though the rather plain and simple (but of course still great because it's NIN, you fool!) \\"Slipping Away\\" starts the cd off, kinda leaving you with false hopes. Everything else is classic, great NIN remixes, but the main tracks that shine on this cd are definitely the versions of \\"The Frail\\" and \\"Starf***ers, inc.\\" Simply superb remixes which I cannot get enough of. The cover of Gary Numan's \\"Metal\\" is pretty good, but a little bit too long... There are simply better remix ep's other than this, but this one still rules, in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like nothing else..","review":"What's really great about this album is that you don't even have to be a NIN fan to really enjoy it. The tracks all sound fabulous over a nice sound system and the production is breath-taking (as usual with any record that has the 'NIN' logo on it). Personally, things falling apart and y34rz3r0r3mix3d are the two best remix albums of all time. Almost a decade after it's initial release and I'm still listening to this beast, that must mean it's a good record, right?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Never thought I'd listen to this one (and write a review)","review":"I'll start by saying that NIN isn't even my favorite band. I recall somewhat liking their (OK - his) \\"Broken\\" and \\"Downward spiral\\". I've listend to the \\"Fragile\\" exactly once and didn't want to hear it again.After listening to this EP, I really feel that Reznor shouldn't have bothered with the original. Seems Reznor has been listening to too much Aphex Twin and it shows in couple of the tracks. Pretend that you are listening to somebody else and have no expectations. You will actually enjoy this CD. A decent industrial album."},{"rating":"2","title":"An awesome CD, but not the best...","review":"Clearly one of the best mix CDs Trent has given us to date, better by far than the crap on Fixed, Things Falling Apart is a must own for any one who wants some NIN, but doesn't want anything too edgy. The mixes are more refined, which can be taken as either good or bad, depending on whether you wanted something milder than the Fragile. An absolute must own for those of you looking for environmental stuff, but if you want some real art by Trent, go for Further Down the Circle before this. One major bonus, it's a full sized CD with some songs you'll almost swear are originals, rather than mixes. Awesome stuff..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another weak remix album","review":"NIN has done it again with their remix albums of slightly changed versions of songs released of previous efforts in an attempt to milk the hard-core ninnies; hard to beleive i was actually one at a point..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"if youre a real fan of nine inch nails you dont need to read a review to find out how good it is you just need to stop wasting time and buy the frickin cd already"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nine Inch Nails can actually be laughed at with this one","review":"This is the worse album for any goth/rock group. Trent is a very intelligent and respected artist of his time but he overdid his work with the remixes. Either he wanted more money or actually thought this piece of work was going to be worthy. Its depressing to just think some songs from a great album such as \\"Fragile\\" was remixed into TECHNO wanna-be Moby songs.This album is one of those that you listen to you want to end as soon as possible because it is just irritating noise. The music that was once taken seriously can now be a club joke. The only reason why I gave this one a two was, ONE for the album art, and TWO, for Trent's time taken into this irritating album."},{"rating":"2","title":"NIN graces us with yet another sonic masterpiece","review":"These sonic manipulations almost play out like brand new songs. Some of them only ressemble their originals in very minor ways. But this is a good thing. It creates entire to interpretations of the old songs.The 3 different versions of Star*** Inc. are amzing, but the icing on the cake is the cover of Gary Numan's metal. Worth the price of the album in and of itself. One of the best covers I have heard in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Things Falling Apart?

But when I get up to move around - gardening for example - it would cut out for a few moments until I would move the transmitter.It comes with its own Bluetooth transmitter, which exhibited the above problem behavior. I also tried it with a Jabra music adaptor, a compatible stereo Bluetooth transmitter, and got the same results.

If I had, I would not have bought this headset. The music playback is decent but not great and the call quality is HORRIBLE. I owned the product for about five days before returning it. It is almost useless for phone calls as people cannot hear me. Also, the little wire that connects the two ear covers it extremely annoying and guaranteed to break. This wire is slyly hidden in packaging and descriptions. That's not cool.

I would give anything to have nothing more to do for an entire year than schleep my child down to Royal Grounds in the BabyBjorn every morning to people-watch and then go home to watch SportsCenter and eat PBJs. After a few chapters I wondered: \\"When does this guy go to work? And who's paying for those dinners at Chez Panisse?\\" This is not my reality at all nor of any parent I know.

The author is rather smarmy and self-congratulatory even when he thinks he's being self-deprecatory.I wasn't sure why I was supposed to sympathise with apparent tragedies like there being no more blueberry scones at the coffe shop that he seemed to live at. I felt Mr. Cooper's love for his child to be deep and sincere and his worries and joys of parenting to be honest but a book of any real interest this is not.This recent overbearing need for parents to tell these warts and all stories of childrearing is becoming tiresome to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item to have in the kitchen!","review":"Super pan and rack, great value for the quality that you get...nonstick convenience inside and out.

This was the first of McDevitt's books I have read, and I haven't missed one since."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid writing, good plot and interesting speculations","review":"A surprisingly good read dealing with a fairly depressing end of the world scenario. The adventure of the explorers stranded on planet \\"Deepsix\\" forms the core of the story, with plenty of support given to the innovative rescue efforts. In truth, the most fascinating topics are archaeological- dealing with the intelligent species that lived on the planet.The final revelations are somewhat unexpected and well thought out. Jack McDevitt always delivers in this aspect.Definitely worth reading, and sure to keep you thinking long after you close its pages. Solid writing, good plot and interesting speculations make for a most satisfying read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"I've read all of McDevitt's books... and find this one to be by far the least appealing. It'd be an OK book by someone else, but I expect more from McDevitt. It reads too much like a movie script (and would probably make a good movie) and fails to have the depth of character and science demonstrated in books such as: Engines of God, Infinity Beach and Ancient Shores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Book, Bad Kindle Edition","review":"This one book I truly enjoyed by the author. My issue is with Kindle. I do not know what they used to make the book into a digital book, but there are too many typo's, nonesense lines, and missed punctuation at key points that seriously detract form the reading pleasure. Such as the word \\"die\\" that shows up numerous times where the word 'the\\" should be. A whole sentence turned nonsense in a critical juncture. Substitutions of letters such as \\"fail\\" for \\"fall\\". Get a proof reader. The way this digital book was put together suggests it was done too quickly and without good editing. Definitely not worth the $8.99 kindle charges. Buy the print edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"exciting sci fi","review":"This is the first McDevitt book I've read, and I will be reading more.

You still aren't sure if you want it?","review":"Hey, you with the bored expression on your face! Ya, you. This book, if you choose to read it, could really liven up your day. I loved it. Why shouldn't you? I especially liked the end. It cleared things up nicely but still allowed space for speculation. Mr. McDevitt wrote it perfectly, I'd say. He scribbled a thriller, then threw in bits of humerous releif here and there. Try it, you'll like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended for any self respecting woman","review":"I, myself, have always been a very open minded and avid sci-fi reader. When I stumbled across Deepsix I was impressed to read that the leading character was a female. While I am a woman I'm in no way obsessed with feminism but the character of Hutch in this book is such a terribly unrealistic and sexist depiction of women that I was absolutely baffled. The character was obviously written and developed by a man and this shows quite obviously throughout the books. Aside from my dissapointment with ALL of the female characters (not just Hutch), the story itsself was relatively interesting but very slow and anticlimactic. I don't recommend this series for women at all based on the character, but I don't recommend this book for anyone of ANY gender due to it's poor plot and slow pace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Film, but NO original language track.","review":"Grrr.If you like Keita Amemiya films( Moon over tao, Hakaider, Cyber Ninja, Zeiram2, Mikazuki) Steer clear of Fox Lorbers featureless grab at your wallet.Grrr."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Japanese Alein Type Movie.","review":"In Zeram a weird creature from outer space escapes from somewhere (it dosen't realy say.) and flies to Earth.

Flowery language is used to mask simple ideas and depth of thought is substituted with random comparative excess. I would not find it shocking if the other reviews herein were actually written by the author, as they are just the type of ego indulgence i would expect from Pettman. Ironically, the book may be a more apt example of millenial anticlimax than an expository piece about it. Infused with regurgitated, often dated discourse, the work is pedantic, forcing you ponder the opportunity costs of reading Pettman, rather than thinking about his ideas. I'm not impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"quickly dated and trivial","review":"After I read this pretentious tome, I became depressed. I thought about how many contemporary intellectuals are lost in a sea of theory, popular culture, and self-absobtion. This book, seeking to be epic cultural criticism, is a mishmash of postmodern theorists that seems starkly disconnected from the zeitgeist it's attempting to portray.If you wish to read significant cultural criticism, I suggest Paul Berman's book \\"Terror And Liberalism\\"- a work that is both urgent and sophisticated cultural analysis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good blend of story and technical","review":"Bill Clarke's book on the C150 series is a good overview of the history of the development of the aircraft and the events that lead up to it.

Her \\"Exsultate Jubilate\\" is the most beautiful, unprententious version I've heard. What I've always admired about her is her pure tone, and this recording is no exception. Even though she sings gloriously, she doesn't show off at the expense of Mozart's music. The English Concert's playing is intelligent and stylish as we've come to expect from them. Also, if you're unfamiliar with the Solemn Vespers of the Confessor, this piece is a real treat for choral music lovers. It is done very well here too."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Like Mozart Choral Works","review":"I had listened to and loved Mozart's Requiem, and then one day I picked up my father's CD of Mass in C Minor (Hogwood).

This CD is more great Mozart - definitely worth adding to any library if you like this kind of stuff :-)Definitely a unique work. Very memorable, and with what seems to me to be the excitement and pride of a coronation. Gloria begins with excited impatience, Sanctus is, well, self important, and Agnus Dei has a sense of domestic peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is a wonderful recording with the highlight being Barbara Bonney's soprano.

Mostly because of the great singing of the leader Sonny Geraci. (later of Climax) He is NOT on this album automatically negating it. The fact that they play Precious and Few (A CLIMAX SONG NO LESS) is only attributed to the fact that Walt Nims (songwriter of the song) is in the band for this concert.This is an awful attempt to cash in on a 4 hit wonder's earlier successes.

The flimsy cardboard box from the factory provided very little protection. The output tube from the motor to the tank was crushed, the cover on the motor was cracked and had a golf ball size hole in it, the head had a broken cooling fin, and the lower tank support was bent.

In Elijah, I really feel the work is more an ensemble piece than a showplace for spotlit 'great' voices (as in, for example, the Verdi Requiem.) On this count James Conlon, his soloists and the Cologne Philharmonic with the superb Dusseldorf chorus are so beautifully balanced that I was truly moved and involved throughout the work in a way that the main contender with Bryn Terfel and Renee Fleming just could not do for me.

As a challenge, sometime try applying a warmed-up shampoo to the feet of an active terrier, putting little baggies on her feet, facing electrocution while further warming up those feet in the sink with a hair dryer... and timing it for 6-8 minutes before you rinse her.

The inside of the top of the sandal even has written \\"made in Brazil\\" and \\"leather upper\\". Soooo not true. I gave this shoe 2 stars because I know that it won't stretch and mold to my foot like real leather would. Also I'm dissapointed because this is blatent false representation of a decent brand.

Ron Shelton is an amazing writer and director, and together with Jones and Robert Wuhl, they paint both a funny and yet disturbing look at baseball great Ty Cobb. My only complaint with this film is not enough Lolita Davidovich. For the few scenes she appeared in, she lit up the screen, including the actors in the scenes. Her almost slapstick banter with Wuhl in one scene is hilarious. Her psychological torture by Jones as Cobb is awesome. This film, as well as Lolita, are way too underrated. By this film.

I expected to see more scenes from when he was playing ball, but sadly there is really only one scene that showed his legendary hitting and baserunning....and that scene is very short and quite poor. If you are interested in what Cobb was like as an old angry man, go for it. If you are interested in Cobb as the greatest offensive ballplayer ever.....skip this one in a hurry. Other than that, I thought the movie - on its own merits as a movie - was pretty lousy.

L'ouverture num��ro 5 is the most curious, disorienting and frantic piece I ever heard from Veracini. After listenig to the latter, I decided to buy the other ouvertures of Veracini which are on this CD. Trully, I was disappointed. Why ? Because this mucic gives me headaches and make me irritable. The main problem is that the movements are repetitives. Sometimes, I thought it was a perfect replica of the previous movement. Goebel should have recorded some concertos of Veracini and incorporated them between the ouvertures. The result would have been, perhaps, less aggressive for the listener.Now the good points: the sound is rich, deep and the orchestra play with great autorithy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than Alluring!","review":"When this title first popped up on Amazon, I was thrilled to bits.

The glaring omission, and one that I can't believe that Hybels would make, is to clearly point out that following Jesus' style of leadership is absolutely impossible apart from first having a personal relationship with Jesus, in other words, you can't lead like Jesus if you don't have him in your life to help you.

And it is a rather unique voice, you either love it or it drives you crazy.I love her drama and commitment to the role more than the qualities in her voice. However, this is a very compelling production and I recommend it highly. If you want to know Tosca you have to know the Callas recordings.The story is quite dramatic and everyone finds it involving.

Some will likely disagree but your money would be so much better spent on old and new versions of the Twilight Zone, Outer Limits, then Boris Karloff's Thriller, Friday the 13th - the series, Poltergist - the Legacy, Supernatural, Ray Bradbury Theatre, Tales from the Darkside and so forth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't be more pleased","review":"I recently purchased the Official First Season of One Step Beyond. At first I was reluctant to make this purchase as I already have the full series, however the production quality of this set is so poor that I have only watched a few of the shows. What a difference a digital restoration can make. I feel like I was watching the show as I did when it first came out in the late fifties. I highly recommend to anyone who enjoys One Step Beyond to purchase this product. As the shows are presented in order with the introductions and teaser included, you'll look forward to each new episode. If you are not familiar with the series, you're in for a treat, especially if you are into Sci-Fi, Horror and Fantasy. Think of the series as the forerunner of The Twilight Zone, Outer Limits, Night Stalker and the X-Files."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent restoration.","review":"This series was restored perfectly, with excellent picture & audio quality. It was great seeing this series in great quality, made even better due to the fact the stories were based on fact & proof. I'm anxious to get seasons 2 & 3 when they're released. This dvd set is worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Step Beyond_Year One","review":"Great box set. digitally remastered and much better then the public domain stuff you see all over the web.Great show, it will keep you up late at night.Now trying to find year three now,and I should be all set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Season One very well done","review":"This is so much better than the earlier very poorly done DVD's.Let's go with seasons two and three folks, c'mon!!You have an audience waiting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I consider myself a Sibelius Violin Concerto connoisseur, and this has to be one of the worst recordings out there of the piece. Chang's tacky bow and vibrato \\"attacks\\" on the opening line of the 3rd mvt., for example, are inexcusable for any artist. And where did she think she was going with the speed she opened the movement with? Obviously nowhere! This is a raucous recording that plunges Sarah Chang to another level below \\"respectable violinist.\\" Her Mendelssohn is so-so, but the echo in this bad acoustic recording destroys the piece, giving it a falsified dreamy quality. This concerto is classical period at it's peak! I do not recommend this disc at all! For a better version, try Kavakos', Mutter's, Lin's, and even one of Heifetz's numerous recordings for a little spice. Believe me, you won't be disappointed like I was with this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Denver Specific Guide","review":"I am practically a Denver native and I was very surprised by how much there is to do in Denver! The book gives great insight into all aspects that make Denver unique, as well as giving good tips to make anyone's visit enjoyable. I bought the book to show some friends around town, and now I have used it to keep myself busy on a few weekends as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wix 51060","review":"I use this filter for a diesel chevy pick up and it is a great filter. I purchased it at about $5 and ordered a bunch. I like wix filter and have never had a problem with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE AVRIL!","review":"Well, this is kind of sad to say but Avril Lavigne has gone totaly idiot! Have you heard her new song don't tell me? I have and it's got some pretty bad langgugge plus it's got other words in it i don't want to tell you about. Please don't let younger children buy Avril Lavigne's cd or listen to her new songs. I was an Avril fan a few minutes ago until i heard don't tell me. When i heard her new song i was disscusted. I also started to cry because that's not the Avril i once knew and wanted to be when i grew up. I can't beleive Avril would write such mature songs when she know's there are millions of fans that are even younger that 6! I think Avril should shut her stupied mouth and stop being such an idiot case! I hope Avril falls off a bridge and dies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"Im a barbie lover and purchase this because I have a similar one when I was a child. Barbie and Keiko arrives in a well preserved box.Is a very cute and beautiful barbie, very well made, and Keiko is beautiful too. Perfect for water plays."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book!","review":"This is the worst book on ghosts that I have ever read. It makes all ghosts sound demonish and evil even the children ghosts. I feel very mislead by the author and publisher. The book was not at all what I was lead to think. I recommend that you go to the nearest library and check it out but by no mean should you buy it. Not worth $20 by any standards!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"loaded of information","review":"when I received the book, it was already signed by the author. I'm writing an adventure book with ghosts in it and this book helps me dissociate between different kind of ghosts. It was a very good purchase.ps: very pretty images too."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's like watching Youtube...","review":"...only it's not free and you spend two hours hoping for the payoff at some point. Bad news - there is no payoff. If you want to watch filthy rich people do donuts in their Lamborghinis for two hours, this is the movie for you! If you'd prefer to see something with a story, like a Gumball run or Players Run, do yourself a favor and look into the previous Teckademics videos. ANY of them are better than this. The series has really lost its charm. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Assault Sucks","review":"Dude this is quite possibly the worst one of the bunch. its just boring doughnuts in expensive cars and boring shots of lambos. theres some drifting but its boring there should be more destroying stuff which is what tek is known for"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Giovanni of all","review":"i have heard many recordings of Mozart's Don Giovanni, and I can surely say that this one is the best, although is not perfect.The High couple (Anna and Ottavio) is perfect arranged in Luba Orgonasova and Christoph Pregardi��n voices. Charlote Mrgiono is the best Elvira since Dame Kiri Te Kanawa (only reached by Lynne Dawson, Cecilia Bartoli and Della Jones) and the pleasent couple is very hilarious with Eirian James (although I still prefer Barbara Bonney in this role) and Julian Clarkson. But the best thing in this Don Giovanni is the singer who leads the title role. Rodney Gilfry's voice has - at the same time - light and shade, fear and courage, anger and love, better than Fischer-Diskau, he is above all the baritones of his generation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fabulous Donna Anna","review":"John Elliot Gardiner's way with most music (including Mozart) is to strip almost all color from the orchestra and (especially) from the singers in an amateurish attempt at being \\"authentic.\\" Rodney Gilfrey has a lovely baritone voice, but he suffers from this approach. The one singer that escapes from this unscathed is the fabulous soprano Luba Orgonasova. I'm sure we would've heard even more glorious color from this magnificent voice had another conductor been chosen. That aside, check out Ms. Organosova's recital of arias on the naxos label. She rivals even the great Joan Sutherland in her mastery of the bel canto showpieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great 60's Punk!","review":"These teens were your typical 60's Punkers wanting to be just like the great British Invasion bands from the mid 60's. They do quite a good job and sound great! \\"Impressin\\" is a very catchy tune with great vocals and tight chords! The guys do a killer job covering the Yardbirds \\"For Your Love\\". I'm sure they played a lot of Teen dances in their time. If you're a die hard 60's Punk collector like me who enjoys this type of music and thinks that this was the greatest era in Rock n' Roll then I highly recommend The Kreeg! You won't be disappointed! 60s Punk Rules!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Old Standby - Good on History","review":"This was one of the first lighthouse books for this region, and because of that, it's kind of dull compared to some of the more recent ones. However, it's great for people who want historical information (for example, lighthouses that have been torn down) and for people who want a comprehensive list of area lighthouses, not just the most photogenic or easy to get to lighthouses!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Poor Photography, even for 1973!","review":"This book is generally good for anyone wanting general information about each lighthouse and about the locations of ones that don't exist anymore. However, the photography is extremely poor. The pictures are very dark with too much glare and have very poor contrast. I would have thought that they would have none better even in 1973! I have seen pictures taken by the coast guard of lighthouses in other books that are way better than these and they were taken earlier than these. If you buy this book and want clear, crisp colorful pictures along with good textual content, you will be extremely disappointed like I was."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT A GODESS OF OPERA!!!!","review":"CALLAS,the godess of opera, i finally know where the great title comes from!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Belcanto at its very best!","review":"If this recording were uncut it would be heaven... But at this time it was a miracle that this rarity was performed at all, because Callas requested it. Callas sings a fantastic Anne, Simionato is the best Giovanna and Rossi-Lemeni has much authority as Henry VIII. This is still the greatest \\"Anna Bolena\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anna bolena, complete opera","review":"Unfortunately one of the CD's was badly marked and therefore virtually unplayable. I would never buy 2nd hand CD's again"},{"rating":"1","title":"obsolete technology","review":"This movie pairing was a great idea. I've had it on the wish list forever just as a reminder in anticipation of the Blu-Ray version. I've given up on the studios ability to do the right thing. I bought the BR version of Chinatown out of frustration. Sad commentary on the industry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drama","review":"If you like watching drama involving a bunch of stupid people then watch this, otherwise don't waste your time. Save yourself some money if you do plan to endure this show and watch it on Netflix like I did though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Callas ducking the high E-flat and not convincing enough","review":"Callas ducks the first high E-flat in the Mad Scene and generally sounds unconvincing throughout. She labors through the coloratura and sounds bored. von Karajan's awful conducting is way too slow and life-less. The sound is dry and boxy. di Stefano overemotes Edgardo's music."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"Callas is at her very peak here! This is an amazing recording! I wouldn't part with it for all the other Lucias in the world! Brava Diva!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super chill!","review":"Currently my favorite chill album - love it, love it, love it (forgive the 4 stars - I only give 5 stars to peers of The Beatles or A.C. Newman, and few can live there). As to the Bjork comparisons - I find Bjork unbearable, so I'm would certainly not connect Cortney with her (OK, I hear the vocal similarities, but none of the pretense or faux artistry) - maybe more like Feist in her finer moments. And as to Cortney being a product of Nashville, this is not like any Nashville you've ever heard. Do yourself a favor. Listen to this on Spotify on a mellow evening, then buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use something else!!","review":"I just took the MAT and now I feel like I wasted a lot of time with this book. It sets you up to think you need to cram a lot of high school-esque facts (history, geography, philosophy, music, bla bla) into your head. Which I did, for two weeks. Then I take the test and it seemed to me to be alot of word play type questions, like SLEEP:PEEL::LOOP: and the answer is SLOOP. The REA review didn't have any questions like that in their practice tests, and it's hard to sit there during the test thinking \\"word jumbles??\\" and try to get your brain in that track. There were maybe 10 questions that my studying was useful for. I think any other book (and I admit, it was stupid to rely solely on one book!) would have been more useful and on target than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Though a period instrument performance, this reading of Beethoven's monumental 9th Symphony is intense as any modern instrumental reading. Gardiner literally flies through the score in one of the best recordings available. His reading of the 2nd movement (Scherzo) is fast, furious, and dangerous, while the 3rd overflows with hymn-like devotion. Enclosing these two movements is Gardiner's unique interpretation of both the first and last movements, and he is in terrifying form. His tempi are the swiftest of any professional recording, and the acoustics of the performance location are incredible (Richard Hickox recorded no less a work than Verdi's Requiem in the same location). An excellent bargain, Gardiner's reading is essential for anyone: collector or otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delight to listen to.....","review":"This could be one of Beethoven's most beautiful and tragic symphonies. He was almost completely deaf by the time it was finished which only makes it more magnificent.This particular recording is crisp & clear. Even though there is a lot going on in the finale, all the voices & instruments are nicely balanced and don't drown each other out or become a big muddy mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"A complete joy to listen to","review":"I'v purchased several copies of this cd as gifts for friends. It's such a rare find and such a pleasure to listen to. And the quality of the recording is superb. This makes an excellent, and unique gift.
