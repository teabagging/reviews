This movie was Made for the females of our species (of which i love dearly)but not for me..a male.The so-called love in this movie seems to be shallow and very obsessive..and that is not a good thing..I suggest Mommies and girls like this movie cause they don't feel loved by their husbands or boyfriends at this moment in time.I like the \\"Underworld\\" trilogy of vampire movies more than this Chick Flic...and girls do yourself a favor..go look for some badboys to lust over in the real world...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Awful!","review":"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! It doesn't even deserve a one star rating. The characters are scruffy and unkempt, look and act as if they're groggy most of the time, there was not one memorable or intelligent line in the whole script, the \\"hero\\" had lipstick on and a weird hairdo (what do they see in that guy?) and the story was nightmarish and simply stupid. In the old horror vampire movies I used to watch as a child, the vampire ended with a stake through his heart at the end. This turkey should have ended on the cutting room floor with a stake through its pathetic and disgusting little heart also. Sick, sick, sick!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?!?!","review":"Not only this movie, but all of the movies in this series have got to be the worst movies in the history of cinema. The acting is easily to worst I have ever see. The storyline is laughable and incredibly insulting to the sci-fi and monster movie history. This is literally based around an extremely overdramatic teenage girl caught in a love triangle between a vampire and werewolf.....Really?!?! In addition they decided to have vampires sparkle....yes sparkle, like a bad Kesha music video. When the werewolves turn they literally look like pokemon cartoon wolves, you almost want to pet them or ride them but definetly not be scared of them. These are a slap in the face to the classic werewolf and vampire movies of our time. How can anyone watch these and think of them as anything but comedies?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The book was so much better.","review":"The acting was not that great. Also the characters were not developed enough in the movie. I recommend you read the book and leave it at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"None of the appeal of the book","review":"This movie was painful to watch. Admittedly I am much older than the target audience, but had read the books in an effort to connect with a pre-teen I know through a volunteer program I'm involved with. As much as I hate to admit it I enjoyed the books a great deal and found the teen love story far fetched but fun to imagine. Unfortunately this book did not translate well to film. Needless deviations from the written story didn't make sense and actually made the film significantly less interesting than the written story. In the book there is incredible chemistry and tension among the main characters, but in the movie there is so little of either chemistry or tension the boredom never lifted. Do yourself or your kids a favor and skip the movie, buy them the books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guilty pleasure","review":"My wife had been hinting for a while that she really wanted to see the latest movie in the \\"Twilight\\" saga at the theater, but beyond the basic notion of it being about vampires I had no idea about the backstory. So, on to Amazon I went...and picked up all of the Blu-Ray releases thus far. I hate to admit it, but these movies are mesmerizing. The acting is just so-so, the story is a little convoluted and to top it all off the friggin vampires sparkle in the sunlight. All that being said, you really can't help being drawn into this world and these characters. The movies may lack a little when it comes to vampire lore, but the whole package somehow just works. The high-def transfers look really good, and my only complaint about the discs is that the dialogue always seems overpowered by the score, even when run through a home theater system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better the 2nd time","review":"Yeah i read all of the books and was so excited to see the movie.the first time I saw the movie i was disappointed that they left out a lot of major plots and where was the blood typing??? i felt you did not get to meet the rest of the Cullens none of them really got a chance to speak.But anyway after i saw it for the second time i warmed up to it.

On a Friday night we sat in the theatre amongst a sea of teenage girls... (I wondered if this was going to be our kind of movie) my husband just rolled his eyes. We all loved it, I went directly to the book store and purchased Twilight. Within a month I'd read each book sharing stories with co-workers (ages ranging from 28 to 65) and its been the book series that has united us all. I'm now reading The Host, I'm a fan for life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh, I'd pass on this movie if I were you","review":"In all honesty, I mainly fast-forwarded through this movie because it was so boring. None of the vampires were menacing nor frightening & the fact that they could be seen out in daylight was absolutely ridiculous. Also, if you are a 300 year old vampire (or however Edward was supposed to be), would you really waste your time going back to highschool again? If you want to see a good vampire movie, check out Interview With A Vampire or even better yet, read the entire series by Anne Rice & put this baby-stuff aside.Robert Pattinson is sexy though, so I gave it two stars just for him, but other than that the movie sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Obsessed","review":"I am obsessed with this movie, I can watch it over and over, it's that good.

Now I'm just sitting here waiting for it to finish so I can finish watching the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What about the dudes?","review":"This product completely neglects the fact that there will be fans who aren't 13 year old girls.

So much better when it's not on bootleg. lol"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent book, but awful movie.","review":"The book is quite entertaining and fast paced, wish I could say the same about the movie. The acting is horrendous and so is the script. The awkward stares and bad visual effects made this literally a laugh out loud movie. Definitely not worth the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"bland","review":"The director managed to suck all of the passion and tension out of the book. Maybe she's the real vampire. I want a re-do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Enuff!","review":"I got exactly what I was expecting from this video. No, it wasn't \\"as good as\\" the book, but it had a nice internal logic that it stuck to and it got the necessary points across. My biggest complaint visually would be the \\"speed running\\" sequences. They just looked kind of silly and didn't come close to capturing the sense of abandon described in the book. Other visuals were compelling, though. My 8-year old loves \\"vampire baseball\\"! Overall, I'd rate the movie as more than decent. Certainly worth a view."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Everything worked wonderfully for me ~ thanks for the free Twilight download, I loved the movie and I am looking forward to receiving the DVD in the upcoming week."},{"rating":"2","title":"The promo code mishap","review":"My promo code was deemed incorrect also, but when I hit the button to buy 24 hour rental, the promo was redeemed and I was charged nothing.

What a waste. I almost fell asleep in the first 20 minutes. Wooden acting, straight from the Winona Ryder School of Thespian-ism: a couple of facial expressions, one of which includes a gaping mouth, and a lot of staring (see Winona Ryder's performance in Alien Ressurection). In addition, no one has a sense of humor, there is no sense of drama, it gets a little interesting toward the end (sort of). I often found myself finishing the actors' sentences (yes it was that predictable). Wasted a buck and about 90 minutes of time I could have spent doing something more constructive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stoker is rolling over in his grave.","review":"Now, granted vampires aren't real and one can make up all their own rules -- for example, all my vampires are great looking rich men who find me to be the most desirable thing in the world (talk about fiction!)-- but this whole story is just terrible. Bella is incredibly boring and quite a downer. Edward sparkles. Which brings me to Edward, sparkly, glittery Edward. Poorly done FX Edward. The special effects are so very cheesy. Very amatuerish. Even if the story is very chaste as this one is, there still needs to be some gravitas to it. This movie has none. In such a small town, it seems everyone is a high school student given the physical size of the school and the enormous crowds walking around campus. The best part about this movie is the soundtrack and even then, they blew it as it doesn't have both of Robert Pattinson's songs from the movie on it. Criminal. Skip this and rent True Blood. TB revels in its' campiness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twilight","review":"If you're a sucker for disrespectful children, teenage angst, a slow moving plot, poor acting, and implausible special effect, this is a great movie.

I watched the movie before reading the books which I am glad that I did because after reading the book, I was sad to see all the things left out of the movie. The movie is awesome though and I still HAD to buy it, but there is so much of Edward and Bella's relationship left out of the movie or combined into 1 scene when it should have been 2 or 3 seperate scenes like in the book. The movie rushed their relationship leaving me wondering how they could possibly be feeling such an intense love for one another. I am excited to see the movies (hopefully they make all 4 books movies!) just the same though because it is such a beautiful story and I love to watch as things are played out infront of my eyes.

The way the movie was put together, the acting, the character development, the way the plot unfolded.....all AWFUL. And they omitted some really important parts of the book/plot in order to save time and added some things to make the movie \\"younger\\", but in doing so, made the movie choppy and weird.

It makes you long for Edward without really showing sex. I can relate to the feelings when I was in love for the first time.

It's full of visual and graphic ideas, and the alchemy with the music is perfect (\\"Supermassive black hole\\" on the baseball sequence). I think one of the reasons of its success is that in the Twilight world, as in Disney's, no one really has a sex life, in opposition to most vampire movies. It doesn't bother anyone, it's not subversive (at all!) so it's for all ages! The bonus disc is not so interesting, not original, full of self-approbation as many. Anyway, the soundtrack by Carter Burwell is amazing, magic and melancholic. It gives the movie the magic touch necessary to be something else than a pop corn commercial film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just buy it for Robert Pattinson","review":"Ok so the movie kind of has a silly plot but dear lord, Robert Pattinson is so ridiculously good looking that I bought it just so I could look at him!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Twighlight","review":"Not just another vampire story, very diferent!

A book is always more detailed and the explanations are always there for every question you might have. Not only a better understanding of the characters but of the relationships the characters have with one another. The book gives you a clearer picture of Edward and Bella's love for one another and the movie pretty much ignores the details of the friendship formed by Bella and Alice. The fight scene at the end and the baseball scene was much more detailed and nicely portrayed in the movie. But overall, good movie but book still wins my vote."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not produced very well, but still addictive","review":"I don't know what it is about this movie, but I can't quit watching it. I'm a fan of the books also. I found the production quality to seem very poor, but I think that's what makes me love it more. Is it just me, or did they use some sort of filter to make everything look darker, bluer, and more dismal? Perfect!!Kristen's acting was terrible, and Rob's wasn't much better, but I felt like the movie portrayed the book fairly well, or at least as well as a movie can. My favorite scenes (spoiler) are when Edward has to save Bella from James's venom (i love the use of the Rob Pattinson song in this scene and the black and white imagery) and I also love the final scene at the prom where Edward and Bella dance to the Flightless Bird, American Mouth song. Did I mention that I love the end credits as well? The baseball scene was amazing as well.

Some things were changed I wished they hadn'tbut overall I guess given the budget and all that it was still pretty good. I think the characters were well cast except something about Kristen playing Bella is just off, not right. Bella is suppose to be a klutz, but very smart, and I think she comes off more as mentally slow rather than uncoordinated. She may have chemistry with Edward (Rob) but I think her acting skills are below the standard of the other actors and that drags the movie down.

The soundtrack is horrible, and it is blatant rip off of \\"28 Days Later\\" in terms of music, lack of brightness on screen and directing.The two main characters have the chemistry and appeal of Hayden Christiansen and Natalie Portman in \\"Return of the Sith.\\" A Brady Bunch vampire special is what the dinner scene reminds me of.This movie is really sucks!!

Well, I can honestly say that there is a new bottom dweller in the realm of vampire movies and it is \\"Twilight\\". Maybe I'm out of touch, maybe I'm too old for the subject matter or maybe it's just a really bad episode of \\"The OC\\"-with vampires. I'm going with the latter. I've heard the books are great.

So I tried it just to try it and what it is is you have the movie forever, but you can only watch it through the video player here on Amazon, and the quality sucks.

Stephenie Meyers for creating an entirely unoriginal story which insults the intelligence of literate people, or Hollywood for taking it and making a film so more people can hate it. I'm tired of the constant stream of hack writers trying to reinterpret vampire mythology and repackage it so teenagers can feel hip. If you're going to prostitute yourself, at least write something original. A vampire in high school...really? Arent classes held during the day during which vampires sleep? Oh...that's right, not THESE vampires. Apparently they're not only able to go about their business on cloudy days, they're compelled to repeat their senior year in high school over 400 times.

I've read the series several times and perhaps that is part of the problem. I know movies must condense and modify, but the movie's atmosphere is not even a shadow of the book. The book speeds through their romance fast enough as it is, but the movie takes such leaps there is no romance, only tension. My list of dislikes is long but my two biggest disappointments: 1) They change the sequence of some elements which really effects the romance storyline; and 2) WHERE IS EDWARD'S SENSE OF HUMOR? At some points he's just a rude jerk. The movie gives no balance to his character. I watched it a second time trying to be more objective and it wasn't quite as painful to watch. But it's still Twilight tofu for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD in perfect condition!","review":"I watched the DVD the day I received it. There were not any scratches..the disk looked brand new.

I have read the books several times because the story was so captivating. Stephenie Meyer has the unique talent of describing her characters in such a way that you feel close to them. Having said that, I would not say that \\"the movie isn't as good as the book\\" because to me they are not comparable. I really liked the movie because I was just excited that in some way the story would continue. I am looking forward to the movie version of New Moon for the same reason. If your perspective is such that you just want more of Edward, Bella, Jacob, and all of the other amazing characters, then I believe that you will truly enjoy seeing the film and want it in your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"After hearing all the good and bad reviews about twilight I decided to buy the dvd instead of reading the books. Man this movie is horrble. The fight scenes are lame the acting is off and Bella is boring as a bat. A waste of good money spent on garbage. The people giving these reviews have to be off or are just die hard fans who just want to rate the movie high because they loved the books. And what was up with the staring contest Bella and Edward were giving eachother. And Edward was on some stalker s***. I mean he was everywhere Bella was and seemed to get mad when she spoke to other people. And what was up w/ the apple trick? The action scenes were sped up so u couldn't get a look in. And did anyone notice Edward was what over 100 yrs of age and was in love w/ a 17 yr old. The twilight fans can have this junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Massive Hate-Crime Against Cinema","review":"Out of all the bad movies I've ever seen (in any genre), this confusing hybrid of teen/romance/vampire/fantasy is probably the absolute worst in a very long time. It's got narrative holes the size of Mount St. Helens, YouTube quality visual effects, ugly camera-work, a jarring tone, pacing that's slower than a snail, derivative action and romance sequences, and worst of all, comical performances. Robert Pattinson has single-handedly beaten John Travolta (of \\"Battlefield Earth\\") for the greatest comedy performance of all time, and that is not an overstatement. Kristen Stewart's performance is also hilarious because of her expressionless face. If the 2005 book was pure garbage, then this film is a massive hate-crime against cinema. When all is said and done, \\"Twilight\\" makes a ridiculous premise look and sound so much worse than it does on paper. And let's face it: the sequels aren't much of an improvement if you ask me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I've read all four books in the Twilight series so needless to say I was excited when a movie came out. But, like most book to movie adaptations this movie was lacking in many areas. The Direction was poor, the acting was poor, there was no chemistry or emotion between the main characters as they would have you believe. The best acting was done by secondary characters which sadly were given very very little screen time. I am however looking forward to New Moon to see how Taylor Lautner acts in place of the Stone-cold , jerkish Edward"},{"rating":"2","title":"True to the story....see twice at least","review":"This is a response to those who've argued with the casting, score, special effects etc. How many of us have read a fantasy envisioning the characters and setting only to be sidetracked by a movie director's interpretation of same? My second viewing got past all the well done changes in the action to better appreciate how it remained true to the main events of the story, including script lines, and the growing relationship between Edward and Bella. The setting was breathtakingly beautiful as the Northwest tends to be and the soundtrack as haunting as the tale. Casting was spot on - one has to remember that Rosalie was gorgeous through Bella's self depricating eyes, so why would we expect more? Loved the third viewing even more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"Puny acting, stupid characters, and long boring storyline and plot.

The film itself may be hard to follow if you are unfamiliar with the storyline in the book. I persuaded my spouse to watch the film with me, and his opinion was that it was \\"slow\\".

I can't wait for New Moon to come out at the Theater. Although at times the actors seemed awkward with one another, I thought they had great chemistry. Maybe I am projecting from the books.

Edward and Bella were terrible picks. They even changed their personalities.I tried to reread these books again but I am finding it difficult to enjoy the books after watching this, I guess my imagination was better.

It didn't have the poetry of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles and lacked potent imagery. Dull, dishwater dreariness! I rented only out of curiosity of it's box office draw. It was so low budget, with so many unseasoned actors and a very week (almost laughable)script for it's paper thin plot. A bad vampire movie usually turns out to be a gore fest with little to no romance. This movie is certainly not belonging to the horror genre and the chemistry between the lackluster performances of the principle actor's was non-existent. It was more of a bore fest!

They all pretty much seemed the way I would picture them to be except Bella. Ugh, what a disappointment there. I know in the book she is average and plain and in the movie I thought she was semi- pretty but her voice and her horrible acting kind of killed the character, for me anyway.There were lots of parts skipped over and scenes jumped from one to another without any fluidity. I know there wasn't much of a budget but they at least could have cast characters that could act.

I quickly traded my twilight saga two disc version for the three disc version. I love the interviews with the cast. What Step Meyer and the production and cast crew had to go through to find the perfect Bella and Edward. This version gives you an up close and personal look at Twilight and what they had to go through to make this movie the phenomenon that it is today. I love this movie. I love the special features.

It was hard to believe how bad it actually was. First of all, the actors couldn't act - there was no emotion to their parts. I didn't believe that Edward and Bella actually felt anything for each other. There was no spark and it was so robotic. It also felt rushed. Yes, movies never capture the details you get from a book, but if you try to fit everything in there is no depth. I feel like I have to go back and read the books to remember the characters the way they should be. If they are planning on making the next ones, which I hear they are, I will not be getting them."},{"rating":"1","title":"amazon should give us fans a new blu ray with new moon trailer","review":"I think this place is lucky they dont get sued for false advertisting i'm really pissed off about this they said there would be a new moon teaser and they lied so we would all be foolish and buy this i wasted 300 dollars on a blu ray and this box set just for the new moon teaser what a waste. i already have a copy of twilight on dvd and now i have another with the same exact things on it.I do luv the movie and the box set im just really upset that they lied to all the fans to get them to buy this and i will never buy anything from this crappy place ever again!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A review of the collector's edition set and not the movie","review":"While I love the books and the movie. This review is about the actual item, the collector's edition set. First of all $79.99 is way too much. The set is cool but it is not $79.99 cool. If it was cheaper I would have nothing bad to say about it, but paying this much I expected a little more. Granted I figured the watch was cheap plastic, but I expected this so called jewelry box to at least be plastic or anything but cardboard. It's carboard and doesn't even snap close because it's not aligned right. The charm bracelet is also plastic, I expected at least a higher end plastic then what it is. The photo cards are cool and the bookmark is cool. All the hype about a New Moon teaser is in fact just a tease. Apparently even though the dvd has BD Live, Summit has not released anything for it so the only thing on the BD Live is the trailers that play as soon as you put the dvd in your player. Overall, I'm a little disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all like the book!!!","review":"O.k., so I am way too old to be reading these books. I am a 30 year old mother of two, who now is completely in love with a seventeen year old vampire. Very embarrassing! I do have to say, because as a mother I would hate myself for not saying it, that I do believe Meyers is sending mixed messages with her book to a very young and impressionable audience. Edward is very possessive, almost stalker like in his ways towards Bella, which makes me wonder if this is not detrimental to the way young girls view their own relationships with boys their age. With that said, I will move on to the movie, it was horrible!!!! I thought the characters matched their physical descriptions well, but the movie was so rushed that it did not allow you to really believe that these characters were as in love with each other as they claimed to be. It was way cheesy and really confusing. It didn't really follow the book the way I wish it had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful acting","review":"I didn't read the book, but since it was a hit with the teenagers and housewives around here I thought it might be a good choice for a light romance. The acting from the main female actor was terrible..very stiff and she delivered her dialogue the same. With the hype given to this movie, I expected better acting. I rated it as I did because of a couple of the scenes that were actually pretty decent. Overall, however, it stunk."},{"rating":"1","title":"twlight fan","review":"I am a huge twilight fan, but so disappointed in the movie. They didn't stay true to the book. What a disappointment. Stephanie Meyers is a very wonderful writer and they took that and crapped on it. I will now stick to the books, as they will destroy the story in the movie. It was not the actors, it was going off the story, like the way the other vamps came to town... and the prom... the way Bella guessed... where it happened...talking with Jacob on the beach wasn't even right. they took a wonderful book and trashed it the way Hollywood does so often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas gift that was loved by my girls!!","review":"I always liked vampire movies - but not to the degree that the 2 young girls living in my household do! They have fallen in love with the Twilight movies/books. They are only 9 and 10 yrs old!! All the older one wanted for Christmas was the Twilight movie, the calendars with pictuers from the movies, and the set of books. She got her wish - and about 1 hour after opening gifts this holiday, the dvd of Twilight was out into the player and was being watched! They love this movie - most teenage girls/boys do. There is something about the way this story is told - and it works! Two thumbs up from us!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Teen angst at its best","review":"The Twilight saga makes a better book than it does a series. While the first movie is entertaining the drama between the characters is overly exaggerated.

There is a part of the movie that skips in a couple of places and the disc, the front and back of the case are written on. Other than that, it was a good purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your crazy if you think this is called a film","review":"Terrible movie. Actors were even more terrible. Stephanie Meyers should have waited out for a better movie studio to produce this book to movie translation. For some reason now a days Hollywood likes to butcher good books and turn them into money making ponzi schemes. Why do people even like to watch this crap. I thought acting and films where supposed to mean more and awaken the emotions inside a person. Film making is an art form. Not some masterbatory movie catered to tweens and 40+ moms. Not to mention the D list actors who just want to be famous. Back in the old Hollywood days, they would have torn Rob, Kristen,& Taylor apart. Not to be mean, Im glad they are following they're passions in acting. God Bless them, but Jeez either take some acting classes or star in more independent films until you think you can produce a good \\"Forest Gump\\" type movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight","review":"This is an excellent film.

Ill be shopping at amazon more often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Digital Copy","review":"There are several versions of the movie out on DVD and blu ray. Target has one with a digital copy- awesome! Why buy a digital version on iTunes for $14, when if you spend $23 then you get a hard copy too? Borders has their own special case for it too- but no digital copy. Love the movie, saw it first then read the books then watched it again. Reading the books really brings the characters to life so you can understand all of Edwards innuendos in the movie and can read his face since you know the whole story. Good movie, fairly good adaptation to film. Its a long book so they do have to cut some stuff out but I think what they did cut out wasn't massively critical to the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight","review":"Enjoyed this DVD --this was a long overdue purchase. My order arrived here very fast. Will continue to purchase from Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight","review":"Great movie! I thought I would hate a vampire movie but I was hooked!

I WAS THRILLED THAT AMAZON LOWERED THE UNIT PRICE ON THE DELIVERY DATE."},{"rating":"1","title":"All hype no follow thru","review":"The movie actually deserves 2 or 2.5 stars but to bring reason to this poorly produced film with choppy sequences I had to try to bring the average down. I waited till midnight to rent this video and I was very disappointed that I spent the time. Read the other reviews, mine is just 1 in 200. The book series is very good the movie has short choppy sequences I feel poorly re-enacted from the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie EVER!","review":"As mentioned by another reviewer, anyone under the age of 16 will LOVE this movie. The teenage angst, the brooding \\"hero....\\" For that demographic, it is actually not that bad - chaste romance, no profanity, just overlook the vampire part.However, if you are older than 16, don't waste your money on this DVD. Don't even to rent it. UGH! The acting is awful. Pattinson looks as if he has violent stomach flu and is desperately trying to hold in the vomit. Granted, with a story this weak, it is hard to create an Oscar-worthy performance. Seriously, does anyone really believe that the dark, depressed girl would be accepted into the \\"in\\" crowd and have the hot guy for boyfriend?? It just does not happen.Finally, this movie has the WORST line I have ever heard. From Edward the vampire to Bella the human, a line that is supposed to make you swoon: \\"So, the lion falls in the love with the lamb.\\" Oh, I think I just vomited in my mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"TIGER BEAT MAGAZINE PROUDLY PRESENTS ......TWILIGHT!","review":"I knew I would eventually get around to watching this film, but I had no idea it would be this bad. The film feels like a dime store romance novel for 14 year old girls. It's slow and boring with little action for the first three quarters of the film and when it does get going it doesn't go very far. What makes it even worse is that it isn't even a complete movie! I felt cheated after watching this pint sized \\"chick flick\\" because it doesn't stand on its own and I'm sure the second installment is incomplete as well setting up part three. If you are older than 14 and have a \\"s a c\\"....stay clear of this waste of celluloid. Just awful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly.......gay","review":"This movie was awful. Is this movie supposed to be a comedy? It made me laugh quite a few times."},{"rating":"1","title":"More gay Ann Rice type vampires.","review":"This is just stupid and an insult to vamparism. Vampires are blood sucking vile creatures, not sexy flamboyant lovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not translate well to film","review":"I loved the book, but it did not seem to translate well. I was very disappointed. Charlie, Carlisle, Esme, Rosalie, Alice, and Emmett were perfect. Jasper and Edward were ridiculous. Some seriously bad acting. Robert Pattinson and the guy that played Jasper struggled with looking tortured and mostly ended up like they just had their eyes dilated at the doctor. Bella's character suffered from a little over acting as well. Lots of heavy breathing and gulping. Very awkward performances, but my hopes are high for the sequel. Hopefully, the script will be better than Twilight as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not sure it was worth it.","review":"I thought (for some CRAZY reason) that the two-disk would have tons more stuff than it did. I was hoping for deleted scenes that were in the book and not in the movie, but they only had six or seven little snippets that they felt 'slowed' the plot too much so they cut them (and they really were little). I am not really interested in the audio commentaries that the second disk held, so I think I just might have been more satisfied with the one-disk.If you're just after the story, it's not worth the second disk for it (unless you happen to find it cheaper). If you're interested in the commentaries, though, you'll like this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight Rocks ~ Great Vampire Flick","review":"I know what you are going to say, \\"What is so special about Twilight?\\" Well, for those vampire and gothic fans it is a Huge deal. There has not been a great vampire flick since Queen of the Damned. So for those Twilight fans I applaud you for seeing the movie, and supporting the creative juices of writers. I hope to see more vampire books and movies in the future. Namaste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight","review":"Ordered the preview of Twilight and was able to view it on Amazon preview service before I even got the DVD in the mail. My son and I stayed up until 1:30 AM to be able to watch it. I had read all the books - my son was assigned the book in school and became addicted and bought all of the books. He urged me to read them and once I started I couldn't stop. The movie was pretty true to the 1st book. I had a bit of hard time getting into Bella played by Kristen Stewart as she just seemed so wooden at first and hard to believe she was so irresistable to everybody, but as the movie progressed, Kristen put a little more into the character to make her seem more likable. In any case, I definitely recommend the movie and I think it will probably get a cult following like the Harry Potter movies. I'm looking forward to the next movie and hope they continue with the whole series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight Saga Fan","review":"I thought the women at work were insane and I am not a reader. I left for vacation and decided just to buy the first book thinking that I would be returning it to the bookstore and would never finish reading it. I was so wrong. I got lost in this series and read all 4 books and the draft for the next book \\"Midnight Sun\\" in less than 3 days. I have now promoted this obsession to all my friends and the remainder of my co-workers. The movie brought the entire story to life. I will probably not read another series like this again but will continue to read this one over and over again each time I decide to get lost in a book that can take me back to those awkward High School days and want to experience that first love feeling again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it...or Hate it!!","review":"I wish the extra sceenes had not been added to this movie. If the 2 sceenes where James, Victoria, and Laurent were hunting, and the one where Edward carries Bella through the trees to a breathtaking view of Washington had not been created for the movie, there would have been more time for more of the actual book sceenes. I really would have loved to see the part about the blood typing in biology class.I certainly hope there are no \\"CREATED\\" sceenes for the second movie! I for one would happily sit through a longer movie to include more of the book. I am a firm believer that if the sceene survived the editing process of the book, then it should survive the editing process of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"=)","review":"OMG! I bought this one along with all the others because it was on sale and I just had to have them all! =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"So the movie isn't perfect...","review":"I loved the books, they kept me sane during a rough time. The movie was done on the cheap so it can't possibly do the book justice. My primary gripe is with the director - Cathrine Hardwick was horrible. She actually deleted the two best scenes of the movie and left in some awkwardly sappy, long panning of a meadow scene. I've seen both of the leads in other things and they have the scope to play this with a naturalness that is missing. I can only conclude it is the director's vision that called for stilted and morose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twilight the Movie Blu-Ray (Ultimate Collector's Set)","review":"WHAT AN ULTIMATE RIP-OFF!This is supposed to be a special limited edition collector's item and I am thoroughly disappointed with the ultra-cheap quality of the contents!

What a HUGE rip-off indeed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"how is this movie getting anything above 1 star?","review":"this movie was boring the whole way through...the whole time i thought it was building up to something remotely exciting or interesting that was going to make up for the long dragged out boring plot that took up the whole movie but it didnt..and it ended with a weak fight scene that is hardly considered one in the first place, the actors were all horrible and had no skill, the only thing that would have made this movie better would have been placing a good looking woman to play the main actress role and even then it would have been eye candy for a moment then the movie would still suck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How can people like this? I really don't know...","review":"Unrealistic, boring, vampire, stupid-girl movie. I guess this has to be a blockbuster in our world. Good for the author, but not for me that spent 2 hours of my life watching this.Serious, this is a joke. SpiderMan and SuperMan are much, much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip off!!","review":"The Blu-Ray and Cd were exactly what you would expect. However, the box is crap, it's very cheaply made, not even as good as a shoe box. The pictures are, well they just are. The watch is so cheaply made, you could find better in a dollar store. Bracelet is okay. Looks cheap too. All in all, I should have searched better for the items in this package, could've gotten better quality for cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst vamp flick ever!","review":"First off i like my vampires to BURN in sunlight, not shimmer or whatever. And whats with the different super powers they have that are unique to the individual vampire. \\"Well not only am I immortal but I can (insert whatever power here; hunter speed psychic whathave you).

Won't be buying anything else from Video on Demand and maybe not from Amazon again."},{"rating":"1","title":"One more unhappy customer","review":"I see I'm one of many who was issued an invalid promotional code for a viewing of Twilight, compliments of Amazon. How irritating to try over and over again to get the promo code to work, only to be prompted each time by Amazon that \\"there's something wrong with the claim code you entered.\\" As if it's my fault that they issued me a bogus code! This is unacceptable.

I never received my code, and spent over 30 minutes on the phone with Amazon to to get the code. It's not worth it and I'll remember that next time I want to buy a DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a vampire movie","review":"I'm a fan of the show True Blood on HBO. While the first season was being aired was when I heard about Twilight. So I was all about watching a movie about humans interacting with vampires. I didn't read the books and I didn't follow what it was all about so don't knock me on that. But to say this is a vampire movie would be false... This is a teenage love story. The whole damn movie is a \\"I want to be with you but I don't know how\\" cliche. Nonsense after nonsense. As for the girl... she has maybe six lines in the movie when she doesn't end it with a girly exhale. Any vampire fans out there that are looking for another good flick might want to stay clear of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"They cut out the campy fun parts to this suckfest!","review":"When I saw Twilight in the theater I was expecting it to not be faithful and I was sort of right. The bright spots were the campy crappy parts like when Edward hisses at the drunken jocks, when Bella says, \\"You're skin is so cold,\\" and when Edward looked like he was going to throw up when he first saw Bella. I am glad they kept the whole, \\"I'm a killer,\\" sequence, but then again they really couldn't cut that out/down. The editors had to cut these sequences in order for it to be a \\"serious\\" tween flick, but my 2 daughters loved those parts and are now upset.

This is less clear in the movie. Other than that, I have to say that my daughter and I swept through these easy to read and very imaginative books, and thoroughly enjoyed the movie as well. GREAT casting, too. Can't wait for movie #2. This was written by J. Ealy, Derek's wife."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Movies Ever!","review":"When I bought this movie, I considered it to be the best movie I'd ever seen.

The acting in this movie is complete crap with Bella being portrayed as a whiny, moody [.....]the whole time.

And her obvious immaturity shows when she basically replies \\"but I love you and I don't think you'll really kill me.\\" Besides the horrible acting and storyline the script was ludicrous and made me laugh out loud at inappropriate times. For example: using \\"spider monkey\\" as a term of endearment.Just so all of you Twilight obsessed people know, I did read the books too, (they're crap btw and will probably lead you to need a therapist if you base your future relationships on them) so I'm not just basing all of this off of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"badly made movie...","review":"This is bad...the movie does not live up to the popularity of the book.

I did some research and found out that it was the continuation of a movie called Twilight, so I rented Twilight. I fell in love with the story. I really liked Bella, and how she is very stubburn and independent, and observant. Edward's portrayal of his bloodlust,anger, and fascination with Bella is very real. I loved the scene where bella tells edward that she knows what he is. I also enjoyed the scene in the trees and the music playing in the background. After seeing the movie, I went and bought all the books, and have read Twilight twice, New Moon once, and i currently reading Eclipse.

He uses different names for the same spirit in different pages of the book which leads to a bit of confusion- No cross reference of recipes by main spirit.

It is easy to see (and watch) the movement inside and the design is--as its picture suggests--quite stunning.It has 2 flaws that keep it from being perfect. The first is that since the hands are gold colored as well as the background, it is sometimes hard to read the time. This is a not a watch with which you can surreptitiously glance at the time. But I've learned the angle to hold it at so it's not as much of a challenge, but in low light it can be a problem. They could easily fix it by making the hand slightly darker. It's second flaw is it gains time slightly-- maybe a minute a day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty, but a disappointment","review":"I bought this watch about a year ago and it has since died.

And this album just goes to prove that no matter what, dark imagery and satire will always be appealing. (Atleast to me anyway.) The opening track, \\"This Could Be Love\\" sets the somber mood for the album. Even Dan's lighter songs have spots of darkness in them, enhancing the macabre feel of the album. The stand out track would have to be Matt Skiba's \\"All on Black.\\" This song is everything a Trio song should be. Dark, catchy, satanic. With lines like \\"Sweet blasphemy, my giving tree, it hasn't rained in years,\\" One can't help but smile with delight when thinking of the reaction of the religious right. Skiba is an incredibly intelligent man, and it shows brighter in this album than in any of the Trio's previous efforts. I give this album 2 horns up. So go buy this album now...Satan commands you...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full song review","review":"This was my first Alkaline Trio perchase and is one of my favourite albums of the year.

Its true they have their share but boast a different approach to put it across. the new album in my opinion is great and met expectations, but does lack the rawness of previous albums, like the intensity of word use and meaning for example which maybe i'll catch fire posseses. But all in all good mourning brings something different and in years to come they will be regarded as greats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Cd","review":"alkaline trio doesn't disapoint with this cd. while at first it might sound too polished, or differently formated than their other cds, its still the same sound, just better produced. the only thing i don't like about this album is the way matt's voice sounds. what the hell happened there? dan once again owns, and continues to be my favorite singer, although its still nice having matt sing to provide contrast. this album was too over-hyped before its release, people were anticipating something huge out of this cd. however its nothing new or different from the trio, its just their same good ol' stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible mastering","review":"I heard these guys for the first time in the fall of 2004 in Vegas.

These guys have shown, in there first three full length albumns, that they are extremley talented. They didn't lose there talent on the move to Vagrant, so why the sudden change? what went wrong?Well first of all, The CD doesn't have a lot of variation. And it becomes very repetitive, it has now \\"Stand-out\\" songs. Granted, it has a few good tracks, such as: \\"Fatally Yours\\" and \\"Emma\\", most of the other songs seem very dull. I think these guys tried too hard to make a dark albumn, and they lost focus of just playing the music.The lyrics are probley my biggest complaint on this CD. They sound incredibly cheesey, either that, or Matt just doesn't sound as convincing as he was before.Im seeing these guys play November 7th, and as I said before, they are one of my favorites, and an amazing band.Im waiting too see what there next CD brings :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"the first two songs are good and thats it","review":"I was expecting an amazing album.

But this album definately got me hooked and it's great to see them getting some airplay, a great band deserves that."},{"rating":"2","title":"dude, yeah","review":"I have been waiting for quite some time for this release and it has amazed me. Although I wasn't impressed with \\"We've Had Enough\\", the rest has allowed me to remember why they are my favorite band. 1. All their songs are decent, 2. This band has some of the best lyrics in punk today, 3. The Alkaline Trio writes songs that have grown on me like no other. I am so glad that this band hasn't let me down yet.

There has always been a certain quality to each of their songs that makes them stand out as their own, but unfortunately it has not been well-developed enough so that Dan's songs don't look like they have just been added to flesh out the album. I love the songs he has written but they seem to have been used sparingly in the past. From Here to Infirmary saw that change but the songs were all basically in that same vein. On Good Mourning, the difference is amazing and it's wonderful to see progress as the album goes through. They have both turned out some of their best quality work yet, and it already makes me want a new record from the Trio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Mourning","review":"This Album is one of the Trio's best albums yet it has so much emotion and the lyrics are incredible. They are the best band and they have the coolest sound. I hope all of the Alkaline Trio's fans will appreciate this album as much as I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you liked their last you'll like this one","review":"If you enjoyed Alkaline Trio's last album, \\"From here to Infirmary\\", then you should enjoy their latest release. Most of the songs have a very similar and familiar sound to them. However, if you only like Alkaline Trio's first albums and didn't enjoy their last one then you probably won't enjoy this one either.Alkaline Trio play great punk tunes, some faster some slower, that are very catchy. Their lyrics are always on the darker side as death and pain are popular lyrical material. One thing that sets Alkaline Trio apart from other punk bands are their great vocals.Good Mourning puts together quality tracks from start to finish with no filler in between. Some of my favourite tracks inlude:This Could Be LoveAll on BlackFatally YoursBlue in the FaceI've found this purchase to be well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff, but nothing ground breaking","review":"The latest album by Alkaline Trio is definitely a solid effort: songs are catchy, fun and the lyrics are dark/funny/interesting as all other Alk 3 stuff. The album starts off really nicely with \\"This Could Be Love\\" and the energy is carried throughout the entire album. Fans who are looking for something new would be disappointed--since they haven't really explored into any new grounds with this album here, with the exception of the ending track, Blue in the face, which is an acoustic track that has some really really good lyrics. The bottom line is--this album is a great buy for people who have always been fans of Alk 3..however, the songs are fairly typical and might sound a little bit boring after repeated listens. Nevertheless, I recommend this album to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually a 200 pin chip (not as shown)","review":"Amazon seems to be having a problem connecting the right picture to this item.

Still, this was written for a tenor and performed by a soprano at the premiere. So why a baritone here? Rothenberger sounds old for Fiametta, particularly in relation to the women whose characters are older than hers. The rest of the solo singing passes muster. But the so-so chorus is recorded in a boxy acoustic and its words are muffled. This matters because the crowd's reactions drive the story (the writer Boccaccio causes scandals). The conducting lacks imagination. There is a flaw in the horn playing near the start of the overture. The 1974 sound-picture suggests a studio, not a live theater.Sadly, this seems to be the only complete version of Boccaccio ever made. The Marco Polo label of Naxos started a Suppé series but never got to this work, which may be the composer's strongest."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Disapointment","review":"I own a 1982 Corvette and was looking for a book that would help me conduct maintenance on it.

Harvey","review":"I was hooked when I first heard the single Bluster . Digging deeper into the disc, I felt like a bad boy the more I listened to lead singer Nina Ramsby's hard-edged vocals. The frequent comparisons to P.J. Harvey are apt, but the tunes seem a bit more accessible. Of special note is the track Lids, where Nina lures you in with her plaintively seductive voice only to turn around and slap you in the face. Ouch! Hit me harder!

Their sound is straight-ahead guitar rock on the surface, but yields a number of quirky chords changes, propelled by songwriter/vocalist Nina Ramsby's continuously curious lyrics and intriguing melodies. More tuneful than the Melvins and less abrasive than Jawbox, Salt was a female-fronted breath of fresh air in the 90's alterna-scape. After Salt folded, Nina went on to perform in the drum&bass/trip-hop combo Baxter, whose sole album is also well worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY WORTH THE MONEY SPENT","review":"i bought this cd way back in 1995 and loved it. i live in georgia so its mostly country down here and nobody knows who SALT is but when they here my cd the first thing they do is go out and buy it. it's got catchy tunes that ANYONE can get into. if it was at all possible i would give this cd 50 stars. my advice to you sould be to buy this cd NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful versatile tool","review":"I asked my contractor friend what framing nailer I should get.

Howard churned out a lot of fiction during his short lifetime, and most of the attention has been claimed by his laconic barbarians-Conan, Kull, and Bran Mak Morn-and that humorless Puritan Solomon Kane. As a result, the fantasy crowd has tended to overlook these idiosyncratic gems about a not-too-bright prizefighting sailor and his bulldog. Forget the lead story \\"The Iron Man\\"-it's just more of Howard's self-serious exploration of machismo. The Dorgan stories, however, show a real sense of humor and an ear-however odd-for palooka dialogue that approaches the Runyonesque.

I'm currently suffering from some acne so my dermatologist says I can't use any gritty exfoliants on my cheeks, but what do I do for the pores on my nose and forehead?

Now I'm left with a lot of scarring, and typically I use Dermalogica Skin Prep Scrub or Daily Microfoliant on my skin.

It works like a chemical exfoliant (dissolves the dead skin rather scraping it off), and that's a great thing for my acne scars and the fine lines.

It was the sound those at Ground Zero heard as the people from the Twin Towers jumped to their deaths. To me at the time, that was the single most impactful segment of this collection. It really hit he visceraly.I recently saw this on IFC and the segment I am describing was edited out. I bought this DVD to see if this was also edited out of it and it was. VERY DISAPOINTING!!

That, and a little unnecessary filler involving some severity dated attitudes on dating, a tad of moralizing about communism and a couple of dashes of pseudoscience, and you have a relatively dull hour, lost forever.

Some of the earthquake scenes are probably missing also (Acquanetta's demise - if my memory serves me correct they used the \\"lava flow overcomes cavegirl\\" stock footage from 1 Million Years BC - Now you think, \\"Say, what did happen to those other villagers?\\").

When the explorers finally get to the top, they see a few dinos, most notably some decent looking Triceratops. They don't really interact with them much. Then there is a volcano, (or earthquake, can't remember which), and there's another long climb down the mountain. The End. As a fan of Dinosaur movies, The Lost Continent was a big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Film","review":"Despite the cast, this film is disappointing.

The climbing sequences was way to long and should have been filmed out side and not on a sound stage. But again this was a 1955 production and the green-tinted I felt took away from the movie.

Who were (with the exception one) more upper middle class. Such men had a more difficult time re-adjusting than others.Plus the story was more focused than the other film. which jumped about from one GI to the other, without giving a fuller picture of each.It also didn't hurt the film to have the \\"VERY\\" Hunky Guy Madison in the lead role either!

I just hope she continues to write more books in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Willett Winner","review":"After reading \\"A Week in Winter\\", I couldn't wait to get into \\"The Children's Hour\\". Marcia Willett really crafts interesting characters and you find yourself thinking about them even when you're not turning the pages!I especially like her inclusion of the importance of the dogs within the family. This adds even more depth and reality to the characters. We all know that dogs \\"have opinions\\" about what goes on with their humans! This is, by no means overdone in the book, but the dogs'personalities add to the richness of the story's background.I was sorry when the story was over."},{"rating":"2","title":"rosamunde pilcher fans rejoice!","review":"Who doesn't want to recall an idyllic childhood, complete with siblings and beaches, pets and unlimited adult attention? And if you didn't have that for yourself, then reading about it might be almost as good! In this Rosamunde Pilcher/Maeve Binchy style novel, the \\"children\\" who sat dreamily around a cherished adult who read them books during the \\"children's hour\\", are now in their 60s and 70s. A unique story unfolds, as we learn of their childhood as the now old ladies tell their childhood memories to each other and to younger family members. Their lives (and the plot) are not without conflict, however. There are secrets that are told, shocking the characters and the reader. Set in a relaxing family estate that has been broken in by generations, the novel is refreshing, relaxing and entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very light read","review":"By reading the other reviews, I know I'll sound unpopular now, but I can't help it. I don't mind a good novel based on past reminiscences where loves stories are remembered and new ones ensue, but I found this particular book to have no depth whatsoever. True, it's a light read indeed and one I'd have avoided had I not spent my money on it.On the good side, the prose is studied and quite elegant. However, most characters, their feelings and surroundings are described in such a repetitive way, it goes on and on. Yes, there are some \\"twists & turns\\", but the bottom line is, this is just the typical he-loves-her-she-loves-him-but-fate-gets-in-the-way kind of story, which takes the reader from past to present back to the past again. Quite predictable too and much too goody-goody for my taste, to the point where the characters seem unreal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too old to be sold","review":"This book was written in 1996. It claims it was updated in 1999. However it quotes a price in French Francs. The Euro replaced the French Franc in 1998. In my opinion, travel books which are this old should not be sold. Don't buy this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening and refreshingly honest","review":"Memoirs from one of the greatest violinists ever, Mr Milstein speaks about the great musicians and composers he knew: Ysaye, Kreisler, Rachmaninoff, Horowitz, Prokofiev, Glazunov, Heifetz, Oistrakh, Piatigorsky, Shostakovich, all in there!I learned so so much about the great musicians and composers from Milstein's era from this book: not recommended but an essential and manditory posession for any musician and especially violin players.Intriguing words indeed from the violinist's violinist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unspectacular, but very nice - -","review":"(should have had Kristan, her official translator on hand; only kidding)- she handled the conversation pretty well, actually - - - sure didn't sound like a 61 year old woman; doesn't look her age either. Four superb back-up musicians -- some wiggy guitar changes snuck-in there, good bass and subtle percussion.

If you have not had the luxury of taking a topology course during your undergraduate studies, but you need to know some topology and you have to study it by yourself, this is the book you need. It is very readable and it explains carefully every concept. However, it is just an introductory text and it contains only basic material. You don't have to invest a lot of time to study the material in this book: let's say 40-60 hours of study are enough to grasp everything. I reccomend it especially to those graduate students of applied mathematics, finance, statistics or economics, who need to use some basic result from topology in their work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great introduction","review":"Having just retired from a science career and looking at widening my maths,I have found this a great introduction to topology is just what I was after."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"I had one semester of real analysis prior to picking up this book. I found it's presentation of metric spaces OK, though Mendelson seems happy enough with abstract definitions that he doesn't always try to help with developing some intuition. This book is probably pretty hard to read if you're not familiar with metric spaces.Mendelson introduces topological spaces very well, though, with lots of examples, counterexamples, and explanations of both. It's dense reading (though not open-dense, ha-ha) but it is worth it. Definitely a good first book on topology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre to Poor Picture and Sound","review":"It's not often I write a review anywhere, but I feel the need to share my thoughts on this DVD.I'm a new fan of the stunningly beautiful Aishwarya Rai, and picked up several of the DVDs she's featured in, including this collection of Aishwara's Top 25. I've been able to directly compare the picture and sound quality of this collection to the songs on the original DVD film releases, and quite honestly, there IS no fair comparison. The picture and sound of the songs/videos in this collection are mediocre at best when compared to the original DVDs, and usually noticeably worse.Save your money for the actual full length DVD movies instead of this poor quality collection. Someone, somewhere (Eros International?) should be ashamed of themselves for the poor quality of this DVD collection, as not only is it an injustice to the consumer, but an injustice to Aishwarya Rai as well.

If you're planning on starting a WISP, this is the book for you. If you're interested in passing the CWNA exam, this book is highly recommended as supplemental reading material due to its tight focus on the ever-growing and ever-changing WISP market.

With my computer set-up, and office, the need for speaker stands was almost a necessity. Lifting the speakers and taking them a few feet from where I sit enables a higher quality of stereo sound. Plus the stand blend in well with my office decor. I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Speaker Holders, but they don't look exactly as advertized with speaker","review":"These are good looking, durable speaker stands. I haven't even used the carpet tacks that came with the stands and they are hard to knock over. I bought them along with one of the specified speakers suggested by Harmon. They are seamless when looking at them straight on, but at side and 3/4 views (pictures that were not available on line) the rear of the speaker is visible. Overall they are great stands and look good. Assembly is a little awkward because the drawings aren't that great. Go to Harmon on line to see better instructions if needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits more speakers than Amazon lists","review":"Amazon only lists a few of the speakers that fit to these stands, but in reality, they work a whole mess of them: HKS 3, HKS 4, HKS 6, HKS 9, HKTS 7, HKTS 8, HKTS 11, HKTS 14, HKTS 15, and HKTS 18.The stands do their job well, look nice, feel sturdy, and are fairly easy to set-up. Still, it couldn't have hurt if the height was adjustable and the cost was about half as much as the $130 that I spent on them.Fortunately, the height that they come in is pretty much at ear level for a standard couch and, other than the price, I'm very happy with my purchase. I'd recommend these stands to anybody who bought compatible speakers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stands for a price almost too cheap","review":"Considering the price of other stands you can buy for cheaper, you pay a little extra for these stands but they just look stunning! The wires are completely inside the stand and connect to the bottom of the speaker. This means at the top of the stand you don't have strands of wire hanging out.The base is made of Iron I believe which makes them super sturdy.

I bought this video when I first began working out but never really followed through. Later I began doing alot of Denise Austin video's, including her Yoga workouts. They were great and as I progressed I thought maybe I was ready to try Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss. I felt it would be more challenging since the Yoga instructor seemed to \\"specialize\\" in Yoga and Denise Austin does several different types of work outs. Boy was I mistaken. This video does not offer a very big variety of poses, and the poses it does have are not that challenging. There is mostly stretching and breathing. I would say this video is great for relaxation but since when does that add up to fat burning or weight loss?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unless, you are a beginner...","review":"Unless you are a beginner in yoga, don't bother with this tape.

I tried 5 different DVD player programs and never got it to work. FYI I was trying to run it on a Dell 3800. Eventually, I gave up and returned both copies"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too complicated to easily use","review":"This DVD was a disappointment. They tried to make it accessible to users of many different levels and in my opinion they made it difficult to use. They actually recommend that you watch it first before using it.

Go for Rodney Yee instead for a good (but slow) yoga workout"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good instruction but not impressed with all poses.","review":"This is a good yoga workout but I don't like it as much as the class I am taking. I don't feel refreshed after doing it as I do in class. She instructs very well and there are 4 different levels demonstrated separately or altogether. It is enjoyable. Maybe it is just the difference between live and on TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best beginning yoga DVDs out there","review":"Of all the many beginning yoga DVDs that I have tried, this one wins hands down. It is easy to follow and Suzanne is very thorough in her explanations. The 4 different instructors showing 4 levels of technique is a huge plus. In 2 months I have greatly increased my flexibility and my sense of well being. Highly recommended, esp. for beginners!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"For beginners or those less flexible this is an excellent DVD. It's one of my favorites, not too long, great instruction, instruction for different levels of fitness and overall a good, yet gentle workout....I recommend it to clients all the time and now own the DVD because my old VHS just wasn't cutting it any more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, with a reservation","review":"This video is excellent in almost every respect. Suzanne Deason is a terrific instructor, and the use of three students to show variations of the poses, including variations using blocks and a strap, is very helpful. I would give this video five stars easily if the theme of presenting variations was carried through consistently. For example, when the instructor is on her back demonstrating a twisting pose with the knees bent, the students are doing exactly the same thing and there is no explanation of how the less flexible student who can't do the pose as shown, meaning ME, can perform a suitable variation. The omission is all the more glaring because most of the rest of the time the variations are shown and clearly explained. With this caveat, however, I'd recommend this video to anyone who wants a well-balanced 45-50 minute yoga workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm impressed so far . . .","review":"The first yoga videos I did was Bryan Kest's trilogy. I have yet to get past the first one and the tape's wearing out. I wish he'd put them on DVD.I really like this Yoga Conditioning DVD so far. The ability to set it on one of 4 levels and see only that level is what DVD is all about. I hadn't worked out in months so I didn't go through the whole workout yet, but I find her voice very soothing, words very helpful, scenery not bad. The sequencing of poses is very smooth. I am impressed so far . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING...May Cause Drowsiness","review":"If I could return this DVD I would. I am a 26-year-old female who has been practicing Yoga several times a week for about 2 years. I was looking for a program that would at least make me sweat a little- and this is NOT it. I would recommend this for inflexible women over 40 and beginners only. Maybe not even beginners. I wouldn't want this program to be your initial impression of what yoga is or can be. I suggest Living Arts Total Body Workout- with individual Abs, Lower Body & Upper Body segments. I purchased Suzanne Deason's Yoga for Weight Loss because she is an instructor on my other DVD- but this is definitely not for the young and active.The scenery is beautiful, but the music is more of a lullaby. I found myself yawning several times during the seemingly endless 45-minute program. My suggestion: if you can touch your toes then PASS on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Yoga Practice!","review":"I love this Yoga Practice!

But I give it 5 stars for an excellent yoga DVD. The location is beautiful and the production quality is great. The voice over and the music are very soothing. I like the emphasis on correct form and slow movements. They show modifications for each movement. You are not likely to get an injury with this yoga DVD unlike some I have used in the past. You will tone muscles, stretch and end up with a wonderful \\"yoga high\\", very good for relaxing.If you are a more advanced Yogini this is probably not challenging enough for you.

My review is based on about 20 minutes of the 1/4 modified routine. It wasn't too hard for me, but it was too slow. It confirmed for me that my Pilates workouts are much more engaging for me. If you don't mind a very slow class than this is for you. The weight loss angle seems added on. I'm not sure that this is challenging enough to make you burn any more calories than a brisk walk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have MS but fitness freak anyway","review":"I love this workout!

When it says fat burning it means it. Definitely more value for money than this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing..and boring","review":"This work out was a pure disappointment. I do not see how any weight loss would occur with this slow paced dvd. In the yoga class I took at school I was sweating and my muscles were burning. I became more flexible and relaxed. However, with this dvd I felt nothing. In addition, the dvd menu is quite confusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"yawnga","review":"I had the same problem that a lot of others have had with this disc. Tooooo sloooowwww. I understand Yoga isn't supposed to be aerobics, a good part of it is breathing and finding that zen, but it shouldn't put you to sleep at the same time. I netflixed this, to see if it was something I wanted to buy, and I'm very happy about that. If you've never done Yoga or it's just still very very new to you then this might be your disc. If however you've attended a few classes or even worked out to 'Inhale' on O in the morning, then this isn't for you. You've already passed the level of fitness this disc caters to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for weight loss","review":"This DVD is fine for beginners who would like some stretching, but there is no weight loss aspect to it. I felt deceived by a cheap marketing ploy that appealed to my desire to lose weight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stress Relief = Weight loss","review":"My title says it all. After years of aerobics and running, at age 34 I now see a chiropractor. My muscle aches and pains revolved around STRESS mentally and physically. My chiropractor suggested YOGA as a way to \\"calm and relieve the stress\\". Each morning, I get up and do this video. This is when everyone is still sleeping and it is peaceful. This video creates a relaxing atmosphere (music and background) and explains how to fully breath throughout each move. The more you do the video, the more you learn to concentrate on your breathing, which allows you to calm yourself. The more calm you are (stress free), the less anxious you are and the less you eat (on the go or under timely situations). For those who think they will lose weight simply with the video - you won't. YOGA is only small part of a weight loss program, but this video is an excellent video with easy to learn moves (especially for beginners)."},{"rating":"2","title":"former nonbeliever, now hooked","review":"I can't recommend this program highly enough. For those of us new to yoga and for whom exercise is but a dim memory, this gently encouraging workout will have you hooked before you know it. Four levels of intensity are demonstrated for each pose. This accomplishes two things: 1) it doesn't scare people away who can't tuck their ankles behind their heads just yet, and 2) it provides incentive to strive for the next level. For those who complain that this program is just so much eyewash, please remember the three areas a well-rounded exercise regimen should address: strength training, aerobic conditioning, and flexibility. \\"Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss\\" is an energizing way to achieve the latter while being, dare I say it, ... fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great tape and a great program you can progress with!","review":"I have just completed four weeks with the Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss tape. People insist that I have lost weight --so I don't argue. I can't say I have lost weight but my body is changing and getting stronger. I feel the difference and my clothes are hanging a bit better!This tape is very well done. The setting, narration, and four levels of instructors (showing you poses simultaniously) is a big help as you progress. The camera work is flawless and you can see all the poses from a distance and then with a closer view.I do the workout once a day at least six days a week --and I am not bored yet. I progress daily and find that my flexibility and strength are increasing in a gentle manner.I have been the most unfit I have ever been after a flare up from an old accident --and can say that even if you have some challenges you'll want to try this tape!I am looking forward to trying some of her other tapes."},{"rating":"2","title":"back strengthening & flexibility","review":"I purchased this DVD to improve my flexibility and to use in conjunction with running. I am new to yoga, and not only has this video definately improved my flexibility, but it has also strengthened my back (!!!) and improved my general posture. The poses are challenging, and the workout definately strengthens if they are held correctly. If you are looking for a fast-paced yoga workout then this video is not for you (check out Rodney Yee's power yoga DVD). If you are looking for a great way to relax yourself yet still get a good workout, then this is definately worth it. Given the 4 versions of the workout ANYONE could follow this video and gradually work up to the unmodified version. My only frustration is that it only took 2 weeks for me to do this, though the unmodified version is still challenging, and Suzanne Deason's perfect poses are something to strive for. This is a great no-impact workout for off-running days."},{"rating":"2","title":"exercise and relax at the same time","review":"The tips and hints about how to think in order to get the positions right are wonderful. I felt like someone was with me saying \\"You should be able to see your left big toe.\\" It's very relaxing, even when it is somewhat difficult; I would have thought that was contradictory before using this video. The \\"front matter\\" was interesting once; I only rewound it to the beginning of the exercise portion after that (eject at the beginning of the exercise, pop it back in, and then use zero-return to come back to the starting point). The only problem is that they are exercising to the right when they tell you to go to the right, so you don't see a mirror image."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I would recomment this for anyone even if you've never done Yoga! I began this Yoga in order to help me loose weight. Another benefit I received and didn't expect was relief of some cronic pain I have had for years. I am sleeping better, have lost weight and see a definite toning of my muscles. I love that you can choose to modify your program and follow that specific person through the Yoga excercises. I began at 1/2 modified and have now moved to non-modified. The one aspect I don't like is you can't skip the advertisement at the beginning, plus you have to fast-forward through Suzanne Deason's talk every time. When your eager to begin your excercise each day, it would be better to go directly to the menu which would lead you directly into the Yoga excercise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!! Terrible","review":"I'd been doing yoga for about half a year when I bought this DVD. I wanted something that was still simple, but with some different poses. I liked the idea of the personal trainer to explain some of the poses in greater depth, never did get around to using it.Suzanne is a terrible instructor. She doesn't give clear direction on how to transition from one element of a pose to another. These are her directions to go from standing Forward bend to Victorious pose: \\"Sweep you arms forward and breathe, breath\\". She is terrible, frustrating and a waste of money in my opinoion.

Always searching for something to take me further, This video delivers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn...","review":"I bought this DVD believing by the title that it was going to be a fast-paced yoga workout that left my muscles screaming in pleasure/pain by the end. Not so. I was bored to tears, and I'm no yoga expert - I'd say that I'm moderately skilled at yoga.

I wanted to be able to practice yoga at home as well, so I bought this video. It was a horrible workout that had little variety in terms of yoga movements. If you are interested in getting a varied workout that will allow you to break a sweat, this video is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor DVD format","review":"A good work out in theory, but trying to put four different instructors on one DVD means the DVD keeps skipping, you constantly have to pick up the remote to get back to the position you were in.The positions are okay - but again they concentrate too much on giving you too many modifications rather than really explaining the stretches and breathing. Gets boring after a few times.Overall this DVD has focused too much on being interactive and giving too many choices - it messes up the format and takes away from the actual yoga."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet More Technical Difficulties....","review":"As with several other reviewers, I cannot access the Personal Instructor feature on my DVD player...it's a reasonably new and popular model, and I have never had any problem with any other DVD...extremely disappointing...UPDATE: I contacted Gaiam & they promptly send me a replacement DVD (that's the good news)...the bad news: it still doesn't work on my DVD player (a Toshiba). So be warned: All the bells & whistles won't necessarily function as advertised, and that significantly reduces the value of this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relaxing and challenging for beginners","review":"I was a little leary about taking up yoga on my own. However, that all changed when I got this home and tried it out. The next day, I was feeling muscles that I hadn't felt in a long time! Susanne Deason goes into detail to describe the positions clearly and concisely. I love the options for choosing which program you want to follow; it gives me room to develop.The program really helps develop flexibility and strength. It is also very relaxing.My only concern is that once I've \\"mastered\\" this, I'll have to shop around for something more advanced. :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I have yoga workouts that I really enjoy, but this was definitely not one of them. The workout moved much slower than others I have done; it was so boring, I could barely make it through the session once. I thought it would be more intense, given the weight loss title, but I agree with another reviewer, that must be there as a gimmick. I got rid of this tape ASAP and moved on. The only good thing about this tape was the Arizona atmosphere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too SLOW","review":"Very beginner. Slow as can be.

The movements and music go hand and hand for a relaxing, refreshing work out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conditioning for the drasticly over-weight.","review":"This DVD works well for the very very heavy or those with no physical condition what so ever. When I read the title I assumed that there was some level of \\"conditioning\\" or real physical exertion. I was mislead. I was looking for something that I could use to cross-train with my running and weight lifting and to help me lose a few pounds. In my opinion, Its a 45 minute stretching session with no real \\"conditioning\\" for those who already have some level of fitness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely slow - no losing weight here","review":"I'm sorry I bought the tape. I did it once and can't really see using it again. There is no way this is for weight loss because the dvd goes VERY SLOW so there is no way to ever get the heart going. We could do a lot more poses if we weren't waiting a minute getting from 1 pose to the next. In addition to being so slow that the heart rate can't increase, it's also doesn't use much strength because it is a beginner tape so you also aren't building more muscle which would burn more fat. Overall, this one is a waste just because you have to spend more time doing the workout while getting less poses since it moves so slow. Yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleeping Pill! Not a workout!","review":"This is the most boring, unmotivating, uninteresting workout I have ever owned, yoga or other. I am exceptionally disappointed, as it was voted best workout DVD of 2005 by Self magazine. I have only been practicing for a few weeks, having fallen in love with Fit Tv's Namaste workouts, I expected the same great music, flowing rhythm, and steady pace. Instead, this is an incredibly slow-moving, dull workout that doesn't even challenge me, a true beginner. I adore yoga, and wanted a longer, challenging workout--this is not it. I'm back to my FREE FitTv Namaste workouts, until I can find somethng better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disk problems","review":"After I got this DVD I decided to simply watch the video at first and follow along at a more opportune time. Since I was going to do this at work after work, I put the DVD into a Dell Laptop to watch. About 23 minutes into the program, it locked up the Laptop. So I decided to read some of these reviews a little closer, and I found others who have had this problem. My advice, this would have probably been a good program, but if it won't play, it's of no more use than a drink coaster. Look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"best yoga","review":"Although this is supposed to be a weight-loss yoga, it has most of the traditional poses that really stretch, strengthen, and open up the body. It is my favorite workout to do right before or after a 12 hour shift on my feet. It offers different modifications, so anyone can follow. I am not very flexible and have arthritis in my back and this just makes me feel better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Introduction To Yoga.","review":"This DVD is a great introduction to Yoga. After using the program for 2 months, I feel more relaxed, less stressed, better muscle tone overall and lost some weight. All around a good workout video."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD Skips Then Dies","review":"While the yoga instruction itself, is great and easy to follow, the DVD itself sucked.The yoga itself has many options for beginner to experienced type levels. It's easy to do even if you're uncoordinated like me. It was fun and relaxing...and if you are a very tense individual who has trouble relaxing, this may just help out.HOWEVER, the DVD stopped working about 3-8 minutes into the actual instruction. There were no scratches on the DVD before or after I opened the package. It just stopped. It skipped then froze all together.The reason I know the workout is great, is because I bought another copy from Walgreens. Hit up your local drug store or target, many other reviews note that the DVD itself is crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"yoga and weight loss","review":"my daughter used to watch it once only, but she like the programm a lot. there are a few levels, starting from beginner, so everyone can find something useful in that particular DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading...","review":"I consider myself to be a beginner when it comes to yoga practice and this workout was not challenging in terms of building fitness. I take a beginner yoga class 2x a week and this dvd is not as challenging as that. There are modified sun salutations and downward dog poses and it just isn't as gratifying as I'd hoped it to be. However, that is not to say that it doesn't offer flexibility and stretching, central components of yoga practice. This would be good for someone who is not at all familiar with yoga moves and is possibly not in great shape. With a variety of modified workouts to follow, it does take special care to address the users comfort level. It simply is not a tool for weight loss."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD does'nt work by routine is excellent","review":"I enjoy this routine very much. 40 minutes and a good stretch. However I keep having problems with the DVD. I have purchased three copies to date. Each has had problems operating in the DVD player. The last copy won't play at all. Very frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD doesn't work","review":"Please be warned - this DVD did not work on my DVD player or other players of the same make. Which is a shame really because it looks like a good workout..."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING-Only for beginners","review":"This DVD is only for beginners. I thought this DVD would at least have an advanced workout since it states that there are 4 levels. I would hardly call it weight loss, even for beginners. It is probably a good stretching routine, but not a workout, especially for people who have taken yoga before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good at first but now not challenging enough","review":"I found that this tape really was geared towards beginners. To it's credit it was useful to have multiple different versions of each move when I first started the tape. I quickly was eager for something more challenging. Good tape for stress relief but I can't honestly say that this workout is intensive enough for weight loss. Good muscle tone maybe...I recommend this for anyone just starting out and especially those with limited movement. You won't feel intimidated by the moves here and the scenery and music are really relaxing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beginners Only","review":"This was definitely a disappointment. I figured that the 4 modified levels would offer me a challenge. I did the unmodified level the entire time, and it was still a beginner level session. And don't let the title fool you. The part \\"For Weight Loss\\" is only serving to feed into the weight loss industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yoga for Weight Loss","review":"I have to say how surprised I was that I enjoyed this video as much as I have! The first time I completed the video I felt incredible! I used muscles that have been dormant for awhile. I did break a sweat, but maintained steady breathing. I was able to walk, talk, breath, etc....normally the next day which encouraged me to keep it up. Some workouts leave you feeling so sore and spent that your motivation decreases along with your drive to do it again. I loved the scenery, music and detailed instruction. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you can buy only one yoga video -","review":"you need to buy this one! Suzanne is an excellent instructor - explains movements well. This video is easy to follow - has four people working at different levels - and feels wonderful! I own it in VHS and bought the DVD version, since I'm probably wearing it out. I have been able to work at a level comfortable for me and have noticed a toning and firming."},{"rating":"2","title":"relaxing","review":"I don't know if this would make you loose a whole lot of weight if only done three or four times a week, maybe if done every day it would be noticable. You definately feel some sore muscles you never knew you had the first couple of times you use these techniques. This is a wonderful way to relieve some of those every day stresses. Burn some incense, stretch and breath. =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for weight loss","review":"This DVD is titled \\"Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss,\\" yet the instructor states in the introduction that she's never had a weight problem. So why is she teaching this routine? I found her to be very annoying. Further, the DVD formatting is really strange, where you can pick between 1/2 modified, fully modified, etc. There are just too many choices, and this makes the DVD 4 hours and 20 minutes, but it's the same routine about 4 different ways. On the other hand, I tried crunch yoga (Joy of Yoga, and Fat Burning Yoga) and really enjoyed both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective disk -- don't bother with this one","review":"Do not waste your time ordering this product.

This is not it. Very slow moving and boring - definitely not fat burning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"Maybe I just misinterpreted what this DVD was about, but I thought the title and information was very misleading. I'm only 16 and I'm not a hardcore yogi, but I found this DVD way too easy to be anything related to weight loss.Pros:-Mentally, it prepares you for lossing weight (I guess).-The strecthes felt good after doing the Crunch The Perfect Yoga Workout DVD.Cons:-Physically, it's no where near helping you actually loss weight.-Too Spiritual.-I actually prefer the gym or in a room setting because I can relate better to that than someone who gets to be out in the wild, while I'm stuck in a room.-Too easy-The streches that actually felt really good weren't held long enough for me.It's really about personal preference and how physically fit you are. If you aren't very flexible and are just starting yoga, get this dvd. For a step up try Crunch The Perfect Yoga DVD instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very Conditioning or for Weight Loss -","review":"I also bought this DVD for the words \\"weight loss\\" and \\"conditioning\\". I am a novice at Yoga, and own 2 Yoga tapes. The tapes I own are much better and advanced than this DVD. I have read about Yoga that is a bit more of a workout than just for relaxing, and was hoping this DVD would fit the bill... not so... too easy... not any challenging poses... They should state this is for day 1 beginners. If you have done any Yoga at all this has the great potential to disappoint you as it did me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only good if you are an absolute beginner","review":"I am not experienced in Yoga. Although I work out regularly, I have only attended about 8 yoga classes and I only started about 9 months ago. Therefore, I assumed that I was a beginner. However, I would say that this DVD is only for people who have NEVER been to a yoga class and probably have not exercised much at all. Overall, I found the program pleasant and they did have some good tips and reminders within the workout, however, I did not get a good workout--just a good mid-day stretch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"This is my first yoga experience and I selected Suzanne Deeson's.I am thrilled. I just received the tape yesterday and completed the workoutlast night and again this morning - absolutely oustanding. The scenery is indeed breathtaking. I love the varying sizes of the instrucors and could adjust based on my level of flexibility. I am online now looking for other yoga tapes from her. I found the yoga training calming and relaxing - the pace was perfect. I loved the tempo and also her voice. I am a Motivational Speaker and Business Etiquette Tainer and this is outstanding. Tremendous job! Great for beginners or people who just want to achieve peace and balance in their lives. Ta-ta."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relaxing and Energizing","review":"I'm not new to yoga - I've taken some classes and read some books over the past several years, however, I've never felt so calm, energized and spiritually connected as I do once I've finished Suzanne Deason's Yoga Conditioning workout DVD. I love the way she focuses on breathing and awareness and gives very good instruction throughout the video. It seems that a lot of the reviewers think this DVD moves too slowly, but I love that it does move in a relaxed way so that I have more time to think about what I'm doing and become more aware of body alignment and breathing. To me, this is what yoga is about. In only a month, I can already see a difference in my body - everything seems to be flowing better, my legs seem longer, and I feel more elegant and poised. Susanne Deason is in stark contrast to say, Denise Austin, who moves frenetically through each posture with little or no instruction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yoga Conditioning For Weightloss","review":"This is the first Yoga tape I have ever bought. Today I own several yoga tapes and I owe my new interst in yoga to Yoga Conditioning For Weightloss. Suzanne Deason's introduction that explains reasons why yoga should be a part of my life really motivates me to do the tape.Each time I complete the tape I can feel the effects of the relaxation yoga is supposed to bring to your life.Even though I have other yoga tapes and prefer high intensity cardio, I still do this tape every couple of weeks as a refresher course on how to do the yoga poses correctly and to get that feeling you are supposed to get after a yoga class.Suzanne Deason is a very good instructor and makes it easy to follow the lesson. Her explanations of the benefits of the yoga poses is very motivating."},{"rating":"2","title":"almost great","review":"As a heavier yog-ette, this is an excellent video- the poses are challenging but not held so long that you have to give in. 2 of the demonstrators are more round bodied and make the tape much more encouraging. The setting and music are very soothing...BUT....it SKIPS all over the place. I know that it isnt my player because its new. When the dvd switches between instructors it often skips or jumps back to 15 minutes earlier. Very annoying to interrupt practice to find remote, find place, etc. I would highly suggest this on VHS"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yoga Conditioning For Weight Loss DVD Review","review":"As is always the case, I was very pleased with my purchase of the DVD from Amazon, Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss. It arrived in a timely manner, was reasonably priced, and the video is extremely well done. The description that I had read was exactly what I got. I will continue in the future to order from Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Suzanne Deason","review":"I've had this DVD for a few years and I always go back to it. I will never be as flexible as I want to be, but this DVD is very helpful for those of us who wish we could do yoga beautifully and know we can't. I want to feel that I am doing this correctly and working on my flexibility, very important as I hit my 50's! Suzanne is a fantastic teacher, everytime she repeats an instruction it sounds as if it is her first time explaining it. There is a lot of attention to detail that other yoga DVD's lack. I always do the fully modified and yet I feel fully stretched out and calm after this DVD. It is a slow moving workout but not boring, I'm so focused on breathing correctly and working on my form I find myself fully involved. I really don't care about the weight loss, I have other DVDs for this, but if this can teach me balance inside and out then that alone is worth the $ I paid. I feel absolutely relaxed and a real sense of well being after doing this work out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Beginners!","review":"This really is a good tape for beginners. I even got my mom to try it with me. I've tried a few tapes, and I like this one because because it offers 4 different modified versions of the poses for people who may not be very flexible. I'm not too sure how well it suits for weight loss, but the routine will definitely inspire you to continue with yoga. Overall, I felt really good after completing this routine. Lots of leg strengthening excercises...a nice change if you don't want to do the same workout everyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tool for weight loss","review":"While this video alone will not enable you to lose weight, it is however a wonderful tool to help you on your weight loss journey. My favorite part of this DVD is that it has 4 different levels of programs for you to do as you progress in your fitness level. This was my first yoga DVD so I also benefitted from help icons that pop up for you to use.The best thing about the DVD is that it helps me to feel energized, centered and balanced. I do break a sweat but only when doing some of the more advanced routines. You will need to use some thing else for aerobic exercise though.Also, if you are a beginner you will need to buy foam bricks, a mat and a strap.Still this remains on of my fave yoga dvds"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not trendy","review":"I watched and did the program presented in this video for the first time yesterday and really enjoyed it. I read a lot of the reviews here and so many complain about the yoga being slow and easy. I think that if one really works in the poses and remains active in them then this is a great workout. If you do not have the patience or concentration for that, then buy Buns of Steel. Yoga requires patience. Plus Suzanne Deason was trained in Iyengar Yoga which is not all about violent movements and sweating and straining and...well maybe it is not trendy. But yoga should not be about that anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD - not advanced","review":"I did know know about Suzanne Deason before purchasing this DVD, but picked it because I wanted a general yoga DVD and this one had pretty good reviews. She is not annoying at all. You can choose to watch the DVD at several different experience levels. This is definitely not for advanced yoga practitioners, but it includes all of the basic poses, and you will definitely be feeling good when the DVD is over. The beautiful scenery in the background is calming and not cheesy at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"painstakingly slow [and boring]","review":"i have only been going to yoga class for a couple of months, so when i decided to buy a yoga tape to practice at home i thought i should get a beginners tape. unfortunately this video is not what i was looking for.the set and music are nice, and the multi-angle feature is fantastic. the actual routine however, was disappointing. i didn't even break a sweat! it's excruciatingly gentle and much too short. i kept waiting for the pace to pick up or for the poses to get harder, but it never happened.i am not in the greatest of shapes myself and have just recently started to excercise regularly and still after finishing the routine i was ready for more. i think this video might be good for people who are overweight, much older, or who have NEVER exercised at all. otherwise, it's just a really long warm-up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, some pros and cons","review":"Pros:Good lead instructorYou can choose from different levels and different instructorsGentle, beginners routineCalming music and narriative voice, beautiful sceneryvery relaxingGood for off-days, when recovering from illness, or need to de-stress.Instructors have different body types, not all are sinewy and lean.Cons:Not really much of a workout, don't see where the weight loss comes in unless you have never done any kind of exercise previously.Can't skip the monologue or ads at the beginning of the DVDNothing really new in this workout, and missing a few moves I really like (DF Dog, tree, etc.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Yoga DvD","review":"I have both the book and Dvd to this series.

It is very soothing and beautiful.Included on the dvd is a great interview with Suzanne. She talks about her family's struggle with weight loss. Her own views on weight managment and of yoga.This dvd is not designed to help you loose weight. It is designed for people that are overweight or even out of shape a great first step towards exercise.

But, other then the fact that the life of this phone seems to only last 2-3 years all the futures are pretty awesome. You can pick songs for different numbers so you know who's calling and the intercom system is really cool...you don't have to yell or run up and down stairs to talk to someone at the other end of the house.

It works great. I get about 4 miles on a charge, and can charge it up at work, if I need to go any extra distance home. It takes me about 20 minutes to drive 2 miles, with some stopping at lights or slowing for traffic and pedestrians. I ride it both on the sidewalk and on the street, but you have to check with your local laws to see if it is legal on the sidewalk. Everyone asks me about it, and I recommend it to everyone.

The battery and charger did not work properly the moment I got it. Technical support replaced both of them within the warranty period ... and the replacements also did not work! It looks cool, and is fun to use, for about 5-7 minutes that the unit actually worked! It is also very time-consuming to remove all the screws and the deck to actually change the motor or see what's going on. This electric vehicle should be built with TWO battery packs for an adult to actually use it, and needs a re-design to make it far easier to get to the battery pack and motor and other parts.

I have bought 2 of these guns in the last 3 years to replace senco's and they are simply the best...EXCEPT They jam when using 8d's (2-3/8\\" nails). What happens is the nail track is too big for the 8d's and eventually they ride up on each other and don't feed properly after you have shot a couple boxes of them. This is a common problem with most framing guns because of the different diameter nails they shoot. If you only feed it one rack of 8d nails at a time (it holds 2) then the jamming is not so bad. The NR83 shoots 8d's better but it doesn't have the punch of the NR90, nothing does. If you plan on doing some heavy duty framing get the NR90. If you are an occasional or light duty user or a hobiest get the NR83 but get a Hitachi."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Nailer Would Not Feed Properly","review":"This nailer would not feed 16d nails reliably so had to return it.

It looked as if it's new and payed very well. I'm very satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Complete Waste of Time","review":"I thought this was an amusing way to spend an hour and a half. It was by no means the best movie I've ever seen, but I thought it was cute and carried a good message about the priorities in our lives!! The scenery is great and the supporting cast created many laughs amongst my friends and I."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent Beginning, Quickly Became Horrible...","review":"My first thought was that this movie had potential and it would be at least decent. The start of the movie was decent but it quickly became what I call a DISNEY movie - corny, predictable, and embarassing to watch and...predictable and corny, oh wait I said that but it deserves to be mentioned twice.Bad movie, horribly disappointing. DISNEY almost Hallmark quality movie. Disney should stick to animated movies, they're much better, just want to add that even though it doesn't relate to this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"I love romantic comedies and traveling, but this movie missed the mark completely. The jokes just weren't funny. The premise and storyline was corny and a bit ridiculous. Its only redeeming quality was the gorgeous scenery, that being said, it would have been more enjoyable on mute. What a disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful scenery, crassy storyline.","review":"This movie features some breathtaking and beautiful scenery of Greece. Both of the ancient ruins and the current times. The premise of the film, a down on her luck nerdy history buff who suffers while taking more shallow tourists on tours could be funny, except that the movie starts to get crassy. The love stories are shallow and the comedy is almost funny. But not quite. There are worse movies out there, but also better ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patheticos","review":"One of the worst movies I have ever watched. Not worth the $6 I paid for it!. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"The writing is so bad, this movie is unwatchable. I wanted to like it for the cast, but the dialogue was painful."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Life In Ruins","review":"Another of Nia's excellent films! Actually love My Big Fat Greek Wedding more but it's still a keeper! Our heroine is a tour guide in her much beloved Greece while awaiting a job as a teacher at college. She's under paid, over-worked, gets the gnarly end of the stuff at work and mostly miserable but she tries to put on a brave face despite all of that. When her tour group and she come together eventually both grow, love ensues and a warm fuzzy feeling blankets all. Above all it is filmed in Greece! How great is THAT!?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining.....loved the scenery.","review":"Cute movie. I like Nia Vardalos, she's been entertaining in everything I've seen her in. Though she's not a dramatic actress it's obvious she likes what she does. I recommend the movie if you want something lighthearted and visually inspiring. After living in Greece I can completely relate to some of the issues experienced, it makes me miss it. The movie is predictable, \\"gal is uninspired, gal meets guy she can't stand, their differences bring them together, OPA!\\" I do intend to buy this once it's available, it's always nice to have a feel good movie around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely a chick flick but....","review":"Yes this movie is a chick flick as it is 1 of 1000's of romantic comedies out there. But if you can look past that there are some positives to point out. The acting of Nia Vardalos was great and I think better than her acting in My Big Fat Greek Wedding (which was very good). The movie was pretty entertaining with an intriguing storyline. The camera work was outstanding as the scenes in Greece were visually stunning. The movie is sweet, very funny, cute and entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much fun, reminded of my Greece trip!","review":"Nia Vardalos the star of My Big Fat Greek Wedding was incredible in this movie and learned many lessons about love and live with the help of her tour bus driver and a little old man played by Richard Dryfuss.If you haven't been to Greece and have dreamed of going, watch this movie. I needed a good laugh and it delivered. Reminded me of my days working in travel and being an escort along with my husband on a Med cruise.Photography incredible, and secondary characters, amazing which made for a very entertaining movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, feel good film","review":"Most of the time I post reviews, it's to express my disgust with the movie I saw, but this time 'round, I want to praise it. 'My Life In Ruins' was a very pleasant surprise. I missed it in theaters and based on the reviews I saw then, I thought nothing of it, but when I rented it recently, I was proven wrong. Nia Vardalos is a wonderfully likable actress and this movie was full of good humor and beautiful locals that were greatly enhanced through Blu Ray technology. It was a cute, uplifting story that leaves you with a song in your heart and a real desire to see Greece for yourself. Especially the men! Yum!Ms. Vardalos is still, I think, one of the most under-appreciated actresses/writers in the biz today. So far, I've enjoyed every project she's been a part of and hope there will be more to come from this funny lady."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought for Wife for Christmas","review":"Wife said it was a very poor movie. Heard that they actually visited some of the places, and my wife said that some of the scenes and backgrounds looked rather fake, especially in blue ray.

It fell well short.This is a no buy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"Yes, the Greek locations are beautiful. Yes, Richard Dreyfuss is a wonderful actor.This is a lousy movie in two parts. The first part is dumb, low brow humor with all the tourists portrayed as ridiculous cartoons. Then the movie shifts gears to become a romantic comedy. Ehhh.The Theme of the movie, the lesson that the \\"heroine\\" has to learn, is that if she will only lower / dumb down her standards, success will be hers. Ehhh.Skip this one and get a Greek travelogue DVD and a *good* Richard Dreyfuss movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"....in ruins....","review":"I wanted to like this movie but it just wasn't all that to me. There was too much CRAP for me to find it worth watching. Nia Vardalos' acting was good as usual but the content was stupid. The main character is told the whole movie she needs to \\"BE\\" with someone...it will make her feel better. There is a scene where another character is participating in a threesome. This 'chick flick' doesn't qualify for me!'"},{"rating":"1","title":"What??","review":"Based on other people's reviews, I rented this movie. I couldn't even finish it. It's that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING","review":"Was a big fan of MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING and ond of Nia Vardalos, and was expecting something similar. However, I was very disappointed. It is a badly acted and predictable comedy that isn't particularly funny. Even the greek guy doesnt look as hot in the movie as he does in the picture on the cover of the DVD box! Don't bother seeing this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hackneyed","review":"Blerg.I love the actress so I was suprised to come across this movie as I didn't even hear that it came out.

It started out painfully slow, and I was worried that it was going to be totally lame, but it gradually, and steadily picked up, making me laugh out loud, and making me very glad that I arrived too late to get a decent seat in the movie I had originally planned to see. Richard Dreyfuss was the real joy of this movie, and I'm going to buy the movie so I can drool over Alexis Georgoulis. Am hoping he makes some more English-language movies.The cinamatography showed off the lush, beautiful scenery of Greece, and made me want to go straight home and book a trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightfully fun tour of Greece","review":"My Life in Ruins gives a delightful tour of Greece with some lessons in human relationships."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a nice surprise!","review":"I purchased this Blu-Ray because I have been a Richard Dreyfuss fan for sometime now. I had seen the movie trailer before and it seemed like a decent movie but I wasn't to sure about it. I had to add it to my Dreyfuss collection though! I was pleasantly surprised by how good this movie is. It was funny, sad and even had a couple very heartfelt scenes. I loved Nia Vardalos and how her character evolved through the movie with the help of Irv (Richard Dreyfuss) and the bus driver (Alexis Georgoulis)and the rest of her tour group. The Blu-Ray quality was fantastic and the beautiful scenery from Greece just pushed that even higher! So if want some laughs, beautiful scenery and a nice romance thrown in there My Life in Ruins has it all. Definately a feel good movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is terrible","review":"I cant believe I wasted my money on this. This movies is so bad it is unbelievable.

The actors were very good"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story, Greater Scenery","review":"Let me start by saying that even if you see this movie and do not like the story, the scenery alone is awesome and worth the purchase price. You get to see many tourist areas of Greece without the cost of a plane ticket to go to Greece (although, I definitely would love to be in Greece and see these places in person). I think the story line is great too. Nia Vardalos has certain aspirations and has a different perspective of how she viewed people and just life in general. She was a tourist guide and was simply burned out. With the help of some of the tourists more specifically Richard Dreyfuss, she begins to see life differently. As a result, she had also found love. If you are considering this movie, definitely give it a try. As I mentioned earlier, even if you feel the story was horrible, you will not be disappointed by the scenery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amusing","review":"It's a fun, lighthearted movie, the scenery is beautiful, and the actors are great.

I don't watch many movies, but after watching the trailer on this decided to rent it. I really enjoyed it, I laughed out loud. Does it measure up to Big Fat Greek Wedding? Yes I think it did in many ways. I think there are those who think it doesn't, because we weren't familiar with Nia Vardalos in Greek Wedding, we weren't expecting to enjoy it as much as we did, there was more of the surprise factor-if you were looking for that you will be somewhat disappointed.This movie, as Greek Wedding, is full of quirky characters, humor, scenes that will touch your heart and situations almost anyone can relate with. And it added the bonus of a peek into the flavor of Greece almost as if you are there as a tourist.I don't rent many movies and purchase even less, but I think I will buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fun","review":"I enjoyed this movie! Maybe not as well-rounded as my Big Fat Greek Wedding, but it's still a sweet, charming movie. Very feel-good and romantic with colorful and endearing characters. Not too deep, just good fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great \\"chick\\" flick","review":"My life in Ruins is another feel-good, warm hearted, \\"chick flick\\" from Nia Vardalos of My Big Fat Greek Wedding. Richard Dreyfuss plays a \\"wise\\" man that that mentors Nia with a great sense of humor despite suffering from the loss of his wife. Nia is an unhappy tour guide with a less than 4-star tour company dreaming of teaching people about the history of civialzation...from the Greek point of view. And she is failing! Well, Dreyfuss shows her how to \\"spin\\" history to make it more appealing to everyone and how to...well, just watch the movie! It's great for those rainy days or when you want a movie that will leave you smiling!

It was just as I'd hoped. It included most of her most popular and famous images, and gave insight into her process and the road she has taken in her career. It's an interesting companion to her latest book.

Not a tutorial and definitely not for someone just learning programming or for someone looking for specifics of a particular compiler. I give it four stars instead of five only because it would benefit from more code examples - in fact there are almost none. But the language rules are quite completely and concisely described.

Rasmussen does an excellent job of describing the material culture, ways and beliefs of the Eskimos (now called Inuit) he encountered across the Arctic from Greenland to Alaska, at a time when they were still living the nomadic life of hunter-gatherers, as they had done for centuries before. Rasmussen's descriptions are detailed, his documentation of songs and poems that might otherwise have been lost are valuable, as are his records of the differences among subgroups he encountered. In addition, the author's respect for the people who are his research subjects is evident throughout this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Grief","review":"I've read a lot of books on publishing but this has to be the worst book of all.

There are much better books on the market then this piece of gobbilty-goop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent","review":"I think I would have liked this book if I had read it when I was 14 or 15. Sweet, dreamy, simplistic. But I am much older and I was struck by the inconsistencies: The young man with turberculosis who hikes around kissing people; the garden 'destroyed by the storm and swamped by the waves' that was completely restored and in full bloom a couple of months later - I lost track of how many black pines these people planted in that garden but it must have looked like a forest; the empty beach with an abandoned plastic shovel (in 1938??). Then there was the secretive, silent, and very private gardener who suddenly talked and talked.I was disappointed in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some minor quibbles","review":"I enjoyed reading this book for our couples book club. It was an agreable little story, stretched a bit thin. It might do for an initial introduction to life in Japan, but I agree with other reviewers that there are many other more detailed books that do a more interesting job. I usually appreciate books that purport to explore the inner spirit, so I was disappointed that the young protagonist, neither by action nor thought, convinced me of the attraction he had for the two older people. The natural setting, yes, but not the people. The \\"crisp, clean writing\\" (as advertised on the cover)struck me as merely simple. It worries me that slim books of this sort might pass as spiritual books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful surprise","review":"This book has been on my shelf for a long time. I don't remember when I got it, but somehow, each time I browse I passed it by, thinking I'd read it. Luckily, I picked it up the other day, and now can't put it down. The characters are lovingly and carefully crafted as is the story. the tale of a young Chinese man who is sent to a small village in Japan to recover. Set in ww2, the tensions between Chinese and Japanese enter into the story, as does love and infidelity. The writer weaves together the angst of illness, personal loss, war, with the lovely moments and relationships that make life joyfill without ever falling into the trap of cliche or false aentiment. I will buy more of Tsukiyama's books, and this time I'll read them right away."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply perfect","review":"simply perfect. one cannot help but be moved by the honesty and humility demonstrated by the characters in this beautiful novel - buy it for yourself, then buy many more copies for your friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top 5","review":"This book was by far one of THE greatest books that I have ever read. It is a beautiful tale about one young man (Stephan) and his blossoming relationship among two other people (Matsu and Sachi). This is a tale about life about learning, about nature and love for things the way they are on the inside.This is deffinately in my top five favorite books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A graceful read","review":"I would recommend this book for those who enjoy a feeling of calm, and yet the book has enough of an action thread to hold your interest through the end.

A very graceful read--one worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read","review":"This book takes you on a trip through a time and place many of us will never be able to forget. Wonderful and refreshing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Samurai's Garden","review":"I was told about this novel by a fellow passenger on an airplane. I wrote down the title and bought it later when I returned home. I absolutely enjoyed reading this book. It gave me insight to the importance of the gardens and what peace the gardens gave several key characters. I have recently read Molakai and how the Hawaiian lepers were treated. This book also described how the Japanese treated lepers. It also showed how the development of the characters was simply and beautifully done and the landscape of how the war developed between China and Japan. I came away wanted to read more of this author's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leprosy and Acceptance","review":"What a fabulous writer who never disappoints.

It's a little too slow paced but the quiet elegance with which Tsukiyama describes the characters and their respective love stories is breathtaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favorites.","review":"I really loved this book. I loved it so much that I bought copies for family members to read. I was really touched by the theme of inner strength and hidden strength. The devolopment of the characters has grace and beauty to it. The idea that beauty is not on the outside, but on the inside is an important theme in literature. I would recommend this book to any person who wants to think about the meaning of life and the values we place on beauty and accomplishment in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"She skillfully paints a visual portrait of time and place","review":"Although the book is set in a rural Japanese village during the late 1930's, it still paints a portrait of Japan as it exists today in many rural areas. I was able to feel the places she writes about, to smell the sea, to taste the food, to feel the soft wood as I took a hot bath in the outside garden. It is a poignant, beautifully written story about strength in the face of adversity and an enduring love. I would recommend it to anyone as a book to remember always."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious & Unbelievable","review":"It took me a week to get only halfway through a very thin book.

I learned so much more about the meaning of peace and serenity from Matsu and Sachi. Acceptance and the ability to pull on inner strength that most of us don't realize we possess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fleshed-out short story; not at all satisfying","review":"I loved the first thirty or so pages of this novel because it set the tone for a beautiful story, then went absolutely nowhere. World War II was the background, but other than a few radio reports and letters from home, it had no impact on the story. Other than the narrator's girlfriend's father rejecting him because he is Chinese, race is neglected as a theme when it could have played a much larger role in the story. Leprosy is a good plot twist because it makes us think about outer v. inner beauty. The garden was an excellent symbol of life, but it's difficult to set a 200 page novel around a garden, especially in this novel.I agree with another reviewer who thought this was a short story that some editor thought should become a novel. Tsukiyama should have concentrated on leprosy and the garden, and left the other elements of war and racism out completely, because they were more of a distraction than real issues in the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing special","review":"I read \\"Women of the Silk\\" before reading this book, both for my english classes, and I found both books quite ordinary. In my opinion, Gail Tsukiyama can write successful children books as her level of intelligence and talent is not enough for intelligent and well-read readers. The characters in both novels were extremely flat as they have no flaws, which was unacceptable for a reader who can discriminate good work from bad one. Also Matsu's character was contradicting itself as he suddenly become a very talkative person.Shortly, if you like reading Daniel Steel, you can enjoy this book, too. But if you think your sophistication level is higher, then that's definetely not a good choice for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"calming story","review":"I found this book soothing and calming. Stephen, while at his Grandfathers home recovering, learned much philosphy about life from the caretaker, Matsu. The lives of the people involved in the story wind and turn, giving Stephen many thoughts that relate to his own life's problems. The philosophy can relate to many of our own personal lives. In my opinion this was a beautiful, well thought out book, and it has prompted me to order all 4 of the writer, Tsukiyama's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"good, not great","review":"Reading the book was like taking a slow walk in the garden, pleasant but not over taxing. Bookclub gave a thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely book!","review":"I have been a big fan of Gail Tsukiyama's work ever since I discovered her book, Women of the Silk..I am currently reading Night of Many Dreams and had finished The Samurai's Garden just last month. Gail writes with such exquisite detail that you feel as if you are within the pages of the book..her writing brings your imagination to life and you literally can't put the book down. The Samurai's Garden is a wonderful tale of love, sacrifice and dedication..It has moment's of deep despair and surprises within the story that will leave you tingling! It's a great read and highly recommended! All of her books are wonderful! This is an author of great talent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good premise but disappointing execution","review":"I was disappointed in this book. Its plot sounds so promising--a Chinese man with tuberculosis recuperating at his father's summer home in Japan, and the relationships he develops there. It seemed that a lot more could have been done with this in the hands of a more talented author. The writing was simple and plain but not artistic, and the characters didn't come across as believable to me. People who had spent their whole lives hiding from the world suddenly spilling their stories to an outsider? The main character was very passive about his own life but quite nosy about others. I am surprised at the number of good reviews this book received."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and Moving","review":"This book is beautifully written. The characters are complex and drawn with such skill and intimacy that by the end of the book you feel as though you have truly known each one of them and seen into a piece of their world. Moving and poignant, but not dark, the story and the characters will stay with you long after you finish the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all-time favorite books!","review":"A wonderfully written book. Characters are very well developed. An excellent story to tell. One cannot help but feel uplifted by the characters in the story. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Literature Lite","review":"It was a mindless, plodding book, fun, lite, good for summer at the camp if you don't want excitement and suspense. Some of the writing was ok, other parts very dull. The plot leaves much to be desired, motivations are weak. Characters are wooden and never clearly seen. At times the plot even contradicts itself. Yet, reading this is like walking through a garden looking at flowers, it's fun for a while but then you crave looking at people and eating a hearty lunch. Unfortunately this book doesn't deliver the latter two experiences."},{"rating":"1","title":"the samurai's garden","review":"I picked up the book because I was quite impressed with the rating. Now, I cannot help but assume they were scored by Ms. Tsukiyama's relatives or friends because this storyline was so shallow, it was painful to read. Believe me I tried but I gave up when the characters' conversations (with limited language skills) became unbelievable. Ms. Tsukiyama should have consulted expert linguists or translators prior to submitting her work. Throwing basic Japanese words didn't improve but worsened. By the time I read two mispelled words in the beginning of the book(genken for genkan, and dannasama instead of danasama) I knew this was heading in a bad direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dreamy coming of age novel","review":"The book describes a year in a young man's life as he encounters the perplexing unfolding web of three other lives in Japan in the late 1930's. The story has much to say between the lines if one ponders the issues. It creates a peaceful delicate atmosphere - very much like the garden of the title of the book. In my opinion it was poorly written in a sharp directed fashion from a young man's viewpoint lacking in poetic depth and substance. I cannot recommend the book unless you have plenty of time on your hands with the ultimate goal of reading everything that ever gets published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is This All?","review":"I can't review \\"The Samurai's Garden\\" really - because what I received was only an extensive summary of the story - not the the real and entire bood - which I was notified later was not available!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tranquility within turbulence.","review":"Even at the start of the book, it was simple to slip into the tale. There are no great action scenes, no dramatic entrances, just the calm events of lives mingling and friendships being built. Even so, there are events that will surprise you, and scenes that will touch you. I was taken to a time of Japan and China at war. At the same time, these events were only a backdrop for the story set to develop. The characters were all quite likeable, and had no trouble expanding as the story progressed. I also gained a deeper understanding of Japanese honor. An excellent lesson from a cultural standpoint, the book kept me interested and wishing for more. At the end, I was reminded of a similar experience I had when I was on exchange for two weeks in Japan. I wish there were a sequal to this story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"About the fragility and beauty of life","review":"This story, written by an Asian American, takes place during the early part of World War II, and begin shortly before the Japanese invasion of China. It is about a young man's journey from being sick with TB in Hong Kong to recuperation and recovery in a small Japanese island village, under the care of Matzu, a master gardener and caretaker at the beach house. It's a very simple story about how the gardener and the ordinary people in the village interact with the young man as he slowly gets better. The story is not about any big events, just about small but significant things that happen. It is about the things that teach both the sick man and the reader about the fragility and beauty of life. It's a simple, easy-going and rewarding read, and a beautiful story, and I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must to read","review":"A well written novel of life that brings home the importance of good values, family, & friendship.

I happen to love the old soul. The songs are just as we remembered."},{"rating":"2","title":"A find","review":"Although the Velvet Underground lost something tremendous when John Cale left the band in 1968, Cale's solo work has been somewhat spotty. However, he hit his stride when he joined Island Records in the mid 1970's, as this 2 CD set demonstrates. This generous set includes the whole of the albums \\"Fear\\", \\"Slow Dazzle\\" and \\"Helen of Troy\\", as well as a few extra tracks. Standouts include \\"Fear Is A Man's Best Friend\\" and Jonathan Richman's \\"Pablo Picasso\\". Also great is Phil Manzanera's guitar playing which ranges from wild (\\"Gun\\", manipulated by Brian Eno) to elegantly understated (\\"The Man Who Couldn't Afford To Orgy\\", featuring Judy Nylon's breathily horny asides). Slight complaint: things drag a bit on the second disk. Listen for Richard Thompson playing on \\"Momamma Scuba\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bargain!","review":"This 2 CD set containing the complete John Cale Island Records releases; together with a handful of great bonus tracks, is really a bargain.His three Island albums are all classics, each containing several Cale Classics. To mention just a few tracks from each album, I would bring out \\"Buffalo Ballet\\" and \\"Ship of Fools\\" (Fear), \\"Mr Wilson\\" and \\"Guts\\" (Slow Dazzle) and \\"Cable Hougue\\" and \\"I Keep a Close Watch\\" ( Helen of Troy)Among the bonus tracks \\"All I Want is You\\" and \\"Bamboo Floor\\" from the \\"Slow Dazzle\\" sessions are gems that had deserved inclusion in the first place.The 24 pages booklet with a fine essay by Ben Edmonds contains interesting recollections from the various sessions and informative notes on many tracks.Simply a great buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very inconsistent","review":"I'm a huge fan of about three of the songs on this collection, but was very disappointed with much of the rest. I'm very familiar with Cale's VU catalog, and some of this later work, but this mid-70s period was largely a mystery to me. There's no debating Cale's talent or passion for his music, but there are about a dozen tracks on this compilation that sound like b-sides that were just added to their respective albums as an afterthought. \\"Ski Patrol\\" for instance is just an awful song. That said, \\"Pablo Picasso\\", \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" and a few others are just brilliant performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"super","review":"I think this is Weller's finest solo album.

Back to the drawing board methinks!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy Heart","review":"With a heavy heart I have to say Heavy Soul is Paul Weller's worst solo album to date. There is not a single song that has anywhere near the magic of his first two solo albums. The songs seem stuck in the same groove and never break beyond the mundane.The best tracks are Up In Suzes' Room and I Should Have Been There To Inspire You. Better Paul Weller recommendations are Paul Weller (1992) or Wild Wood (1993).[DW]"},{"rating":"2","title":"He's the UK's Neil Young, he is.","review":"Weller's ability to keep his fans on their toes is evident here. Great guitar, refreshingly so from the hippy-trippy tone of his last two efforts. Recorded whilst separated from his wife and kids, Weller focuses his isolation and frustration into well crafted songs that are simple without being vague. And given some of the songs' apparent gloom, there is still hope in Weller's voice that comes with being an old revolutionary. A heavy soul indeed, but worth repeated listens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy Music","review":"After a short hiatus, Paul Weller is once again making great music (and very little filler to boot!). Heavy Soul is the more rocking side of the Weller catalogue. \\"Up in Suze's Room,\\" \\"Heavy Soul Pt. 1,\\" \\"Mermaids,\\" \\"Friday Street\\"... all sorta-psychedelic-soulful rock. Not to mention the soulful confessional \\"I Should've Been There to Inspire You.\\" Simply a breathtaking song. There is a small amount of imperfection you need to endure too, but it's a VERY small amount (\\"Science,\\" and \\"Golden Sands\\"), but then again, he IS human!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great oil medium","review":"M Graham produces quality oil mediums for painting.

We listened to the stories all about the Hapsburgs entanglement with the Austrian/Romanian/Spanish dynasties. The heirs to the Romanian throne actually live in NYC and are related in the Hapsburgs. the last Queen Marie talked about in the book died in 1939--just before the Nazis envasion. It made our trip even more enjoyable to know some of the history. It helped with the smaller countries around that area and how they still feud till this day.

I haven't heard this performance for decades (it's on LP) and I eventually replaced it with the Hogwood one that uses the boy trebles and I found I preferred the Hogwood. But I'm sure I would still enjoy Mackerras's performance if I could bother with all the kerfuffle it takes to play LPs. The Hogwood is also on LP so I need to replace that too.

(wtf with that name anyway. jiggy? do they specialize in Will Smith merch or what?) the email says that if i have any questions about my order to email them. so i politely inquire why the T-shirt i received has some printing on the back because the shirt i ordered wasn't supposed to have anything on the back. a month goes by and no response from the JiggyPeople. why send a customer an email asking if they have any questions about their order and then not respond when they email you with a question about their order? do you see the irony here, Jiggy? so anyway, next time i need a t-shirt, i'll get it from one of the thousand or so other places i could choose from."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best","review":"None of the other Flower Kings albums grabbed me like this one. Now I can't stop listening to it. Great vocal work by Stolt and Froberg, great instrumental work by all. This album has the majestic, the mellow, and everywhere inbetween structured in a way that feels natural and inevitable. I recommend it to all fans of neo prog and all Yes fans who are out there wondering what happened to the 70s progressive movement. Catch them live in concert if you can - I did and was not disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful prog.","review":"The Flower Kings do the oldschool prog thing like nobody else. I love Neal Morse's work, but these guys are just on a whole other level. Beautiful melodies, mixed with amazing musicianship, and tons of different styles. Also, Roine Stolt is my favorite guitarist these days. He should be on every Guitar World list, even though he's not.Highlights: \\"I Am the Sun\\" (1 & 2), \\"A King's Prayer\\", \\"Rumble Fish Twist\\"If you miss the glory days of Yes and Genesis, check this out right away. In fact, they even put those great bands to shame (yes, it's true). Roine Stolt is the man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neo-prog at its best","review":"Neo-prog fans who were around to be fans of Prog the first time around tend to compare bands to Yes, Genesis, ELP etc. The Flower Kings pay their respects to those bands in many ways. There are elements of Zappa, Yes, Genesis, and King Crimson on \\"Space Revolver\\".To me, prog is simply about good musical passages, in most cases, rock with classical influences. \\"Space Revolver\\" has a number of good passages. The first few minutes of I Am the Sun rank up there (IMO) with parts of Yes' \\"Relayer\\", Alan Parson's \\"Tales...\\", and Jethro Tull's \\"Thick as a Brick\\".But \\"Space Revolver\\" is not a rehash of any of those bands, or works, it's Roine Stolt and company doing what they do. These are good musicians who have crafted fine compositions. A bit more pop than anything mentioned above, but not as much pop as, say, Spock's Beard. Some hard edges, but not really metal ala Dream Theater. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal!","review":"The Flower Kings are, in a word, amazing!Unlike the endless numbers of clueless and boring prog-metal hair bands out there (Magellan being the exception), these guys are the real thing: progressive rock in the grand tradition of Yes, Genesis, etc.There's a little something for everyone on this album. I personally hear a lot of Yes influence, but they really have a style uniquely their own. It's amazing how, as other reviewers have remarked, Roine Stolt can come up with so much musical material so frequently and not have it sound like filler. He's a truly gifted songwriter and musician.The Flower Kings give me hope that prog is not dead or anachronistic. They seem to be almost single-handedly reviving the genre. Get this recording; if you love prog, you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kings of Prog Rock","review":"The Flower Kings are one of the best prog bands going and continue to hold their position as kings with \\"Space Revolver\\". It has everything any prog fan would want so why \\"only\\" 4 stars? I didn't think at was progressive enough as say \\"Retropolis\\" or \\"Flowerpower\\". Don't get me wrong, \\"I am the Sun\\" and \\"Monster Within\\" are excellent, but as a whole it isn't as progessive as it should be. Pick this up because it is great, but i also suggest the ones that i mentioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did nothing for me...","review":"Having listened to Prog-rock for a long time, I was duped by this disc. The other reviewers praised this disc/band to no end. I strongly disagree with all of them. Either a band grabs my attention or they don't, after two complete listenings I still wasn't impressed. Perhaps I would like one of their other discs, maybe not. Proof that everyone doesn't see eye to eye concerning which bands are prog-rock. Oh well, it won't be the first or the last time that I blew my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prog Rock gets another boost","review":"Do you miss having new music from such classic Progressive Rock bands such as Pink Floyd and Rush? If so, you will enjoy The Flower Kings.I have to admit my favorite Flower Kings CDs are Retropolis, Stardust We Are, and Flower Power. Any new listener should start with Retropolis which is by far the most accessible.In my opinion, this one and \\"Back in the World of Adventure\\" are worthy but second tier efforts. This CD takes a bit more effort to appreciate then the afformentioned titles. However, the rewards are great. There are some great tracks including I Am the Sun, King's Prayer, and Underdog. The musicianship and lyrics are strong. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece!","review":"I am a long time fan of Genesis, King Crimson, Yes & ELP, and I must say that these guys are really making great music that is comparable to the works of the best progressive bands. This is the Flower Kings \\"Lamb\\". Don't miss it & make sure you turn all your friends on to this one. These guys are improving at an incredible rate. Hope they will play in the states sometime soon. There just isn't enough of this type of music being performed here anymore. It is desperately needed! Thanks Flower Kings!"},{"rating":"2","title":"you're right, george!","review":"The previous review anticipated all I wanted to express about this remarkable production.

I guess you wouldn't like it if you only like her last two albums (wonderful albums but her earlier work is different), but for those TRUE fans who scour indie record stores for imports you know you'll never find, who will play all of her albums in succession in one evening by yourself, you'll love this. And not just because her name is on it, it's truly great. And just a little more offbeat than usual PJ."},{"rating":"2","title":"not for everyone","review":"I bought this album a few years ago, I played it once and I hated it.

It it kind of a mix of the harder rock from her first two albums and the mellower songs from To BRing You My Love. However, if you listen to it enough with an open mind, it is one of PJ harvey's greatest accomplishments. I give it 4 starts for a PJ Harvey album, and 5 overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing.","review":"I'm a pretty opened minded person. So I gave this CD a listen.

I remember being blown away by \\"How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accent\\". Even then, Yolanda was my favorite character. It was easy to get right into this book-it was fast-reading, interesting, and definitely worthwhile. Being a resident of Vermont myself, I am amazed with Julia Alvarez' amazing writing talent. And although she is not nationally well-known, she is a name commonly heard around here. Yo! was a truly extraordinary book-a Hispanic version of \\"The Ya-Ya's\\", with a little added flair. I believe this is the type of book you would either HATE or LOVE-luckily, I loved it and recommed it to anyone who enjoys a good laugh, and a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing! Each chapter a mini-novel unto itself!","review":"Alvarez cleverly depicts the main character Yolanda Garcia (who prefers to be called Yo) through first person narratives of a number of friends, family, and acquaintances. The stories of each so vividly and affectionately describe the Hispanic culture of a family native to the Dominican Republic. As the reader gets to know the main character (who never has the opportunity to speak for herself), a wide range of emotions are evoked. The end of the novel is tear-jerking terrific!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Arriba!","review":"On my daily treks to my local library, I searched for a novel by Isabel Allende.

Reading this novel proved to be a delicious experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MIND BENDER WORTH TRYING","review":"This book has more twists and turns than a spiral. It has more action than the Matrix, and more temptation than the Garden of Eden. I was so mesmerized with the style of this novel, I often had to go back and read the chapters again. At first I thought this was a bad thing, but the more involved I got into the story and its characters, I realized I just didn't want to miss or interpret anything.Zon enlightened me on so many topics concerning African Americans today, how deep the problems are, and where they stem from. There is a strong supernatural element in the book which will knock you for a loop at times, but the overall message at the end will let you lknow why it was necessary for Gregory Morris to go that route. I recommend this book for anyone who wants to be entertained, inspired, and challenged. It's not aneasy read, but it's definitely worth trying. I give this book a 4.Tamara Ward, a prolific reviewer"},{"rating":"2","title":"ZON","review":"I wasn't expecting this book to captivate me like it did.What a great story.Not the average book,takes one back in time.Very vivid scenery,supernatural and magical.Leaves you feeling the characters so deeply.A book all should read, from the young to the old.Looking forward to more of this books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reader, Charlotte, NC: Geoffrey M.

State machines are useful and have a place, but there is no need for a whole book on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"I think the title is a little misleading.It is more a introduction to state machines and implementing them on embedded systems. It fact it is more about developing on embedded systems!Having said that it does it very, very well. I would even reccomend it to non-embedded developers,particularly the sections on multi-threading issues and Active objects.I'm not sure who the audience is though. A lot of embedded developers are unfamiliar with C++, UML while non-embedded developers may not even think that state machines could be useful to them.I appreciate the quantum physics analogies, but I don't think they needed so much space.The section on implementing O-O in C is good, but once again,is it relevant to a book on state-machines and active objects.The framework looks good, butI would tweak the C++ version to get rid of all those macro's and function pointers! Particularly if you wanted to port it to java.Excellent book but change the title!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book and code","review":"This book was a definite eye-opener for me with regard to state machines. I recently rewrote a major piece of code to utilize the Quantum Framework (included with the book) and it has worked wonders. My previous code used a more traditional state machine and had quickly evolved into spaghetti code. The hierarchical state machine approach made the new code smaller, more robust, and much easier to maintain and extend."},{"rating":"2","title":"All About Dolphins hits big","review":"I can't even describe how good this book is.

I have to admit that it took more than one reading of this book for me to even begin to appreciate the spiritual answers contained within. On the very first page of the book, it says, \\"they that tread the path of faith, they that thirst for the wine of certitude, must cleanse themselves of all that is earthly--their ears from idle talk, their minds from vain imaginings, their hearts from worldly affections, their eyes from that which perisheth. They should put their trust in God, and, holding fast unto Him, follow in His way.\\" Thus begins a spiritual journey that the reader will never forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Progressive","review":"This work answers many interfaith questions, particularly validating and supporting the differences between the older faiths, and providing a framework for understanding why those differences exist.The review of progressive spiritual / cultural change, set into context, provide a strong foundation for understanding other religions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Numbers Needed","review":"I purchased the numbers for a baseball tryout.

I just punched a hole in the top and bottom for safety pins.(It would have been easier to have perforated holes but you get what you pay for.) They were durable and easy to read. Even though we did not come close to using all of the numbers, the extras will come in handy with other events. Overall, we were pleased and the numbers served our purpose at a low cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"divinal","review":"The debut album for the UK Perry Blake is a combination of smooth soft and melancolic songs that are a mix of strong emotions. The musics are often sad, slow, but very deep and strong. They may resemble in style Jay Jay Johanson, but in fact they are much more deep and more complex.If you like moody, soft and deep songs buy this album, altough it is hard to catch the taste of it, but listen first and if you like buy it. It is not listeneable in two or three minutes, it is too complex to do that. Still, a must-buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The purest Perry Blake sound","review":"I will start by saying I like artists experimenting and evolving their unique and original sound, but I must say also, that this is so far the best Perry Blake album, dark and soft, with a very good instrumentation, that reminds me of some European soundtracks to movies of the 50's. \\"little boys & little girls\\" opens up perfectly, followed by \\"The Hunchback of San Francisco\\" that leaves you craving for more. But the second part of the album is even better, if you get the chance to buy the special edition with three bonus tracks that would be awsome, \\"Ulysses\\" is my favourite of the whole record... definetly two thumbs up for this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"melodic melancholia at it's finest","review":"A gorgeous offering....haunting vocals against a backdrop of lush melodies and electronic rythyms. everyone should have a copy!

If you can identify the truth within yourself then & only then you can identify with all of humanity. This book deals with only a half truth.

Gary Oldman! how could it get better!). It's the true story of artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, and what makes this soundtrack so special is that Basquiat himself was a selector of the music. This soundtrack introdused me to high energy bands like Joy Division and Todies, and to moving singers like John Cale and Gavin Friday.

Orson Wells portryal of \\"Varner\\",lord of the southern town brings strength and visual reality to the times.

Woodward is a talented character actress in her own right (see \\"The Three Faces of Eve,\\" for sure), but she is missing a character to play here. Plus, let's face it, Liz Taylor she is NOT, and she does not cut it as sultry bait for Newman's lusty drifter. I'm sorry, but the attraction between her and Newman has been and always will be a mystery to me.

The film doesn't have a cast of thousands, but what it does have is the raw,rough excitement of a time long past that reflects the mores and sensibilities of an age when straight talk and no nonsense actions were the order of the day. The performances by Newman and Woodward are moving and thoughtful to the point of almost being uncomfortable listening to the dialogue, but it holds the premise of the story. Orson Wells could have done a more proficient job with his part, but his mumbling, stumbling and disjointed attempt as the \\"big boss, father figure\\" lessened the overall quality of the story.

Your eye mask is a gift from the universe! I heat it either for 10 minutes in a warm pot of water or microwave it for 15 seconds, then apply it to my head and ears, neck, back, wherever the pain is coming from, and feel instant relief.

She gives a lot of practical and hands-on advice, that totally changed my love life!!! She really understands the difficulties of communicating about this subject and I found her suggestions very valuable. My partner and I have a much better time telling each other what we exactly like and what we don't like. I definitely recommend her book, if you want more pleasure for yourself and for your man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good tips but very one-sided","review":"I eagerly awaited EO and read it carefully. There is much good information about a man expanding the pleasure of a woman but essentially nothing about expanding the man's orgasm. I reread the cover to see if I'd missed something informing me that this book is about coaching, and considers enhancing women's pleasure only. My re-review revealed nothing about the onesidedness. Certainly I love giving my partner incredible sexual pleasure. And my level of excitement is directly connected to her's. But what about some thoughts on how to touch a man, talk to a man, truly share with a man. While I will study the book and we will explore its suggestions, I feel a little [cheated].

Fortunately my lens motor wasn't damaged - I just had to remove this adaptor and power on again for the camera to fix itself.The adapter is JUST big enough for your lens to come out so just make sure you have it lined up exactly, or simply put this on once your camera is powered up and the lens is extended. Screwing the adapter into the tripod hole will not necessarly line this up perfectly.One you get past this alignment issue this product is pretty nice, I have a fisheye lens I can attach and 3 macro lenses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Functional, though disappointing","review":"These speakers are better than the internal speaker in my computer, by a longshot, but I am disappointed that an AC Adapter did not come with it, runs on AAA batteries, the cord between the speakers is too short, and the speakers periodically (often) have noise (apparently very cheap wires that pick up any small bit of interference).

Now the bad news: The separate amplifier and all the wires going everywhere makes the connected assembly look like a science lab project, especially if you opt for the USB power connector.Yes, the sound quality is better than the one inch speakers in my IBM ThinkPad but not nearly as good as your typical $19 desktop computer speakers. The problem is that the sound is limited to highs with little if any midrange. Bass is nonexistent. It's like listening to a pair of big tweeters. The enthusiastic reviews are a mystery to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice size but zero bass","review":"Small, portable, nice design with plenty of treble and middle frequencies but no bass. If you want your CDs and MDs to sound as if they were being played through an old 2\\" TV speaker, these are for you. If you prefer a fuller sound, you won't like these speakers. Another caution: They have very powerful magnets. Don't put them anywhere near any magnetic-type data storage (floppies, hard disks)."},{"rating":"1","title":"my notebook speakers actually sound better.","review":"I ordered these to carry around in my notebook bag after reading good reviews, and was seriously disappointed. The sound quality is mediocre. The low-end is nonexistent, and my notebook speakers have slightly better mid-range; only the high-end comes through at all. Moreover, the sound is REALLY quiet (2 watts per channel, maybe I should've expected that).Two other drawbacks: you can clearly see the DC-in on the little amp module in the photos, so I expected it to come with a wall power converter--not so. I keep having to remember to turn it off when I step away to conserve batteries. And, the speaker magnets are strong enough (and unshielded enough) that I can't throw it in a bag with my computer without thought.Overall, a waste. I'm sending it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most relavent review","review":"I read mixed reviews, so I rolled the dice and bought these. Absolute garbage. In their little bag they are 3\\" thick. They sound very quiet. No bass (expected), and no Mid-range (not expected). The front panel is a cheap corrugated plastic sheet. They certainly are 360 degree speakers: They sound equally bad from all directions. Even the patch cables that they provided had breaks in the cables. My original comment to my wife was \\"Twenty bucks, how can I go wrong?\\". Well, my answer now is I could have still had my $20. Now I just have to find someone to give them to, as they are not worth the space they take up. I know you get what you pay for, but if that was the case here, then should have been on sale for half off at the 99 cent store."},{"rating":"1","title":"somewhat disappointed","review":"The unit works well after sorting through all the wires. The lead from the music source is extremely short and requires some dexterity. The biggest complaint is the battery cover which refuses to stay on with modest handling. Also, the on-off switch is cheaply constructed and I found it prudent to remove the batteries when travelling. Switch activated when travelling and caused battery loss. A neat gadget for the price. Sound quality is more than reasonable for the weight and compactness."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I am a musician. I found these speakers to be very limited in range.

This film gives us a chance to experience their artistic vision.The film is visually beautiful. Wright's performance is subtle yet precise. After seeing some documentary footage, I could hardly tell the difference between the real Basquiat and the actor. So, bravo!!! The rest of the cast is at their usual best.Although this film focuses on New York art scene and on Basquiat as an artist, it also raises serious issues without being preachy. For instance, when asked during his first exhibition whether he considers himself a black artist, Basquiat (who was of a mixed racial heritage) replies to the man: \\"Do you consider yourself a writer or a white writer?\\" I think that sums up Basquiat's views about race and about art: he was an artist first and everything else second.I hope Schnabel keeps on directing."},{"rating":"2","title":"An eye opening splash of darkening manic lowlights","review":"Having travelled the long journey to Greenport,Long Island to see my favourite all round performer-BOWIE in a role totally fitting to his own personality(Warhol),I was delighted and pleased to report afterwards of a truly invigorating experience-One I would have no hesitation in strongly reccomending to absolutely anyone,youngor old,art fans music fans(Excellent soundtrack available on c.d).All the cast put in believable and sometimes moving performances that left one thinking about the alternate free lifestyles some people strive for but may never have the oppurtunity or guts to do anything about.Drugs dont work.Aconfusion of manic creativity and desperate lost souls with a sprinkling of light hearted loyalty go to make what I feel is a very accesible yet thought provoking mastrerpiece-A classic cult film this will become Iam certain!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful....","review":"I was so impressed by Jeffery Wright's acting in this film as the late Jean Michel Basquiat, who is one of the best artists to have ever lived. He had the imagination and creativity that an artist must have to be successful, and this film shows it all. From his rise to fame, to his harsh downfall with life! This is a must see for anyone who loves art or has a destiny to become famous."},{"rating":"1","title":"pathetic, really pathetic","review":"Basquiat's life is terribly interesting and I was pleased to see a film about it. But Julain Schnabel, making the \\"bold\\" move from painting to cinema, scores a big zero with this doobie. Total inattention to detail-- this move not only doesn' t look like it takes place in the early eighties (90s hair and clothes, and even cars), it's also a mess of a screenplay and the acting is purely laughable. Deep failure. This movie is insultingly bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heaping pile of doo doo","review":"If the point of the movie was to show how sick and disoriented people become rich and famous, then the movie succeeded. However, it is difficult to enjoy the movie because you can't identify with the characters. They're just too damn bizarre."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exciting movie for the art appreciator","review":"Whether you're an artist like myself, or just someone who appreciates and enjoys fine art, you'll enjoy this biographical film of one of the art communities \\"bad boys\\". Whatever your position is on J.M. Basquiat, this movie sympathizes with him and takes you on an entertaining journey through his life: from his graffitti days on the streets to his last days of his life. Also check out \\"Pollock\\" (this is not as lighthearted of a movie though)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"I'm a Paul McCartney fan, and when I read he wrote a screenplay, I went out and saw the film GIVE MY REGARDS TO BROAD STREET. Boy did it stink. McCartney can write lyrics okay, but writing a 2 hour screenplay was too much for a novice to try. Same with Schnabel. I like a lot of his art, but he's a novice screenwriter, and this movie shows it. No, I don't like Basquiat, and probably people who watch MTV most are among his biggest admirerers (his art is perfect for those with short attention spans). My 4 year old niece's drawings look just like his. But that's incidental to the inept directing and writing that are the reason for this film's failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZZ","review":"If it wasn't for the movie, I may never have known Basquait. I just wanted to see a movie about a black man who paints since I was sick and tired of all of the gangster and slave movies. Anyway, I went to a theater to see this one. What a mind numbing mess! There were a waste of interesting characters in it that did nothing but babble, and Jeffrey Wright was about as animated as cold grits. I couldn't understand a word the man said! This movie needed subtitles big time! I understand that he was trying to capture the true ways of the real drugged out Basquait, but did he really have to go that far? There was only one moment I remember from this movie, and that was when I chuckled while watching David Bowie's cheeky Andy Warhol having a mild pointless argument at a restaruant. If the purpose of this movie is to tell a tale about someone's life, it failed miserably. All I know from this film is that Basquait made horrible paintings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Artsy Fartsy","review":"Unless you are an intimate fan of art nouveau or you just love pompously pretentious movies, you will hate this movie. When I say pretentious, don't get me wrong...they don't have big words or interesting dialogue. This film doesn't even try to make its characters sound intelligent in the least. It is full of staggering, incomprehensible behaviour. But don't worry, most of us can't even begin to care about why Basquiat is such a pathetic and meaningless person. I know, I know...it's hard to believe Parker Posey, Gary Oldman, and Benicio Del Toro could all be in such a piece of junk - but alas...rent it and you'll see how awful. One of the worst films I've seen!Of course, if you'd like to see an intelligent, highly attractive woman paired up with an ugly idiot...look no further...but then again, isn't this the scheme of most films?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hype becomes Art","review":"Jean-Michel Basquiat laughed himself all the way to the bank ... er -- his heroin connexion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Artist Fallen.","review":"Whoever the actor that played Basquait is, he did an incredilble job. I didn't even know that was David Bowie as Andy Warhol! What a trip! This film is excellent in all aspects of filmmaking. It captures the tortured soul of a diluted artist, a timeless tale told again and again. In this film it is executed beautifully, totally connecting you to Basquait and exposing the world in which he lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Farewell to a meteoric artistic promise !","review":"The meteoric rise of the most irreverent artistic urban icon of the eighties - Jean Michael Basquiat - was portrayed with sincere affection by Julian Schnabel who conveyed a very objective feature of this living legend who died - like Jim Morrison - at 27.

The rendition created in the movie was boring and annoying -- big dissappointment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling and tragic","review":"Basquiat's life and demise are lessons in too-sudden fame and the exploitation of African Americans, street people, and the poor. Julian Schnabel has made a subtle and artistically structured tribute to Basquiat, the kind of tribute that only a fellow artist could make. The film exposes the New York art world for some of its artificiality, power plays, maneuvers and corruption in the lime-lighting of potential money-making genius. The film, however, feeds the myth that great artists are marginally sane and creative to the extent of that marginality. An excellent choice for viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tragic and believable","review":"I liked this movie because it showed what it's like to have too much too soon. Highly recommended for a change of pace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a DM album but worth a listen","review":"This a great album by a singer of a band for 20 years were he didn't write a single song.

I can't afford the import like some others but when its release here in the states I will have it. I will agree that I would have liked to see more development in the sounds. Its his first solo album and who knew he could write. I am glad he can and I hope he has a more electric album next time. Maybe evan have Alan Wilder produce wouldn't that be something.

It puts you in the Halloween mood, gives you bits of wisdom and insight to chew on and is just an interesting look into the author's mind and beliefs. Maybe everything in the book is not academically correct; but that really doesn't matter so much. There are two kinds of books that are written in this world.. those that look to spell out the known facts about everything and those that are written from the mind and heart of the individual.

Season 4 used to be the worst season of Sex and the City (that is, until season 5). The show took incredible liberties with each of the 4 characters - changing nearly everything about them entirely.

Highs and lows of sex and love combined with brilliant humor. SATC literally shows every type of relationship out there and ones you never thought of. Especially good for the relationships one has had where you couldn't put your finger on what \\"that\\" was. Boom! You find it on these discs. Beneficial for men to watch as well. I could watch this over and over and over. SATC never gets old for me and I am sorry the story line had to end.

It's largely an action film for teens, falling very short on dialogue with a plot that hinges on a hypnotism bit that is wholly unbelievable.

But since I bought it, I fast forwarded through the rest of it, stopping at times to get even more depressed. Despite the music, which I recommend only buying the soundtrack, it is one of the most misrepresented movie covers I have read. What appears to be a fun, love filled movie is exactly the opposite.

Led by Jimmy Stewart, the crew which include great acting talents like Richard Attenborough, Peter Finch and Ernest Borgnine courageously try to survive the desert heat, lack of water, and high tempers between crew members.When all hope of a rescue is gone, an idea by a German model plane maker, to rebuild the crashed craft, initially not taken seriously by Jimmy Stewart, is eventually seen as the only option of survival and the movie climaxes into a gripping story of team effort and a race against time to get the plane flying. This is a highly recommended film that will have you on the edge of your seat right to the end. The film got 4stars because the UK DVD lacked even the simplest extra, like a trailer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Soaring Moment in Filming making History...","review":"Currently I have around about 280 odd DVD's in my collection.All films of which I know I can watch again and again and bethoroughly entertained, all the time.I knew of the pending arrival of \\"The Flight of the Phoenix\\" 6 months before it's release, I don't have a copy as yet, waiting to see if it's released here in Australia for zone 4 in Pal format, suffice to say that it will be part of the library soon!...and as already mentioned in, I think about 3 previous reviews, it is the scene in which Richard Attenborough starts to laugh which gradually changes to an hysterical cry that gets me all the time, arr to be an Actor!This is a Good film in every respect, I can't wait to see it again....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film--was surprised I liked the remake better, though!","review":"It's a little Man against Nature and Man against Man when a flight of men are stranded in the desert after their plane experiences engine trouble in a sand storm.

Finally, they realize their only hope is to cobble their broken airplane back together with the aid of poorly socialized genius. Will they get it off the ground? Will they even survive long enough to try? This is a wonderful story with a lot of heart. Jimmy Stewart as their aging pilot, Captain Townes, is wonderful.

Anything with Jimmy Stewart in it is usually great. This one keeps with that tradition.The plot and content of the movie are well developed. The crowd appeal for this movie would typically be more for guys from my experience. In a gathering wtaching the movie, the guys liked it and most of the women weren't interested.It's a movie that will become a permanent resident in my library. I'm glad a group of friends suggested it to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: Package contains mutilated work of art!","review":"This version was made from a full screen version where the left and right sides were sliced off. Then the tops and bottoms were sliced off so the image would fit a modern 16:9 monitor. What you see is a small rectangle cut out of the center of the original movie.The first clue was that the familiar 20th Century Fox logo was cut off on all four sides. When the actors came on screen, it looked like every shot was a closeup. Lots of giant faces, like how they used to shoot TV shows. The effect is gruesome. Watching this version is most unsettling. I could not stand to watch for more than about ten minutes.The package says \\"widescreen edition\\". Maybe it's time for legislation to define terms, because this labeling should be illegal.

Stewart plays the pilot of the plane who must work with an egomaniacal model airplane designer to create a new, working plane from the wreckage of the old twin-boomed Flying Boxcar.This film has a lot to say for it: an international cast, a good plot, inner turmoil, interPERSONAL turmoil, etc. The only thing I would have done differently is I would have given the monkey more screen time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Being a Jimmy Stewart fan and having read the other online reviews, I purchased this DVD.

The plot about a small group of plane crash victims trying to cobble together their aircraft again is compelling enough, but director Robert Aldrich, like novelist Ellston Trevor in his original work, clutters it up with a lot of pointless and contrived subplots.

Furthermore, there are parts of the work - in some cases, dozens of pages long - that are a complete waste of time, Pound being hopelessly self-indulgent.Having said all that, studded here and there throughout this big thick difficult book you will find some of the most beautiful poetry ever written.I once seduced a beautiful but previously-unattainable woman by taking her to a sunlit park and reading to her from the Pisan Cantos in the slanting sun. Which is what poetry should be all about, right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please.","review":"The Cantos of Ezra Pound are not \\"the most important literary work ever\\" or some other such nonesense. Essentially they amount to a man, steadily losing his sanity(notice that the cantos become increasingly fragmented the longer the poem gets) who was spouting a lot of crackpot political and economic theories via incomprehensible poetry. And his readers weren't the only ones to whom the Cantos are incomprehensible:Pound himself didn't know the meanings of most of the Ideograms that are spewed throughout the poem. This is not an \\"acheivement\\" or \\"an indictment of our society\\" or a \\"brilliant satire\\"(to utilize some of the favorite phrases of readers of pretentious, incoherent, and ultimately meaningless literature), it's just drivel.

If you ever wonder how radicals are created then read this garbage. It's always easy to be looked upon as a genius when the critics are radicals like yourself.

What a nut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pound sucks","review":"No one person has done greater damage to the English language and its literature than Ezra Pound. After being mistakenly hailed by T.S.Eliot (a great poet) the works of Pound have been taken as a licence for thousands of mediocrities to gush their meaningless tosh all over the rest of us, get worshipped for their esoteric genius, when in fact they are just lazy, sloppy, selfish, regurgitators of rubbish. Language was invented so that people could communicate with each other, and make sense of what the other person was saying. Pound kicked into the 20th century full of sound and fury, signifying nothing, since he had nothing to say, and was in fact a kind of mental and spiritual dyslexic.

It his revamp of a little-knownsuperheroine who is a hybrid of human and orchid, with theability to control minds with the use of scent.As befitting to a story that utilizes a lot of flora andfauna as metaphors, the fully-painted artwork is lush andcolorful...you almost want to reach out and touch the leavesof a tree or smell the flowers.Look for cameos from well-known DC characters such as LexLuthor, Batman, Poison Ivy, the Mad Hatter, and others.My only complaint about the story is a rather abrupt andsomewhat unfinished ending. I'm guessing this is becauseDC intended it to be the launch of the ongoing BLACK ORCHIDcomic book series, which lasted for 24 issues and neverreached the heights of this story, originally a 3-partminiseries."},{"rating":"1","title":"torn cover","review":"Book came with a tear about 3cm long on the back near the binding. Apart from that it was as described."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everyone Has To Start Somewhere","review":"As a big fan of Neil Gaiman's novels and Sandman series, I was truly looking forward to this. Of course, as seen in the early issues of Sandman, Gaiman wasn't a natural at writing comics (but, then again, who is?) and he needed a bit of time to develope his \\"sea legs\\" so to speak. As such, this work of his was a little weak, nowhere near on par with his later efforts in works such as Mr. Punch, American Gods, The Books of Magic, Neverwhere (the novel), and, of course, Sandman.Dave McKean's artwork, though, is always a treat, so I should point out my review is focused more on Gaiman's writing for this rather than McKean's artwork."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I won't get into the story or the author and illustrator, as there are plenty of reviews on that, except to say I liked the artwork a lot - better than I thought.What I wanted to convey is that I was under the impression that this would be a much longer book. I don't read graphic novels (this is for a friend's daughter,) but my sister did way back in the 80s, and they were always quite thick, so that's what I expected. I should have looked more closely at the book's posted details, I guess. I'd still have bought it, but I wouldn't have been so disappointed at the content:price ratio. I was expecting it to be at least twice the length."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Gaiman's Black Orchid","review":"This is a fine crafted psychological exploration of the Black Orchid's life story. I was expecting a more powerful stress on themes of environmentalism, but what Gaiman offers is very satisfactory. McKean's drawings for this story are some of his best, from what I've seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely book","review":"I read this after reading the first few Sandman novels. It was rather different, but was still a lovely book with a interesting plot and a nice conclusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Orchid, A Woman Done By Top Two Men in Graphic Novels!","review":"I bought this before \\"Veils\\", also reviewed by me, and was very happy since this work, unlike most \\"comics\\" work, was more clearly aimed at women. I already owned much of Gaiman and McKean's work and was surprised to discover this feminist and environment oriented book among their earlier work. Also, buying it in the trade paperback version meant I wouldn't be missing any issues of the story, the typical problem when you are trying to find these as individual comics. McKean is my all-time favorite artist in \\"comics\\". He can do no wrong and I was delighted to find him doing a non-macho storyline. I wish Gaiman and McKean would go back to this type of work rather than what they are doing now in the \\"comics\\" field."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everest. 50 years on the mountain","review":"Excellent ,but will not play on (International) DVD player although the player is set to receive all regions.

Very enjoyable and pretty well written/scripted, and the historical side of the story is educational too. Basically, a fairly solid and more than satisfactory documentary as one would expect from National Geographic. If you plan to choose an Everest DVD for family viewing then this is, in my opinion, the one to get. Some of the others are either too technical or scary for younger family members."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Visual Delight","review":"Documentary manages to capture the history, spirit, beauty, and danger of the world's highest peak.

Joe Hyams did a fantastic job explaining how a the study of martial arts can lead to a more balanced and fulfilled life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good quick read","review":"This is not really a book about zen in the traditional sense or a comprehensive study of the martial arts, but rather it's about the author's experiences while studying martial arts. The book is composed of many short chapters, each covering an insight attained or lesson that the author learned in the martial arts. Some insights are easily applicable outside of the dojo while others require a bit stretching to be useful in everyday life. Though this is an entertaining read with sprinkles of wisdom throughout, it's more anecdotal than how-to. After reading you might feel like you've understand a little more about certain zen aspect in the martial arts and life, but you won't necessarily be given clear instruction on how to reach that state of being. If you like zen, Eastern culture, or the martial life then you'll definitely enjoy this book, just don't expect it to turn you into a warrior sage or anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zen in the Martial Arts--a tribute to exaggeration of benefits","review":"This is a fine book. The problem for me in it deals with the subject more than the treatment. Martial arts, and the Zen attitude toward it, presents exaggerated benefits. One doubts that it produces personal superpowers. That seems a myth. It reminds me of what Hirohito's wife said after World War II, which was that the nation should have paid more attention to science and less to spirit. That is, they assumed that simply through zen discipline, they could overpower all the nations of the Pacific, as well as the United States. It didn't work that way. Similarly, with all the benefits that Zen may confer on the martial artist, it may not amount to a complete transformation of experience, as the author seems to propose. Still, it is a good book and well worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"That's all fine and well but...","review":"I think i would be far more impressed with this book if Mr. Hyams had internalized anything he wrote about. I have nothing against the author personally, but i also see no obligation to diefy someone who does not hold true to his writings"},{"rating":"1","title":"Apart from the cliches and the name-dropping, Mrs. Lincoln..","review":"The better parts of this book are a Reader's Digest Condensed version of martial arts philosophy; the rest of it does not rise even to that unambitious level. It is to the original works that it apes as a Superman comic is to Shakespeare. Generously larded with name-dropping, the book represents some of the more profound ideas and principles that have been associated with martial arts in a trivialized, sound-bite form that shortchanges both the reader and the ideas themselves. Despite these deficiences, the book is often praised -- not a surprise, perhaps, given that a sound-bite view of a philosophy may represent much more than the average reader has yet encountered. Is the book easy? Yes. Is the book accessible? Yes. But you need to ask yourself exactly what it is you're getting easy access to. You can do much, much better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding?","review":"I can't understand how anyone could give this book a good review. It's nothing more than a series two page explanation of some very difficult concepts, and most of the explanations are either slightly off or just plain wrong. The author makes it sound like all you need is for someone to explain what Mushin means and \\"poof\\" you can now attain \\"no mind\\". It doesn't work thatway folks. His anecdotes are ridiculous! I especially like the one where he is told that pain doesn't hurt if you simply put your mind elsewhere, and then he claims to have simply performed this feat next time has oral surgery. LOL...right! People that can pull off this kind of feat work at it for years. It doesn't just happen! I happen to be a big believer in the Zen/Martial arts connection. That's why I bought this book. The mental aspects of the martial arts are every bit as important as the physical ones. But read something instead like \\"The Zen Way to the Martial Arts\\", which is a much better book IMHO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Of course this book consists primarily of name dropping","review":"and nothing about Zen. And the little there is is simply cut and paste from other places."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding?!","review":"Where did all the 5 star reviews come from? This book is little more than an egotistic, self promoting, shallow piece of tripe. Joe Hyams is no maritial artist, no Zen Roshi, and a nobody.

Another great thing about this book is its readability; a typical chapter doesn't take more than 10 minutes to read. I always keep it at hand and just open the book, pick a chapter and gain a new insight. This book is a must for you if you want to grasp the subtle principles behind every martial art and apply them to qualitatively improve not just your performance as a martial artist but your daily life."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say??? A classic. Pure and simple.","review":"The real beauty of Mr. Hyam's book is that, unlike his often ad hominem and jingoistic contemporaries, he has sought out and shared the wisdom and insight one can obtain through martial arts training without putting one style or country above another. I see no need to \\"deify\\" him for this (see other reviews), but I certainly owe him a debt of gratitude! Over the past 17 years, I have returned to this book again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read!","review":"I couldn't put it down, once I started reading it. It is an excellent introduction for anyone beginning their martial journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"I was given this book as a gift many years ago when I was going through a rather rough patch in life, and it worked wonders for my psyche. The book contains little bite-sized pieces detailing various martial-arts based lessons and how the author was able to apply those in a real-world context. I have since taken many of the lessons and applied them in my own life or in conversations with others, and as simple as some of them may be, they provide great insight into a different mental approach than to what I was accustomed. I have given this book as a gift to others I have encountered that, like me during my intitial readthrough, might benefit from its words, and each of them learned something new. I would guess that I currently posess my 8th copy of this wonderful book, and I look forward to eventually purchasing my 9th."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant - Worth Reading Again and Again","review":"I never re-read. There are too many books I still want to read for the first time. But with Joe Hyams's book I flipped back to page 1 as soon as I finished it.

If your a master of the art or someone with an interest in it, you will find Zen in the Martial Arts to be an amazing book.

An unhappy son who never had his father's love has only his alcoholic mother to cling to, and finds that a proper marriage to well-to-do socialite fails to bring him the peace of mind and belonging he craves and loses himself in his law career. Love does eventually find its way but at what price? Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward are the stars in this story but the film belongs to Woodward who is excellent as the snobbish and slutty wife who delights in tormenting her cuckold husband. Ina Balin, Leon Ames and Myrna Loy also figure in major roles in the movie. Newman was approaching the elite class of actors at this time and his best roles were only a few years removed from this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Newman movie ever!","review":"It may be one of his lesser known films, but the heartache that Newman shows on screen through those gorgeous blue eyes melts my soul every time I watch this movie. If anyone has ever been torn between true happiness and being with someone because it's the right thing to do will love this movie.

Very effective look at life in the 50's and 60's, when bright young men on their way up (like my own father) were often forced to choose, and choose hard, between job and family.It's always worthwhile to watch Paul Newman, especially in a role that is a stretch for him.

Not rated (mature subject matter)."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre","review":"This movie starring Paul Newman and his wife Joanne Woodward was mediocre at best. It was overly long with a weak story plot. It seems that Newman's acting was forced and the continuity was missing. The film kind of lost itself in costumes and sets without any story substance. Woodward's old flame had most of the best lines and acted the rake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul & Joanne at there Best!","review":"I love this movie.

This is the first official live recording post-QMaxx, and there's definitely a noticeable difference in energy level and sound. What the Slackers have lost in QMaxx's bombasity, they've made up in a tighter sound, better harmonies, and an older sound. That's not to say I didn't like Marq Lyn, because I absolutely loved him. However, it's great to hear that the band has moved on well without him.This CD has a good amount of the Slacker's classics -- Married Girl and Have the Time among them.

It's not a problem with our TV: we cycled through every possible viewing format (wide, zoom, wide zoom, full, etc) and none would allow for the complete labels to appear. It seems that when the DVD was made, the picture aspect ratio was made too narrow; the package indicates it's 16:9 widescreen but it sure doesn't appear to be. If we had known this before ordering, we probably would not have bought it, as part of the enjoyment is knowing what you're seeing.

What amazes me about the DVD (I bought the Blu Ray DVD) is the unique aerial perspective and the amazing quality of the video. I was able to notice architectural features of the buildings and surrounding landscape that are simple impossible to see from the ground. Also, the camera is apparently mounted on the helicopter in such a way that the video that is produced is smooth as silk. With the helicopter constantly moving forward, it reminds me of the Ken Burns effect you see so frequently on photographs in PBS documentaries. We were spellbound watching the video.

(My reaction before I found out was that Allende had gone seriously downhill.) But from the young adult perspective, it's not a bad read. The second of three mystery/travel/adventure books by Allende, written for her grandchildren, this is an entertaining tale set in a thinly disguised Bhutan. An irascible, mid-60's-ish travel writer named Kate Gold invites her grandson and his friend Nadia from South America to join her on a trip to the Himalayan Kingdom of the Golden Dragon. There they meet up with the King and his heir, a seven-foot tall monk trained in the martial arts, the secret Sect of the Scorpion, a plot to steal the Kingdom's most valuable treasure, etc. No sex, not much violence, and lots of traditional values. Probably good for the 12-13 year old set, but, unlike Harry Potter, definitely not for grownups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Allende Trilogy","review":"I loved this book on tape and its two companion stories. I've always been a fan of Isabel Allende and listened to Daughter of Fortune and Portrait in Sepia in the car.

I imagine that a 10-13 year old child would really enjoy these books and have set them aside to give as a gift to a special young person in the future. Despite the more simple story line I loved the tapes and couldn't wait to get back in the car to listen. Books-on-tape are, I think, the complete answer to road rage. When I'm listening to something good I don't care how long it takes to get where I'm going."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has a freaky attitude","review":"Isabel Allende's \\"Kingdom of the Golden Dragon\\" seems like a cool book at first. It has a village of yetis, indomitable Buddhist monks, and a talking statue made out of gold. Though her writing drags, she has some good ideas.But she really puts out some weird and disturbing ideas as well. Allende seems to have a problem with Americans in general. Her ideal 'Forbidden Kingdom' is a benevolent dictatorship, where the king gets to tell people how to dress, restricts what Western influences they get to see, and generally controls their lives according to his whims. The sheep like subjects all like that. And this is shown as a good thing. Call me a materialistic, soulless Westerner, as I'm sure Allende would, but I call that a lack of freedom and rights.Who knows why Allende doesn't think much of Americans. But it's weird that she puts forward an ideal civilization that is far from ideal.

When the sheriff asked somebody to take the shot during a hostage situation and they were supposedly showing actual footage, the shot was there.

I'm not saying \\"The Fourth Kind\\" really had much potential, but it wasn't anything special. It was kind of unique how the director interviews the \\"real person\\" (who's obviously just an actress), and how it has a double-screen effect when it shows the film and the \\"real\\" footage. I have to say, parts of the film were actually scary, like when you hear the alien and those \\"abduction\\" scenes. It seems like the director really wanted us to believe that it was real. In some ways, it kind of worked, but it ultimately didn't work. It just looked fabricated. The movie didn't end well either. Altogether, this film is really obnoxious and not anything that you can watch over and over again. At least not to me, so I'd say that \\"The Fourth Kind\\" isn't a must-see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick of these mock-documentaries","review":"This is like the Blair Witch Project- presented as a real documenatry, with 'genuine documentary footage', but it is actually all fake, a fictional device. This takes away anything the movie might have had going for it, because the idea that it might have been real is the only thing that made it scary- it's otherwise quite an unremarkable film. I must say I do not like this trend of lying to the audience, saying fictional movies are documentaries. It is blurring the lines too much between fact and fiction, and it is fundamentally dishonest. Either a movie is fiction, or it is a documentary. It cannot be both, so please, no more of these con job movies..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me!","review":"Disturbing.

If you want the cream of the crop of alien abduction, then watch the X-Files television series. The 4th Kind is alright, but it's been done much better before."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fourth Kind - Abduction","review":"Great movie! Completely fictional but well done. It is based on real theories about extraterrestrials/gods but the supposed \\"real\\" footage in the film is actually not real, at all. This isn't a slasher film or anything horror like that but it can actually put a realistic fear into your mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't worry if it's real or not...just enjoy it.","review":"This is my favorite kind of movie, scary without the excessive gore or special effects, and the chance it could be true. However, from what I read it seems it is not all factual, but it is still real enough to scare the heck out of you. Hey look, the last \\"real\\" movie I saw was \\"An Inconvient Truth\\" and I fell asleep four times in that one. The part I liked the best in this movie was the voice captured on the voice recorder, that really made the hairs stand up on the back of my neck. If you like scary movies and can restrain from being a film critic and just view it as entertainment, it will be worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored stiff.","review":"I'm glad I only rented this. I admit this sort of movie is not my cuppa tea. I won't be buying it. Owls are messengers according to some Amerindian beliefs. Is this why they were represented? I didn't get anything out of this. Certainly no fright. It takes something extremely scary to do that. Movies generally do not have that factor. Not for me anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORED OUT OF MY MIND","review":"I followed this one for about 15 minutes but the acting was below par. Not horrible, just below par and why should I put up with that because people are promising it will be some engaging horror later?

Zero imagination.This ultimately comes across as a cheap, lazy gimmick with no pay-off. I love Milla Jovovich but she looks so pained during the opening and closing shots that I felt bad for her. Acting like she believes in UFOs from this shoddy movie appears to me like an impossible task.If you want to see Will Patton in a better role in a much better movie, check out THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES. It's another paranormal film based on \\"true events\\" but at least it has some style, good acting and it doesn't beat you over the head with its own pretentiousness...like THE FOURTH KIND."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept me interested. Decent film.","review":"The first thing I must say is that this film kept me interested right until the bitter end. The story was very interesting, the acting was very good, the \\"based on true events\\" shtick was great and made the movie more chilling to watch until you find out it's aparently all fake. The way this film makes the viewer think they are watching actual abduction footage and sessions is a great kind of Blair Witch style horror. This was a very suspenseful movie and over all was worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fourth Paranormal Activity of the Blair Witch","review":"Laughable.Yes, all the handi-cam footage you can bare in this one! Another movie trying to use \\"actual footage\\" to make someone believe in the supernatural. Not really even sure what to write here? I would have MUCH rather have had an alien abduction movie that is just exactly that. A nice, simple, plain old alien abduction movie, not some giggle inducing footage of real actors, playing real parts that are really ridiculous. The whole \\"actual footage\\" gimmick is kind of over for me here and if this movie wasn't billed as something it's not than I would have enjoyed it far more.So if you're still a fan of the Paranormal Activity movies then there is no doubt you will be roped into this one and could very well enjoy it. But if you aren't a fan of that genre, as I am not, then steer clear of this one as it is a waste of a precious hour and a half that you won't get back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very disturbing!","review":"I liked this film a lot. It certainly is not a \\"feel-good\\" movie. It does do a good job of telling a story and the production is excellent in my opinion! The cast is believable and the film succeeds in creating a heavy and disturbing atmosphere. This is definitely aided by the beautiful physical location in which the story occurs. This movie features a different take than other abduction stories such as \\"Fire in the Sky.\\" I ended up watching it twice when I rented it and I found it to be just as compelling on the second viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"the owl!!","review":"im think the owl was the safe place while being hypnotised, but i just guess that the wife didnt know this.. u see the owl wasnt there after awhile maybe cuz her husband was dead and she was trying to do his job and didnt know about the owl and all patients mentioned the owl.. dunno movie was cool and original check it out"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment!","review":"Hollywood continues to frighten the viewing public while exaggerating the negatives connected with the UFO phenomenon, even lying in this case. The film was publicized as a true story, which it is not. They professed to having real interview footage, which it does not. What it does do is scare the heck out of the audience by planting horrific visions and psycho-babble connected with UFOs and abduction. The script, effects and acting were big disappointments."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT REAL FOOTAGE.","review":"I just had to write a review. This was a decent movie overall. It is not filled with vulgar language, gore and sex. It is compelling, and well written. I would have given it a better rating had it not been for the HUGE DEAL they made about this being REAL footage in the movie. I can assure you, it is not. I would have been able to accept the premise, and the style because it was still well done. HOWEVER, I am still torqued about the fact that they spent SO much time trying to convince me this was actual footage of interviews. I would still recommend it. I would compare it with Communion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a great movie but I received it on time and packaged well.","review":"The movie claims to be based on true cases but the woman in the \\"real\\" video who was abducted and telling the story is an actress.

Whirling the camera around a stationary actor isn't wizardry. In fact, it's annoying. So is the technique of having characters whisper. This may be groovy when you see a film in a quiet theater, but when you're at home and coping with planes flying overhead, the dishwasher, a dog snoring and other distractions, WHISPERING SUCKS.With too many plot inconsistencies to enumerate, poor acting by most, and no gratuitous nudity (it's Milla Jovovich, ya know!), this experience could only be made better by downing enough vodka to forget you've seen it.PS - I suggest The Fifth Kind; that's when aliens rob you of 1 hour 45 minutes, and the cost of one movie rental. The horror!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It should be called \\"The BAD kind\\". It's one of the worst movies of 2009.","review":"It should be called \\"The BAD kind\\". It's one of the worst movies of 2009.- The whole movie never showed anything that scared or thrilled me. There were no aliens, no beasts.- There was one scene blatantly copied from \\"The Exorcist\\". That was where the victim floated about 2 feet above her bed. Did the director expect it to scare the wit out of us?- Ninety percent of this film is very much like \\"Paranormal Activity\\" in a way that it does not show any \\"bad guys\\".

Regardless of the negative reviews here (or elsewhere), the film is pretty darn creepy in that it actually goes beyond the alien theory. Maybe the stories in this film are all made up but based on actual case histories? Whatever the case, this movie was pretty attention-grabbing from start to finish.

Overall I believe The Fourth Kind is better crafted than Cloverfield and is equally if not more unsettling than Paranormal Activity. Thus it instills the cosmic fear of Cloverfield but manages to bring it into your own home much in the style of PA."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fourth Kind","review":"The Fourth Kind was an interesting movie which explores an interesting subject. It was a rather dark movie and unnerving......The basis of the movie is the fact that Nome Alaska has its share of missing people. Some believe it is caused by the winters, which tend to affect people in strange ways. The makers of this movie portray the cause as Alien Abductions. I've seen my share of alien movies, but this flick cranks it up a notch, as its possession scenes rival \\"The Exorcist\\".In a way the message is to be taken seriously. Not all Aliens are like ET, which was invented by Spielberg. If a species is a different life form, there is no \\"Earthly\\" reason why it would have the higher attributes attributed to man, such as empathy or compassion.Good movie, but not for the sensitive................."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spellbinding","review":"This was a well crafted tale, really enjoyed it.

These washed out, strangely out of focus videotapes are really creepy to watch, as is the real person the film is based on - her wide eyes, frayed looking features really convice you that something very strange was going on.

Like the Amityvill Horror and the Blair Witch Horror this was produced to make you think it is an actual story but it is not. Worst still, it is badly produced and badly directed. The acting is non-existent. Obviously the producers,director and the woman playing the \\"actual\\" Dr. Tyler believe that speaking in a monotone is acting. It was all I could do to finish the movie and wish I hadn't Unlike the two mentioned, this one will not be around long enough for the admission that it is a fake.

The movie mixes re-enactments of the events at the time with audio and video recordings purportedly showing us actual, first-hand accounts of those events - although anytime anything of any real interest or significance starts to occur, the sound and images conveniently go to static.Directed by Olatunde Osunsanmi, this warmed-over serving of \\"Chariots of the Gods\\" foolishness - combining ancient Sumerian dialects with invasive body-cavity probing - is strictly for the tin-foil hat crowd."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mockumentary","review":"There have been several movies in recent years that have done a decent job presenting fictional stories as documentaries but this isn't one of them. For starters, Mila Jovovich opens the movie with a monologue as herself (\\"I'm Mila Jovovich...\\")stating that the footage we're about to see is real - that's an unethical stunt. It's one thing to present documentary style footage and lead the audience to buy into what they're seeing (Blair Witch Project, Paranormal Activity, etc), it's another thing entirely to make a statement that it's real when it's not.

(spell check, I know I know!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Notes from a liar and her dog","review":"The book was great and I think it would be a good book to write about. It's each girl's point of view of their life. This would be a good young ladies book.I liked it because it was telling about each of the girl's personalities. I didn't like how Anotonia's sisters like to spy on her.I like the Charcter Antonia MacPherson because she's different from everyone in her family and she always does something exciting.An exciting scene was when carol says \\"you're been telling people your adopted... that your real parents are going to come and take you away from your real life.\\"I like it because she's expressing her feelings.Somethings i didn't like that some of the chapters are short and it repeats alot of stuff.I recommened this book because i like that they use to be good friends, but then she started writing bad stuff about her friends.That's why they didn't want to be friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"This \\"Liar\\" is a Terrific Read","review":"What a wonderful book! The main character in this novel about a young girl who feels alienated from her family, is a gem . . . someone I would want to know. Her feelings are real and the problems both she and her family members experience in communicating with each other about serious issues are portrayed honestly. The plot is gripping; it seems that there is no way for the issues to be resolved, and they are not resolved perfectly because the book is so real. Once you read this one, you will be hooked waiting for Gennifer Choldenko's next."},{"rating":"1","title":"MISERABLE...","review":"Books, especially books for young people, don't have to be full of misery to get a point across. Didn't see much to laugh about here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really, really, real.","review":"This is the anti-sitcom book--rather than earth-shaking problems being resolved in half an hour, minus ads, this books shows the conflicts between Ant and the adults around her clearly and realistically, and begins the resolution process imperfectly and honestly. Ant feels she has to lie to get any notice in her family. Ant's Mom and Dad are fed up with lieing and refuse, then, to listen or give Ant any attention, positive or negative, unless she had said something so outrageous it cannot be let go. Circular conflicts that feed on each other are realistically and thouroughly portrayed in this phenominal first novel by Gennifer Choldenko. A great book for discussion groups, too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My wife was thoroughly disappointed","review":"I got this gift wrapped for my wife's xmas present.

The acting is all right, but there really isn't any story and it's generally neither enjoyable nor believable.

Right from the start of the movie where Santa comes down the chimney, bounces on the table and 'carves' up the family during Christmas dinner, to the ending where Santa has the \\"battle\\" you'll laugh.The plot synopsis in the movie description sums it up well.The movie isn't for children, but older teenagers and up it should be fine.

There is some clever mixing and a few extra instruments brought in for effect on a few tracks. But what mostly makes this CD unique is the words, which seem designed to instill homophobia.

Sadly, these were dealt with in passing. The sinking of the German destroyer fleet in Narvik, for example, is barely given a paragraph! Also, this book is overloaded with explanation marks and rather dry and poor humor.On the other hand, it is a good history of the political machinations - which were no less dramatic than the military ones. On all sides other than the German (Norwegian, British, and French) there were ever-changing arguments, strategies, and conflicts ultimately leading to both defeat and replacing Neville Chamberlain.It is a worthwhile book, but would be better off subtitled \\"The Political Conflict Between the Allies.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Interested in true revival?

I also really liked the seamless look, great to wear under t-shirts. It doesn't come up too high under the armpits and does not have a band under the cups, so there is nothing to roll up.

It arrived ahead of schedule which was great, but now I have to send them back because of the defect with the wire the other stuff I could have dealt with but the wire shift makes it hella uncomforatble to wear all day long.

Your item must plug in at the wall outlet, only it does so into the back of another plug. So you have a plug into a plug into the wall, with a very long wired on/off switch. The design is awful, since the plug into another plug into the wall adds weight to, and puts pressure on, the plug that makes contact with the wall outlet causing it to droop. It is not compatible with a wall wart and should also not be described as an extension cord, since it doesn't extend your ability to plug something in far from the wall outlet it just has a really long on off foot switch. A useless product of poor design and quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"woods extension cord","review":"I have a woods extension with a remote foot switch but is also an extension cord with three areas to connect to.

Possibly if you are a committed Catholic and interested in the difference between today's Catholic beliefs and those of fifty years ago, this novel might keep you awake. Otherwise, this novel is exhausting in its exploration of an inexperienced priest's coming-of-age, and the plot is slow-paced--I couldn't make it to the promised murder. Besides, the victim was so uninteresting, I couldn't bring myself to care who might have killed her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening!","review":"I saw this when it aired on A&E, and though I have always been a huge fan of John Wayne, there were a great many things that I did not know.

You use it to connect the fence to your charger/controller, even if you have no gates or breaks in your electric fence! It's also what you use to connect sections of electric fencing separated by things like gates, etc.. For what it is, it works great..For hooking up your electric fence, remember you need two runs of it! One to the actual fence wire, the other to the grounding rod! So make sure you have the proper length. For connecting sections of fence, you only need a single run between the separate sections.It has a solid plastic shielding on it, but I didn't need anything besides normal wire cutters to work with it. For stripping it, you can use guarged wire strippers/cutters, but I'd use beefier wire cutters to actually cut it. it's a pretty solid wire, if I recall correctly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way overpriced","review":"Purchased toy as a gift.

Ever since, the drive has become unreliable, resulting in uncorrectable 'chkdsk' errors and causing file corruption errors. The drive has been formatted multiple times to no avail.The SimpleTech 2GB flash drive was one of the first, and by far the cheapest one to market.

So I rated this as a bad product. I only spent five-dollars for the thing, and to me, it's not worth going through the trouble to return it. But I suggest going elsewhere, and find a better product. I really wish I would have known the strength of the magnets and how many there were because there are only two small magnets.

The music is brilliantly written and well performed, and based on those qualities alone I would easily give this CD a five-star rating.Unfortunately, the sound quality is not up to the standards I expect from a commercial disc. The music, like most choral compositions, contains a very wide dynamic range, and there is discernable audio clipping during the loud passages on nearly every track.Don't get me wrong, this is a truly enjoyable disc, and a must-have for any Whitacre fan, especially since there is no other recording of the complete a cappella works available.

I remember practicing it and getting chills everytime we sang it. When we finished singing the piece, the audience gave us a standing ovation. My choir director got so many positive comments about that one piece than the others we sang. Whitacre's use of ethereal layered voices is just spectacular. His choral pieces are some of my favorite to sing or, in this case, listen to. I truly hope he continues to expand the horizons of modern music."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Recording Resonates with Joy","review":"I first encountered the choral music of Eric Whitacre when performing the piece \\"Sleep\\" with my college chorale. This recording by the BYU University Singers well captures the resonant joy that exudes from Whitacre's inventive yet approachable choral style. Whitacre's manipulation of chordal voicing creates a wash of sound which the BYU Singers approach with a simple, yet exhilerating vibrato-less style. The performances are a bit staid at points where I would have appreciated more rubato. But on the whole one cannot help smiling at the precision and depth of sound the group produces. This is a cappella choral music at its finest."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Journey of Musical Ecstasy","review":"From the first track to the last this CD carried me from the sweetest joy to the deepest sorrow and back again.

Its a cheap piece of glass and you get what you pay for. You are better off with just about any other option"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont use it...","review":"It creates not a nice effect on UWA lens such as my sigma 10-20mm.

On DVD. I bought \\"The Flight of the Phoenix\\" recently and inside was a flyer entitled \\"Hollywood Heroes.\\" When I opened it up, the first picture of a DVD was \\"The 300 Spartans,\\" with a caption stating \\"Never Before Released.\\" Wow! It's been a long time. But it seemed like it was already out because the back of the flyer said new to dvd. Looking forward to it. As a kid, it introduced me to the history of ancient Greece."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 1/2 Stars","review":"Good little 60's mini epic. While not as grand as El Cid or Spartacus, this is a decent and often under appreciated film. For the younger movie viewer who has seen Frank Miller's 300, you will laugh at the not so bloody battle scenes and special effects. But for the times, it was as bloody as they would allow and this is the time of no CGI. This version of 300 is more historically accurate than the modern film, though a proper Greek phalanx would be a tight line of men many rows deep. I enjoy this little epic despite the flaws."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Battle of Thermopylae (480 BC)","review":"There is a monument at the site of the battle, with Simonide's epigram to the Spartans; translated it reads: \\"Go tell the Spartans, stranger passing by, that here, obedient to their laws, we lie\\". This is an exciting movie about the epic Battle of Thermopylae where 300 Spartans and the Spartan king Leonidas died fighting an overwhelming force of Persians. Whereas technical inaccuracies may be cited, it is still a great movie. Richard Egan turns in a grand performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"300 Spartans . . . and hardly one will be missed","review":"Given the quality of the main cast, the number of extras engaged, and the storyline, it's hard to see how this film could fail in its purpose. But like the real 300, it does. At first glance it has the look of an expensive epic. Yet, despite the presence of Richard Egan and Sir Ralph Richardson and an assortment of usually proficient actors, it's a lacklustre enterprise, ranging from the wooden to the excessively theatrical, an unintentional parody of history. In a film this bad, being bumped off early on must have been a relief. The theme music redeems the effort in part, for one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"1.5 stars out of 4","review":"The Bottom Line:Dull, slow, and seemingly interminable, The 300 Spartans is a leaden war film with awful battle scenes (watch the extras try to catch the spears to their chests to make it appear they were hit by them), campy acting and turgid direction; while the more recent 300 was no classic, it's certainly more entertaining than this stinker of a film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another \\"peplum\\" (sward and sandal) epic of the era","review":"I saw the film in 1962, the era of italian \\"sword and sandals\\" epics, this was a little better than usual, mainly for his American participation, they say Greece helped on the stagin of the battle. in cinemascope was OK. for children matinee.The acting is bad and the dubbing is worst.But those films had their charm, and it remains today."},{"rating":"1","title":"300 Lost Spartans","review":"So where is it?When I saw it advertised here last March (for a 3 June, 2003 release date),I immediately included it in my Wish List.

I mean, don't get me wrong, what we have here is essentially the same story as was seen in Frank Miller's 300...only without the darkness, the choreography,the effects, the mystical exaggerations,the grit, and the gore...but this one's only a keeper for those who can stomach the cheesiness that became so many 1960's swords & sandals epics, attempting to duplicate thje success of true classics like Ben-Hur, Sparticus, and the like. Long story short...I bout this is late February and it took me until just yesterday to finally watch it to the end because I kept sleeping on it. 1960's 300...only the exact opposite of Frank Miller's 300. Not for me...wait until Frank Miller's 300 is on dvd, seriously...zzzzZZZZZZZz"},{"rating":"1","title":"300 spartans","review":"i bought this movie to compare with the 300. not even in the same universe. this is so poorly acted and directed that its awonder anyone would put their names on it. the story of the spartans at Thermopylae is so big and compelling you wouldnt think a director and actors could make it so small and comical."},{"rating":"1","title":"The 300 Spartans","review":"One of the worst movies I ever saw.

This is truly the worst film I have ever seen other than made for tv movies. Please! do not waste your time on this. I sold it to a used dvd store for 2 dollars and felt like I ripped them off. I have never sold a dvd before (and I have hundreds), but this one made the cut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Sword and Sandals Fun!","review":"I enjoyed this movie and have watched it several times. Quite a bit of the dialogue is lifted directly from Herodotus' account of the event.The only drawback is some of the wooden acting from the \\"Spartan\\" spy and the sappy dialogue between a young Spartan and his girlfriend. If they could edit out the scenes between those two, the movie would be far better.Other than that it's definately fun and worth watching!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Routine but mildly interesting sword and sandal","review":"The story of how 300 Spartans sacrificed themselves at Thermopylae in the battle against Persia here becomes an only mildly interesting film, though it has its merits: Sir Ralph Richardson gives a good performance as the great Athenian statesman Themistocles, the landscape photography is impressive, and there's a very good score by noted Greek composer Manos Hatzidakis. But these can't save the film from its wooden acting in most roles, a trite script, pedestrian direction, and an unconvincing and obviously tacked on romantic interest in the form of a pair of young star-crossed Spartan lovers.All in all, I'd say this movie would be of interest to people particularly interested in Ancient Greece or in the Hollywood sword-and-sandal epic genre. Others are likely to find it watchable but forgettable. (Triva note: it's the only movie I can think of in which the script includes a few lines of ancient Greek.) The Fox DVD transfer is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good moive for History buffs..","review":"If you are like me you will enjoy this movie for its historical value. A good percentage of it appears very factual. While it is a little dated and cheesy.. this 1962 movie is way better then the newer version called \\"300\\". I saw both movies back to back and this movie is far superior to the modern version which in one word is \\"horrible\\". See my review on it for why.So if you like history and want to learn from your movie choose this version, which is a very good representation of what happened, why it happened and what it may have looked like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad product","review":"I hoped to have a classy sleeve when I bought this product but it is no where near being elegant.

Also, the covers seem prone to ripping and tearing as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for boys & girls","review":"We've had this book since my twins were 2 years old. They both love it.

What was this all about?\\"Do yourself a favor, and read J.Feghhi's grossly mistitled book \\"Web Developer's Guide to Java Beans\\" instead - an excellent introduction to beans programming, and a terrific comparison between Beans, DCOM, and CORBA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Essential?","review":"The value of this book depends on your interests and knowledge in opera. I agree with the previous reviewer on the books' strenghts so let me just emphasize the reasons why I din't like it: 1 - The authors defend their choices by stating that they do not know how to define the 100 best operas so they just pick the 100 essential ones. That seems silly to me. One could have objectively decided what are the 100 most performed or recorded operas and recomend their best recordings. That, I think, would have been a useful introductory text. 2 - Quite aside from the actual choices of operas the chosen recordings are, at times, quite idiosyncratic, just like in the original, full size, rough guide to the opera book. They seem to compensate the choices of modern operas for the \\"essential\\" repertoire by picking many old recordings for several of them. For these reasons I can not think of any group of people (begginers/experts/occasional collectors etc..) to whom I would recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Violent World Tribute is 10 x's better","review":"This is the lousiest tribute albums I have ever heard. The Violent World tribute album is way more superior. These bands seem to be trashing the Mifits legacy , not honoring it.

Being all the artist on that record are nothing but corprite rock hacks. Geting to the death metal, the Misfits pioneered horror-punk. Death metal, is one of its off-shoots.What better way to replay a misfits song then to uses one of the styles the helped create.

Alas, it - and the remainder of the contents - are not the original versions, but horrid, recent remakes.

You may like some of these tenors, you may not like some of them, but that's not the point. The point is to introduce you to a bunch of tenors in a minimum amount of time and space, and this is what this recording does splendidly. With few exceptions, each tenor featured here gets to sing the piece (or one of the pieces) he is most famous for. These are, obviously, NOT all of the tenors you can imagine, but they well represent the standard tenor repertory presented on this disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive","review":"I really enjoy the quality and presentation of all the Celtic Woman DVDs.Now that I've had said that; allow me to to say that I hate to be deceived.Since this was nothing but a montage of the previous concert DVDs, the producers should have made that clear.

However I do mind that they are not authentic voices. I have been in the performance production busines for many years and it is obvious to me that all of the vocals in this \\"live\\" concert are dubbed. Meaning that the nicely dressed and coiffed young women are not singing. The voices may be in fact theirs but these are just lipsynching videos. I find that makes them much less authentic. If you have ever seen other Celtic performers ie. Chieftains, it is of crucial importance that the performances be real. These Celtic Women videos are all fluff, the singers look too much like they came off of a Las Vegas soundstage, and, as I said, the lip synching takes away any possibility of an authentic experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"JM","review":"I thought there would be new material on this DVD.

I would not recommend it for individuals first learning this material. The book is frankly contradictory in places, and frustratingly repetitive in others. In the early chapters it assumes concepts not yet explained, and introduces terminology and symbols that are nowhere defined.If you already know quite a bit, you may find this approach enlightening. But if you're just beginning to master these concepts, I suggest you look elsewhere.I also suggest that much tighter editing would do this book a world of good.

No one could learn forms fromthis book without a professor leaning over theirshoulder. The formalism and exotic notationalone would be overwhelming.To offset this the author should give detailed andsubstantial worked examples (much more than justthe simple ex of polar coordinates as this one does).Furthermore, there are some eccentricities in theexposition such as section 8.9 which is offered asa novelty but which in fact appears in virtually everytext on vector analysis which treats applications.If you want to learn about this stuffand have a much better time doing it,check out John Baez'swebsite and save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone light a match, because this book stinks.","review":"It would be nice if the code in Crowley's case study implementation of an operating systems class would actually compile!

References to specific algorithms and how they are implemented in REAL operating systems would have added much to this book. (i.e. Like what scheduling algorithm does Linux use in its virtual memory management and contrast that with what algorithm WinNT uses. Benifits, problems, etc.)Frankly, Crowley's book is too idealistic to be useful. I recomend buying a real OS book! Like the Stallings OS book. Also, the OReilly book on the Linux Kernel rocks!

Don't misunderstand, I think he added a distinct flavor, ESPECIALLY on Burgers but on the live electric sets (this and Classic Hot Tuna Electric) he gets annoying and repetitive after about two songs.If you're just discovering Tuna, I still recommend Burgers or the first Hot Tuna Live as starting points."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot ******* Tuna!!!!!","review":"Probably the BEST ELECTRIC Hot Tuna ever put out.

This is just a much more creative album. It's also more technical than previous albums too.

He adds a new edge to the band's sound by making it a little more atmospheric. The one thing that angers me, though, is that some people said the band sold out because they did their first music video. How f***ing stupid is that?!

Also check 'em out at Gigantour."},{"rating":"2","title":"not technical?","review":"Not technical? you got to get out of your bedroom with your guitar girlfriend and get in a studio and try to put something together like Ghost of perdition. That song, the middle especially, is as intricate as metal should get without sounding overdone. TOO Technical can sound like garbage. The song has musical ups and downs, which has always been their trademark and the sound quality is much better then previous albums due to the fact that they make more money and can afford a better sound engineer.

Mikael Akerfeldt's vocals were the thing that got me. I thought it was truly amazing. The vocals range from hauntingly brutal death vocals to beautiful, clean melodies, which i have found is what makes this band. Perfect examples are \\"Ghost of Perdition\\", and \\"Baying of the hounds.\\"Not only was this an awesome album that satisfied my musical taste, it opened up a whole new world of metal for me.

Music in our time must be listened to in order to sort traditions and gain perspective.

All of the \\"serious\\" music of North Americans has deep roots in the European tradition, and this includes the Classical and the Metal genres. Ghost Reveries is not some empty, head banging gesture- rather, it boasts achingly beautiful melodic lines, with clean and lyrical vocals. Each song features imaginative instrumentation and ideas. Opeth uses a characteristic \\"voice\\" in some of the weightier sections, and it's more like a character in the music, rather than just some heavy posturing.All round, atmospheric, nice dual guitars, epic concepts and sweep - a great outing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's been done before, and much better too.","review":"\\"Too Scary and Powerful\\"---Give me a break, I can't stand all of these retarded bands that use cookie monster vocals instead showing any sense of tone whatsoever.

So all in all this album was another fantastic opeth album but i think future opeth albums will not be the same with the 10+ minute songs i think opeth might try to make there songs shorter so they can be put on TRL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Opeth has returned.","review":"What a breath of fresh air. The metal scene right now, while better than it has been in years, still lacks something. Most bands are total ripoffs of the Gothenburg heavy metal scene. Outside that, there are few acts doing something unique. I have never hesitated to say that Opeth is that band. Every album is new, yet still classic Opeth. Ghost Reveries pushes the envelope one step further. It is easily their best since Blackwater Park. The songwriting has been kicked up since Deliverance/Damnation. The songs are notably more progressive and the mellow parts and mellow tunes are a bit more interesting than much of the work on Damnation. This is an essential album for any metal fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the Masters of their Art","review":"It takes time to understand the depth and breadth of Opeth's music. Going to an Opeth's concert to see their expertise, their passion for the music and the sheer power of their music will probably help those who are still skeptical. As for people who thinks that Ghost Reveries is not as good as earlier albums, I just simply say that you have to let the band progress and be a bit unpredictable. After all, that's what they have always been. If they keep churning out My Arms Your Hearse 1,2,3 like some bands out there, it will be waste of their talents and creativity.With that in mind, i think it deserves all 5 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"And I embrace bereavement\\"","review":"Probably one of Opeth's best albums to date.

I think that these bands are nothing more than a fad ,who claim to be real metal listeners but would soil themselves if they went to a real concert. It has come to my attention that Roadruner has taken complete control of this band it is also quite evident .1 star for lack of creativity and being a false metal band it has all been done before . By the way Opeth is quite lauphable in concertonly a fool and a enemy of metal music would give this more than 2 stars .You need to get passed the illusion this is all FALSE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story!

However, my daughter got this doll for her birthday, and I honestly think she is just as cute and even better in some ways. This Strawberry Shortcake doll has a pleasant strawberry scent that is much stronger than the Bandai SSC doll. This doll has long, shiny hair that doesn't frizz when you comb it and your child can style it in so many different ways. Her outfit is hip and seems to be of pretty good quality (some of the Bandai SSC doll clothes ripped and were a bit flimsy). However, she is slightly bigger than the Bandai dolls so the outfits from my daughter's Bandai SSC collection don't really fit this doll.

Back when their first album, Okay? came out, I remember reading about them in Puncture magazine. This is before Pavement started putting out proper albums. I got the distinct feeling that people were thinking that it was either Lovechild or Pavement who would be changing the game. Pavement, ultimately, is who we all read about now, but it really could have been Lovechild. After all, they traveled in the same circles.While their first album is a great example of off-kilter indie pop, Witchcraft focused on a much darker, sinister vibe. It traded the jokey lyrics for insightful reveals. One-minute songs stretched out to over 10 minutes in \\"The Rose is a Thorn\\". Alan Licht's searing guitar is amazing throughout.Lovechild's oeuvre is the secret history of indie rock. It lives in a strange parallel universe. I guess it just turns out that way sometimes, no?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work well for me -- dries and creases","review":"As a Clinique devotee, I really wanted to like this product, but it just isn't a good one for me.

It seems very much alive and growing to the challenge of a better understanding on my part. You may not like the perspective. However, accurate observation and a profound knowledge of human behavior and aim will disregard the wrapping they are delivered in. To call this a \\"Science Fiction\\" book is misleading. It is easier to read a newspaper at a certain distance from your face - and so it is perhaps easier to accept and digest the most uncomfortable facts about human society (and yourself) if the author goes about her business describing those from an outer-space-view.

After seeing it, I bought the book (w/ 4 novellas, including Apt Pupil and The Body -- inspired Stand By Me) and the soundtrack. I wish that this film would have been honored with at least one Academy Award in 1994. Instead of giving an Academy Award to Morgan Freeman for a tremendously difficult performance, the powers that be gave the award to Tom Hanks for Forrest Gump in, let's face it, a caricaturish role.

A hero that THINKS his way through crisis and danger, rather than the typical kick butt in most movies.The way this movie misleads and surprises the viewer is tremendous.

However, I would like to go further, and suggest that Shawshank redemption is one of the worst movie's ever made. For starters, it's got Morgan Freeman in it. Morgan Freeman(this spelling may be wrong, but I don't care) is a man of limited talents: he can play a guy hunting a serial killer, and sometimes the president, but when he tries to act he's terrible. And you know I'm right.Two: The film is really boring, goes on forever, covers a span of decades yet the cast never age(Morgan freeman should be dead by the end), has voiceover to explain everything, is really sentimental, everything ends ridiculously happily, he escapes in a stupid way, it actually contains the tagline \\"hope can set you free\\" and so on and so on.Three: The film's star, Tim Robbins, actually said it was awful. He is right and you are all wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated treacle","review":"This paean to middle-aged scofflaws, attempts to persuade the viewer to side with rapists, thieves, and murderers.

The first thirty minutes were about some murderer dropping the soap too many times, then a little while later some old guy becomes an hero, then they go to Mexico and hang out on the beach.

Evidently, author King did.Perhaps his mind works better in his home state. Freeman and Robbins finally get out; the revenge factor against a corrupt establishment is the key theme to the movie. But, what of those who never get out? Next, the realism of the movie is abeted by its brutality scenes, pictures of which one would rather deny. One would also assume in 2008, the likelihood of such a scheme succeeeding would be next to impossible.Yet, reports of 3 million incarcerations at present in the USA makes one wonder. Finally, the movie is totally engrossing, leading to multiple viewings. The reason for this,I suspect,is probably different for every individual. Please take the time to mull over your reasoning.

I watch this once a year, and every time, it makes me weep with empathy. There are wonderful characters, funny, pathetic, and strong, as they survive in a brutal prison, run by a corrupt evangelical christian sociopath; the warden is the perfect mirror for the horror over which he presides.The story is perfect, full of struggle and wonderful surprises, recounted by Red, the friend of Andy. Andy is a remarkably resourceful man, who pursues several agendas at the same time, with patience and passion and pain. Red, who becomes his intimate and special friend, helps him and then learns essential lessons from him about the value of life and freedom.

I have reviewed this movie for Yahoo.com but, I like it enough to review it again here. Freeman and Robbins made a great on screen dual male lead. This movie is filled with realism and suspense. I must say the first time I watched it I was stunned at the twist ending. I should also say this was a movie adapted from the book \\"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption\\", written by Stephen King. King is an incredible story teller. I like this movie better than another adaption. I have enjoy Kings work for many years but, this is really a deep story line.I can't think of a scene that I like any better that the twist scene so I will not detail it as to hold the suprise for those who haven't seen it. Its a great movie just buy it and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest movies of all time!","review":"This movie is definately one to buy and watch over and over again. An incredible, compelling story with superb acting. Usually I like the original book better than the movie, but this one is an exception - Stephen King's story (\\"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption\\") is good - this movie is GREAT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Title, A Perfect Film","review":"There are few films as sublime as \\"Shawshank Redemption\\". Morgan Freeman's narration is impeccable Timothy Robbins shall not do a better movie I predict. This is a lazy man's prediction for \\"Shawshank Redemption\\" has a screenplay based on a Stephen King story that is flawless, acting that is awesome and directing that is thoughtful.I could waste my time and yours by giving you the the low down on the plot, but this movie is to be seen not to be talked about. It is that good. It is one of those rare major motion pictures that could be called a poem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Job","review":"The DVD was what I expected, new. It was on time and in perfect shape. Oh yeah, it's a good movie too. A future classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"Outstanding performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman!!!!! It is a classic movie, but not for the faint of heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic film of the human spirit","review":"This is truely a rare film, where the triumph of the human spirit shines through. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are absolutely superb in this movie and all of the other supporting actors make this film worth watching over and over again. It shows the worst of the human spirit and how it ruins a person completely to showing the best of the human spirit and how it can redeem and cleanse a mans soul even in the worst possible conditions. The narration by Freeman during the movie adds even more to the overall story. This was brilliantly adapted from Stephen King's short story, and I highly recommend it to everyone who wants to see a brilliant piece of film making."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fear can hold you prisoner; hope can set you free...","review":"Why am I adding another review to 265 others? Just merely to justify that this - in my opinion - is the greatest film ever made. Until today I still think that The Shawshank Redemption is the most extraordinary, impressive and engrossing film I've ever seen. I watched this film 4 years ago; and only recently when I bought a DVD player I decided to purchase the dvd as my first investment. After seeing it for the second, there was so much more I didn't get in the first time. Throughout the movie, a constant message of hope transcends as its short but intelligent plot unfolds. This film is a rare accomplishment that will uplife and move you."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite movies","review":"The Shawshank Redemption is definitely one of my all time favorite movies. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman do an outstanding job in their roles. The story and characters are just phenomenal.

This is truely a great movie and would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"INVINCIBLE CLASSIC","review":"A MOVIE THAT GRABS YOUR ATTENTION AND DOESN'T LET GO UNTELL THE VERY LAST MINUTES OF THIS FEEL GOOD MOVIE. FREEMAN SHOWS HIS ACTING HIS HIS BEST ROLE UP TO DATE, AND ROBBINS IS ONE ACTOR THAT GOES BEYOND BRILLIANT. THE SCRIPT ALONE IS SOMETHING TO BE WORSHIPED AND PRAISED FOR YEARS TO COME.

The acting is good, the lines are good, the plot thickens. and heck, it is Morgan Freeman. He's awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A shockingly-good movie","review":"Many movies have been set in prisons, but none with the story of this magnitude. Not one with characters so endearing, so believable. I do believe it's in part due to the wonderful writing of Stephen King's story, from which this film is adapted, but some of the credit has to go to the actors and directors.Red and Andy are like peas and carrots. Like Peanut butter and jelly. They're yin and yang.An uplifting story with a great central message. The prison has your body but you don't have to let it steal your mind... or your heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"You gotta be kidding....","review":"The #2 best movie of all time? Are you kidding? \\"Shawshank Redemption\\" is formulaic, dumbed-down Hollywood treacle. The heavy-handed Morgan Freeman voice-overs right away indicate that you're in for two hours of safe, sentimental mass-appeal entertainment devoid of any irony or intelligence.The movie's depiction of gays (the \\"Harpies\\" in the prison) as violent rapists out to defile decent heterosexual men needlessly promotes dangerous stereotypes.\\"Shawshank\\" isn't a horrible movie. It's just a mediocre one that doesn't belong even near any \\"Best Movies of All Time\\" lists."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed,overly hyped.","review":"After many years of hearing How great this movie is, I Finally saw it. I was very disappointed; itwas way too long, and had the usual hollywood baggage. In 20 years no 1 ever ages. Only 1 prisoner ever admits their guilt. Anyone with a religious view point Is of course a vicious hypocrite. Robbins's Portrayal is so understated as to border on comatose. The climactic development Is patently ludicrous morgan freeman is great. I feel no great interest in ever seen this movie again. this is not even the best movie I saw this weekend, much less of alltime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Definitely the type of oscar-winning movie that will put you to sleep inside an hour. This movie was lame, dry, amd very slow-moving. Why people liked this thing so much? I do not know. I did not feel suspense and/or was I riveted to my seat at all in this movie. Extremely 2-dimensional and the plot of someone trying to get out of jail, I thought was lacking substance. There are way better movies out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely overrated","review":"I have been hearing great things about this 'classic\\" movie since it came out in 1994, but only saw it for the first time recently. Even the librarian who checked it out for me vouched for it in the strongest terms (women especially seem to love this movie, for some reason). I found it to be mildly engaging, but formulaic, saccharine, surprisingly vulgar, and painfully cliched. I will never watch it again. For a truly great prison movie, watch \\"Cool Hand Luke\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Another boring oscar-winning movie. I thought that this was one of the dullest films I have ever seen. The story was so boring and slow-moving. I was wondering when (if ever) something would happen. I found nothing special in this film, just another boring sentimental flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Emotional Suspense","review":"There aren't enough words in the english language to give this movie the justice it deserves. An absolutely captivating performance by both Robbins and Freeman. A story so simple in concept becomes an epic undescribable in words. No reason as to why this awe-inspiring classic didnt receive the recognition it is so deserving of."},{"rating":"2","title":"packaging","review":"Bought the blu-ray book packaging version for $8 from amazon and received the package just now. I opened it and got blown away by the book material inside. Nice photographs from the movie, lots of information about the actors, darabond, stephen king... Has to be the best purchase on Amazon. I don't know about the quality of the blu-ray encoding but others have said it's pretty good. Frankly, I don't care. The booklet itself is worth $8."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish I could give this movie more stars","review":"Morgan Freeman and TIm Robbins best performance. Best movie I have ever seen. If you consider yourself a movie fan you have to own this movie. I wish I could give this movie more stars than 5 cuz it deserves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hands down, the best movie of all time.","review":"Sometimes I wish I could go back and experience this movie for the first time, and sometimes I'm glad that I've seen it twenty times already. I'm always finding new things to love, and the movie never fails to amaze me. This movie is simply, well made, well acted, and an all around great examlple of what good movie making can produce."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece!!","review":"What a great great movie. The writer and director put together this BRILLIANT movie. A \\"Cant Miss\\" which I watch 5-6 times a year and will continue to watch over and over for the rest of my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly wonderful","review":"I absolutely loved The Shawshank Redemption. This is a film about hope and how we can survive the worst of situations. It's among my all-time favorites behind: 1. Saving Private Ryan 2. Braveheart 3. Forrest Gump 4. Silence of the Lambs 5. The Shawshank Redemption."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best","review":"This is truly one of the finest films ever made. It is sweeping, heartbreaking and uplifting. It has surpassed Star Wars as the movie I've viewed the most times. I never get tired of it and the emotions never cease to pull me into those prison walls. The characters are a part of my imagination now. They carry stronger memories than some people I've known. I can see Andy and Red now on the shore of the Pacific. Do yourself a favor, buy this without a doubt. You will never regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie Great Packaging","review":"Love this movie. It shows on A&E all the time but wanted my own copy regardless. A must have for people who appreciate good dialogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Movie!","review":"This is just an all around great movie.

Shawshank Arrives on Blu-Ray","review":"Length:: 3:05 MinsForgive me if I was repeating some stuff in the video. Again, there isn't a thing wrong with the video quality. It is, like is said, better (plus in widescreen edition) with color and sharpness enhancement."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Diamond in the Rough!!","review":"When this movie came out in 1994, I never heard of the movie.It wasn't till 2000-2001 when me and ex-wife bought the movie.She said it was one of her favorite movie, so as a loving husband IBought it for her not knowing anything about it.It wasn't long after we bought it that this movie became one of my all time favorite movies.Even though me & my ex aren't together anymore I still watch this movie from time to time.I rate this DVD a 5 of 5 stars!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies...","review":"not much to say here...except this is one of my favorite movies, hands down. the acting is superb and the story itself, is just amazing. freeman and robbins were great together. get this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"The Shawshank Redemption is one of those movies where after you are finished watching it, you feel good about life, about the power of the human spirit. Andy Dufresne who is accused of murder and sent to prison. This is the story of his life in prison and how he didn't get eaten up by the system. How he kept his hope and his will to live alive. If you haven't seen this movie you will come away moved, on how good men can still be good in an evil situation.Morgan Freeman narrating as Red gives the film a classic feel to it, his voice sounds like a grandfather's voice, and in narrating the story from his point of view and not Andy's, you get the feeling of tribute. This movie is a classic and belongs in any good collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Words cannot describe how masterful this film is. Tim Robins and Morgan Freeman are one of the best duos to ever hit the big screen. They're chemistry together is uncanny. The cinematography is great. The scripting is right on point. And the characters actions are justifiable. Shawshank sucks you in from beginning to end. From the moment Tim's character enters the gates--you feel as though you're being sucked in with him. You feel his pain and you begin to relate to all of the inmates. The movie is very inspirational and offers some form of hope to a brighter better future. I love it. I just love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shawshank cant be made twice","review":"The best movie in every movie store. There can be no other movie that reaches the heights of this one. Its a true classic. For me its the measuring stick. I compare all other movies to this one. I give Godfather I and II a score of 9/10. 10 being shawshank. I simply cannot accept another movie that can be like the Shawshank. not possible.......Everyone who watches this is forced to give it 5 stars. Guys like me get a little carried away and 5 seems to short a number for stars if the movie is shawshank. I just get goose bumps everytime i hear morgan freeman delivering those wonderful dialogues. Man what a movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest movie's on DVD","review":"One of the greatest movies of all time, it's one of those movie's that can infulence a change in your life. This movie has some great lessons like: Don't do anything half-assed/ If your gonna do something give it a 110%, Don't do anything you might regret, hope is something you can hold onto and there is much much more. If I were you I would definately buy this movie because it is so good.When Andy (Tim Robbins) is sent to prison for falsely accused of killing his wife that was cheating on him he gains a strong relationship between him and a prison buddy named Red (Morgan Freeman). None of Andy's friends in Shawshank believe that Andy actually killed his wife, through thick and thin Andy and Red experiance events in a prison run by a crooked warden.PARENTAL WARNING: Extremely Strong and Graphic Language and Mild Graphic Violence, and a scene of sexuality (I think)SUGGESTED AGE: Definately 13-14"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Love this movie - always have. Beautifully written, fabulous story, wonderful actors, great set and filming. Can't say enough about how much this movie touches me. It has become my second favorite movie of all time. I highly recommend it to anyone that loves a great story with deep characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Years Later, it is Still the Best Film Ever Made","review":"When reading through some of the viewer reviews, I am shocked to gaze upon such comments as \\"dry\\" and \\"boring\\". I honestly feel sorry for these people. Anyone who cannot allow themselves to be moved and changed by such a great film must be extremely closed minded. The film may not have had explosions and monsters, and naked women from start to finnish, but that is one of the reasons I believe so many people enjoyed it. It was honest and brilliant fimmaking without all of the hollywood bullsh*t. This is the only movie I have seen that has every element I look for in a good movie. Great acting, supurb story telling, and an ending that will make you feel like you are on top of the world. Do yourself a favor and watch this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, What a Surprise!!!","review":"I am the 480th reviewer and am also giving this movie 5 stars. The Shawshank Redemption, in my opinion, is one of the greatest movies ever made. I just happened to watch this movie while reading Viktor E. Frankl's \\"Man's Search for Meaning.\\" Both dovetail perfectly in elaborating on the human spirit. This movie also contains the most gratifying ending of any movie except maybe \\"The Sixth Sense.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite movie of all time","review":"I cannot imagine how someone could give this movie a bad review. Sure, everyone has different tastes, but this is truly a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hope, is maybe the best of things.","review":"The Shawshank Redemption to me was all about hope. Andy never lost sight of hope even in the midst of the horrible, tragic events he faced. He wasn't outspoken but he would never give up on proving his innocence and finding a way out and redemption for all he'd been through. He restored my faith in believing in yourself and never giving up. Hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Service","review":"Received movie in timely manner. Product received in excellant condition.

So many different emotions throughout the film but by the end will make an impression on the viewer."},{"rating":"2","title":"hope...","review":"this is an interesting film that i have watched many times and i will without being bored.the shawshank redemption shows us the importance of HOPE and it is a serious work i think; however there are a little more goofs in it.but it is okey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could Have Been Great","review":"Good movie, but I've got two complaints:Firstly, I like sad endings - think Midnight Cowboy, Dog Day Afternoon, One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest. I would have much preferred an ending where we didn't know for sure whether Red would meet up again with Andy. You know, as in its Red's SEARCH for Andy that is poignant, whether he actually FINDS his friend, or whether his search is futile - we're better off not being told.Why do you Americans need films with happy endings, anyway?Secondly, I loved the fact that we don't know at the start whether Andy is guilty or innocent. The episodic bit in the middle of the film - with the \\"kid\\" and the overheard jailhouse confession story that proves Andy innocent - spoils this ambiguity for me. The Andy character is much more complex when you don't quite know whether he's an innocent man (as he claims), or whether he's a good (but flawed) man who's been pushed passed his breaking point. Now, that really would be about \\"Redemption\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest movies of all time","review":"With tremendous performances by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins this movie is a work of art that leaves you warm inside. A must own for any respectable collection. Based on 80,000+ votes on IMDB this movie is rated second only to The Godfather, as the best movie of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Shawshank Redemption","review":"Adapted from a Stephen King story, Darabont's \\"Redemption\\" reinvigorates the prison-drama genre with a robust, deeply touching story about courage, friendship, and the persistence of hope amid the regimentation of life in the Big House. Robbins gives a masterful performance as the aloof, enigmatic inmate whom everyone--including the bulls--comes to respect. And Freeman brings his own Southern gentility to the role of Red, the wizened con whose bond with Andy takes him to a very unexpected place: the outside world. Excellent support from James Whitmore, William Sadler, Bob Gunton, and gorgeous camerawork by Roger Deakins makes this crowd-pleasing \\"Redemption\\" song worth hearing more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best movie ever","review":"This movie is by far the greatest movie ever ... When I got the movie one side of the case has a very small scratch the movie is perfect:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"An amzing movie","review":"This is my number one favorite movie. It's got so much strength behind it. The story is amazing and the actors are just as great! You will cry tears of sadness, you will cry tears of joy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The beauty of hope and friendship","review":"Hope is a wonderful thing... as is friendship...This film is a story which centres primarily around these two themes and is one of the most moving and uplifting films I have been fortunate enough to see... You don't want to know anything about the events in this film, just that it will change you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top ten of all times","review":"Excellent! The actors are incredible, the story is both interesting and touching. The story is about a man that never lets go of his dreams. Tim Robbins plays the protagonist that forms a lasting friendship with Morgan Freeman. The chemistry between these two is amazing. After this movie I felt compelled to call my best friend to tell him how much I cared about him."},{"rating":"2","title":"question..","review":"Let me understand this..When you say there is no commentary track, does it mean Freeman's narration all through the picture is missing? Or is it an extra goody they \\"mistakenly\\" advertised? This is crucial beacuase I think most people who've seen it on tape and broadcasts will agree that its freeman's narration that adds that pang/(bang?).."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellente.","review":"Near-perfection. A brilliantly acted, superbly plotted, and overall great tale of a man wrongly imprisoned. It combines suspense, human drama and a great script to make for one of the most powerful movies ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shawshenk Review","review":"I missed this movie in the theaters and I missed a great movie. I am very happy to see it come to DVD. The story on the surface is about a friendship between two inmates in Shawshenk Prison. Underneath that story is a story about perseverance, and hope. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give stellar preformances here. The movie for me worked on so many levels, while it was criticized for being too long, I, didn't want it to end. I wanted to know what happened to these characters. The DVD transfer is great and I highly recomend this film for everyone. My only complaint is that it was not a special edition. Mr Darabont is a talented and gifted director and I would like to know more about what he was thinking when he made the Shawshenk Redemption."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie","review":"This movie had everythin that anyone could expect. The acting, plot, setting, and emotion was perfect, and the environment and style touches a spot deep inside of many people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive & Satisfactory ending","review":"One of the best movies I have seen in this past decade. Definitely it deserves the high ratings. Though many of my friends thought it's a boring story, cast in prison (not the idle entertainment show). I was very touched and impressed with the ending, a rather smart, practical and satisfactory ending better than the normal classic revenge of the \\"The Monte Cristo\\" version. I loved the movie and I think one ought to have it in his library."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies ever!","review":"This movie will surely make any heart weep with joy and emotion. It centers around an innocent man triumphing over violence, sexual abuse, and emotional and spiritual devastation that haunts his prison-bound existence. Robbins and Freeman move the viewer with subtleties and friendship and give the performances of their careers, making one of the best duos in movie history. A must see for any one who understands the lows and highs of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful, long movie","review":"Though this is one of the longer types of movies, it is definitely one worth watching (like so many of the great ones are!) You really get connected to the characters and hurt with them and rejoice with them throughout. I have watched this many times and tune in whenever it is on TV regardless where it is in the story line. A must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real picture of the inside's inside","review":"There was reasonable doubt in the guilty conviction of an innocent man condemned to life in prison run by corrupt officials. What else is new; it's not just in Mexico or some thrid world country where this happens (hopefully it won't happen to you or me). The details of this movie are astonishing, at times unpredictable and filled with surprises. A colorful example of how the American system of justice however blind can be dumb and perverted."},{"rating":"2","title":"A film about despair and hope that will leave a smile on your face when it is over.","review":"A great movie with great actors. Even being 2.5 hours long, the time just fly's by. The Blu ray has good but not perfect picture quality and very good sound. It is a step up from DVD but not worth the upgrade if you already own the 2 disc edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"I have watched this movie before, it always keeps my interest.

After having my arm twisted into watching it, I was surprised by this film. It speaks of keeping hope and faith through adversity. Need inspiration? See this film. It has a delightful cast. It's a great story. It has a fantastic plot with a surprise ending that you'll love. There are both poignant and light hearted moments. Buy it. You'll love it, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best films ever, but where's the special DVD set?","review":"We all know Shawshank is one of the best movies of all time, and many of the reviewers have well-described why, so I won't bother rehashing the movie.Rather, I would like to air my puzzlement and irritation with Castle Rock for not releasing the movie in a special DVD set filled with extras. It seems that basically every_single_movie that comes out -- mostly garbage films no one has even seen in the theaters -- gets its own 2-DVD set. Conversely, one of the most popular films of the last generation has been relegated to a limited, basically empty DVD version for nearly 10 years.Shame on the production company, and I plead with them to re-release Shawshank to give it the glory it is entitled to and give Shawshank's many fans a better product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Sent fast! Go it fast in the mail. Will love to do business with these guys again! It's also an AWESOME movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best movie","review":"Agree, this movie is one of the best movies, if not the best. Makes u realize people who are in jail are humans too. Some innocent, some who cant cope with the real life out in the world. I'm a female, and I know women will love this movie as much as men do."},{"rating":"2","title":"From far, one of the best...","review":"I was 12 when I saw it the first time, just loved it, but didn't really catch anything for myself, after 4 years, now 16 I was on CBS and saw that it would be on, I canceled everything I was doing to watch it again, That was the best thing I did, after seeing and analizing the movie and it's wonderfull story made me think a lot, you wonder if a man could really do that in real life, stand all the pressure, well... I think it can happen, and more, it can be us, normal people, as Andy was, if u wanna see this movie be ready to get excited about everything Andy does, and try to apply it to your life, it doesn't matter how hard your life is or how old u are, you still can do it, Just \\"get busy living, or get busy diying\\" if u feel just like this u surelly will like(love) this movie, \\"You may say I am a dreamer, But I am not the only one. I hope some day you will join us, and the world will live as one.\\" John Lennon"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best fictional movie about prison","review":"Even after all these years I still find my self watching this movie from time to time, I am a big fan of documentaries about criminal investigation, court trials and prisons, and this in my opinion seems to be the best fictional movie about prison and incarceration ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern 'Count of Monte Cristo'","review":"I agree with most of the other reviewers. This is a great movie in all respects. But I must point out its similarity to the classic 'Count of Monte Cristo'. An innocent man wrongly convicted and incarcerated in a hellish prison who finds wealth and then has revenge on his accusers. The director presents a subtle hint at this in the scene where the inmates are stocking the library. One of the books being shelved was 'The Count of Monte Cristo'. Nothing more to add except it deserves it's place as one of the all time greats."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great story ever time it is told","review":"Story telling just does not get any better. Steven King's short story was terrific and yet Frank Duramont (director), Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, James Whitmore, Bob Gunton, Clancy Brown, Mark Ralston put capture on film the telling of a tale you will want to hear again and again.It just do not get any better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Man v. The System: Film returns to it's artistic roots","review":"I am normally loathe to give *anything* a perfect score. Perfect scores are just that: perfection. I feel that this movie is indeed perfect. Deep characters, an excellent storyline, believable situations, you name it.The hero, Andy receives a life sentence for the murder of his wife, and then spends the next 20+ years living it out. After quite some time, Andy manages to make friends with a few of the inmates and after being placed in a pivotal position, begins to make real improvements in the prison rehabilitation practices.The movie draws you in and holds you there. There are very, very few movies on the planet that can achieve that all-elusive place of causing you to forget that you're in the real world.Set aside plenty of time to watch this masterpiece so you can enjoy it uninterrupted and prepare to stand in awe of filmmaking as an art."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST!","review":"This has to be one of the best films that I have ever seen in my entire life. A prison movie is an excellent idea and even better than that it was written by Stephen King which means that you know it is going to be really good. I am not going to go on and on about why you should watch this movie or how it is really good. If you like movies and I mean REALLY like them I suggest that you watch this. There is not one boring part in this movie. It just seems to go on and on and on but it keeps you interested as it goes on. So I give this movie a 5 because of the brilliant acting and storyline behind it. I just couldn't think of a better way to spend a friday night then watching this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"One of my favorite movies!Beautiful acting with a powerful message.Great price and quick shipping -I give this a thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic and Wonderful Story","review":"My husband and I watch this movie almost weekly whenever there is nothing else on TV - the repeat of a great story is far superior to some of the trivial junk that is presently on TV. I think that this may be a story about prison life that in many instances is sadly true. The story itself is not without its very strong messages - our favorite \\"its time to start living or time to start dying.\\" After serious illness, my husband has taken that line in the movie to heart and we both see the quality of our lives unfold in a somewhat controlled way by the Grace of God and a series of choices that we all are given the opportunity to make. Not only is the movie an excellent story, but it is blessed with superior acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who doesnt love this movie!","review":"Good quality, no frills, single disc edition.

Good quality, and condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top 5 All time","review":"Quiet reviewer and dedicated aficionado that rarely comments:This is the rare movie that without fail if 'I happen upon it' I cannot turn away, no matter at which point it is in the story.Top 10 Favorite all time quotes:'I guess it comes down to a simple choice.

Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through. It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revenge is so sweet!","review":"This movie is one of the best I have ever seen. I was told by many people to watch it long after the release. Finally I broke down and rented it. What an amazing movie. Tim Robbins is intelligent in every movie he does, but this one is at the height of his career. Tim Robbins potrays a man wrongfully accused of killing his wife and lover. Through his many attempts to prove his innocence, none have worked. He befriends Morgan Freeman, a man that knows the streets and the ins and outs. Their friendship provides strength to get through the many years they serve in prison. Excellent movie, excellent ending, a must have. It has been added to my own personal blockbuster!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT widescreen, check for yourself!","review":"My third submission on this, if you are doubtful, check for yourself. I own the VHS of Shawshank. I recently purchased a DVD player and Shawshank was one of my first disks. I set both the disk and the tape up to play simultaneously, and flipped back and forth to compare the superb quality improvement of DVD. I was in for a surprise. The picture DOES NOT get wider-AS IT SHOULD-and the top and bottom of the picture of the DVD version are ERASED and replaced by the black bars. The other movie I found with this flaw is Jackie Brown. Check out the point where Bridget Fonda \\"services\\" Robert DeNiro. On the VHS widescreen version , her \\"buns\\" disappear. They are fully visable on the fullscreen version! The top and bottom have been erased on the widescreen version and the picture does not get any wider. I suspect more movies have this flaw. Now that we know what to look for, let's look!"},{"rating":"1","title":"clarification of June 1,2000 submission","review":"I reviewed this DVD on June 1, 2000 and wish to clarify myself. The black bars at the top and bottom have ERASED the top and bottom of the movie. In effect, take a full screen movie, cover up the top and bottom with black bars, and the unwary will perceive it as a widescreen film. However, you get less movie for your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"F\\" Word Strikes Again","review":"I've seen this movie on television several times and enjoyed it greatly. A good story of triumph over adversity, however when I purchased the video I was greatly disappointed because the notorious \\" F \\" word ruined the writing for me and the acting as far as I'm concerened. Thats all I could see or hear and it ruined the quality of the movie for me, my husband didn't even enjoy it as much. It's a shame that a briliiant actor and director had to fall victum to the use of vile language when it was proven by the television version that it was completely unnecessary to the impact and story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT LET YOUR CHILDREN WATCH","review":"This movie was a very bad influence for my daughter. She doesn't get out much so we keep her stocked on movies to watch while my husband and i are \\"busy\\". We had bought this film the moment it came out on DVD, and she was very ecstatic. Now i know why! We found that she had slowly chiseled away in our basement and covered it up with her hannah montana posters. Silly girl!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Conned by the retailer","review":"Another victim of false advertising. I ONLY ordered this for the audio commentary (like all the DVDs I own) and there's nothing! Mine's going back for a refund!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No redeeming qualities and an unbelievable ending","review":"I watched this movie after reading several reviews that rated it very highly. Not the usual prison film with violence, riots, etc., they said. Not true! Here is a movie that depicts and accepts severe bullying, both by the prisoners and the guards. The protagonist suffers biweekly beating and sodomy for the first two years; this is trivialized by the narrator as just \\"his routine\\". Perhaps we are to think that this is a movie about the protagonist rising above such humiliation, but the biweekly \\"routine\\" is stopped only by the guards bullying the bully, and the protagonist rises only by becoming a crook. The ending is such a surprise that we have to be shown some scenes cut from earlier in the story, while the narrator explains what we missed. But most unbelievable of all is the escape. The protagonist's cell is in the middle of a row, yet he somehow manages to tunnel through the wall not into the next cell but out to freedom! Give me a break!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent in time and at the Prison site.","review":"I thought it was one of those movies that keep you on your feet. Everytime something happened your were either on your seat or standing on your feet. One of those movies that you just could not stand to miss any of it. It was really done well for all those people that played in this movie. Great Job to everyone. Even the Directors very well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply put, a fantastic movie","review":"I won't go into a long review. 'The Shawshank Redemption' is in my opinion one of the best movies ever. My wife and I own the DVD, plan to purchase the Blue-ray version, and if we are surfing channels on Direct TV and we come across this movie we will watch it. It doesn't matter if we catch it from the beginning, or somewhere in the middle. Just a perfect movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most incredible movies I have ever seen","review":"I have seen this movie about 30 times, mainly because TNT shows it every two weeks. Really good movie to buy, cause you will watch it over and over again. this is the plot summary - \\"Tim Robbins plays a banker named Andy who's sent to Shawshank Prison on a murder charge, but as he gets to know a life-term prisoner named Red (Morgan Freeman), we realize there's reason to believe the banker's crime was justifiable. We also realize that Andy's calm, quiet exterior hides a great reserve of patience and fortitude, and Red comes to admire this mild-mannered man who first struck him as weak and unfit for prison life.\\" Overall I think this is one of the most entertaining movies of all time and has one of the best endings ever recorded on film.A+"},{"rating":"2","title":"indescribable","review":"this movie is one of my favorites of all time. tim robbins and morgan freeman blend fabulously well together with the support of several very good fellow prisoners who's actual names i do not know. tim robbins plays a man who is falsly accused of murder and sent to a prison called shawshank. he is unlike any other man there. i dont want to give away the ending and by saying anymore, i will. so thats it. one thing i must insist on to anyone who watches this is watch it the whole way through without getting up to piss or anything because it will ruin the movie. so go out and rent this as soon as possible and prepare to be amazed. if i could, this movie actually deserves six stars. this is so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendor of Delight","review":"Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are so good in this movie together it makes your jealous of their acting skills. The plot is unique,orginal,smart, and most importantly WELL DONE. I cried, i lauged and i defiantly saw it again and i still am. If you have not encounterted upon this film go see it at once."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of the most beautiful movies ever made!","review":"I love every single moment of this movie - I wouldn't change a frame. Frank Darabont did a marvelous job in telling this story. The film looks wonderful, and the performances are truly stunning. Tim Robbins is convincingly sympathetic, yet strong as the wrongly jailed Andy Dufresne. However, my favorite element of this movie is Morgan Freeman's performance - especially his narration that tells the bittersweet story. His voice is so richly textured, and soulful, you can hear in every word as he relays this story the profound depths of his experiences in Shawshank, and the happiness his friendship with his dignified and graceful friend Andy Dufresne has brought him. It is quite a powerful message to see a man who has given up hope begin to dream again. Everyone goes through times in their lives when they are paralyzed by fear. But this film shows us so eloquently that paradise awaits us if we break out of the prison that fear has the power to create."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hope.","review":"All time favorite movie. I am not a critic, just a guy who watches movies. I will not talk about the screenplay adaptation, or the score, but merely the single most important part of this movie. Hope. This movie has given me something that I now carry with me. The line \\"Get busy livin', or get busy dyin'\\" is the absolute truth, and hearing it has given me something to do now. Get busy livin'. There is hope in the world, and this movie has shown it. A must see in my book, and one that I watch whenever I feel there is nowhere to turn. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"THANKS FOR A LIFE CHANGING FILM","review":"THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER MADE.

Was very pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFULLY BORING!","review":"This movie must have been one of the greatest snores of the decade. It just did not have any substance to it. I was hardly riveted to my seat as I was watching this. The film was very slow and there were very few parts the I actually enjoyed. I do not know why this movie got high ratings.... but for me, it was one of the worst in some time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointed","review":"First off let me state this is my friends favorite all-time movie. I had such high expectations but feel I was let down. Slow moving, felt like the movie was \\"floating\\". The acting was well-done. but moving it wasn't. O well to each his own. I am a comedy/horror fan. I enjoyed Morgan Freeman in \\"SEVEN\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Reason for DVD","review":"I've watched this more times than I remember, but I do remember that I decided in 1997; I wouldn't bother to buy a DVD plyer until this came out... I bought a copy 3 months later. Stephen King did an excellent job as always. check out \\"Different Seasons: A Novelette\\" with 4 stories. Three were made into films, including \\"Stand By Me\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Stephen King's best gets royal treatment","review":"Another Stephen King masterpiece that receives just the right touch on the big screen. The movie is extremely faithful to the short novel, and the few departures are just right. Everyone does a good job with the acting, and the dramatic prison escape in the ending is tear-inducing. There is some restraint on the triumph, as the old men who leave prison are different from the young men who entered. And the division of good prisoner/bad guard was a little too stark to be believed. Overall, though, this is a good movie that has something to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cinematic Perfection","review":"Wow! When I think of \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\", I see it as the most perfectly made movie I have ever seen, flat out! True, it is only my personal third favorite film behind \\"Heart and Souls\\" and \\"Forrest Gump\\", but I do see it as the best movie ever made for it's crafty storytelling. The progression of the characters and the messages throughout this film weave such a strong and profound story that it will leave you breathless. And Morgan Freeman's narration gives such REALISTIC heart that it has the power to touch ANYONE, not just people looking to be touched. Sharp, fresh, and thoroughly powerful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EMOTIONAL ISN'T THE WORD!","review":"THIS IS ONE OF THOSE MOVIES THAT HOLDS YOU AND DOESN'T LET GO.

However, you have to remember that, if you're sitting there enjoying it and willing to pay attention to each and every line from the characters, not to mention willing to pay attention to each new direction the story takes, then it can't be THAT bad. Come on now.The final 30 minutes of film were totally worth it. Think about this- a guy breaks out of prison that can actually have some emotion connected to it? Yes it's true.Morgan Freeman once again shows us why he has never been awful in any film ever. His presence can only increase the amount of enjoyment you get from a movie. A calm character he is, one who always comes across as patient and someone you want to listen to for advice.Well worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much for the special edition.","review":"I payed extra for the special edition copy of this movie, which came with the movie and a metal cover case. When I got the movie it was in a cream colored sealed envelope, when I opened the package the case was so crushed I couldn't even get the movie out to watch it. I guess the extra money I paid for the special edition version was to protect the dvd from getting broken, cause if it wouldn't have had the metal case the dvd would have definitely been broken when I got it."},{"rating":"2","title":"greatest movie","review":"I'd give this 10 stars if I could. I have watched it over and over and love this movie. The story is fantastic and so are Robbins and Freeman. This is a must for any collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Film, Less than stellar DVD","review":"This may be my all time favorite film, which is why I have the most trouble understanding why it recieved only minimal treatment in the DVD format. With all the great \\"Special Editions\\" and \\"Criterion Collection\\" films that have come out, films that are worthy of true in-depth exploration, why hasn't Shawshank gotten its proper DVD release for the people who love this film. I try to get the most for my DVD dollar, and love DVD's for the \\"behind the scenes\\", \\"making of\\", \\"directors/actors commentary\\" \\"alternate endings\\", \\"storyboards\\" special features. Shawshank doesn't have any of these to speak of....just production stills and trailer. This edition is really a glorified VHS copy, and that is a true shame....a big let-down for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shawshank Redemption","review":"This movie is, by far, the best movie I've ever seen. I have watched it dozens of times and intend to watch it dozens more. It tugs at your heart and you find yourself hoping that the prisoners, even though most are guilty of their crimes, find some peace in their lives. And the ending is super!! Good for Andy and Red. (Zihuatenejo is gorgeous!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this film!","review":"This movie is one of my personal favorites. Everything about it is superb. It has a message to tell it's audience. The message I got was that prison life can take over your mind,body and soul. Some prisoners that are incarcerated for several years never recover from their experience. A perfect example of this was when Red got out of prison and also the old man who nurtured a black bird. Andy Dufrane though never let prison get the best out of him. I loved how he outsmarted the warden at the end. The ultimate revenge. This is one of my top-ten favorite films. Others films I admire are 1492:Conquest Of Paradise, Leaving Las Vegas, Close Encounters Of The Third Kind, 2001: A Space Odessy, Metro, Planes,Trains & Automobiles, The Big Lebowski, Starman and ET: The Extraterrestrial."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely one of the best movies of our time.","review":"Each time I watch this film, I discover even more meaning. Based on \\"The Wrong Man\\" thesis, this work is artful, poetic (especially Redd's narrative), poignant, and riveting. It will undoubedly move you and leave you with a victorious feeling."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my favorite movie!!!","review":"This is the greatest movie I have ever seen. The character development and the story unfolds beautifully. The cinematography is incredible, especially the use of color. It is harsh at times helping you feel what the characters are going through. If you have kids who you think might get in trouble when they get older just make them watch this movie. They'll never commit a crime!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies ever","review":"This movie has to be one of the best movies ever. Just for a movie to be so involving, it feels like you know the characters and you actually care what happens to them. I found the movie very inspirational and the ending could be one of the best ever. It made me feel good and I actually felt good for a long time after seeing it for the first time(I watched it once a week for close to two years!!!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A testimony to hope and friendship","review":"Although this movie contains all the usual prison cliches - wardens who are related to satan himself and in-mates who you should definitely never put your back to, this film is head and shoulders above every other prison movie I have ever seen. The reason this film is ALWAYS quoted on the 10 ten best movies ever made is the sheer humanity of it. \\"Start living or start dying\\", its about never giving up hope, the power of friendship and about getting what you deserve if you have the strength to reach out for it. If you don't own this movie, buy it today! I challenge you to get to the end with out a tear in your eye."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie, not-so-great DVD","review":"Many great things have been said about this movie, and the movie deserves it. This Stephen King prison tale is excellent (as is his other prison tale The Green Mile). Unfortunately, this DVD is lacking. The only extras on the disk are a trailer and a few photo stills. Originally, the disk was to include a commentary by Morgan Freeman, but he apparently backed out. With all the hype and acclaim around this movie, surely some more extras could have been included. Bottom line - Buy this DVD for the movie, not to learn more about it through extras."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best movie I've ever seen","review":"This is my favorite movie of all time. What can I say that hasn't already been said? The acting is excellent, the story is fantastic, the surprising ending (I never would have guessed!) is exciting and touching. I have high hopes for 'The Green Mile'. The novel is Stephen King's masterpiece, and I have a feeling it might be every bit as good as Shawshank. Let's all hope so!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My all time favorite movie!","review":"This movie, despite what the critics had to say about it is the best movie I have ever watched. It showed and brought to life so many emotional struggles and discoveries. Friendship, trust, love, betrayal.. just to name a few.

Because he was better in later works. But in this book, an early effort, his imagination stretches to the limit. Simply amazing.

Apparently, their regulations don't match FAA ones in that it's not allowable to use a carseat where the belt goes OVER the child like this one does. Only allowed are ones (like most standard carseats), where the belt secures to the body of the seat itself.Even so, when I was traveling alone, switching planes in Chicago and London, with a 13 month old, it was indispensible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the investment","review":"We have used the Sit N Stroll system on two trips and found it well worth the investment. The ability to act as a stroller as you enter the airport, switch to a seat on the airplane, back to a stroller at luggage claim and into a car seat in the rental car was everything we asked for.There will always be issues. Multifunction devices never have the quality that an individual car seat, stroller, etc. would have but we are willing to look past that for this very practical device.You may have issues with an airline employee about the seat on the plane but stick to your guns. You'll usually get it on the plane. It is technically bigger than the seats on the regional jets and DC-9 we have taken it on but made it work. In the rear-facing mode on smaller planes the seat in front of the Sit and Stroll will not be able to recline.If you travel with an infant or very young child this is well worth it. Keep perspective on the fact that it is a multipurpose device and you'll be OK."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's a better alternative!","review":"My husband and I looked into buying this for our vacation. While it looked good, it just seemed like a lot more gear we were bringing with us! Something we were trying to avoid!Yes, it's a car seat, but then you have the wheels attached and the handle, etc. We just wanted to make our trip (& life) easier. We found the TOTEaTOT. It serves the same purpose, but I think it's better. It's two straps, with a built-in backpack, that attaches your child's car seat to your suitcase with wheels which we use as a carry-on.It's a fraction of the price! Just $25. And so much less gear to bring, and we used the backpack once we got to our destination. www.toteatot.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not fit down the aisle in coach","review":"Despite the description on Amazon, this stroller does not fit down the aisle in coach. Standard aisle width is 17\\" and this thing is wider. You need to actually carry it over the seats and heads of all the other passengers, in my case with my child still strapped into it with my carry on bag over my shoulder. The manufacturer apparently makes no claim on their website that it fits down an airplane aisle, neither do they tell you how wide it is. I don't know why the description on Amazon says it fits. Do not buy this if you want to roll it down the aisle of an airplane."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very convenient for travel","review":"We purchased this since we like to travel. Our first trip was a great success! This car seat was very easy to travel with, especially with all of the opening and closing of the stroller getting on/off the airplane, into & out of the Hertz courtesy shuttle, going through airport security, etc. It literally takes 3 seconds to push/pull the handle bar and the wheel open/close mechanism. The wheels stroll and turn very smoothly and the whole system is not very heavy & cumbersome.The not-so-convenient steps with using this may apply to all strollers...such as finding the child-seat restraint hooks on the cars (especially the one behind the seat). Also, the belt that goes over our child's lap when she is in the seat needs to be loosened and moved each time we put her in and out of the seat. But this may apply to all child seat designs anyway.Altogether, this is certainly a valuable purchase for those who like to travel. We HIGHLY recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"very valuable if you travel a lot","review":"I have purchased this car seat for my son when he was 8 months and we were about to travel to Europe for the third time. It made our life easier because we did not need to bring with us stroller and car seat. However, it is not the best stroller you can have mainly we you wan to walk a lot. My son really enjoyed being in it and everybody was curious about the 2 in one function. Yes you can also use it attached to a regular chain at lunch time but it is a little bit unstable. The only problem is that you do need help when you want to change function having the baby sitting in. If you plan to travel a lot without your car, it is a must and really changes your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy to convert.....NOT!!","review":"At 6 months old our son grew out of his travel system car seat. Since we travel a lot, we thought the 5 in 1 travel system would be just great. The conversion from car seat to stroller works well empty, however as soon as we put our 9 month old who weighs 21 pounds in the seat, the conversion was extremely difficult. The manufactor says it can be used up until 40 pounds....no way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tested and True","review":"We have had our sit-n-stroll for almost 4 years. It is best used as a travel stroller, due to the use of the shoulder harness, however I have it works great with sleeping babies. My son would fall asleep in the car seat, and I could take stroller and all in the house and not wake him. Overall a great investment for anyone who travels more than once a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"flimsy as a stroller","review":"I found the product highly unsafe as a stroller. The handle is very flimsy, and is not strong enough to control the direction of the stroller. Also the wheels do not lock properly and safely. Its ok as a car seat but as a stroller has a lot to improve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyday","review":"This is not for everyday use. It was a little heavy for me. Especially while trying to convert it into a stroller while my baby was in it. As he grew I would make him get off to convert it which defeated the purpose of the carseat/stroller combination. The handle doesn't feel sturdy enough. After a while I used it just as a car seat and used a separate stoller.I can see how this would be useful for the frequent travellers."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE!!!","review":"This is a horrible product, especially for use as a carseat!!! It is impossible to understand the manual and as far as installing it into a vehicle, forget about it. I wouldn't recomment this to anyone. Use your own carseat. It is much safer. The manufacturer has a lot of work to do to make this a good car seat. The stroller and airplane function may be the only safe way to use this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for travel!","review":"This seat is really a safety must! After traveling with our infant son we found that riding in cabs or between airports on the shuttle without him in a restraint was just too great of a risk. Now that the seat has the latch system it is easier to use and we have had no problems. It is definitely not for everyday (in your regular car) use but is a must for safe travel. We highly recommend it- easy to understand and use!"},{"rating":"1","title":"if you want to return it you have to pay 25% of the product + shipment","review":"Make sure that you really want to buy this product. To return it they make you pay the shipment which is ok, but also 25%, yes people 25% of the product. So do you want to pay 30$ plus in this case over 60$????Will be more than 90$.... i don't even know if is legal. So i am not return it in this situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad experience","review":"This travel system is a good idea. However a wheel broke off on our 2nd flight, probably due to baggage handlers, so would not buy this product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sit 'n Stroll","review":"This is really good for traveling. The instructions show it going from carseat to stroller with the child in it and I will say that's really hard to do. Also the latch that keeps it in the stroller position is a bit difficult. We've had it collapse a couple of times."},{"rating":"1","title":"actually negative 5 stars....DO NOT BUY!","review":"This product was terrible. First and foremost this seat did NOT fit on American Airlines Business Class seats! Secondly, the rear facing car seat tilts so far forward that your baby is falling forward agains the harness and if they fall asleep their face is pressing against the seat belt. The wheel covers fell off the first time I used it. The stroller is a piece of junk. When I called the company to explain my problems they never even called me back, so on top of it all they have a horrible product and terribel customer service to match. Do not buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"Sure it's ok for travel but we had trouble lugging it through airport security. We had trouble folding it up every time as the wheels would get stuck. You need to be strong to lift this thing out of a car and forget about folding it with a child inside. The wheel covers finally broke off and only then could it be folded easily. The handle is very flimsy and does not extend high enough for a person who is 5'10''. If you're tall you will be hunched over trying to push this thing. It does not roll smoothly on carpeted areas and tends to wander so you are constantly trying to steer this thing with a flimsy handle. You will be totally worn out after using this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good at both, great at neither.","review":"The stroller is a little flimsy for everyday use, and the whole thing is kinda heavy (especially with the baby in it). It is not hard to transfer from stroller to car seat and back, but you need to have a little upper body strength if the baby is still in it. I use it as our regular carseat, but not our regular stroller. We only use the stroller option in airports.As for using it for flying, I wouldn't do without it. It is FAA approved, fits in all airplane seats that I've tried (coach), and it goes easily through the security checks. It is worth the cost just for this. I really like this product if you are a frequent flyer; however, it is kind of a money-waster if you don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor hardware quality","review":"THE hinges were of very poor quality .... seat could not be lined up with toilet(causing constant shifting) ..... after only two weeks in use and much slipping .... had to be replaced ... the only thing that got sucessfully flushed involving this seat was my 30 bucks !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong color","review":"I ordered one of these back in 2008 and liked it so much I decided to reorder it again. The oak color matched the rest of my bath and the seat was comfortable. However, since then I have order it twice now and each time it comes - it arrives in the wrong color.Amazon has taken them back so that is positive. However the color is brown..almost like a very dark walnut. Perhaps the company has changed the color and if so hopefully Amazon can take out the word Oak in the description and also put in a proper picture. I mention this because I ordered it twice and had to send it back twice thinking that maybe they had just packed the wrong item the first time around.Apart from the issue with color, I really liked the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"The seat broke very easily","review":"The seat is made of four pieces of wood glued together.

I kept having to re-read sections to find what point I must have missed, since the trail that the author was taking was too obscure. The last third of the book appeared to be sort of another novel tacked on in order to satisfy the publisher's requirement for a book of 300 pages. Some of the middle third are the only parts worth reading, and they are still not that good!There are huge logical inconsistencies throughout the story, and the sudden changes of time and place are so clumsy that they are confusing rather than clever. All the female characters are basically the same person, and are cardboard cutouts of people with no substance.If only the author could stop her literary self-indulgence, she might be capable of writing something of substance, since there is a little potential here. But I can't recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"for poetry lovers only","review":"Read this book only if you have a lot of time on your hands. As others have said, the imagery is beautiful, but the character development is seriously lacking. Plot does not move forward very often. If you read poetry for fun, you won't mind that Ms. Michaels sacrifices substance for style. If you don't read poetry, it will drive you insane. Stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evocative novel about love across space & time ...","review":"There are echoes throughout the book that keep coming back to me - questions about my presumptions of what a life is, how it is shaped by willed singularity, what is known, and even more of what isn't. I feel Michaels' book has achieved the equivalent of slowly unearthing a perfect fossil, a specimen complete in itself. This isn't a story about the Holocaust - it's about the legacy of love ... I hope she writes another soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful novel full of poetry","review":"I haven't come across such a well-written novel in years. Its prose lapses into poetry. It is moving without sentimentality. It must be read, not only for its linguistic superiority, but of course for the power of the story. It is incredibly powerful, partly because of what is written, but partly also for what is left unsaid. The book tells us of a young Jewish boy separated from his family during the second world war. By pure luck he is rescued by a Greek archaeologist and smuggled out of Poland.... I was sceptical when I discovered the subject of the book... fearing detailed descriptions of gory concentration camps, but they are there only in the shadows. And for me those shadows are the very reason for the novel's success. I will definitely read it again very soon, but this time to savour the beautiful language and style rather than the compelling storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fugtive Pieces","review":"Ms Michaels writes like a woman wearing all her jewelry at once. Why not sprinkle those literary jewels with more care. She hits the reader over the head with all the lines she has saved up over the years for her poetry. We know she understands the subtly of metaphor....but she isn't sure her reader does. I will go to her poetry and hope for more, which will hopefully be less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is \\"Fugitive Pieces\\" really worth the reading?","review":"\\"Fugitive Pieces\\" was a book that I thought was not worth my time because it was a really hard book to read, understand and some of the imagery used was hard to figure out. I think that other people like this book just because it it hard to read, so they think it must be good. This book tries to correlate two readers to be the same, but it just makes the story more confusing. The beggining of this book was really intruiging and touching when Jakob was narrating about how he found a new \\"family\\" and \\"fatherly figure\\",Athos who made gave him a new life to start over from his terrible past. But when the other narrator,Ben, started narrating, it confused me and made me think how worthless this book really is. It seems to me like Ann Micheals took a stroy and tried to add meaning and value to were their is none. So, overall this book is not worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"In the past week since I finished the book, I find myself every so often experience a small wave of genuine relief that I am no longer reading it. There is little to no plot development, although the story begins with a good start and beckons the reader to keep reading it in the hope that it will develop. It doesn't. The characters remain the same monotonous bores throughout, basking in ad nauseum \\"poetic\\" descriptions of the gray details of their lives. I could accept a book that is built on poetry rather than plot if the poetry itself was insightful or beautiful or even a cohesive collection. There were a couple of lines that resonated with me and that I will continue to think about. But they were buried within pages and pages of incoherent drivel. A entire book of this stuff was just not warranted."},{"rating":"1","title":"The emperor has no clothes","review":"I tried very hard to like this book since it was recommended to me by a bookseller, but to my distress I found it to be extremely pretentious-- overwrought, overwritten, and vastly overrated. The voice reminded me of the kind of poetry readings I hate to attend--monotonous and full of itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Words disappear right before me and her soul fills me.","review":"This is a rare piece of work. Every word, every thought feels so right it dissolves into instant love. A marvel of patient healing words reaching the deepest innerfeelings of the reader. Thank you, Ann Michaels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it slow. Again and Again. Your Heart will Ache.","review":"I usually start a book and finish it in a day or two or three. I read Fugitive Pieces for days. Not because it was slow or boring, but because it was soooo beautiful. I wanted to savor it. I still pick it up and read several pages at a time. Still so heavy, still so beautiful, still so full of memories, still such beautiful prose. At times like reading poetry. For those who read it and did not like it. Too bad. You went through it too fast. You can't enjoy the scenery traveling at ninty miles an hour or traveling through rush hour and thinking only about getting there. This book is a thing of beauty and I will think of it for ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Fugitive Pieces\\" - Anne Michaels","review":"More often than not, I found myself reading Anne Micheals' Fugitive Pieces whilst sitting on the London tube (District/Circle line between Bayswater and St James Park). I lost count of exactly how many odd looks I got from people who watched this 6'6, 25 year old in a suit weeping quietly to himself. It's honestly one of those books that will remain embedded in my mind for the rest of my life. Without making it sound too much like a cliche (I think that means \\"watch out, here comes a cliche\\") it's a book that has probably had more of an impact on me than any other piece of literature. Michaels has a gift few writers possess. I have often been upset about finishing a book - letting go of the characters - but I've never before actually tried to ration myself to avoid finishing it. That Anne Michaels took ten years to write this book is obvious. If her next offering takes that long, it will be worth the wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fugitive Pieces--Jessica Newhouse","review":"I thought this was an interesting novel filled with deep insights, and profound quotes. It did a wonderful job of portraying the effects that something as horrifying as the Holocaust can have on a person. It shows what the main character, Jacob, had to deal with and learn to overcome. This novel has a lot to say about the power of language, the power and impact of silence, the human need for belonging and love, and truth. Anne Michaels addresses these issues, but leaves them open ended. For this, I think Fugitive Pieces is a pretty good novel, however, it is often slow-moving and without action."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a real treasure! I will read it again and","review":"I was mesmerized by Ms. Michaels wirting. I can't imagine being intelligent enough to have written Fugitive Pieces. This book is a real treasure. I will read it again and again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful tapestry of words and images!","review":"This is the type of book that one can read again and again, each time noticing different and beautiful images. Yes, the book has a free flowing plot and if one were to analyze it according to historical fact they may find gaps. I do not believe that the author's intent is to write a history textbook. Instead, the poetic language works to provide colour and shape to the weaving of the tragedic story of war and loneliness."},{"rating":"2","title":"achingly beautiful prose","review":"Fugitive Pieces is nothing short of a gorgeous read. It manages to be both heartbreaking and uplifting without a hint of melodrama. I read this book a year and a half ago, and not one week goes by that I don't think about one line from the book. It is not a book for those who want a fast, fun read, but it is for lovers of fine writing and quietly heroic characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated and boring","review":"Please, please, no more badly researched books by authors who suddenly discover that they are very interested in parts of history they know nothing about! One of the worst books I have ever read. If you have to give someone a present you don't like, pick this one, it will surely bore this person to death."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sooo boring ....","review":"I was so excited about this book, but was greatly disappointed. Don't waste your time and money on this one. It has to be THE most boring book I've read in ages. And very difficult to read too. Unless if you're truly into poetry and poets, don't bother with this one. A huge disappointment. I want my money back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"unsatisfactory for women","review":"When I read this book I could not believe that a woman had written it. I feel ashamed that someone of my gender portrays women in such a cheap way and wants to show that men are superior to us and have really important problems that justify every kind of behaviour. The main character is transfixed on his sister and therefore unable to build up good relationships afterwards. This book is nothing for a modern woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overcoming Boredom for Tragedy","review":"I was assigned to read this book for an English class at my school and I probably wouldn't have read it on my own, and if i didn't read it I don't think I would have missed much. This book contained many good life themes about love and tragedy, but throughout the book they were lost in the endless sea of words that caused the reader to fall asleep. Only in certain portions of the book did I feel that I was half interested in what was going on. The only bright spot of this book to me was the heroic story of a scared young Jewish boy who grows up to realize his dreams and conquer his own fears. I would only recommend this book to very diligent readers who do not get bored with meaningless details. If you are not one of those readers do not read this book, for the meaning will become lost when you fall asleep. There are many other books out there that deal with the same issues, the difference is they convey it in a much better way."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the most compelling books I've ever read","review":"The book is beautifully written, very beliveable, most compelling.

But then, When I read the opinion of the reader from London! Well, Now I feel better. This is indeed a boring, obscure, vague, and at times even pretentious novel. The plot is ludicrous. The message unclear. The only context where the book is worth reading is before going to bed. I will miss it, for this purpose only... If anyone does not share my opinion, please do write me and explain me while I missed the point..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful prose, lousy novel","review":"Fugitive Pieces is filled with stunningly written prose that makes you stop and ponder. Although I appreciate the prose, the book lacks any type of plot, and the characters are so distant that I never grew to care about any of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"An elegant book about the post-Holocaust era? Yup.","review":"Winner of 6 Canadian literary awards, author Anne Michaels constructs the story, set in post-Holocaust Poland, of a 7yo boy's journey to healing and redemption via the age-old power of love - but not conventional love, this time. No, it's love for an old man and for ancient botanical history.The story begins during the war when Jakob, the protagonist who has recently seen his family murdered by Nazis, is discovered by a Greek geologist who spirits him off to Greece and hides him till the end of the war. There Athos, the Greek, helps Jakob recover from his psychic wounds by teaching him about the flora and fauna of ancient eras.A stunningly beautiful story that leaves a powerful afterglow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Couldn't Get Into It","review":"Sorry Ms. Michaels, I just could not get into this story. I liked the first 35% of the book, and then it deteriorated (in my estimation) substantially, when the chief character moved to Toronto.What I identified as the problem for me was that I felt the book was frequently \\"over-written.\\" Too cute for its own good, too often, and then the sentence-fragment-add-ons were a kind of show-off, an author saying, \\"See how clever I am?\\"The author is a poet, and this book too often reads like a bad marriage between prose and poetry.I'm sure others loved the book. Just not for me.A 2 on Amazon's scale."},{"rating":"1","title":"What fresh hell is this?!","review":"This book is too bad to review but too lauded to ignore.Another reviewer calls it holocaust-lite; it is also poetry-lite. What it is heavy on is mawkishness, pretension and self-pity; I would guess that the author was as surprised by its reception as anyone. Did it infiltrate itself as a bookgroup virus, perhaps - a sort of literary AIDS?You don't neutralize pain by turning it into schmalz (too reminiscent of what the Nazis did, already...) Or if it's just a fancy Cabaret-style backdrop to the author's Hallmark card self-indulgence, well - that would, in Oscar Wilde's words, 'lend a new horror to death'.This book - surely now notorious? - and its reception would make an excellent subject for a book, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensively cutesy","review":"C'mon people. It's time to expect a little more from the books we read than what's offered in this trite, limp, detestable piece of holocaust exploitation. Anne Michaels should be ashamed of herself. After finishing the book, I promptly threw it out. I urge the publisher and all booksellers to do the same. My only comfort lies in how soon Fugitive Pieces will be forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mawk and Hooey","review":"Not one believeable gesture of honest writing can be found in this novel filled with supposed lyric pyrotechnics. The \\"creative writing\\" here is all stagecraft and no substance--a sort of Andrew Lloyd Webber play about the Holocaust and its aftereffects. This is the kind of drivel mediocre poets generate when they can't write poems. But if you are interested in the study of poetry, this book does provide a valuable resource. It may very well be the world's largest compendium of decorative imagery and metaphor. Too bad Alexander Pope didn't have this book around to use as an exemplar of bad writing in one of his essays. If you want to read serious fiction that skirts the line between poetry and prose without having your ear accosted by a legion of maudlin fiddlers, then try \\"Jesus' Son\\" by Denis Johnson."},{"rating":"1","title":"to write or to ramble","review":"It is a terrible thing when people write a book about a very important point in history and butcher it, all in the name of becoming an author or an artist. Michaels did this with fugitive peices, she rambled incoherently about the horrors of the german's treatment of the jews and she twisted somthing real into a perverse but polite litte story about a boy. All in All I would have to say this is a terrible and over-hyped book. It is certainly not worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't finish it","review":"While this book may be well written and in general I enjoy historical fiction, I could not stomache this for some reason. There are so many true stories of the Nazi's atrocities that need to be told and read. For me, the real stories are so powerful that any attempt to fictionalize what happened to the Jewish people and others almost seems wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pale compared to The White Hotel","review":"Like others who've offered their reviews, this book was recommended highly to me by a friend. Perhaps if I had not already read The White Hotel, another novel by a poet with the holocaust as a theme, my opinion of this book would have been higher, but where the White Hotel successfully bridges the poetic and the narative, Fugitive Pieces fails.I was unconvinced by the endless parade of quasi-poetic aphorisms: \\"Every moment is two moments.\\" \\"Complicity is not sudden, though it occurs in an instant.\\" \\"There's no absence if there remains even the memory of absence.\\"The author does not let the reader judge the meaning of the scattered recollections that make up this book, but insists on stating the meaning explicitly. I found this alienating, and I never felt at all immersed in this book.I do strongly recommend D.M. Thomas's The White Hotel, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fugitive Pieces","review":"This book could have been reduced to about a quarter of it's size, the author has tried to include every word in the English language in the story. The story itself would have been a good read without the paragraph upon paragraph of tortured meaningless sentences that added nothing to the story. Would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like an overstuffed chair","review":"I tried at least six times to pick up the rhythm and flow of this book but always felt like i was being preached to rather than joining in an imaginative recreation. lacks the quality of felt life, is overwritten, extremely abstract, and hardly a novel at all. Some memorably evocative descriptive prose but too fragmented and, despite its horrific subject, curiously detached."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another cry against hyper-lyricism","review":"This book seems already to have been amply reviewed on Amazon.com and so I will be brief: I fully concur with those reviewers who found the lyricism excessive, the poet virtually bullying the novelist right off the page. The concept was strong - the successive and only partially interlaced lives of a holocaust survivor and his protege. But Ms. Michaels seems always to have to remind us of her poetic gifts, page by increasingly tedious page. I began to feel the way one does having to watch a parlour performance by a child whose parents have told her too often how talented she is. If you want a book by another Canadian Anne who can match Michael's lyricism stride for stride but also spin a captivating tale of how history insinuates ordinary lives, go instead to Anne Marie MacDonald's \\"Fall on Your Knees\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Book","review":"Fugitive Pieces was, when I read it nearly five years ago, and still is, my favorite book. Michaels' expression is graceful and powerful, and I enjoyed the story as much as her eloquence and hauntingingly beautiful sentences, clearly reflecting her poetic genius. I am eagerly awaiting Michaels' next novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spur of the Moment","review":"Spur of the moment is one of the most versatile and entertaining bands I've ever seen.

I know that many people consider this book a classic, but the writing style was simply too distracting for me to get into the story and enjoy myself. No one can seem to speak normally. They gasp, whisper, purr, rasp, drone, etc. It was very distracting. I don't feel that this book has stood the test of time. It may have been something special back when it was first printed, but it has not aged well. The premise behind the book was interesting, but the writing style was just too old fashioned and borderline silly for my tastes. Despite all the other rave reviews of this book, I felt very let down and disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic that holds up well","review":"For a book over 70 years old, I was very impressed with the story. There was action and adventure from start to finish which was not hampered by how old the book was. However, this was originally a pulp novel, and it shows.

Very interesting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst I've read this year","review":"Eliots tale of the Raveloe weaver was not only boring with a shaky and divided storyline, but held a trite view of the materialistic loner Silas and his previous life. He who was entraped in his own world of pain and anguish with only his gold to comfort him, reawakened from the appearence of a young girl, Eppie. Eliot's potrayal of Silas's metamorphosis, however, held little real meaning for me.

This is an album of old French movie songs, some of them are beautiful classics, and all of them are nicely performed. If you like the old 30's and 40's movies it is worth getting and the vocals are beautiful, very intimate at times and in period. Lambert Wilson can do no wrong for me, so I really got to like this album a lot.

This product is in marked contrast to other Alan Moore graphic novels in paperback, such as WATCHMEN and THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN, where the illustrations are on glossy paper and the images are clear and powerful.

This comic is better than Watchmen. And that's saying a heck of a lot. This is what started my love affair with Alan Moore's writing.

So many changes were made for NO reason. God I wish I could film the story Alan Moore wrote here, instead of the wachowski's drivel. Seriously though, this is one of the greatest lessons in true patriotism and the power of symbols over the masses. For anyone as fed up with the current state of global affairs as I am, this book rings true in the same fashion that Orwell's \\"1984\\" or Huxley's \\"A Brave New World\\" did in their times. A man with a finger truly on the pulse, prophetic and foreboding, and a little too close to accurate. Read this now, and always remember the 5th of november."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Now, don't get me wrong-I loved Watchmen.

Flimsy packaging.","review":"I pre-ordered this set months ago, as I was excited that such a collection would be available before I had to set up a V for Vendetta Display in November.The good, the book is great, but you can buy a comparable edition for a few dollars less on Amazon by itself. I repeat the book is great 5 stars, too good for this set.The mask is a flimsy thin plastic number complete with hanging tab. Garbage. I will return and buy the deluxe rubies mask, it has to be better than this one. The worst part, the packaging. It is so flimsy my first set was dented, and my replacement set was worse, the cellophane tearing out of the front. The box looks completely different than what is shown here. I will upload images to show what I mean. What a waste of potential.If you don't care about the quality of the mask or the condition of the box you may like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freedom","review":"V For Vendetta is ugly, mean-spirited, violent and cruel. It's also perfect. Nothing I have ever read has laid down a better defense of freedom as a way of life. I say this because it presents freedom not as it is so often depicted elsewhere in fiction as a road that leads inexorably to the Promised Land, but rather as a choice one must make anew each day, a choice that may get you killed or endanger the ones you love, a choice that may leave dead bodies and broken minds in its wake. The final achievement of V is that it shows you the terrible price tag of freedom and still convinces you that nothing else is worthwhile. A masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deal, but was overestimating","review":"Don't get me wrong, this is a great deal. The book is well made, the packaging is aesthetically pleasing, but you get the standard mask. I was hoping for the Deluxe mask, considering this is a nice set. The description did not say which mask you get, so I guess I was just being optimistic. Still worth the buy. No regrets here."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first comic that ever hit me as classic literature","review":"I had read a number of comics before I could get hold of a copy of V4vendetta. I read it all in one go, cried through it, was astonished by the twists of the tale and it really got me thinking for a long time. To me, it is as good as \\"1984\\" by George Orwell. A lot of die hard critics and writers who look down on comics and say they are kids' stuff ought to read this and see if they can write remotely as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read and Good Screen Adaptation","review":"I saw this film last weekend and a friend recomended I read the graphic novel. This was the first graphic novel I have ever read. Now I can say I wish I had read the novel first, it gives you more insight into the characters. The film is more compact and emphasizes a more politcial and moral base. The novel has more a \\"pulp fiction\\" feel.I do not want to give too much away but will say there is a difference in the begining sequence when Evey meets up with the Finger Men. There is a relationship (that Evey has) and a few subplots from the novel that never make it into the film version. The endings are a bit different - see the film and read the novel and you can decide which you prefer.I am glad that this was the first graphic novel I read because it has good character development and is entertaining. The illustartions compliment the story and even add to it. Other graphic novels I looked at were overwhemling visually. That was not the case with this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"V is for very long","review":"V if for Vengeance is a weighty tome--not intellectual-ly. It was over 400 pages long. Now I know why people buy e-readers. First, why spell Philip with two lls; its root is philo-which means love of. Second, the author writes from two points of view--first person (when she's Kinsey) and omniscient author when she's writing from Nora's, or Dante's point of view . Maybe Grafton ought to hang up the alphabet mysteries. Oh, and what's with the Japanese gardener, the coyotes, and the huge turkey vultures? This section doesn't advance the story at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it appeared to be","review":"I bought this product for my son's english class and was greatly disappointed when I received it and it was not the full graphic novel.

Try the Watchmen."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD BUT HARD TO ENJOY","review":"This graphic novel is no doubt a revolutionary masterpiece. It is dark and compelling. It is easy to see why this is one of the most popular and well received graphic novels of all time. For me, however, I didn't find it particularly fun to read. I still liked it but I felt as though the second act of the story was somewhat boring and almost lost my interest. Luckily the finale is well worth it. Maybe the main reason I didnt love the comic as much as everyone else is because I had read watchmen right before it and was absolutely blown away. This is good but still, in my mind, does not compare to Watchmen. Overall it is a must read for every graphic novel fan. Just dont go in expecting a happy go lucky fun book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remember, Remember...","review":"I consider the Wachowsik Brothers movie adaptation to be one of my favorite films, so I figured it was only fair to buy the graphic novel. This was one of Alan Moore's earlier works, and the inexperience shows a little, but it's still a great story. I didn't realize how much the Wachowski Brothers had changed the story for the movie. I think they made improvements, as the story feels a bit weak. The book is also fairly short, containing a lot of dark artwork. The art is good, for the most part, but some images are confusing. Despite these gripes, it's still an amazing story. Fans of the movie will be surprised, but I still recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific","review":"This is a brilliant graphic novel, and I highly recommend it. This is such a worthwhile purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks great","review":"First of all, I should say I'm not rating the book itself (as in the writing or artistry). On the contrary, I'm giving it five stars for the quality and functionality of the Kindle version. As one of the most famous graphic novels of all time, most people already know how they feel about it, one way or the other. My thumbs up is to Kindle for successfully formatting it into usable, enjoyable electronic media."},{"rating":"2","title":"The War on Information Continues...","review":"\\"V for Vendetta\\" is one of the best pieces of work I've read in a long time. I strongly feel that everyone should have it in their personal library! This book / movie exposes the massive deception that is regularly carried out on a daily basis by our mis-Leaders. When a tiny group of elites own the media (like in the US), it's becomes relatively easy to manipulate an entire population. Besides the action and great plot, this is one of the many things that I enjoyed about this movie and book. Eventhough it's classified as fiction, one can plainly see the parrallel to what has happened to our freedom in the past 5 years. The message is clear, \\"People should not be afraid of their governments, governments should be afraid of their people!\\"Dr. Matthew J.

But seriously, isn't this just a comic book version of the rebel against Big Brother? Seriously? How more hackneyed can you get? The Finger; The Voice of Fate; the Nose? I gave it more than a star because there was some attempt at character development, and it was interesting at times. The artwork overall is well, let's say it sometimes reminds me of Cole for Plastic Man. Sloppy at times, though I don't know if this was the intention, but sloppy does impart a very atmospheric and gritty feel when done right."},{"rating":"1","title":"great story, but poorly executed","review":"The idea of a masked terrorist fighting back against a totalitarian government is a interesting story, but the characters in THIS story are weak at best!

I came to it because I liked the movie so much. I found it to be misogynistic and tedious to read (entire paragraphs of text repeated, as if the writer couldn't think of enough to fill out his story). The artwork was ugly. The plot lines were sometimes hard to swallow, characters' motivations not believable.

It's a lot better than the movie, which is similar, but doesn't completely do it justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Murder in Elizabethan Times","review":"Edward Marston's latest Tudor mystery pits his hero, Nicholas Bracewell, against an unseen foe, apparently determined to bring Lord Westfield's men, the acting troupe, to their knees. One difficulty after another arises, and suspicions turn gradually to the new playwright, whose personality leaves much to be desired. A cute subplot revolves around the actors' attempts to rouse the group's house playwright by playing matchmaker. I thoroughly enjoyed Marston's ability to transport the reader to another time and place. If mysteries be the music of escape, play on! Procure a copy of The Malevolent Comedy, and fall under the author's enchantment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, mid-period John Wayne western","review":"John Wayne's tough-guy character gets some choice zingers in this amiable, two-fisted, entertaining (and occasionally ricketty) western about a Texas Ranger who's out to bust up a gun-running gang that's selling arms to the Comanche renegades. It's one of those films where the Indians drop like flies every time the cowboys open fire, but it zips along at a pleasant pace, with a tad more plot than normal. Lee Marvin has a short but choice role as Mr. Crow, a sinister gunslinger who goes on a roaring bender with Wayne, paving the way for their interplay in the '62 sizzler, \\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence.\\" This was the last film directed by Michael Curtiz, who is probably best known for his work on \\"Casablanca,\\" and while this film is nowhere near the same league at that classic, it still has its moments."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rousing western","review":"On of the last great westerns of the golden period. John Wayne is great as always in westerns. I reserve 5 stars to Shane, Magnificen seven and a couple of others, but this is not much behind of these. You can see how good Lee Marvin was in smaller parts, too. Enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love John Wayne westerns, this is one of the very best.","review":"As a life time fan of John Wayne movies I have had the pleasure of seeing most of them. The Comancheros is one of my all time favorite John Wayne westerns because it has a great story combined with excellent characters. This fantastic movie has fight scenes, shoot outs, twists, turns, good guys, bad guys, and even romance. The movie begins aboard a steam boat with an interesting romantic interlude. John Wayne is a Texas Ranger and the first time you seen him is when he arrests a man on the steam boat for a murder. As it turns out, this story becomes more complex but always keeps you interested in the next scene. This is a great western action film for everyone who loves seeing the Duke at his best.In conclusion, if you are a John Wayne fan and have not seen this classic, you need to get yourself a copy fast.Rating: 5 Stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: The Monandock Defensive Tactics System (MDTS))"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Comancheros-Blu Ray","review":"An excellent movie, beautifully presented with the evergreen John Wayne in the lead ably supported by Stuart Whitman.

It has a great cast, story, photography and one of Elmer Bernstein's best scores. The widescreen DVD looks incredible. John Wayne and Stuart Whitman play off each other brilliantly. Lee Marvin as Crow has a small but effective and outrageous character part. There's plenty of action and heroics to go around in this great outdoor adventure. I wish they would make movies like this today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why no widescreen?","review":"This a great later Wayne movie with a rather Bond like approach - meglomaniac villain bent on world domination (well Texas anyway),one liners and great action. It is also one of the great sixties Cinemascope westerns, with spectacular Utah locations, so why is it being released in full frame only?This is available on Laserdisc in widescreen, stereo and with a good commentary from the cast (Pat Wayne not John), is aired on UK BBC channels in widescreen and stereo, so is this the best Fox can do?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Drunk Indians","review":"This movie was good for the most part but then again if you dont want to see drunk indians shoot white people then dont worry about seeing it. There were some good parts in this movie but the whole movie was a rather large dissapointment. These Indains would kill people so they could get their Jollies off by getting alcohol for it, even though the story wasnt to be based on this. This movie was very unrealistic as far as that actually happening, like if someone to be arrested they wouldnt be let go OR given a gun, and all the actors should be reformed and be made better through my eyes. I take my reviews very serioulsly and this movie was not that good at all, do not let your children be scared by watching this movie. John Wayne was a good actor props to my man Wayne, he's my man.

I often opt to use this because of its superior sound (volume) and because the people to whom I am talking can hear me much better because of the microphone placement.The only downside to this is that when you go bluetooth it is because you don't want wires. But the wire on this is short and only goes between your ear and the clip-on, not to your phone. But the quality and ease of use combined with the value more than make up for the wire. If you don't mind it, I would really recommend you consider this unit when choosing bluetooth headsets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mic volume is too low","review":"Volume of the earpiece is ok.

Webb must be quite dismayed to find that his research and story somehow ended up in Cockburn and St John's book. More to the point, this is a book that is basically a careless bricolage aimed at conspiracy nuts and culled from other peoples work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A necessary survey","review":"What's amazing about this book is that it includes no groundbreaking revelations.

I compared many of them & found that most of them all had his biggest hits, but they were also missing several of his other key, less popular songs that I really wanted. Then I came across this collection & found that it had just about all of his hits that I wanted & then some. I admit that I was then a little skeptical at first that these were going to be the true original recordings that I looking for & to my surprise, it was. So if you're like me & want to get as much bang for your buck as possible, then I would definitely recommend picking up this collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAME OLD, SAME OLD (AGAIN)","review":"Once again, Universal has released another Buddy Holly CD, and once again, they've dropped the ball.

I found the other popular lost Italian sci-fi flick 'Caltiki the Immortal Monster' much more watchable. DTSE is recommended only for completeists ONLY.If you are looking for very good, lesser known 50's sci-fi titles to add to your collection, try hunting down Unknown World, First Man into Space, Creature with the Atom Brain, Lost Missile, Rocketship XM or Donovan's Brain.

As an elementary school teacher, I can think of a hundred more powerful and original ways to explore children's art, most of which would include beautiful artwork made by children, or at least something by an adult which captures the spirit in a more authentic way. I also found the color scheme boring. Pretty much everybody thinks they can write a great children's book, from Billy Joel to Jerry Seinfeld. It ain't so, and it ends up being an abuse of an art form that appears effortless but is truly very tricky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a well done picture book","review":"I've been a huge fan of Mutts for some time, so when I saw this book by Patrick McDonnell, I felt like I needed to check it out.

All other events surrounding the war, such as the revolution in France that it caused, are covered though not explored in depth, as they are topics for other books.It's apparent Stephen Badsey researched the topic well and writes for understanding, reflecting his lecturing background. The numerous maps are excellent; I have never read a book where every single placename is on an accompanying map; making the text and the battles easy to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cliff Notes of military history","review":"The \\"Essential Histories\\" series from Osprey could easily be compared to the Cliff Notes series.

The good thing about this training video is that his techniques can complement more traditional views on how to use the triangle or be used as a unique method. Ryan Hall seems like someone who uses technique to win. I did not give a five star rating because I have not been able to train that much since purchasing it. The few times I did, Hall's lessons showed promise on the mat. The school I train at, Laselva MMA, is a traditional BJJ school, so far as BJJ is concerned (I have not done the MMA program) and does not specifically teach Hall's methods.

I can very easily picture some of the main characters as I am reading & thinking about it.There are really 2 plots in this book: the main, obvious one of the unfolding of Mr. Choppy's business, the Nitwits, Powell Hampton & others; however, there is a hidden agenda in the author's mind as he is writing this...a sort of metaphysical mystique, if you will. i won't give anything more away...but my suggestion will be that anyone interested in several main plots & a connecting sub plot will find this book fascinating, and perhaps even be able to relate to it on a personal level.Please do give it a try...it will be worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Boring, Boring","review":"Ugh!

It is, however, an excellent example of what can happen if a great idea isn't properly nurtured.The premise is promising, but it never quite comes through. There are quirky characters aplenty, but they're too quirky, too over the top. Dalby also tried to weave in romance and does a poor job with it. Both are underdeveloped and crassly handled. The man lacks subtlety, that's all I can say.Beyond that, I just didn't care about the book. I didn't care whether the characters married, whether the store closed, or why Mr. Choppy lost his finger. I just wanted out of the book.That being said, I had a hard time rating the book.

When The Ballad Hits came out I predicted this one coming...because I don't know how anyone would get away with releasing a compilation album without their first #1 single, \\"The Look\\".Just like The Ballad Hits, this album also features 2 new tracks, 13 of their up-tempo singes from 1988 to 2001, and on some versions (for a limited time) a bonus 4-track EP with B-sides and previously unreleased songs. Its only single outtake is the opening track, \\"Opportunity Nox\\". Just like \\"A Thing About You\\", it is the only one to be released from it.This album is absolutely ideal for parties - especially \\"retro\\" themed ones (in reference to the first half of the album).

Strangely catchy musical numbers, very low budget special effects, and so many plots it should be 6 movies, a couple classic characters, this movie has it all. Bear in mind this was the 80's, but if you loved Repo-man, you should find something to smile (or groan) about in this slice of z grade cinema."},{"rating":"2","title":"good cinematherapy for these times","review":"The film is a lower-budget type of Rocky Horror show without the sexual content and with less music. There is definitely some sarcasm within it, regarding small-town naivete, notions of science from the 50's, particularly where related to space, and, last but not least, the joining of space flight with a super-souped-up version of a teen's ideal toy-a car! The picture, apart from its craziness and the bizarre persona of Abdullah, seemed highly prophetic at times, and on hearing the Bagdad Boogie for the umpteenth time, I visualized Dubya, Cheney and Rumsfeld in drag in place of the dancing girls. This is for anyone and everyone tired of American reality. Try it, accompanied by some sedating liquid and quiet surroundings."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a badly written book.","review":"This book taught me nothing.

Tolkien is best known for his epic trilogy \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and its prequel, \\"The Hobbit\\". But the true scope of his work lies not just in these longer tales.In this book we find two shorter works by the master tale-teller, each showing new facets of Tolkien to the reader. Both are well crafted in their own right, without the broad background of the LOTR. These are not the epic struggles of the Ring-Bearer, but the everyday trials of everyday characters trying to make their way and name in the world.Farmer Giles is probably the more accessible of the two characters to the casual reader, but both stories have enough depth to qualify for a second and third reading. The details lie in the characters, not in the descriptions, and Tolkien does a masterful job of leading us to the window for a peek, then letting the reader's mind fill in the rest.A worthwhile read for Tolkien fans, as well as fantasy aficianados."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tool you can trust","review":"Nothing but oustanding.

Despite the fact that I knew the history and therefore the outcomes of many of the events he was describing the detail which he gives to his character's lives as you follow a family history through time is riveting.

The problem is he tries to cover too much ground; there's breadth but no depth. When he does get to the interesting parts (each of which could rightfully be a book in themselves) they're glossed over. \\"Poland\\" is ponderous, dull, and a huge disappointment. A conventional history by, say, Norman Davies, would be more entertaining and more informative.Not recommended"},{"rating":"1","title":"So MUCH Fluff!!","review":"I enjoyed James Michener's novel Hawaii. I liked the way it was laid out and the fact that it showed how the flows of immigration from different groups of people led to the unique lifestyle and openness of Hawaii. He managed to do this by focusing on people - after all this IS an historical novel. In Poland, however, Michener goes on and on about what was on the menu for this feast or that feast. He talks on and on about who wears what and who is groomed in this way or that way. (Let's leave the worthless focus on such things to People!) He talks about the viciousness of the Swedes in the 15th century or the Turks in the 17th century, but he ignores the viciousness of the Russians in the 20th century. I guess he approved of their menus and their appearance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it","review":"Michener uses outdated historiography in a overtly nationalistic interpretation of Polish history.

We readers are the beneficiaries of both her legal freedom and personal willingness to continue her story. With so much dubious scholarship and questionable intention to be found in books on Kerouac and the beats, from an assortment of writers claiming to be \\"insiders,\\" Johnson provides a voice both vulnerable and true as she returns to a time and place she remembers perhaps as well as anyone still living. In her correspondence with Kerouac at a pivotal point in both of their lives, we bear witness to the twin agonies of genius and celebrity, and glimpse through a lens of most tender intimacy the very real people behind the mythology that so swiftly became the beat movement. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"This A&M spare tire cover was a huge bargain in Dec '06 and is still good value now.","review":"I ordered this with a certain amount of trepidation because it was so much cheaper than any others I had seen elsewhere and I didn't know how it would look or fit. (It was an amazing price of about $11 back in late Dec '06.) However, I need not have worried, the cover is made of surprisingly thick, black vinyl and has a large maroon A&M; logo (with white hightlights) printed very clearly in the center of the main face. The cover has a drawstring that was strong enough for me to pull the cover really tight and get it nice and smooth around the tire. (Our spare tire is quite fat (an all terrain/mud type), but the cover covers it competely.)So, to sum up, this cover quality is good, specially for a 'universal fit' one, and I think it's a good deal, even at $30.

Anyway, for those of us still suffering malaise-inspired nightmares, Gary Allen's acidic (and, unlike Carter's writing, short-and-to-the-point) 1976 \\"biography\\" is a wonderful antidote. Inside, you will find the details of Carter's life before he was a virgin. Allen writes with a venemous wit and there's something delightfully cathartic in reading his sarcastic take on our 39th President, especially with all the recent talk of Carter being our greatest ex-President.

Still, while I found Ford to be an honorable and decent man, I saw him as a continuation of the Nixon administration and, therefore, part of the problem.Had I known about Carter's oversized ego and habit for duplicity and micromanagement as so humorously documented in this brief, unauthorized biography, I might have swallowed my pride and reluctantly voted for Ford.Had I known what a abject disaster his presidency turned out to be, I definitely would have done so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peaceful","review":"This album is wonderful for releaving stress.

And he provides some back writing for his little fantasy world which pays his bills. Not terribly interesting reading, mind you - this is no Silmarillion - and this is supposed to be complete.

This new book is not a new story. It was not meant to be a new story. It does give you alot of background info on the making of the series. I think if you pick up this book knowing that it's not farther adventures, but a book that let's you see the other side of how a author makes a world that we love to visit.I don't believe David Eddings is going to be writing any more books in the future. I was very suprised to see this new book on the shelf when I went to the book store. Since he pretty much said he wouldn't be doing anymore in Polgara.So stop complaining...

This point was made loud and clear in the Rivan Codex but beyond that there was nothing really new . If you have read the series as much as I have you will find that this pretty much old hat. The insights into the creative process were interesting in themselves but not enough to justify an entire new book. In conclusion if you are a huge Eddings fan you will find this book worth reading. I'm just not sure that it is worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth getting if you've read all Bellgariad books.","review":"Although I'm a great admirer of Eddings work, this book defies any useful purpose. The only reason to get this book is if you've already read the entire set of Belgariad books. Yet it offers no new or insightful comments that followers of the series don't already fully comprehend. Reproduced work on this scale can never be justified. Instead of buying this book re-read the series, much more enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"unasked for and unneeded","review":"The Belgariad is considered an epic by most, and the Mallorean is a welcome continuation. \\"Belgarath\\" and \\"Polgara\\" were reasonably interesting, but not this one. The Rivan Codex is contains such trivialities that the authors had forgotten to include in the books, along with tidbits that no one really wanted to know. It seems as though the authors are milking the cash cow that is this series as far as it can go. Read the first ten books of the series, and the two following if you wish, but this book is by no means a necessary addition to your library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"A great follow-up to his other series', The Belgariad and The Mallorean. It has the real historical books such as the Book of Torak and the Book of Aloria that you only got to read bits and pieces of at the beginning of his books. I only wish this wasn't his last book on this incredible story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing effort from David and Leigh Eddings.","review":"The Rivan Codex is a disappointing effort from the Eddings. Rather than advance the story of Pol, Garion, Old Wolf and company, this book seems to have been published just for the sake of publishing. It contains material that the authors wrote as references when they began writing their trilogies. Some of the 'holy books' are truely mind numbing while others are just gibberish.In the foreword David Edding states that they published because of pressure from fans of his trilogies. After reading the Rivan Codex I think fans would have been better served re-reading the original books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eddings fans will love it","review":"I am amazed at the criticism this book has received. It appears to me that most readers really have no concept of the effort required to produce the multi-volume epics Eddings has written. The introduction may border on arrogance, but the fact that he's right ought to come into consideration. This type of book is rarely published. Its a compilation of notes and studies that form the underlying structure of The Belgariad -- it is not a story in and of itself. True fans of Eddings will love it. Others will not."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best living classical composer played by a wonderful group!","review":"Eric Ewazen brings a unique perspective to contemporary classical music ... warm and lyrical, his compositions are evocative of both place and feeling.

If you are looking for a contemporary analysis of integrity of character, this is not it. It is nothing more than religious ramblings which equate integrity with obeyance of god.

Mr. Carter does the nation a great service by stating the obvious (which if it was really obvious, wouldn't need stating in book length) in language that is sufficient but not difficult and using examples, that, while some might decry the close historical distance, are examples of things that are still close enough to be common knowledge, and thus, readily understandable without long explanation."},{"rating":"2","title":"good read","review":"I had to read this for class, but it turns out to be a really good book.

His prescribed fixes, however, are little more than just the sort of swell-sounding but essentially empty rhetoric which he is skewering.While Carter promises a new approach to integrity in American life, all he seems to have on tap is a lot of quotations and circular logic. \\"We can learn to do right by doing the right thing, or listening to the right people,\\" he seems to say, without ever providing a really supportable definition of those terms. Instead, he depends on his own, completely subjective, ideas of right and wrong, which don't convince. His appeals to group ethics are slightly more useful, but fall prey to the same critiques he is leveling at what he calls \\"media culture\\" and other left-wing \\"evils.\\"Political hackwork."},{"rating":"2","title":"Style and Function","review":"I love these placemats!

I can now, for example, hear a Broadwinged Hawk before I ever see it; that is just one example of the skill one can obtain from listening to Birding by Ear. More Birding By Ear goes one step further than the first series; it gives you songs of coveted species of birds - birds such as Henslow's Sparrows, Northern and Louisiana Waterthrushes, Black and Yellow Rails - birds that are harder to find, elusive, or a challenge when making a visual ID.

The bag is still somewhat usable, but looks terrible due to the huge tear, and can't be trusted to resist water or other stresses.I've used stuff sacks from Granite Gear and found their craftsmanship to be much better.

So far the new phones have been great. I have the best station on the 1st floor of the house and 2 of the handsets on the 2nd floor and the reception is crystal clear. The phones have a cool intercom feature letting you call one handset from another. The only downside I've seen so far has been the size of the phone, which is rather small, making it uncomfortable for someone with big hands (like me). It does have speakerphone on each handset though. The selection of ringers leaves something to be desired, all of them are rather annoying.

Yes it is not super fast, it is 4x, but it is good for a USB port. I burn about 10 CDs a week and it has never given me any problems. I made a great purchase and this burner is so much better than the HP USB CD burner. Definitely a great purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"By anything, except a predator","review":"I purchased this predator drive to use with a Dell Dimension 4100, P4 1.7, 512MB Ram, etc.... and this drive is awful. I have had it replaced twice by Iomega. Sometimes it will burn CD's, it will never back up data. Most of the time it will not recognize blank CD's. I put it in the closet and bought a Yamaha internal. I hope this review was helpful. It may work better with a different OS than Windows 2000."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but junk","review":"Shame on Iomega for selling this product. It is flimsy, shoddy, and unreliable. If you've got a lot of time to waste, and don't mind destroying a stack of CD-Rs, you might burn a few successful CDs. But I plugged this thing into three different computers and had the same inconsistent results each time. The list of potenial errors is truly amazing. There seem to be an unlimited number of ways that this product can ruin discs. Perhaps a dependable external cd-burner has not yet been built. But this one is so terrible, I doubt I'd buy anything with the Iomega name on it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"CD Burned","review":"Well, folks-the bad reviews are all too true. I bought this piece of trash also and have had nothing but problems with it.

I don't know if the power supply is bad or what? The led lights wouldn't come on and I couldn't get the unit to power up. what's up with the stupid connected module in the back? No phone support on off hours, so I boxed it up and sent it back. Now I'm looking at a yamaha internal instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to install","review":"I read several horror stories about USB CD-RW devices, but decided to take the plunge anyway.

Overall I am very happy with the Predator."},{"rating":"1","title":"cd-r enthusiast","review":"I bought this thing several months back and it did nothing for me but make coasters. I'm not an inexperienced user of CD burners either. I tried everything in the book - defragged my HD, closed all applications, etc. Nothing worked.If you want a burner that is 10 times better than this, get the new Plextor Plexwriter 24/10/40 USB burner. It supports both USB 2.0 (super fast!) and USB 1.1 and has the BURN-Proof technology which prevents the dreaded \\"buffer underrun\\" issue. Plus, Plextor is one of the best brands in CD burning technology. Retail for it is about 200 bucks...very reasonable considering this one isn't that much cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Drive is The worst Drive I ever Bought","review":"Absolutly DO NOT BUY this drive I bought it and it didin't work so I sent it back to iomega and they gave me a new one and that one didin't work either.Do your self A favor AND DON\\"T BUY THIS DRIVE"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and No Help","review":"My unit worked fine initially, and then stopped writing on most commercial discs. The first response from their so-called support group took three days by e-mail. They offered suggested corrections one at a time, with additional delays before offering the next step. Phone help is not available except during working hours. It took over a week to get instructions which could have been sent initially, none of which worked. After all that they said another unit would be sent at an indefinite time in the future. That was twelve days ago, and I've heard nothing since."},{"rating":"1","title":"Temperamental Drive","review":"I have no previous experience with any other CD-RW outboard drive but this one is very temperamental. It does not like being plugged into an outboard USB hub. It only works when I give it the one onboard USB port on my laptop (and actually works well). All my other USB devices don't have any problem sharing but this drive is selfish. The success rate in creating CD's is low and the frequent error messages are not real helpful in diagnosing and resolving the problem. Will often get to the point where the only option is to reboot and hope that the drive wakes itself up. If you can dedicate an onboard USB port to it you may have success but if you need to plug it into a hub you might consider some other drive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this product if you use Windows ME.","review":"This device is not compatible with Windows ME.

I have encountered nearly every problem listed on other reviews, plus a few new ones.Do not even bother using the drive to write at higher speeds you will only make coasters.Also, forget about CD-RW! I have tried at the lowest speeds and I cannot even tell you how many times I have corrupted the file system of the disk in one way or another. I have to do data retreval on one disk I was stupid enough to 'Move' files to. Worked fine...but when I went to view the files the laptop hung...forever - after it was rebooted the CD-RW was corrupted.

The only problem that I had was when I used media (both CD-R and CD-RW disks) that were not made by Verbatim. After having problems and contacting tech support, I was told that Iomega only recommends disks made by Verbatim and a couple of other companies (sorry, I can't remember which ones). I switched back to my Verbatim disks and haven't had any other problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST CD BURNER EVER!!!!","review":"Though some may say that this burner is non reliable, wastes cd's but why they say that it is it does that because of what they do.They dont know how to work it or they just do it wrong.

I am in the market for a CD-RW and have been looking at the options for use with my new iMac. You said that the USB interface is modular with the Predator, and that if you upgrade to a machine with firewire, you could upgrade the interface. I have firewire now, does this mean that I could choose to use a firewire interface with this drive? Also I think that Toast will allow you to set your cache buffer up to 4 times the write speed, to avoid the underruns. You can also get a little help by increasing the RAM allotment to Toast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"I am using this burner with a Dell Inspiron 4000 running under Windows 2000 Professional and found the burner (less than good) at best.

Gershwin melodies goes straight as a prairie highway but with Arlen, they have lots of turns and zigzags around them and that's where the risk emerges. Of course, through the years they have become staples that the melody become as common as apple pies. What's left with singers is to improvise over the melodies and maybe that's a reason there are not as many Arlen tributes as there are the Gershwins, Kern and even Weile.Wopat's effort is something unique since he's not really a singer of standards, jazz nor a cabaret crooner by which Arlen usually caters. Wopat's sounds flat on most of the songs but again I'd rather hear so-so singers sing great songs than divas and \\"divos\\" producing trash and they are legions. It's nice to know a number of them are discovering America's gift to the world - the Great American Songbook!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"I am a fan of Harold Arlen's music and I thoroughly enjoyed Tom Wopat's The Still of the Night so I was eagerly awaiting this release.

Yet I've noticed over the years how much better this has aged than the other Dag Nasty albums. Remove this from the Minor Threat/Dischord scene and appreciate it for the songs. It's excellent, every bit as good as what bands like Husker Du were doing around the same time. In fact, Dear Mrs. Touma may be the pinnacle of American 80s college rock.

For one, the level of musicianship is remarkable for guys barely in their twenties in a genre not noted for the musical chops of its players. Brian Baker practically invents the pop/punk guitar vocabulary on this one--his changes/solos/accents are executed with real originality and panache. The rhythm section is also outstanding with tight drumming and bass playing. And the vocals are raggedly endearing without pretension or bs; they capture a real sense of what's it's like to be teetering in that odd place between teenager and adult. If this classic had been released in the early '90s, it would have sold millions. Forget Green Day, Field Day is your ticket."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too bad that this is out of print.","review":"One of the best pop punk albums of the late eighties. Unfortunately, they were about five years ahead of their time and they broke up sometime after this.

Taylor embodies the quintessential and well-loved western archetype seamlessly. Nearing the level of Wayne and Eastwood with a portrayal that is anything but mimicry. He is constantly, with every nod and tip of the hat, molding a character that is exquisitely nuanced. It's endlessly entertaining just to watch him work. Katee Sackhoff's performances in this series are also worthy of note. She evinces a cougar-like physicality and tempers it with a convincing patina of femininity. She cleans up nicely but will kick your ass if necessary. There are myriad tough-chick characters these days but few pass the laugh test. No test required with this one. Her character, Vic, is the perfect foil for Longmire and Sackhoff has acting chops to spare. If you like Westerns this is a \\"can't miss\\".

The former sheriff has to be jailed and is causing all kinds of ruckus in his office, trying to solve his crimes for him and telling him how to do his job. The curmudgeonly codger adds quite a bit of humor and mayhem to the show.Speaking of humor, you may not want to barbeque for awhile after watching this episode.This is a meaty episode, one which Longmire fans are sure to enjoy.

For mystery addicts the plot is sufficiently intricate. The use of mistaken identity starts early in the story, and early in the story it is used more than once. The \\"federales\\" who are the bane of all local enforcement, including this sheriff's department, show up early too.... Or do they? Deputy Vic Moretti, who relocated from her former position as a member of the big city, back east, Philadelphia Police Department, seems right at home with the grisly nature of the plot, and its darkness.

The music was great, and the videos were quite good as well. I still have them.Good thing I kept them. Because the video quality on both of the DVD versions is absolutely disgusting, especially on Natural States (Desert Vision is marginally better). While the sound quality is OK, it looks as if they took a worn-out VHS tape and copied it onto DVD with absolutely NO processing to improve the picture quality.

However, a deeper investigation shows that the profound philosophy using these forms fully endorses Buddha's views. Visualization, mantra and ritual dance are practiced in the same way as breath awareness - a support to establish calm abiding and eventual insight into the nature of mind itself.Richard Kohn has captured some of these practices quite eloquently, led by the highly respected master Trulshik Rinpoche. Here spirits, demons and gods are given no ultimate solid reality - nor, for that matter, are humans. Instead, a vast environment or atmosphere is created using music, dance and image to potentially cut through ordinary perception and witness the awareness Buddha spoke of. Kohn successfully shows how art and celebration can join with meditation to bring this about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Transformative","review":"Destroyer of Illusion at the very least cracked the veil of illusion.

The previous reviews of this recording have really said it all - this is a gem that is surely to be considered in the top 20 or so jazz recording of all time. Brilliantly blending Brazillian influences with bop and hard bop styles, the compositions are interesting, inspired, and beautifully constructed. Although there is a very good unity throughout most of the recording, I sometimes felt that the band was not playing at the emotional level that is on display on \\"Jinrikisha\\". It does not in really detract from the recording as a whole, as Joe's performance is excellent accross the entire album. In the final analysis, this is a highly recommnded recording for anyone interested in good jazz music.The remastering of the original recordings was carefully done, preserving the dynamics of the performance.

The main issue is in Europe. I got caught out. I bought a 3 catridges overseas - I could not use them on my HP printer. I asked for a refund, HP Email Support (US) was nice but ineffective.

Most people probably know them as the creators of this other little franchise, POKEMON. Drill Dozer is an absolute gameplay delight, and the art and story are really charming.The basic hook of the game is its heavy use of the L & R buttons. R turns your drill on, and L turns the drill on backwards. The kicker though, is they use the drill for EVERYTHING. Fly through threaded tunnels, kick backwards out of blocks, hang from platforms, open doors, fight bad guys, fly and swim with a propeller attachment, and smash through walls, desks, chairs, lamps, blocks, crates, ceilings, floors, cars...Every couple levels they throw something brand new at you, and there is decent replay value in upgrading your drill bit to access secret areas, as well as collecting chips to spend in the store.Next to Ouendan/Elite Beat Agents this is the must play GBA game of 2006 no matter what age you are!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected","review":"Having read many of Jeremy Robinsons books, this one caught me completely off guard!

First of all, I'm a sucker for time travel books. Second, I teach high school theology, so the idea of going back in time to meet Jesus thrills me.This book, alas, did not. I found the characters flat and stereotypical (e.g. the anti-Christian scientist embittered by the murder of his missionary wife), and the writing is just pure action without much texture. The plot is somewhat interesting, and I did, grudgingly, finish the book to see what happened, but I didn't much enjoy myself along the way.This is just very much like so many other works of Christian fiction: If Christ weren't a character in it, it wouldn't get published."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, the next Michael Crichton","review":"This book takes you on an emotional rollercoaster ride back in time to explore the inner depths of the Christian faith to its core belief in the ressurection of Christ. The Author mezmorizes you right from the start with ideas so profound yet securely rooted in scientic theory that one can truely believe they are traveling through time to witness histories greatest moment ever, the dawning of a new age, after the death of Christ. But what happens after that... you'll have to read the book for yourself. Does Christ really rise? Or has it been one of the most elaborate hoaxes the world has ever seen?

In all honesty, Jeremy's awkward handling of grammar and viewpoint renders this book nearly impossible to read and enjoy. I absolutely love his (high-concept) story idea, but why didn't he have the time and the energy to seek real publication, which would in turn provide real editing?Jeremy, I'm giving this book my best shot, but I wish you'd at least have found someone to critique this book in a professional manner before you released it to be read by the reading public.

It lingers around an original and interesting concept of time travel. It also lacks imagination. Imagine a 14 year old punk kid that skips class, listens to devil rock, and steals his mom's cigarettes paraphrasing the Bible. That is the gist of this book. The approach to the material can only be described as immature.This is a book about Biblical times and the author sidesteps the story to essential preach to the choir on multiple occasions throughout the book, only to display his ignorance regarding Christian and even American History. When combined with consistent grammatical errors, the book becomes little more than a painful showcase of one man's ignorance and superficiality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly book","review":"I bought this book because of the favorable reviews and was really disappointed.

An interesting premise, about two time travelers from 2005 going back to walk and talk with Jesus Christ. But it was so badly written (misspellings and bad grammar) it was hard to read. I am very surprised that it made it to print with so many typos in it, e.g., \\"he wretched into the grass with force,\\" \\"the man who lied on the ground,\\" \\"the Yankee fan whom had already taken aim,\\" \\"his eyebrows raised into his forehead.\\" And this is all in the first 50 pages. Plus the plot was somewhat corny. It read like a comic (there were a lot of \`Pangs' and \`Whacks' and \`Arghs') not to mention stuff like hospital charts hanging at the foot of the bed (they haven't done that in 50 years!). The whole time travel thing befuddled me so I didn't even try to keep track of how and when people went and came back. And the ending was rather lame. I thought Tom's reaction at the end was out of character, but just a nice expected wrap-up to the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"i was disappointed","review":"frankly, after reading all the positive reviews, i was very disappointed in this book. the character development was weak. while the concept of the basic story was quite unique (time travel to biblical times) the discussion around the technology and enigmas generated by visiting the past were poorly described. i also got the impression that this book was a pro-christian piece of work much as the Left Behind series is. i have never written a book review here before but i was motivated to do so after being let down by this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Religious propaganda","review":"I'm a big fan of techno thrillers and was looking forward to reading what looked like an interesting challenge to the bible's stories via time travel technology and the associated paradoxes. But this was a weak plot which essentially retold the bible's stories from the perspectives of 2 characters from present day - one a doubter and one a believer. The good guys are perfect, Jesus is portrayed as a cool guy who doesn't get perturbed by anything, the disciples are loyal and strong - I kept waiting for a twist but it never happened. I wouldn't have been surprised to see an invitation to join up to a church at the end of the book, it was that bad.

It turned out to be the most ridiculous and far fetched take on religion and the nature of god that I've ever stumbled across.The only thing more laughable than the the beginning and the middle, was the ending.

I think it was morbid curiosity. There are countless typos and grammatical errors throughout the novel, which is bad enough--worse is that the whole concept for this book is ridiculously juvenile, preachy, ethnocentric, and ill-conceived. Anyone who's ever spent any time with Jewish people or Israelis would probably toss this book out the window after the first chapter. The characters are one-dimensional (not even two) and I'm still wondering if anyone actually bothered to proof this manuscript before it was sent to the printers. Sheesh. What a waste of a day...

If you've ever read The New Testament, nothing in this book will be new to you. The only part of this book that completely disgusted me were pages 256-257 where the author proselytizes about how there would be no America if there had been no Jesus Christ because we all know America was founded by Christians. Ben Franklin would probably barf, and the pages were completely irrelevant to the story. Anyway - I suggest you read this book only if you have never had an independent thought in your life, are not familiar with good science fiction or quality literature, or like me are addicted to reading and it is the only book in a 5 mile radius you haven't read and you are desperate for a fix."},{"rating":"1","title":"No time paradoxes here","review":"If you like time paradoxes and want to see intelligent resolves around them, this is not the book to read.

This book was a great read for so many reasons. And it's probably obvious from reading the reviews as to the type of people who will like it and the type of people that will lead a crusade against it. I'm one of the people who loved it. Without giving anything away, I'll just say: think TIMELINE meets THE ROBE. However, this isn't a technical story that seeks to justify the science used, rather it's a \\"what if\\" story. The science takes a back seat - as it should. A Crichton-like diatribe on quantum physics wouldn't suite this story, as the real impact and feel of the plot is with the characters and where they are, with what they're going through. It's a spiritual journey, and the emphasis is appropriately applied within that sphere. Robinson's first novel hit the ball out of the park for me, and I think a lot of other people will fall in love with it, too!

I knew that going in, so I'm not complaining about the time travel aspect. The sad thing about this book is that the time travel aspect is more believable than the characters. The characters in this book are so poorly written.Then there's the issue of how the time travelers come across the time machine. That is a challenge in all time travel novels, explaining how such a device is created. Well these guys simply promise themselves that they will invent it in the future and send it back to them in the present. So....wait for it....they get a time machine at the exact time they are expecting it, from the future. LAME!!! And again, if the characters weren't so shallow and cliched, I could have overlooked the time machine aspect.Really cool idea, poorly executed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"Wow!

I have really enjoyed James Rollins' novels. Basically, this book struck me as a thinly veiled Christian novel - similar to the Left Behind stuff. I could not get through it. Not much creativity in the plot or much depth. I expected some interesting twists and surprises.

This one has On a Whim which is lyrical and melodic, Tears behind the Shades with a hint of blues, You Cross My Mind which is a great ballad and Someway, Somehow which, hmmm just a great Ron song. Gold in Them Hills is not my favorite but a lot of people like it. Pop, folk with a hint of blues...that's Ron. He's a nice guy, too, so buy this album and all of his other albums.

I bought the album because of this one song that haunted me and had me watching this station out of canada way to late at night, hoping to hear it again. The line \\"you were the first song I ever sung...\\" kills me. Excellent song and song writing.9. Words We Never Use: Along the lines of you were there, stong lyrics and haunting.

This movie is entitled \\"ICE CUBE: THE VIDEOS VOL. 1\\" It's not a documentary of Ice Cube's life and to rate it low because the movie didn't answer his questions is insane. Second of all, this video was put together for the fans. All the songs and videos that went to number one made it possible for this movie to be made.

But Marriott got all the airplay with the Small Faces, followed by Rod Stewart with the Faces. You really had to buy the albums to get to the Ronnie Lane stuff, and unfortunately, I never did...Recently, the Bottle Rockets (my favorite band) covered one of Lane's Faces tunes-- Ooh La La-- live. I loved the song. (Ironically, Ron Wood did the lead vocal for Ooh La La for the Faces, but you can see an amazingly great Ronnie Lane Slim Chance version on YouTube.) Several Bottle Rockets fans strongly recommended dipping into Ronnie Lane's work, so I did. I started with Slim Chance, and got absolutely hooked! It's musical, fun, well-crafted and multi-dimensional. It's instantly accessible yet it gets even better with each listen. I'm in the process of collecting everything Ronnie Lane did, and there are gems all over the place.But start here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelieveable....","review":"Hard to believe(or is it)that in this bass-ackwards world that there are only two reviews on this classic two-fer recording of truth and grassroots wisdom from the Late Great Ronnie Lane. ONE FOR THE ROAD is a five star release in any book and has been sadly overlooked in this off-kilter age we live in. SLIM CHANCE is no slouch either.No record collection is complete without and you owe it to yourself and to your children to own all of Ronnie's studio releases. They are all one of a kind, quality recordings of musicianship, truth and uncompromised individualism - all the way. One of the greatest songwriters of all time.Cheers Ronnie!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"Truman's Water is a bad band that makes irritating pseudo=intelectual pot-punk. Although they are compared to Polvo on Amazon, they are closer to Blood Brothers. Really obnoxious vocals and pointlessly \\"arty\\" song structures ruin the few good riffs on here. If you listen to the samples on Amazon they seem good, but the full songs get old VERY fast. Good for one listen if you can stand it. I gave it one star because the album cover is cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"A trail of red in a land of beauty, peace, order.","review":"I have enjoyed Tony Hillerman's stories for a long time now. One is never like the previous mystery, but is fresh and new. His work will be enjoyed for a long time, and he is sorely missed.Coyote Waits was another excellent read, once again set in the vast land of the Navajo Reservation, where Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee do their best to maintain peace, beauty and order. Even in the scene which looks like an Ansel Adams picture, greed, mayhem and murder can transpire. Here, where no gumshoes walk the beat, the evil coyote waits. The people of the story are as real as desert heat of the day. The plot moves in and out, leaving you wondering if an old \\"witch doctor\\" is as guilty as Chee initially believes, or as innocent as Chee ponders as the story moves on. Leaphorn and Chee pursue a different sort of \\"time bandit\\", who could possibly deceive them all. Justice, however, comes about via a young lover.A great story, and I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average","review":"This is not Tony Hillerman's best novel.

Even though I should agree that this novel is a good mixture of a detective novel and a introduction of Navajo culture, why the author used so much negative stuff to introduce Navajo culture? He could have written a happy novel about Navajo. Also everything is kept in suspense till the very end of the story and it turns out that there's no unexpected twist or deep story.Don't waste time, there are so many other novels that worth paying money for. Don't misinterpret that the best selling novel is the best novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"This book has been recommended to me many times since it was released and I just now got around to reading it.

I am not an expert in Classical Chinese, but Bob Flaws shows that he is not either by making several elementary mistakes. He often skips over characters and leaves them untranslated. He ignores grammar completely and only translates the major verbs and nouns. He claims to be producing a text that is not bogged down by overly scholastic terminology, but ends up producing a translation that can barely be considered a translation. His use of Wiseman's standardized terminology in a rigid ways actually makes an argument against standardized terminology-it just makes for a lousy read in general. There is nothing redeeming about this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"readers digest of chinese medicine classics","review":"I have read several translations of classical Chinese medicine texts, and in every instance of reading works by this author, Bob Flaws omits much of the information that is useful and relevant to traditional Chinese medicine practitioners.

This book is so touching and achingly beautiful. It reads like poetry. The words of the men themselves are printed alongside poignant photographs that seem to capture the sentiment of their words. I feel honored to have met some of these men in person and even more honored to have had the pleasure of asking them to autograph their individual pages. The title of my review here is what one of the men, Bruce, wrote to me last night.To be able to put a voice and a human face to those who have likely seen the best and the worst of life is a gift to all thinking and compassionate people.

The drums are very beautiful and Isaam is a great drummer. The first song on this CD is one of my favorite songs. It has such a beautiful arrangement. The music is a rich mixture of baladi, saidi, classical and drums. I love number ten also: it is a lovely accordion baladi. This CD also has very nice, interesting music that could be used for tribal-style.

POA great-","review":"After purchasing the other 2 Harry Potter games for PC I find the 3rd game to be the best. Issues such as difficulty saving games and very annoying chocolate frogs are solved in this game and small details like the ability to skip some cut scenes and a bonus bean room make Prisoner of Azkaban move quickly and with a great deal of fun.There are joint spells, Fred and George's shop and a flying hippogriff challenge that, while fairly tough, is very enjoyable. The graphics move much more smoothly and EA Games seems to have mastered things like flowing robes and mouths that match words. All in all, very happy with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very fun game","review":"For those that have grown up with Harry Potter, this game is certainly good addition to the franchise. I love the concept of the spell challenges, which have continued since the Sorcerer's Stone. This game's graphics are clean but not overdone, which is a nice change. On a negative side, I wish the game was longer, and that there were some stealth/keep-away-from-Filch sections like in previous games.Excellent game."},{"rating":"2","title":"It didn't work!","review":"I would have to say overall the game is fun, but it didn't work on my Windows NT! Which made me very frustrated, so I had to install on my other computer. I think that the spell symbols are a little mixed up and weird this time, which took some getting used to because the last two harry potter games didn't have that. But overall I would say that the first three harry potter games are the best out of all of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Work","review":"My copy of the game did not work.It goes all the way through installation but once it gets to the menu it simply will not start, and it would not allow me to exit either.

I highly recommend this game to harry potter lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised!!","review":"Upon getting this game I half expected it to be a simple kids' game along the lines of most kid's movie license games. So I had pretty low expectation to begin with, even if the games comes from EA.Well, I was right, that it IS a simple kid's game. And there's only three (yes, three) real levels, after the LONG tutorial \\"lectures.\\" But I was pleased with sheer amount of details (artwork/buildings/etc) they put into it. There's tons of hidden passages to get lost in, and many collectables that actually do have to do with the series.Also the game engine itself is pretty well programmed and you can almost trick yourself into thinking that the title is a regular 3rd person action adventure platformer.As a follower of the series, I'm pleased how this game turned out...I just wish it was a little more challenging and a bit longer. Keep in mind, if you have ANY experience in any video games you will breeze through the actual levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review","review":"THIS GAME IS AMAZING!!!!!! I love it so much!

Hopefully, EA will do a better job with the next version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly missed opportunity","review":"I agree almost completely with the review of darkgenius. Read that review. But darkgenius gave 4 stars while I give only 2. Why? Because it seems that no thought went into the game at all. There is nothing intense. Nothing challenging. Nothing surprising. Nothing to put you on the edge of your seat.The Chamber of Secrets game was infinitely superior, more innovative, longer, more intense, had a real storyline, and had a real climax. This new Prisoner of Azkaban game has none, despite the book's being the best of the series and despite having access to the wonderfully dark and intense new movie.Boo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good game, even on older PC","review":"I won't comment much on how much fun the game is (lots), but I wanted to note that this is one of the few games that will install and run on a machine with less video memory than \\"required\\". My 8MB laptop machine came up with a note that it was defaulting to software emulation and reducing video settings. The picture isn't high resolution, but it plays fast and smooth.

The first two in the series were basically identical in look and play, but the third has a totally different look and feel. The movement is much smoother and more lifelike and game play is faster.

If I had a choice between this game and my brother I would choose this game.The reason I like it is because the levels are great, the pictures are good, and there's this one level where you have to do this mirror thing where you connect the mirrors to a crystal ball.So buy this game and if you don't you're just sick."},{"rating":"2","title":"they work","review":"I surprised my doctor when my blood test showed I was no longer deficient in b-12 after I used these for a while.

Well, I would prefer to not feed myself cyanide, even if it is a small amount, so I started looking for the other types of b12 at my local chain drug stores. Every single bottle had the cyanocobalamin in it. I did eventually find this Now brand at a local vitamin store after calling around. The local GNC didnt even have the methylcobalamin type.

I dried out a couple of dehydrator packets I took from other bottles, but the tablets still disintegrated. I ended up throwing half of them away.NOW brand needs to one of two things:1. Put only 30 tablets in a bottles (I started noticing deterioration at about one month)OR2.

This book is great education for learning about the abuse through the victom's eyes and how they see it. For those who have had regular childhood, this book almost seems horrifying for the mental, physical and emotional abuse that went on for a child that wanted to be just like any other child but didn't know how. It is only normal that she couldn't get out of her situation, because she didn't understand what was normal except for what she experienced with others or saw - until her adult years in life and to be able to compair to what it should have been. That goes for any child. I recommend anyone to read this book. Thanks for reading my review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotionally Brutal","review":"I've read most of Charlotte Vale Allen's books, but I'd missed this one, so I finally decided to download it to my Kindle. It's a very honest portrayal of her horrific childhood. She was sexually abused by her father for about ten years. I think anyone who has experienced sexual abuse would benefit from reading this memoir. She doesn't sugarcoat the experience. She honestly shares that the experience has haunted her throughout her life and has caused confusion and pain in later relationships with men. But, she did free herself from her father and managed to come to terms with the experience over many years. There's something about Ms. Allen's writing that appeals to me--I think it's her directness and honesty, along with the ability to tell a good tale. Sadly, this one was based on real-life experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"never heard of it","review":"This is an older book, but I've never heard of it & can't read the review of it, anyone who can speak english, please tell me what this book is about.

While I do not believe that this is a book to \\"condone the war in Iraq\\" as one reviewer put it, it is extremely biased and any researcher using it must be careful not to take everything Davis' says to heart. As my favorite English professor used to say, \\"Take everything written with a grain of salt.\\" What is a fact is that Mr. Davis is an extremely well versed historian and expert on Oliver Cromwell.

Warrior Class, however was a disappointment. There were numerous errors in grammar and syntax, so that at times I had to reread a section more than once to decide what he was trying to say. The book is at its best in describing the technical features, though it is reaching the point of incredibility with the jet packs allowing an armored warrior to jump out of a plane at 300mph and land softly. There are numerous gaps in the story, the worst being the one when Thorn switches attitude from trying the run the heroes to ground to tacit support.

Unfortunately, the writing, plot and characters simply aren't up Mr. Brown's earlier efforts.When I read Tin Man (a terrible book) I vowed to buy no more of Mr. Brown's books but I borrowed Warrior Class from the library. Mr. Brown's earlier books were superb but, like so many other decent authors, he seems to have grown stale. The characters and their relationships seem shallower and much more neurotic. The plot -- a russian criminal bringing the Europe to the verge of war through the use of one stealth bomber for the sole purpose of getting an oil line built --- is far too thin.I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crosses the line","review":"I usually enjoy stories of this type. However, Mr. Brown's latest effort is disturbing in its underlying message - that it is okay, no, it is patriotic, for private citizens to become vigilanties if they believe the cause is right. In the novel, ex-President Martindale,ex-Air Force officers McLanahan and Briggs, and powerful private citizens Masters and Tork establish their own \\"private\\" military to fight wars when the elected government of the United States chooses take a more isolationist stance.

While I expected this book to be a bit 'out there' (and it was), about halfway through the book Brown decided it was time to invent ridiculous gadgets to go along with the ridiculous plots. My favorites included 'sausage-sized supersonic projectiles' that manage to plow through the entire sea all the way to the bottom where somehow they continue to plow 300 feet into the sea floor, and rocket-shoes that allow people to jump out of aircrafts.

Now, six months later, gravity has had it's way with the spring tensioner in the stand, and screen now rests at around a 60-degree angle with level. I've got the stand sitting on a pile of books just to be able to look upwards at it. I've gone so far as to disassemble the stand and try to readjust the spring mechanism, but it just won't budge.

Not challenging at all.Buy a different game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun!!!","review":"This game was very entertaining and the fact that you were able to have a couple of files going at once was very convenient alowing you to work on a couple of different things at once. The abilities that you were able to purchase from the shop were another bonus. This game gets harder as you go through the game, which allows you to get better as you go. Everybody I have let play this game has wanted to buy a copy of there own. My only complaint is the price of the game...quite expesive for a small chip. But all in all a great game and a wonderful addition to any collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Princess is now the Hero","review":"I remember first playing this game on a demo in NYC at the Nintendo Store but trying to buy a copy for myself wasn't so easy. I love how the game finally stars Princess Peach as the heroine instead of hte damsel in distress. Its really fun and even though I'm almost done beating it I know I'm going to keep playing it so i can try and beat my old scores. Even my best friend and her daughters enjoy playing it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS SOOOOOO FUN!!!!!","review":"i got this game for christmas. it is somewhat hard for players like me who are less experienced with action games. i'm not saying it's really hard...in some parts it's easy, and in some parts it's difficult. i just got to the second boss. more experienced players might find it easy....or maybe not...i don't know. anyway it's really fun and i highly recommend it. there isn't much violence...no blood or anything. it's also fun to play with the vibes. if peach sits still she starts twirling her umbrella and eventually perry(the umbrella) opens up itself and closes on her head... it's kinda funny, but i feel bad that peach looks stupid in spite of an annoying parasol. it's a fun game. buy it. just because it stars princess peach, it DOESN'T mean it is just for girls...even though i am a girl, i mostly wanted it because i like peach.i've run out of things to write. this game rules. bye."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is basiclly my favorite game! The game changes roles change when Peach sets off to rescue Mario, when he is held captive by Bowser, along with Luigi, and some mushrooms. He uses the Vibe Specter to do so. Peach heads off with a magic umbrella named Perry. This game has simple controls and is pretty chalenging, but not enough to make you really frustrated and fling your DS across the room. The bosses are entertaining and you have to think before you attack them. Girls (like me) can finally use Peach to save Mario. But for girls or even boys I think you should get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"good game","review":"good clean fun for the whole familyI would recommend this productcould be cheaper but still a nice buy over all"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game if...","review":"I'm a 21 year old girl who'd rather play a fun game than an intense game. Super Princess Peach is perfect for me. It's fun. It's a little bit challenging. I don't have to play it every day, like I feel compelled to do with Animal Crossing. Princess Peach has some pretty cool powers she can use. I really love this game. It's my favorite game for the DS so far. If you're looking for an incredibly challenging, action packed game, this one is not for you. Still, I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"not just a kid's game or a game for girls....","review":"it's just a great super-fun game period. i love nintendo. they focus on making good games for good handheld systems. super princess peach is just another in the long line of nintendo hits. with new super mario bros., pokemon diamond/pearl, and all the rest (zelda, FF3, etc) joining the already solid DS lineup (mario and luigi, mario kart, mario 64, meteos, resident evil DS, castlevania, jump superstars, animal crossing, nintendogs, brain training, advance wars, etc) not to mention the extensive GBA library (too many great titles to mention), it appears that the nintendo domination of handheld gaming is past, present, and future. sweet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good cover but not flush","review":"The cover for me does not close flush at the top and bottom when closed/locked... there was a small gap (maybe 1/8\\") and since you could view it on-end in my setup it bothered me.

In fact, there are only two dull videos in the bunch - No More Heroes, which is just flashes of news clippings, and Nuclear Device, which is rather silly. The rest are very good to great. The best treat is seeing Hugh Cornwell and JJ Burnell looking SO COOL!!! The sound quality is really good and the picture quality is very good for that era. If you love the Stranglers, this is a great visual souvenir of their early years to have. It also includes the notorious live film of Nice n Sleazy in London uncensored."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a fun group! Didn't see them on TV back then...","review":"Very enjoyable collection of videos from the (just) pre-MTV era. Many of these videos are funny and creative, which is an accomplishment considering they were pretty low-budget affairs. If you like/love the Stranglers, you'll like/love this DVD.

My heart literally skipped several beats. Miracles do happen, and this is a prime example. The Powers That Be have finally heard the pleas of the B&B fandom, and I know I'm not alone in pre-ordering this. After a decade and a half of waiting, what's a few more months? I was a mere child in love with the series when it aired, and was heartbroken when it was taken off. Now, for it come back to us in full DVD glory, it brings tears to my eyes. Domo arigato!

Whippeeeee!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Revisiting an old friend","review":"I waited a long time to see \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" again. It was always the ultimate fantasy: a powerful protector who loved but asked nothing in return; a beautiful, brave woman who needed him in her life (despite some convincing kickboxing moves of her own) and kept his secret; a bond that nothing could break; all that yearning, all that sexual tension with no sex. Think Romeo and Juliet, the original Beauty and the Beast, Moonlighting.So did the revisit measure up to memory? Not quite--but not bad. The storylines are weaker than I remembered, with more violence as a solution to problems. Everything seems underlit, even with the TV picture set to \\"vivid.\\" Vincent's voice is not as deep and thrilling, which I think was an artifact created for Ron Perlman in the second season. But Linda Hamilton radiates purity and beauty that we never saw again after she married James Cameron.I will certainly buy the second season when it is available."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's about time!!!","review":"I was beginning to think I'd have to buy a DVD recorder so I could copy my VHS tapes of \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" to DVD. I don't know what took so long for this box set to be released. It aired at a time when there was almost no fantasy on television and it was singularly unique -- romantic, intelligent, exciting. Set in modern day New York, the fairy tale was transformed into a different time and place without losing any of its magic. No singing teapots in this one, just well-written, compelling storytelling. Especially strong is the episode where Catherine accepts a job in Providence, RI. What transpires to keep her in NY is unbelievably moving. I challenge you to watch this show and not need tissue a time or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Timeless Treasure","review":"After receiving my \\"First Season\\" set, my son and I made an all nighter of it! We watched all six disc in a night. To me it was a chance to fall in love all over again. To him it was an opportunity to witness what true love really is. To be able to see that bond between Vincent and Catherine is a beautiful contribution made to that thing we call love. This is a timeless classic of love. The good, the bad, the beautiful, and the not so beautiful. The commitment of two people so in love that no matter what they have to face, as long as they can face it together, they can make it through anything. It has given me a chance to sit and experience those same feelings for my husband all over again. Sometimes we get so wrapped up in the worldly and daily grind of life, that we forget to take a moment to appreciate the ones we love the most. I, like others who have enjoyed this series from the beginning, also hope they release the second and third series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings back good memories","review":"I was a teenager when this show first aired on prime time television, and I used to faithfully follow it every week...the love shared between Vincent & Catherine...those two shared on-screen chemistry & gave me goosebumps watching them!

I was about 10 when Vincent and Catherine first stole my heart. However, now many years later I find myself very bored re-watching this show. I don't know if I only enjoyed it the first time because I was so young, or that TV has changed so much in the intervening years that this show seems old fashion and out of date. The relationship that once seemed so romantic between Vincent and Catherine now seems kind of silly and over the top--like I'm reading a dime store bodice ripper minus the steamy sex. The plots are predictable and boring.I am very disappointed :( I wanted to love it again! Oh well...I have my memories."},{"rating":"1","title":"A headache!!!!","review":"The Second Season and Final Season was brand new as described. First Season was used and NOT brand new as described.

I paid with an Amazon card and Amazon has to refund your money.

After looking in the case I notice I was missing disc 2, 3, 4, and 5!!!! What was these people thinking? Tells me that they didn't look at what they was sending me. Tells me they don't care!

Wonder when season two will come?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkably Well Made","review":"You know this series is much like \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" or Disney TV series \\"Gargoyles\\" in that the plot or episode synopsis can make it sound so off the wall sometimes it seems hard to take it seriously. So any new comers should keep that in mind. It's really not as far fetched as it sounds. It's a remarkably well made TV series and they spared no expense on makeup, costumes, even the music for the show was big screen worthy.This series has been a cult hit for 20 years now, and for good reasons. Anyone who loves fairy tales, Shakespeare, or mythology (and maybe a dash of Law and Order) will really enoy this.Ron Perlman is FABULOUS as the Beast, and Linda Hamilton makes a wonderfully brilliant \\"Beauty\\". Even though she needs to be 'resuced' by her Beast sometimes, she still comes off as a very strong female protagonist.Even Disney BATB fans wouldn't be disapointed with this series if they've never seen it before.I hope the DVD release does the series justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great show - terrible dvd quality","review":"I was glad to see this dvd set released, but I am very disappointed in the quality of the presentation. I have thoroughly enjoyed the shows once again, although I have not finished watching the first season yet. I fully expected a 1.33:1 aspect ratio, since I'm sure the original show was recorded that way. But some effort could have been put into cleaning up the video transfer a bit. It doesn't even look like anyone cleaned up weak horizontal/vertical synch signals, as every now and then a scene will lose its vertical stabilization briefly on my tv (no - it isn't my player or tv because this is the only dvd in my large collection that behaves this way). If this dvd set comes out in a \\"remastered\\" version someday, I am going to be very upset. But the shows themselves are as enjoyable to me today, as they were when I watched them in prime-time, years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"OH MY GOSH....YIPPEE - and yes, it's about time!","review":"I can't believe it, they are actually doing this, and the whole first season! There are so many reviews already even though it's not available yet because we dedicated, die-hard fans don't need to actually have the product; we've probably watched each episode over and over. Now I don't have to worry about my old VHS tapes crumbling, on which I originally taped the episodes from '87-'90. How much longer could they last? The only other shows in all these years that have even interested me are Lost and Invasion...and they canceled one!Laura"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Pass on This Series","review":"The wait is finally over. This is by far one of the best TV series ever created. The writing and acting is brilliant. I have all the episodes released on VHS and have viewed them over and over again. You will not be disappointed. The sets are awesome as are the characters, music and poetry. I read that the series ended because the sets were too expensive to produce.

Waiting for Seasons 2 & 3","review":"I was nearly 10 years old when I watched parts of the three seasons on the national channel (Greece). I was amazed and touched by the cruelty and romance of this 'masterpiece'.Unfortunately, I cannot comment on the quality (in comparison with the TV version) but, sincerely, the series itself is an excellent fairy tale (?) that I wish to have for my children.It is obvious, that I am anxiously looking forward to Seasons 2 &3 on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beauty and the Beast - all 3 seasons","review":"I watched all three seasons of this romantic adventure on television from 1987 through 1990. I was surprised it did not go into reruns, but I'm so very glad it did not because I did not remember any of the episodes. The only thing I remembered were the sounds of Vincent's and Catherine's voices. The third season DVD includes \\"Vincent's Quest\\" with original love letters read by Vincent and an interactive journey with questions and answers. I will not give it away, but the end of the last season was very appropriate and rewarding for Vincent. Although Vincent had a very dark side, he was extremely caring and loving with his friends and above all with Catherine. The journey the two of them went on was unusual, but who would not want to love and be loved as this incredible series portrayed love, kindness and friendship. If only television would give us more beautiful fantasies to watch. I know fans of this show are very satisfied to see this recorded."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Return to Romance","review":"It was so nice to see this finally released.

I was actually watching it for a friend so I could tell her what happened (I had no spare tapes at the time to record it)...and I was beside myself by the end of the episode. Every Friday night at 8:00, my sister and I planted ourselves in front of the TV. We have all the episodes on tape; we didn't miss a one. And of course, twenty years of playing those tapes over and over have put me in a quandary because they were wearing out.

It was very difficult to adjust the straps once she was seated in the seat. Also in assembling it to move the shoulder straps to the correct slot, there is no way you can follow the directions of rotating the metal plate. We had to take a screwdriver and force it out in order to adjust the shoulder straps. I liked the looks of the plaid cover so I gave it 1 star for that reason only. We were able to take it back and will end up buying a different booster car seat. This one is horrible so don't waste your money on it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I am returning mine","review":"This seat is problematic for exactly the reasons the others mentioned. It is almost impossible to adjust the height of the straps as the metal clamps cannot be removed with other than brute force and a tool.

We hardly ever use it. This past weekend I went to use it and noticed we needed to make adjustments to the strap height - this ended up being a nightmare. I could not get one of the metal clips to snap in the way it says it should have. I even used a hammer (which at that point I knew it was getting returned) and the piece would not go in. This made me very disappointed and frustrated. Very poor design. Also, please note that the fabric also started fading after about 4 months and the cup holder would not stay on."},{"rating":"1","title":"The straps are horrible","review":"My dad purchased this car seat for my son while on vacation this fall. He originally had a Cosco Touriva car seat and hated that one because the seat was not padded enough. The padding in the Evenflo car seat is decent for the price, but the straps are horrible. I can never get the right side to tighten. The adjustment bar is on the left side and will never tigthen the strap on them right.

One was enough. The bottom latches slid down the straps and slipped through the slots in the seat pad. The slots were wide enough for the latches, but not my hand, so the latches got stuck inside the base. Of course this happened away from home. Since driving home with my daughter not buckled in was not an option, we had to completely remove the seat, retrieve the latches and reinstall the seat in the parking lot! We exchanged this car seat for the Graco Comfort Sport and are much happier."},{"rating":"2","title":"good car seats","review":"I purchased this seat as a toddler/booster seat when my first son was about one, and a second when my second son was old enough. Now my sons are 4 and 2 1/2 and we still have these seats. I like the front adjustor for the straps, makes it quick and easy to fix the straps especially when they were additional gear (winter jackets or raincoats). I plan to buy a third for my daughter now (just turned one). They are practical in design, fairly easy to install (what carseat is quick and easy??) and a good value.

The attachable arm rests and cup holder are made so poorly my son pulls them right out!!

It seemed pretty comfortable, and it fit my daughter well. While trying it my only issue was that the tabs that you buckle fall through the hole to underneath the seat. So if they end up falling through the holes you would have to unbuckle the whole seat and start over, where some of the other have plastic inserts (graco&cosco do this)to prevent this problem. I was very disappointed because the price point was good and it seemed like a good car seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves the seat!","review":"We recently purchased this for our second vehicle. We used the latch system and the car seat won't even budge. Our 4 year old son loves that he can sit upright and look out the window.

However, my daughter is still under the thirty pound limit so we have to continue to strap her using the 5 point harness. What a cumbersome process!! Like the previous reviewer, the lower latches slide down below the seat and you have to fish them out. The adjustable strap that is placed on the harness itself, just seems to get in the way.

We researched booster seats and found most of them to be either flimsy or too complicated. This seat lets our son sit up straight, instead of reclined like he was in his Britax car seat. I have read several reviews about toddlers falling asleep in this type of seat and having their head bob all over the place, but we simply got him a neck roll ($6) and we dont see any floppy head.

The reactions of the family to crises and the roles they each fall into are so accurately done that the viewer can get way into his/her own alcoholic upbringing and pain before they are aware of it.I have shown this at several gatherings and it never fails to shake some people up seriously. Kids are especially vulnerable in their teen years. But entire families can get very agitated during the viewing.So I would recommend that anyone showing or viewing this film be prepared to deal with some extreme reactioons for several days afterwards. Don't just show this and send your guests home. Instead have a discussion and a followup trip to a meeting of Alateen, Al-Anon or AA.BUT SHOW IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reference.","review":"The American Civil War must be the most written-about episode in U.S. history, with as many as 70,000 titles thus far and more appearing every day.The sheer scope of the literature can be overwhelming. Where to start? The present work is an excellent jumping-off point, as it organizes the literature and research into eleven broad areas, then subdivides each into 47more specialized topics such as ordnance, social conditions, and economic factors, each of these then treated in a bibliographic essay by an expert on the subject.The result is a feast for beginner and old hand alike, opening the entire literature for browsing or focused research. Woodworth and colleagues have produced a work of enduring value, which deserves a place on the bookshelf of anyone interested in the Civil War.(The \\"score\\" rating is an ineradicable feature of the page.

They arrived in an Amazon box with the original product packaging inside. These units are made in China, and the original packaging looks like its been through a war. The packaging is also very flimsy, and in my opinion for a delicate item like this is totally inadequate.Amazon promptly replaced the damaged unit, and I received another that is damaged even worse that the previous one.So I am returning both units today for a refund. In my opinion, Amazon should drop Quoizel as a vendor and stop taking any orders as long as they keep sending inadequate and severely damaged packaging and product.I have hundreds of previous orders with Amazon and this is by far the worst product packaging issue I have had. Amazon has been very prompt and courteous with the returns, but overall I think they would do better to weed out vendors of this quality.I'm going back to Amazon to search for new lights, but definely not from Quoizel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very accurate","review":"Immersed in 175 degree water, this gauge read 215.

Without a name ( that we know of..) in-between failures and uncertainties he lives in a world of prostitutes, actresses, maids and only in a final decision on the eve of a great political event in Spain does he manage to free himself from his mediocre and depressive lifestyle. A descriptive and rich portrait of the last \\"uncertaint years\\" of the spanhish monarchy.

Andrew Lang is attempting to refute the theories of Max Muller, who argued that mythology was \\"a disease of language.\\" This book is Andrew Lang's refutation of that theory and endorsement of the countervailing theory that mythology is a survival from the misperceptions and reflexive animism of primitive peoples.I can only imagine this text being of interest to those who are truly *dedicated* to the study of comparative mythology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes WW II reading interesting","review":"I thought this book was pretty good, considering it is a history book.

As mentioned in the earlier review, the author offers a general overview of this period but covers such things as Hitler and his relationship with the German Army and its commanders, Hitlers 'style' of warfare, the concept of 'Blitzkrieg' and the weapons & tactics involved and finally the camapign in France. The book is well researched and is very easy to read with 20 maps, 59 B&W photos and a number of line drawings and charts to assist the reader. I do not think that the book or any of its ideas has aged since it was first published in 1979 and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking to understand how the German Army conquered all before it in 1940."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Troma Masterpiece","review":"Dark, gritty, violent, disturbing.

However, I was very dissapointed. My dissapointment isn't due to the songs, though. A lot of the songs are very good and feature some spectacular performances from Sherinian and various guitar gods. My dissapointment is with the overall sound of this album. The mix is horrible. It actually makes it unbearable to listen to more than a couple of times. There is essentially no bass in the mix and everything else just sounds very weak. If it weren't for this, I'd probably have given this album 4 or 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Derek's best solo effort yet","review":"Derek Sherinian is an awesome keyboard player. But what has always struck me most about Derek is that despite the fact that he is such a great keyboard player technically, he is still very much a ROCK musician. His music always rocks and is always very heavy. He does not get bogged down in overdoing the atmospheres that keyboards can provide. He uses atmospheric keyboard styles but never overuses them. But, in addition to the ROCK attitude, this album brings in a very strong Jazz Fusion influence, primarily along the lines of the early solo work of Al DiMeola (one of my personal favorites for his early solo work). In addition, Yngwie Malmsteen & Zakk Wylde provide some magnificent guitar work on this recording. As does Steve Lukather.The track \\"Sons of Anu\\" is worth the price of the CD.

The producer didn't seem to make much of an effort to get soulful performances out of the musicians - that would be Derek.I love each and every one of the guitar players featured on this album in their own right, but the soundscapes that Derek painted for them to play in just didn't evoke that much excitement."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrid","review":"a lot of talent and a huge dissapointment. very standard throw-away metal riffs with tons of \\"noodle-ing\\" (speed riffs up and down the fret board, repeat) i really bought the cd for drummer simon phillips who sounds uninspired here. if you are a simon fan save your dough and search out any of his solo cds. dimeola fans do the same, i recommend the brilliant kiss my axe. star cycle is really the only good song on here, but even then, the jeff beck version is much better. i tried to give this album a chance, but after so many times i felt as if i were punishing myself listening to it. luckily the store where i bought it took it back. it really is that bad. if you like this \\"prog-metal\\" style of music though, i would like to recommend john arch- a twist of fate cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metal for grown-ups","review":"Fans and musicians are sometimes aggrieved that metal isn't taken seriously by those outside the faith -- after all, the virtuoso performances of drummers, keyboardists and guitarists are often dazzling. One problem is that so much metal is repetitious. Every hemidemisemiquaver that Yngwie Malmsteen plays is utterly predictable and pat. Many metal fans like that. The astonishing thing about Sherinian is his endless inventiveness. True musicality never ceases to progress and surprise the listener. A lot of reviewers who don't like Sherinian have just been left behind by him, or are unable to tell that the whirlwind playing is not simply the usual arpeggios and dreary riffs, but something creative and thrilling.Derek Sherinian is a wonderful performer and a very serious musician, and this album deserves a listening from everyone who loves to hear new music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"This is more of an instructional video that you might watch in a high school PE class once before you go out and try it than a pilates routine designed for lower back pain.

Its going back tommorrow!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a different one to use indoors","review":"If you are buying this bed to use at home as a guest bed...DON'T!I have two areobeds; I bought the first one in 1993 when they had just come out. The pump is attached to the bed and it needs to be plugged to charge it. Fifteen years later it still works like a charm. I liked it so much; I recently bought a Minute bed because I needed another guest bed. It does not say anywhere on the box that you cannot use the pump without having to charge it first for 24 hours. Needles to say one of my unexpected guests had to sleep on the sofa. The battery is NiCad, which means it develops a memory, so now even if I remembered to charge it the day before, it does not run long enough to inflate the bed. They do not offer a separate electric, detachable pump, so now I'm stuck with a \\"plastic carpet\\" that cannot be inflated with anything else. The areobeds work great, but if you need one that can be used for any unexpected occasion, buy a different type."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the price!!","review":"I bought this item for indoor use and I'm happy I did it. It is really comfortable and reliable (Atleast so far). Though not like a cotton mattress, it still holds good for guest bed room and other occasional use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bed and fast shipping","review":"This bed was very well priced and I received it very quickly. This was a very positive transaction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swimming with the SV-iP4G","review":"I started a daily swim program 7- 8 months ago. After 1/2 hour of laps it got pretty boring. The SV-iP4G helps me get through my 1.5 hours a day doing laps. It is wonderful! No leaks. No worries. I am about to test their warranty on the headset, as mine appears to have a wire short, but I am still very impressed with its operation. I have both the armband and waistband carriers for use when swimming, and I like the armband the best. I recommend it to anyone who asks about it at the gym, and also recommend it to anyone who wants to spend time swimming with music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conceptually Good- Bad Execution","review":"Conceptual this is a good product but as for adding music to your swim workout it's not a winner. I was so excited when it arrived but spent the majority of my workout trying to readjust the arm band for drag or stopping to re hit the play button because a flip turn cause it to pause. And the earphones dont give you consistent sound as you swim; creating a somewhat irritating tin sound after a few laps."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing chocolate-voiced off-spring of Cleo Laine","review":"I never heard of this artist but listening to the CD is like rediscovering an old friend. She not only sings with a rich, full jazz/easy listening/oldies alto but she's written every number! Haunting, lyrical, snazzy - a must have in any collection, she follows in the footsteps of Cleo Laine, who encouraged her career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!!","review":"This book was amazing and launched me into reading the entire series featuring Amanda Garrett. If you are looking for an action filled book with a small romance off to the side then this is the book for you. It has the perfect amount of action to keep you interested but also shows a personal side to the female captain. James Cobb is a great author and can write the hell out of any war novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALL AROUND GREAT BOOK","review":"I found that this book was a all around good read. The Idea of Stealth Technology is auctially quite realistic I mean who noes the U.S Navy might already have Stealth Ships and are just not telling us . I mean they tried a simular Idea with The Philiadelpha Project (which really happend), so why not write a book about something similar to it. The only part I found Hokey, was that they had very little major problems. Other than that it would make a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"great military techno-thriller","review":"very exciting, and the weapons and systems are very realistic and seem like the logical step in future naval warfare, can't wait for his next book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"High-tech Mayhem","review":"James Cobb dishes up first rate action in this high-tech naval thriller. As an earlier reviewer mentioned, Cobb's details are sometimes lacking, but overall he does a good job of capturing the flavor of life and combat aboard an ultra-modern warship. For a guy who never served in uniform, Mr. Cobb writes with much better accuracy than I'd expect. As a retired Navy Chief, I was frankly shocked by Captain Garret's romance with her helicopter pilot. As a reader, I found it an interesting flaw in an otherwise strong character. It slowed me down for a little while, but the action drew me right back in.Jeff Edwards, Author of \\"Torpedo: A Surface Warfare Thriller\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"High-seas, high-tech battle stations in the near future.","review":"Stealth technology applied to a battle cruiser, a nasty enemy to sally against, and characters both believable and flawed. Relentless pace that allows no respite, no resting. You will read it in one sitting as you move at break-neck speed like a raft on river rapids. Only an ephemeral love interest by the Skipper mars an otherwise perfect 10. The weapons and stealth systems are logical outgrowths of present technology, and leaves you wanting to see them in service. The final battle is excruciatingly exciting, and you will read it more than once to savor and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dime Store Novel","review":"This is a classic dime store novel and shouldn't dare be compared with Clancy or Brown. The plot is predictable and anyone with a Navy background will laugh at this \\"supership\\". On the other hand, it is a quick summer read so if you've run out of books to read, you may want to borrow this from the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Step Aside Clancy","review":"I'm not going to thumb my nose at the genius of the Hunt for the Red October but James Cobb has done for destroyers what Tom Clancy did for the submarine. He takes it into tangible, believable waters with characters that are courageous, flawed and wonderfully human. The lead characters and their lesser counterparts all come together and play like a orchestra telling a tale of naval daring set in the lush backdrop of South America which is a nice change from the 'Axis of Evil' plot that usually involve: North Korea, China and Iran. And for once, we have none of the Cold War runoff in the typical KGB interference. The story is pure and untainted in that regard. I would love to see this book turned into a movie, it occupies a permanent place on my shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful conversations about life.","review":"Rohmer = talk, usually thoughtful talk; in this case very thoughtful talk, as the protagonist teaches philosophy and that occasionally becomes the topic of conversation. Love is also discussed. And life. And desires. People manipulate. People are manipulated. People realize they have been manipulated and respond with varying degrees of annoyance or anger. All much more interesting and engaging than it sounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Looks Like It Is Going to Be a VERY Long Year","review":"I really don't like it when I get to the end of a movie and wonder why it was even made. Indeed, this movie moved so slow I think it took just short of an eternity to watch it! My wife, literally, longed for it to come to the end. We both found the conversations to be mostly overly verbose and insignificant to moving the story along. There isn't anything in it that would be against traditional family values. The reason we watched it is because the daughter was eighteen years old, and I'm working on a book on movies about kids. I'd say the best that could be said of this movie is that it does give the feeling of being the 'third wheel' or the 'odd woman out.' This is supposed to be the first in a series of four seasons; if so, it is going to be a very, very long year."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i expected","review":"I was disappointed in the movie, \\"A Hired Heart\\" because, although it had the potential of being a cute romantic comedy, it did not pass my test. I am on the lookout for romantic comedies and romances which do not have language or sensuality in them. I read the reviews and was mistakenly led to believe this was an innocent love story...one I could share with my teenage kids or my close friends. But the sex scene, the foul language, and the message of using a person for gain, was not appealing to me, and I will probably not loan it out to others. I will stick to Love Comes Softly, Love's Enduring Promise, Emma (with Gwyneth Paltrow), and The Inheritance (with Meredith Baxter Birney) any time, over this. Sorry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The disappointed heart","review":"I loved \\"Love Comes Softly\\", and when I saw that this was recommended for those who liked that movie, I bought this one. \\"The Hired Heart\\" did not have the morals or spirituality of \\"Love Comes Softly\\". There was also bad language, which was not present in the other movie. For anyone looking for a movie without language and pre-marital sex, this is not it. The story was good enough to stand on its own without adding the language and immorality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a family movie.","review":"Despite the cute sounding description, this is not a family movie. The constant undertone of the movie is the sexual tension between the two characters and the utterly absurd emotional reactions of the heroine. The idea of the movie was a good one but once again Hollywood messed it up. We were very disappointed and threw the video out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"I cannot believe I was recomended this because I rated Love's Enduring Promise (which is decent, moral, Christian movie). I read only part of the first customer reveiw, and it sounds really, really sick. Amazon.com: take a clue. I appreciate your services, and I expect that you won't try to sell me anything else of this type. Zero stars. I would not reccomend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie, not so good quality","review":"I saw this movie long time ago on TV and since then I have always tried to find it on DVD. I had no success down here in Brazil (South America) and in the US it was difficult, so I was pretty happy to find it and watch it again. It's a light movie with a little drama, but mostly romantic and funny. Great characters, great actors (Barry Corbin, Graham Greene, Penelope Ann Miller, Brett Cullen) and a sweet story.Unfortunately, the quality of the image is not too good. If you're not too demanding you'll be OK, but if you expect DVD type image, you'll probably be disappointed. The image is actually quite \\"funny\\" sometimes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, informative read","review":"I enjoyed this book and the personal view of someone witnessing 9/11 in NYC. I found myself aching for the plight the characters were in. Very good read - finished it in one airline flight. Only found the references to the main characters interest in languange to be distracting. Found myself glossing over those parts to get on with the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting new songs!","review":"\\"Love is the only Soldier\\" is one of those albums that's jamp-packed with emotion. Every song on this CD tells a unique story and brings the listener to another level of wonderment. When I first received a copy of this CD, I listened to it over and over again. I just couldn't get enough!This CD is easily one of my favorites! A definite must-have for any serious Jann Arden fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Wow, after 3 awesome CDs this is quite a let down -- don't mind the reflective mood but the songs are just not good. No melody just b-o-r-i-n-g! Luckily her next release \\"Jann Arden\\" is a step in the right direction but still not the equal to the terrific earlier releases. Hope the next one is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A living book on an arid subject","review":"The story of the privatzation of Manila Water and Sewage System doesn't look like an exiting subject, more the kind of book you read when you are in the water business, because it will be full of data, and you \\"have to\\". The entire contrary, the book is read as a novel, with dramas, questions and uncertainties up to the end of the process. That would make every book interesting, but there is much more: by clearly explaining how the Philippine Government has step by step overcome the problems encountered during the privatization process, this book is, for any administration willing to privatize water services, a catalogue of what to do (or not). Eventually, the book is also very useful for managers of private companies involved in the business of water privatization, as it gives an unique insight of the thoughts of the Civil Servants who had driven the privatization of MWSS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product BUT Beware of Your Crib Design!","review":"We love the whaley whale bedding. The quilting done on it is so interesting. You can't really tell this in the picture, but the soft fabric is sewn so it looks like there are waves running through the water background. My daughter really likes the feel of the bumper.The one problem we found was that the ties on the bottom and top of the bumper do not hold it onto our crib very well. I had to snip the bottom ties and hand sew them onto the top between the existing tie lines in order to make it fit our crib better. Even with this tiny alteration, I would buy this product again in a heartbeat. It's extremely cute, and I think it works well for babies of any gender."},{"rating":"1","title":"bouncy, soft and slow","review":"My local skate shop recommended these wheels for cruising, but, unfortunately, they're very slow, even with new brand new bearings. For sidewalk cruising, I much prefer my 68mm Powell cruising bombers (86a). Maybe I'm not used to riding wheels this soft, but the Bombers are much faster, and still very grippy and smooth."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of a fantasy anthology than a horror anthology","review":"This was disappointing -- it's much more of a fantasy anthology than a horror anthology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suki Review Revised","review":"I Orderd two products, the Skin Toner was great, fair price,great shpping.

And, I point out again, very badly? Unnecessary and cheap, I have a feeling the book is too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book!","review":"I ordered this book along with How to Restore Your Muscle Car. Overall its a good book, with lots of projects that are broken down and organized well. The projects don't go as in depth as, say a factory shop manual, but give you an idea of what you need for parts, tools, and the like. If you have a muscle car and want to know about some upgrades you can do to the engine, or if you want to know how to take off some of the stainless trime, etc this is the book for you.

Bitter Instinct has numerous redundant passages and bogs down with too much introspection right from the beginning. The formatting on the kindle also inexplicably has several unnecessarily hyphenated words, which I found distracting. I only made it through about 10% before I couldn't take it anymore. At only $3, I guess I got what I paid for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the next one!!","review":"If you have been anxiously awaiting this Jessica Coran novel as I have, just skip over it and wait for the next one. This storyline was not even close to the previous Jessica Coran \\"Instinct\\" novels. It was, frankly, boring. Too much gibberish about poetry and not enough forensic details as all of the other stories in the past have had. I read these novels for the terrific medical/forensic details, hard-hitting detective work, and the gripping suspense that usually keep me guessing until the very end. This novel should be non-fiction based on all that I learned about the poets and poetry of the modern and pre-modern world.Take my advice, as a huge fan of Robert Walker, wait for the next installment in the Instinct series (hopefully there is one) and hope also that it is much, much better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book borke my record.","review":"I have always been patient. Once I picked a book, I will make myself finish it as a way to tell myself that my choice is correct and worthy. But sorry, could not do it with this one.The 1st 50 some pages were fine, but then it went downhill. A point made was repeatedly said, scenes were dragging, unnecessary script and telling like the Russian helicopter and the ride side tracked the story, the writer showed off too much with the poems/peotry...all made the reading bulky and dull. I did make an effort to convince the story would pick up later. However, if by finishing 1/3 of the book and it still could not intrigue me, reading which should be a pleasant activity turned to be a chore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinky writer","review":"I can't believe this guy got published. His writing is fragmented, disjointed. His character development is poor. Yuck! How can anyone say he's better than . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"serial killers can be dull, too","review":"This novel got less and less interesting the closer I got to the end, the exact opposite of what a crime novelist should be trying to achieve. I think the main problem is the way he deals with the serial killer-- with the author trying to keep his identity a secret, we never really get to know the charismatic psychopath, and he remains a background character, an enigma.Second is the way the crimes are committed themselves. That so many people would willingly let someone carve poems into their flesh, even after the bodies begin to pile up, is ludicrous.There are other problems, too: too little forensic or investigative detail, characters that are caricatures, etc. I read his first four or five Jessica Coran novels, and this is a big disappointment compared with those early efforts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Movie--but that last scene...?","review":"A fantastic, moving, dramatic movie about the casualties--at home--of the Vietnam War....Voigt, Fonda, and Dern are superb.But one thing that has always nagged at me--the very final scene with the \\"Lucky Out\\" sign on the convenience store door--how are people interpreting the meaning of this?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Coming Home","review":"A love story to be sure, but also a highly original take on the human price of war.

A triumph from the late, talented Hal Ashby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coming Home","review":"I saw this film many years ago, and don't remember whether I've yet seen it on video. I remember it being a profoundly moving movie with excellent portrayals of people seeking what they need to be happy and others realizing their reality is not satisfying anymore.

Look for excellent scene at end of movie with Bruce Dern accompanied by the music of The Rolling Stones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite, full of cliches.","review":"This is a truly bad movie that does not get better with age.

He rolls around her house in his wheelchair with his shirt off and it makes Jane get wet and slushy all over.The part I like best about this garbage is when Jane's husband comes home and blows the creep away with a shotgun hole in the middle of his exposed chest. That part is really cool. Unfortunately, it was left out of the version I saw, so there are no saving graces to this film at all.It ends with the cheated-upon husband running into the sea with his backside jiggling. Thank you for that unforgettable junk.Jane is as wooden as a soup ladle."},{"rating":"2","title":"painfully true to life movie.","review":"Both Jane Fonda and John Voight gave excellent performances of people living during and with the Vietnam War.

It is truly a moving experience of the tragic circumstances faced by many of our men who served in this terrible war. The performances by the stars were extraordinary and the movie deserved every award it received."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent acting in a great and powerful film","review":"...Now back to the movie....Coming Home is a wonderful film with great performances from Jane Fonda and Jon Voight who both deservedly won Oscars. Penelope Milford also shines in her part as Janes best friend. I also think all the music used in the film was fantastic it added so much and made the film even more powerful and moving. I loved this film and if it was not for the \\"Deer Hunter\\" it would have easily swept the 1978 Oscars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A PAINFUL TIME","review":"The acting, scripting and storyline are perfectly on the mark for this important wartime piece. And you can't overlook the soundtrack. This is as poignant and sensitive a story on the Vietnam experience as any I have read or seen on the screen. This should go in everyone's library."},{"rating":"2","title":"eveneve","review":"As a product of the 70's, I suppose I may be somewhat biased, but this is a beautiful movie.

But after further research on the TimeLife website, I realized an ENORMOUS number of the episodes were identical to those already released by Columbia House and Gunther-Renky(sp.)...very disappointing. I will not spend money on virtually duplicate DVDs merely for a chance to own a few new episodes and a sprinkling of bonus material. I can only hope TimeLife decides to release the DVDs individually so I can invest less money trying to collect episodes I do not already own.Hint: For those who years ago purchased the VHS episodes of The Carol Burnett Show from Columbia, please know these VHS tapes were not copyright protected so they can be easilyconverted to DVD & will last years longer than VHS tapes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still no season box sets","review":"I love the \\"Carol Burnett Show\\" - we used to stay home on Saturday nights just to watch this landmark variety series.One of these days, (before I die, please) they will stop all this \\"Carol's Favorites\\" or \\"Ultimate Collection\\" crap and just release the seasons in order, like we, the REAL fans, want.Until then, I will purchase no configuration of this show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"DVD's vibrate very loudly, tried them in 2 different DVD players with same result.

Still I am glad to have a collection of what I would agree is some of the best shows I remember."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as I remembered","review":"If you are looking for funny moments from the Carol Burnett show don't waste your money on this collection. While the collection has some funny moments, you have to sit through numerous skits which have not fared well with time. You would be better off looking for the \\"Carol Burnett Show Stoppers\\" which shows only clips then having to sit through this. Sorry, but it wasn't as funny as I remembered and these were suppose to be Carol's favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was hoping for a montage of different \\"funniest\\" clips; instead it was entire episodes.

The skits were the best and the chemistry between Harvey and Tim are priceless. This collector's edition makes a great gift for someone who is not feeling well or needs cheering up. We sure need more shows like this today. The whole family can watch together because it's just a good time for all.Thanks Carol for making such a wonderful show that stands the test of time.

A great family show to enjoy together."},{"rating":"1","title":"The skits are really funny but------","review":"The skits, that are advertised on TV, are really funny. However these Advertised skits are overpowered in the full shows by the long stretches of taking questions from the audience, and long boring musical/dance segments. My family and I put the collection away after the first two shows. I would not recommend the full version shows to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"This was a gift for my parents and they just love it. Hysterical, classic television. They don't make them like this anymore!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish I could find more videos of the \\"Carol Burnett Show\\"","review":"I have to say that I am a fan and grew up watching the \\"Carol Burnett Show\\". The level of talent, the live dancing, singing & hilarious comedic wit captured on this Tape. I only wish I could see more. What a class act. This would make a great gift for anyone who misses the quality programs of the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could've been funnier","review":"Seeing the previews, I thought this would be a riot so I bought it for my parents for Christmas. We started watching it together and the 1st skit was funny but after that we didn't even remotely laugh. We haven't made it through all of the CD's yet because we were bored with what we saw so far. I wish they would've put all of her hysterical skits on the CD's and skipped all of the other \\"not so funny\\" stuff. Wouldn't recommend purchasing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, didn't realize these have the WHOLE shows.","review":"Realized after we got this that we were mostly anticipating the humorous skits. Forgot about the monologues, singing etc. in the shows. But those are fun too. I didn't get to watch much tv as a kid so now I'm learning what I missed, besides the hilarious skits."},{"rating":"1","title":"I watched it once, probably not again","review":"These are Carol's favorites? They are not mine. There is at least the \\"Went with the Wind\\" sketch. But I can think of so many other sketches that were much funnier than the ones on these discs. Does anyone remember the Snow White sketch? She was Snow White after 30 years of marriage to Prince Charming (Harvey Korman) and Lyle Waggoner was the Mirror who kept making rude comments about her? That was much funnier than the skits on here. I'm sorry Carol, but I do not recommend this set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Too much singing and not enough skits.

She is timeless, extremely funny, and a clean show. Tim Conway is one of our all time favorites, especially when he has Harvey Korman in the dentist's chair.

Will not purchase anymore of the collection. Marketing managers and Carol Burnett need to spend many hours reviewing and combining the very best in a set, and with their experience and knowledge of show business I would think it could easily be done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift","review":"I gave this as a gift, and while I haven't watched it yet, the gift receiver was extremely pleased.Good clean entertainment at a good price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great episodes","review":"There are more episodes I would have liked.

Received quickly and in damaged. As described."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barrel of Laughs","review":"This is a fantastic, comprehensive collection of the Carol Burnett Show. It's got all the heavy hitting sketches (As the Stomach Turns, The Oldest Man, etc) and it's so great to see her unique brand of wry, self-deprecating comedy again. There are some great bonus features, a must-have for anyone who grew up with the show (like I did) and missed those rolled-down panty hose! You won't be disappointed, it's hours and hours of hilarity, plus there are wonderful interviews with the likes of Carl Reiner and Betty White. It's great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Closed Captions!","review":"If you're deaf/hard of hearing, or you're thinking of getting this for someone who is, be aware that Time Life chose to ignore up to 40% of the likely demographic for this series and not provide Closed Captions. I'm glad I wrote them and asked before ordering!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"Love going back in time... to a simpler time. Sketches were great but what makes this collection the best is CAROL. She's so funny and so likable without being mean!!! She made me laugh when I was a kid and she's making me laugh now. This collection has so much content and the quality is surprisingly great! I'll treasure this new DVD set and play it for my grandkids!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful Survial Techniques","review":"The book was interesting enough and provided useful facts.

I would recommend it for any young Scout, camping or hiking enthusiast."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good Book If Your Shipwrecked","review":"This is a very good book if your shipwrecked. It teaches you how to cook a snake, make your own compass, tell how to know which fruit to eat, and many other useful things. This book is wonderful and I hope I have it with me if I get shipwrecked! YOU should get it and don't prove me wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Castaway In TheJungle","review":"I thought this book was scary but when I read it it was a question and answer book.Then, when I started to read it it tells you what can you do in different situations it asks you if an old lady wants to sit down in the spot that you are sitting in,what would you do? in this book you have to imagine if you are in the jungle because it says for example,you need water to survive.The setting was in the jungle it was in the present day some parts that talk about jokes I really like.In this book it doesn't have any characters so I don't have any favorite characters.I recommend this book to all my friends especially ages.I recommend this book to all my friends because it is a funny book and a question book. It might be interesting to them. The question part is the part that I liked the most and it might be other people's favorite part too. The question was whether you knew how to cook a snake. I won't try it because the snake might kill me first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scots are Go!","review":"I tracked this down because I'd read and loved Legge's short story \\"Pop Life\\" in the Children of Albion Rovers collection. Here, he really emphasizes the short side of things, as 33 stories are crammed into 152 pages. Ranging from a half page to twelve pages, the stories are full-on Scot-centric. In general, the longer the story was, the more I liked it. If you want to sample a novel of his, try The Shoe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fela's \\"Big Mouth\\" Sidemen","review":"Baritone saxophonist Lekan Animashaun and trumpeter Tunde Williams were the heart and soul of the Afrika 70 horn section in Fela Kuti's legendary Afrobeat band. As long time Fela colleagues, it is only fitting that these high profile players were able to make their own albums as leaders with the Afrika 70 group, reissued here on this import CD. Animashaun's \\"Low Profile\\" and Williams' \\"Mr. Big Mouth\\" have all the trademarks of classic Afrobeat -- pulsating march-like grooves, layered percussion, and great, catchy horn riffs. The only thing missing is Fela's booming baritone vocals. With facsimiles of the original cover art and an essay by esteemed Fela biographer Michael Veal, this is a most necessary purchase for Fela devotees. If you picked up all the Fela MCA reissues as I have (if you haven't, hurry up they are starting to go OOP), and you can't get enough Afrika 70, then this disc is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"This puzzle is junk","review":"I bought this for my 4 year old grandson for Christmas. We opened it up and sat on the floor and began putting it together. He was excited because he is a Lighting McQueen fan. He got about four pieces of it together and got very frustrated. It would not stay together. THE PUZZLE IS JUNK!!!!!!!! The pieces are not flat and do not interlock so that they stay together. He lost interest and left. I finished it enough so that they were laying together to see the picture - which is very cute. But, no way would they ever all fit together. Do not waste your money on this. I also had to retape the corners of the box, as they were all coming apart too. Yea for cheap imports. The USA is so much better off for them????????"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nancy drew The scarlet Slipper Mystery","review":"I remember reading the Nancy Drew book's when I was younger. Now I am 70 yrs old, I wanted to see if my granddaughter would like them as much as I did.? W ell as soon as I get done reading them again, I told her I would let her know. LOL. They are still as good. And you are ever to old to enjoy them."},{"rating":"2","title":"scarlet slipper mystery","review":"i was suprised to see what some people rated this!!!i loved this is a great action packed book.there are tons of exiting parts in this mystery!!this is about nancy trying to find the people responsible for sending the notes to henri and helene fontaine and later on to stop the jewel smuggling and to find mr.koffs brief case and figure out why a women stole the scarlet slippers on helenes desk in the place she works for dancing ballet.this is a really good book despite some of the reveiws i would reccomend that you could buy it or if they have it at the library youcould check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Most Nancy Drews are VERY good. but this one was so boring that I couldn't pick it up. (oppaset of couldn't put it down.) It took me the longest time to finnish it, a week or more, and that's saying somthing because I nomally finish them in 1 or 2 days. The most exsiting thing was when Hannah was tyed to a chair. don't get this one, a diff. one."},{"rating":"2","title":"My All Time FAV!!!!","review":"Sure Im a little old to be reading Nancy Drew books but who cares?Any way this one is my Favorite because Ned and Nancy pretend to be married and almost ask Nancy to marry Him (almost He hints)So thats why its my favorite because of the romance :-)If you want more mystery read Nancy's myst. letter!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only 2 minifigures","review":"This is a good product, but it only comes with two minifigures, not three as advertised in the \\"product features\\" section. My 8 year old daughter needed help with one or two pieces in the assembly, but otherwise no problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our son really enjoyed putting this together","review":"Our son really enjoyed putting these together but prefers the more challenging Legos (ones recommended for children twice his age). I enjoyed helping him (I am his helper of course, allowed to find the next piece needed :). Once he had it together he played with it for a couple of days and was onto something new. But it was worth it to see his face when he finished it. Pretty much the same for all the Legos we've given him. The exception are the Technic line - he plays with them off and on weeks/months after completing them."},{"rating":"1","title":"too fragile to play with","review":"My son received the firetruck, 7239, set for ages 5+ for Christmas. It is fair that he needed help putting it together as he is young. However, we are all disappointed that once put together, it is VERY FRAGILE and falls apart practically when anyone looks at it, let alone touches it. If we try to pick it up, something is sure to fall off. It is cool because it has a lot of features, but what good are they if playing with it is more frustrating than fun??? It is not just because he is small (almost 5 years). Even when adults play with it, it falls apart. For the price and reputation of LEGO products, I find this unacceptable. We have other lego products that do not have this problem, so it seems to me that this is a bad design. The sad thing is that he was most excited about this gift and it has turned out to be a real letdown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Lego Set!","review":"Got this for my 5 and 6 year old boys. The 5 year old put together the trailer that holds the boat on top, and the 6 year old put the truck together. The 5 year old helped with the ladder, which he needed a little help with. The ladder actually works pretty well, which is good because any kids favorite part of a fire truck is the ladder. A good addition to the Lego City line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"There are only 2 figurines not 3 as advertised. I hate this toy. I spend more time putting it back together than my son plays with it. It is in a constant state of falling apart. The ladder of the boom is not properly counter balanced and breaks off every time my son touches the ladder. I bought this toy explicitly for the moving boom and ladder. I actually tried to crazy glue it this morning (only opened this toy yesterday) out of frustration. Now the truck falls apart at a weaker point. Poor construction and not sure why it has such high ratings. Save yourself some time and frustration and buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's NOT worthy.","review":"I didn't satisfied with this toy.

Great possibilities for play and imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Childhood Flashback","review":"I bought the Fire Truck for my girlfriend who managed to tap the back of one a few months ago. (She's fine) Anyway, the truck has undergone some improvements since I was young. It might be a little complicated for someone who is just starting to use Legos (I made my girlfriend put it together), but we managed to put it together just fine. Plus, it comes with a neat raft/trailer attachment. Worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Tony Danza Movie","review":"I recently purchased this Movie \\"Doing Life\\" which I had not seen since it was originaly shown on Television back in 1986 or 87. I always considered Tony Danza a very good actor after watching him on the Hit TV show 'Who's the Boss\\". Even though that was a comedy sitcom, his serious acting ability really comes to the surface in this true to life story of a wrongfully accused man and his persistant attempts at gaining his freedom from the convaluted and twisted American Legal System. Great acting by Danza in a fast paced story that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the movie. Yo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TV movie \\"Doing Life\\" starring Tony Danza","review":"Good acting in this true-story drama directed by Gene Reynolds. The picture quality of my Hearst Entertainment Inc.

I still cant belive how unlike the picture they were, i needed my shoes for an NCP bikini comp and these were not it at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good price, but not great fit","review":"I normally wear a 7.5, but it only showed a 7 or an 8. I ordered a 7 b/c normally 8s are too big on me. I tried them on and they were really tight under the clear strap in the front. So I am sending them back and exchanging them for a 8. I'm hoping they work. They are cheaper here than on other sites, and I am only going to be wearing these once for right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not satisfied","review":"The pic looked nothing like the actual shoe. The plastic part on top of the shoe came so low toward the toes that it dug in and was uncomfortable. Also, I had read other reviews before purchasing, and many folks said to get a size smaller than you normally would wear. This was not a good idea. They were way too tight. They sit in my closet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Odd Shape & Fit","review":"While I've been warned by other bikini competitors that these types of shoes will be tight at first until they stretch, these are not only way tight and uncomfortable...the toe is shaped extremely odd and extends way out in a pointy fashion. The strap across the toes is even more odd and seems like the shoes are rejects??? Not pleased at all. And of course, I'm expected to pay the return shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Like The Picture","review":"I just got my shoes two days ago and I have to return them. They don't look like the picture at all. The shoe is very pointed in the front, the clear strap dosen't cover any of your toes at all because it's so high up on your foot...you have the clear strap that goes around your ankle and then like right under it is the other thick strap. You see how in the picture some of her toes are coverd by the shoe,the shoes I got arn't like that, every single toe is all the way out..even my little pinky toe,it's all out. It's hard to really describe but it seems like they made the shoe wrong or something because the design dosen't make sense. I don't like the shoe and it wouldn't be such an issue if the shoe was the same as the picture but it's a whole different shoe and I hate it. Grrrr SO UGLY"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great looking and very comfortable shoe!","review":"Just got these shoes today and they are extremely comfortable. These shoes fit true to size, I purchased my size which is a 8, so there is no need to buy a size up or down. The platform is not too high and adds an additional look and feel to the shoe. Great buy, can't wait to where these to my next pole dancing class!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My first walk on the wild side!","review":"I saw this movie when it was first released. I loved it! I had never seen anything like it and tried to get my buddies to see it. They felt the same way I had at first.\\"This movie can't be any good, there's nobody famous in it\\". It taught me that there was a whole world of films out there that I hadn't been aware of. It was a great discovery that echoes down to this day. The film is probably about a 3 1/2 but I'll give it four for the life lesson it taught!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pitch-Black","review":"I think \\"Blast of Silence\\" is possibly the single best film I have ever seen at portraying the raw emotions of a criminal, the life he lives, and the justifications for his actions. I know that all may sound kind of heady -- but the great thing about this film is that it is so unpretentious and just portrays the stark, depressing realities of a loner as he takes care of his job over a few days in New York. Classic hard-boiled writing and excellent direction puts this leagues above a lot of other B-films of the era. for my money, much better than Kubrick's \\"The Killing\\" or other crime films from the late 50s and early 60s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blast of Mediocrity","review":"This movie has lots of style -- scenes of New York, jazz music, the narration -- but little substance. While potentially interesting, this movie is devoid of any real drama or suspense. Even the actual murders are rather unexciting. The film thus relies on being a character study. Unfortunately, the lead actor is too bland to pull this off successfully. Baron simply doesn't posssess enough emotional range or grit for the role. The most interesting character is Ralph, the gun dealer, but he's in the movie for only about 10 minutes. His chase scene actually provides a few moments of suspense.Overall, most noir fans would be better off renting as there is little repeat value. For a similarly-themed, but far superior film, see Melville's Le Samourai (French) starring Alain Delon, also by Criterion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kenton at Arcadia Theatre review","review":"On Oct. 20, 1974 the Kenton band did not have one of its best nights. The band's performance does not sound especially inspired, but then who can really tell? The sound quality is so poor. The whole thing sounds like it was recorded with 2 microphones - one set between the bass and piano and another for the soloists (who can generally be heard quite well). But the mix is dominated by bass and piano. At times the saxophone section is almost lost completely and you never hear the brass section come in with its legendary power. It's a frustrating listening experience. Not recommended. Spend your money instead on the many superb Kenton recordings available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now this is music!!!","review":"I first heard of Janice Derosa on my local NPR radio station.

And I think its just as good today as it was back then, yeah the music is a bit on the garage band side but hey- thats whats great about it since the songs are all live. Reminds me of the times I have seen them play and I will always keep that close to me. This album has alot of special memories for me and my friends.

Boy was a wrong. Matt realizes that he still loves Kate and that he will not lose her again. He even convinces everyone in town that they are married when they are not. It is crazy and funny. Although, I feel strongly that there is really two stories--one, is who is the mother of this child and two, the story of Matt and Kate. If you expect to find out the in depth story about the child you will be disappointed. The only thing tht I can say is that it tells you about the same information that the first book did.

Donald Byrd is surrounded by a group of musicians who know how to create a mood and let him come to prominence within it. The '70s has never sounded so mature and complex as it does on this album. Track 2 in particular is beautiful. This song is a *song* but it evokes such rhythms and tones as complicated as the more free-form tracks do. Yes, track 2 moves me and I want to hear it again and again--it speaks to me of loss, of the coming of the end of the hopefulness and audacity that was funk and the '70s multicultural, pluralistic experience, long since pushed aside for either emptiness or anger. I dare you not to cry after you listen to it--whether from tears of nostalgia or resentment or joy or loss.

A film about the change over of Hong Kong from British to PRC rule. The casting was there too. Jeremy Irons, Gong-Li, and Maggie Cheung. This was a film I looked forward to, understood very well, but was ultimately disappointed.The symbolism is great. The dying Jeromy Irons represents British rule. The scarred but always optimistic Maggie Cheung is the people of Hong Kong. Again, this was a clever idea and props to that, but the film often just wanders and drags.Also disappointing was Gong-li. Gong-li is one of the most gifted actresses in China. She is fantastic. However, her poor English really hurts her performance. She has given many powerful performances in her native language and it was painful to watch her struggle in a English film. Gong-li is great and should not rush to make anymore American films.So again the films concept is great but the finished product is a noble failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real shame to put Gong Li in this predicament","review":"'Chinese Box' attracted me through a fairly interesting looking trailer. I couldn't have been more disappointed with the movie itself. Jeremy Irons, Ruben Blades, Gong Li - these three characters are somehow close, but they interact as if they're from three separate universes. They're certainly not helped by the script (what the heck is this about anyway?), Wayne Wang's sloppy direction or his choppy, disjointed storyline.Gong Li is worthy of particular note. Perhaps China's greatest working actress, I've gotta think that Wang was so infatuated with the idea of having her in his film that he manufactured a way around her (at the time) very limited English. Her very few lines have the feel of being pieced together via phonetics. As a result, the supposed intense relationship between she and Irons' character is real stretch to envision. It's a real shame that many viewers will get their intro to Gong Li in this fashion. She deserves far better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Fan of Both Irons and Ruben Blades, But \\"CB\\" Was the PITS!","review":"I watched about the first excruciating half hour and then gave up.

Terror Firmer has an over-the-top performance by Will Keenan and a Mel Brooks-inspired performance by Lloyd Kaufman. If you're a fan of Troma you'll love Terror Firmer, and if you're not a fan, this film may change your mind about those loveable misfits. You can only wonder if this is how the folks at Troma make all of their films. Wow, to spend one day on their set..."},{"rating":"1","title":"My eyes!

I like the fact that that it only has 1 PCI-E 1X slot. At this point PCI slots are much more affordable for just about everything you'll need for expansion. I've tried these boards with both nVidia and ATI cards: it works with them all. Unless you are a high end gamer and need dual card cross fire you can get a very good single card and play just about everything. Runs Vista very well. 1 Major issue is RAM.

The storyline and presentation is pure Ennis style mayhem: loads of bloody violence combined with an outrageous sense of dark humor; a combination which made his works on The Punisher, Fury, and Preacher so sucessful. The art by Preacher cover artist Glenn Fabry is more than solid artwork, though Darick Robertson (who did the art for Ennis' Fury and the recent Punisher: Born) would have been a better choice to illustrate all the bloody carnage. While Thor: Vikings is a great read to be sure, it doesn't strike the same gold as Ennis' previous works, but it doesn't try to either. All in all, fans of the great Garth Ennis should check this out."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best from Garth Ennis","review":"First, what's good:The artwork is amazing! Glen Fabry does a great job, very detailed stuff.What's bad:The story is like a B-movie script. Something the robots on Mystery Science Theater 3000 would have a field day with. It's just plain hokey. About the violence/gore, I don't mind it if there's a good story that requires it. We don't have that here. Too many severed heads! And the evil zombie Vikings look like something out of Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\" video. Kinda goofy.I bought this book after reading Garth Ennis' \\"Preacher\\" series (a fantastic set of books that you should buy), so I had my hopes up really high.Check out Ennis' \\"Fury\\" book, about an aging, cranky Nick Fury. I enjoyed that book much more than Ennis' attempt at a Thor book. His newer MAX run on \\"Punisher\\" has been good too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great instructor, long routines","review":"I like the instructor, very \\"real\\" personality - not too bubbly or fake cheerful. The routines are very long and original, and it took me a few tries to keep up.

Sammy is salt and Lawford is Pepper- oh that's funny! They're not cool- they're just 2 old geezers trying to live it up in swinging London. The dialogue is stupid - the plot even worse. Remember this movie was released during the time of The Beatles- The Stones- The Doors--and here we get to see Peter and Sammy wearing love beads and Nehru jackets--because they were so with it and such hip guys.

This makes it completely useless for swimming, and probably any water activity that requires arm movement.I just stick the water proof case between the straps of my swimsuit in the back.

The book is split up into sections, subsections, and types of the shown subsection. Rather than looking all over the place, you can find something simply by looking for what section it is in then looking in that section to find the subsection and so on. The best part is that the book does not put in a bunch of confusing mathematics terms but instead gives clear and fast examples. It also shows more than one method of solving the type of problem so you can find what method is best for you. This book is worth every penny and is vital to success in mathematics. Take it from me, I struggled in math until I found this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent condition","review":"This book is in great condition. It couldn't be better.

Wexford is recuperating from a serious illness, and the book gets good mileage out of this, but right from the start Rendell's writing is uncharacteristically flowery and awkward. More seriously, the plotting is feeble: more than halfway through the book, the rug gets pulled out from under Wexford's investigations (which is fine) but Rendell then takes the story in a direction which feels like an afterthought and the ending has little impact."},{"rating":"1","title":"murder being once done","review":"Just a comment on the Kindle version - it was full of small typos like I'll for ill.

Maybe it's a scottish thing, although Ellen Hart has done the same... of course she may be part British like her heroine in the Cordelia/Jane series.

In other words, if you plan on wrapping the mattress with this bag and moving it, you are probably going to tear the bag or have the end come undone as there isn't much left at the end to wrap around and tape.

I had no real problem sliding it on by myself (I'm a fairly skinny girl) and simply used packing tape to seal the open end.

I have been purchasing Caldrea products because they were recommended by a friend because my husband has severe allergies and certain scents bother him. Because I am a stay at home mom, Caldrea became much toexpensive, thus the purchase of this book.Now, for the book review. I thought the information given was helpful and easy to follow.

And like most teenagers, he's willing to eavesdrop or observe the dramas that occur around him, in order to find his own answers.The members of his family and the townspeople are seem real. The writing reflects the Southern accents of that region fromthat time.

It was long and very slow moving. Also, the language used in it was terrible. I had to say the words and phrases aloud so that might be able to understand them.

It really is a miracle I finished the book at all. Plot? Nonexistent. In fact, I can barely remember what the book is about.

I thought that it was above average and could be read by anybody above thirteen. It portrayed the life styles of the people in the turn of the century very well. I liked the way it explained the situations that the different characters were put in, and how they all handled things very differently. The society in which they lived was also very realistic for the early 1900's. My favorite character was Miss Love. She handled her difficult situation of being in love with an older man and being accepted by his entire family very well. She never tried to seek revenge on anyone who thought what she was doing was wrong. She is a very strong woman with a good heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"I loved this book!

My teacher has told us a little bit about what our test was on and that we need to know the symbolism of the tree (how do teachers know these things).

Will Tweedy tells the story, but his Grandpa Blakeslee is the real main mover here. The plot covers a year in a small Southern town at the turn of the century (the 1900's) when society was proscribed and its rules set in granite. You did not do certain things--like marry a women young enough to be your granddaughter, elope with her, and worse yet, have a child by her. There is a lot of realism to these characters--they're easily human, with all the flaws and strong points that entails. The author spent years writing and re-writing her novel, even while she was ill with cancer and heart failure, and in the end produced something that was an instant bestseller. This is the only complete novel she wrote; and I think she did an outstanding job.--C. L. Rossman"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to read","review":"This is a hard book for a teenage child. I have a college reading level and still found it difficult to understand. I had to read it for school and it took me about 4 and a half months to figure out the meaning.Once you learn the meaning, its a farily simple book, but learning the meaning can be tough. It takes time and i have asked many people what the meaning was, and have recived many driffent answers. So the meaning can be competly driffrent for you than it was for me, but over all, a VERY hard book to under stand.It does have some good meanings, and morals though I must crete the author with that"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor choice for summer reading","review":"Required reading for my child entering high school, \\"Cold Sassy Tree\\" lacks coherent structure, elegant style, meaningful content, and deep characterization. The text plods and plods...yet it is as if the author skimmed a lexicon of Southern cliches, regional names, rejected soap opera story lines, and flea market items...and trusted every idea that came to her rather than culling weaker ones. Most characters are named once never to be seen or heard from again; others seem downright \\"ornery\\" or contradictory. The narrator's point of view (supposedly age 22 and looking back to his teen years) is unconvincing and uninteresting. Names like: \\"Miss Love Simpson\\" and \\"Dr. Slaughter\\" seem silly. The writer, a journalist who deserves credit for writing while ill, underestimated the leap to fiction. If you must read it for school, keep another book (by Harper Lee, Mark Twain, or William Golding--for example) nearby so that you don't internalize too many bad habits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time","review":"I really was looking forward to reading this book. I'd heard great things about it. I was enjoying all the short little stories within the big picture until about page 75 or so. It took so long to get to the point of the story. Lots of semi-intersting stories throught the book, but the main theme of the book was very ugly and depressing. I didn't appreciate the comment about explaining \\"it\\" to his friend with a five year old girl who \\"wouldn't know the difference anyway\\" and it just broke my heart to read about the Grandpas sin towards his wife and the troubles with Uncle Camp.

I had written a review of Terry Kay's book TO DANCE WITH THE WHITE DOG, which I loved. And so I sat down to read Cold Sassy Tree. The author was not known to me so I didn't know what to expect.The tale is set in the south in the early 1900's. A bit of history flashback, charming method of telling the tale, idiosyncratic characters that were full of vinegar and surprises. I won't reveal much more than that, because it will just spoil it. I would certainly read the author again. If you love listening to a master storyteller (those southern people have the knack, must be the water) this read is just like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humorous and Touching","review":"This is a great depiction of the South by Olive Ann Burns. It is written in the tradition of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, with a young Will Tweedy narrating his adventures and family life. I love the humor within this book, as Will Tweedy is always looking towards his grandpa for advice and how to live. He experiences many of the hardships, both sorrow and loss of love ones, in finding himself.This book does have elements of racism and deals with the death of family members. I think that Burns was making a statement about how people felt about levels of society in the South and how this is an unnecessary and unjustified way to think. Much of this novel is about finding oneself in youth, and understanding how and why family must stick together. It has a good balance of both humor and sadness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!

The irony of people judging others when their life is not together is quite amusing. It is weird to see how people are so involved in other peoples lives that they almost forget to live their own lives, and when they begin to live their own life it's too late and they become the center of attention.

Olive Ann Burns certainly had the ability to draw readers into the story. It is impossible not to engage with the characters and feel like you've lived in Cold Sassy yourself. Elements of surprise and suspense are woven throughout the book, keeping you reading. You definitely know you are \\"down south\\" in the early part of the 20th century because of the accents in the dialogue, the amusing anti-Yankee attitude and the sprinkling of current events, like fashion and the new fangled automobile.

Cold Sassy town will always be in my memory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author had no experience.","review":"To quote Emily Dickinson,A word is dead/ When it is said/ Some say.This feeling remained throughout the entirety of Cold Sassy Tree; Olive Ann Burns doesn't know enough (and doesn't possess the skill as an author) to recreate life in the 1906 Deep South. The book was written by a white woman retelling (and embellishing) the tales told to her by her white grandfather. There is no apparent racial tension, which I would not have expected from the South at this time. The book's underlying theme of the grandfather's remarriage is accompanied by a string of unrelated stories about car trips, camping, etc.; the smaller tales seemed unnecessary and had no effect on the main plot (what little there was). I suppose that Burns kept these tales to present a feeling of the times. If they were accurate, Burns did succeed in impressing an image of life in 1906: dull and utterly bereft of relevance to the real world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time!!","review":"This book, Cold Sassy Tree, by Olive Ann Burns, does not live up to its reviews. The Washington Post said \\"Rich with emotion, humor and tenderness...a novel about an old man growing young, a young man growing up and the modern age coming to a small southern town.\\" To me, this book is not only un-humorous, but, as it was my 9th grade summer reading, I had to force myself to run my eyes over the page and comprehend the plot. Oh let me correct myself: there was no plot. If you wish to read a good book, worth your while, do NOT read this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good read...","review":"Read it just to check out what our 11th grader was reading in high school English.

The pressure of the keys is about right for me.The main complaint I have is that it is not really a full sized keyboard. Not as small as a laptop keyboard, but definitely smaller than the regular keyboard I was using before. My hands feel a bit cramped using it.Note that the box does not list a PS2 adapter in the contents, and indeed there is none. The description that calls this USB/PS2 is wrong.

But if you like nu, you should check this album out. The vocal delivery is great, as are the rhythms and grooves of the songs themselves. The guitar lines are rather simple, rhythmic structures. Not boring, but not technically complex. Some interesting and weird sound effects are thrown in here and there.

Navigating the treachery of two warring clans, he gradually settles into life, marrying and having a son. He keeps a secret love for the island's schoolteacher, but he cannot be prepared for the wickedness of his great-uncle and self-proclaimed \\"king\\" of Rockbound. Superbly narrated by Shakespearean actor Richard Donat, who skillfully adds color and flavor to the Nova Scotia dialect of the Rockbounders, Rockbound is an enduring parable of treacherous times, where the sudden turning of a man's heart can be as deadly as the shift of wind near a rocky coastline.

Have lysine daily, and keep your lips moisturized. I use 'Lypsyl' before I go to bed and when my lips are dry. In the winter months, it's easy for a house to reach 20-25% humidity.

That's cool. But this is not a revealing character study or a gripping drama and it is certainly not a comedy. While watching this, I kept wondering if the writer has actually had any real-life experience or has just siphoned off the existential, self-destructive angst of characters in movies of the 70s. This is not FIVE EASY PIECES no matter how much writer/director Brian Koppelman apparently worships such iconic fare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comedy???","review":"The DVD box noted it as a 'comedy'.I fail to see anything humorous about Douglas' character.I would classify him as desperately seeking a life, as in REAL life,instead of a shallow existence of booze and one night stands.I must admit I am a bit disappointed as I recall seeing the trailer sometime agoand thought I might like seeing it. Thank goodness I waited to see it on DVD and did not spend $$$$$ at a theater.As the French say 'C'est la vie'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tragic","review":"This isn't exactly a comedy, though there is plenty of humor. Without giving too much away, Michael Douglas plays Ben, a successful businessman who comes to a crossroads, and rather than face the challenge, he proceeds to make every bad decision possible. Everything good in his life has been cast aside along a path of self-loathing that's hard to fathom.This presents lots of opportunities for the cast to flesh out their characters, while the audience wonders just how far can they be pushed.Ben has several opportunities to redeem himself, though we never really know for sure if he does.A tragic story to mull over.Life really is what you make of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solitary success","review":"Michael Douglas is a once successful businessman who's life is falling apart. He can't pay his rent, and his pursuit of younger women has strained his relationship with his daughter.

Douglas stars as a former big city car salesman who was at the top of his game....until unscrupulous business practices put an end to it all. What remains is his seemingly insatiable appetite for very young women--no matter the cost. And the cost is high, as his appetite seems to have a negative effect on practically every aspect of his personal life and relationships; from that with his daughter and grandson, to his own girlfriend. And while a health scare may have exacerbated an already healthy appetite for the opposite sex, despite his bad behavior the protagonist is surrounded by a cast of people who have only his best interest in mind. A rather interesting tale, but not a movie I would rave over.-DYB"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great actor, bad story","review":"As a huge fan of Michael Douglas' work, I had high expectations of this film.

Unfortunately, it isn't even worth renting.The acting was... OK, but certainly not what most of these actors are capable of. For that, I blame the directing. The story line was banal, predictable and rather stupid. For that, I obviously blame the screen play writers.So, poor story line, sub-par directing and OK acting make for a poor movie in my book. Far better choices abound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Douglas is Perfect for this Movie!","review":"In Solitary Man, Michael Douglas plays the lead as Ben Kalmen, a 60 year old man is trying to ignore the fact that he is no longer a young man. He past has been spent jumping from one young romantic interest to another. His professional life has been on a backward slide, and it seems everywhere he turns, everyone is younger than him. He is also ignoring a health issue and dealing with a troubled relationship with his daughter. Ben (Douglas) seeks solace, by returning to the college town of his youth, and reconnecting with an old friend Jimmy (Danny DeVito) to sort out his problems and his life.I found this movie, bittersweet, as Douglas ponders the question we all ask at a certain point in our life: \\"where did all those years go\\"? I liked this movie a lot and think it will especially resonate with the baby boomer generation.RECOMMENDED"},{"rating":"2","title":"androidshopper","review":"Good movie...

This should have been titled Empty man instead of solitary man. Douglas is a sick jerk in this movie. There was no sympathy for the man to be invoked and then what a cop out. At the end of the movie, the story appeals to the audience to feel sorry for Douglas' behavior and to justify it. I have also always liked susan sarandon, but i couldn't believe that she endorsed sympathy for his behavior by being willing to take him back in the end. Douglas needs to leave his shirt on, get on medicare and retire....please no more....I can't take it...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterful performance","review":"\\"Solitary Man\\" showcases a masterful performance by Michael Douglas who is supported by an all-star cast including Susan Sarandon, Danny DeVito and Mary Louise Parker. Relying on a superb script and refreshingly free of distracting special effects, the movie presents an intimate portrait of life, love and forgiveness.The irony of Mr. Douglas portraying a man who is struggling with the fact of his own mortality gives the film a pathos that could not have been fully appreciated at the time of its production. Mr. Douglas infuses the hedonistic lead character with a kind of swagger and confidence that only he can; drawing our keen interest, if not our sympathies, as a series of poor personal decisions wreaks havoc around him and those he holds most dear.Ending on a note of suspense, I highly recommend \\"Solitary Man\\" to everyone who enjoys movies that seek to charm and captivate, not overwhelm, their audiences."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just okay.

However, the storyline has been done too many times before. The acting was pretty decent and the leads did a good job of making the parts believable. But, there was very little that made the movie unique.As Ben Kalmen (Michael Douglas), the character goes through some difficult times in a mid-life (or later) crisis. He keeps his humor, but his personal and professional life are a mess. Nothing really kept me interested in the movie and at the point that Kalmen cheats on his girlfriend with her daughter is when I really had to turn the movie off.Douglas played the part well, but I would have loved to see more substance or something to really set the movie apart from typical Hollywood productions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Micheal Douglas, no need to say more!","review":"Legendary performers, great comedy about mid life crisis, you cannot go wrong with this movie.Micheal Douglas lives up to his acting reputation, Susan Sarandon is wonderful, Danny Devito is hilarious and Mary Louise Parker is great.

The band is a bit too tight and folds down. The cups are a bit too large, even on the highest hook. The front hooks that you use to drop the cup area are like standard bra strap hooks which makes them easy to unhook with one hand, but impossible to hook back with one hand.

Rather, I'll say that this first novel caused me to rush to my computer to buy all 4 that have been released and to pre-order the one releasing in January! Parshall does a fine job with characterization, creating 3-D likeable characters. Attorney Will Chambers struggles with internal and external forces to get his life and career back on track. We end up with a close study of the man plus an intriguing plot and some great courtroom dialog. I have now read all 4 of the Will Chambers books and can't wait for the next one. They have each been unique and exciting to read...enough action to keep you up late because you just have to find out what will happen. This author is a treasure. The added prize is the deep spirituality of his Christian message. There is something (and most likely everything) to delight all readers in this book and in all his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great affirmation of the importance of fatherhood.","review":"Ben Stein who is a lawyer, actor, economist and most of all father writes this warm affirmation of fatherhood that all fathers and future fathers should read. There is too much negativism in our society about the burdens of parenthood and the joys of the career. Stein proves that it's just the opposite. Good parenting and being a great father is the most rewarding job there is. Who ever said in old age that they wished they'd spent more time at the office? The costs to our society and world of the absent father, which virtually every boy grows up with (without really) are unreal. Stein shows how fatherhood changed himself and changed his life. Kudos for his courage and bravery in making this transformation. Want to be a \\"real man\\"? Really \\"macho\\"? Don't lift weights, get into fights, build buildings, raid companies... Be a good father to your own children who need and admire you...!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Check out Stein's later parental \\"success\\"","review":"If you are interested in this book, I hope you check online for Stein's later parental \\"success\\" stories. When his son is in his teens, he plays violent videogames obsessively and Stein at first does not see this as dangerous--not until his son stops going to school, anyway. Just recently in January 2009, commenting on the economic crisis, he notes that his son, a recently-married student in his early twenties, relies on Stein for his sole support and has no sense that he can't eat in any restaurant he wants. So I think you should question Stein's actual parental experience before taking his advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book should come with a warning.","review":"I bought this book hoping for a heart-warming tale of a man in his 40's adopting a child. But what I got was Ben Stein talking about how shallow he once was (he was right about that), and spouting his arch conservative views. While it's true that he does say what a great kid his boy Tommy is, neither his perspectives on parenting techniques (buy them whatever they want, whenever they want), nor his political diatribes (abortions are 'chopping up babies') were welcome. Unless you're intolerant, spiteful (Stein refers to one woman by name who was on the other side of him in a law suit as a 'witch'), and suffering from low self esteem (get a kid, they automatically think you're great if you're a dad!), don't get this book. And Amazon, please remove this book from the 'adoption' section, it's misleading."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a \\"Box Set\\" !!!","review":"\\"Box Sets\\" are multiple CD collections of a career retrospective that include the hits, the rare songs, unique songs that were included in movies or tribute CD's, and unreleased songs that were recorded for specific CD's or vinyl albums that at the time were not deemed worthy of inclusion in said albums.This is a marketing ploy that allot of record companies are using these days by packaging 3 popular albums together with packaging that looks like a real \\"box set\\" and hoping that the consumer like a grandma or someone who does not know any better would buy it as a gift or the like. CBS/Columbia use this allot.It is a rip off ploy. I liken it to a record company releasing a CD, then 3 months down the road releasing the same CD with a few more additional songs on it. Carly Simon did it. So did Heart and Mariah Carry. What a rip off!!! Especially since the songs cannot be found anywhere else!!!!Marketers.

Here's what you get in this box set: Her Cher album, followed by Heart Of Stone and Love Hurts. They all range from almost 16-19 year ago, so I can't help thinking this was just another one of Geffen's tricks or bids to try and gain more money. From someone who already has all 3 of these albums, I can tell you now, they are fantastic songs! Out of all 33 tracks included (10 on Cher, 12 on Heart Of Stone, and 11 on Love Hurts), there are absolutely no fillers what so ever. The David Geffen company, however, are being really greedy and so unfair on Cher lately. This survivor diva - one hell of a one, too, deserves to be treated alot better. If We All Sleep Alone was not in this collection (it's on the Cher album) - my favourite Cher single of all-time - I would've given this 1 star. Because it is, I boost my rating up to 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"calming, meditative","review":"I adore this video! I ordered this when I was 16 weeks pregnant. I had been following Brian Kest's POWER YOGA video before that, but found that I felt nervous with a lot of the poses. I had read another review that said this video is not physically challenging- and I agree. There are some squats and arm exercises that can be tough- but you aren't going to work up a sweat! But Gurmukh talks about how these postures prepare us for labor... both physically and spiritually.There are a lot of stretches, dancing, rocking, chanting and meditation and I really believe that this video is helping me and my baby prepare for the impending birth.I would recommend this to any pregnant woman or any woman trying to conceive. Actually, I have a feeling I may follow this video even after I deliver because it is so calming~!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for back","review":"I own some of top selling prenatal DVDs and this one is the one I always do over and over again.Why?

This DVD is definitely not my style.1. It is too long at 68 minutes, and there isn't a short version if you're pressed for time2. I found Gurmukh to be really annoying and weird (she's really into the spiritual aspect of yoga)3. I thought it was very boring - there's a lot of meditation and not a lot of strengthening. I really hated the \\"free dance\\" section where she tells you to just dance to the music. It just felt strange to me.4. Gumurkh doesn't do a good job of explaining the moves and transitionsI thought this yoga DVD was really weird, boring and not a very good workout. It is very new-age and meditation focused. Gurmukh Kaur Khalsa seems like she's on another planet.It is hard enough to find an hour during the day to exercise- sitting around and chanting \\"OM\\" is not how I want to spend that rare free hour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"I am 6months pregnant and have done a little yoga in my time and this DVD is terrible! The poses hurt, they did not have good form and the instructor rambled the whole time. I turned it off half way through and left the workout feeling annoyed and sore(not in a good way)."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a good book, but...","review":"I first picked up this book not knowing what it was about. As I was reading it, and I figured out the plotline, my immediate response was to say 'this is so cliche!' because I've read maybe seven books, chosen at random, about ana/mia in the past few months. However, this is one of the truest versions. The main character is very real and could be any one of the girls at my school.Even though I was hooked by the story, the editting disappointed me. There are misspellings throughout the book and a lot of words are dashed that wouldn't normally be, such as 'some-one' or 'yes-terday.' Also, many places where someone is asking a question in the dialogue, there is no question mark. There may be a period instead, or no punctuation at all. There was even a spot where the main character was referred to by the wrong name.If this kind of thing really bugs you, I would not recommend the book. If you are looking for a good, realistic story, however, this would be a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh editor, Where art thou?","review":"I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. I was so aggravated by all the typos and poor grammar that I couldn't get rid of it fast enough. One thing you can count on with this book is every other page or so has an error or two.

Ubisoft says that Intel updated their drivers and the chip will no longer allow the game to play."},{"rating":"1","title":"very slow action","review":"This is not a great purchase for an MMA fan. These fights feature at best 2nd rate fighters and the action is extremely slow. These fights are not like the ones currently held in sanctioned MMA. The referees cannot restart the action when it becomes slow and therefore you have a lot of wasted time with fighters just laying and praying. Also there are no rounds or time limits. This leaves the fighters with no sence of urgency to rush the fight or to create action. In fact one of the fights spends at least ten minutes with the fighters pressed against the cage jockeying for position with little progress either way.A fan of current MMA will be bored with the lack of action in these videos and someone looking to see the more primitive roots of MMA would be better suited purchasing the early UFC contests or the early events in pride. Those promotions feature a much higher caliber of fighters and also a little more action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better books are available.","review":"You do not show date of publication, but if this is the same one I bought years ago, it is very sketchy.

Damn good movie. But this seriously is not for those with weak stomach.It's probably as realistic as the mpaa would allow a movie to be without branding it with the dreaded nc-17 rating.

True, it was brutal and gave a side of prison life that you would not wish on your worst enemy. What I enjoyed about it was the cast and the unique storyline, something that is usually not found in this type of film. I originally saw a screening of the film at the American Black Film Festival in Miami a few years ago and was equally as captivated with it when I saw it again on DVD. I would suggest this film for those who want a peek into the hard reality that so many live every day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please dont let your children watch this","review":"i still cant get the images out of my head, i had nightmares after seeing this movie, i've seen some disgusting things in my life, but this!!!! was HORRIBLE. men, Stay AWAY FROM JAIL!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gangster","review":"This movie shows how you can be so inocent and still end up in hell.

Its really sad to know that De'aundre Bonds (the man who gets raped) is actually in prison for 11 years which I found extra-ly disturbing. but anyway, this film is amazing, i'm so into prison films now but its really disturbing to think that this actually exists in prisons...but oh well, its a lesson, if u ever go prison, this is the kinda ish u'll be facing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Average in every way","review":"This film comes up short in casting, believability, editing (it's too long) and resolution. It's a story that's been done repeatedly, and follows every possible stereotype. Even Richard T. Jones can't carry this movie.Black man and friends (one \\"good,\\" one \\"bad\\") wrongfully accused of murder and sent to a maximum security prison where... every possible prison storyline happens.

I did realize before purchasing that it's a \\"jail\\" movie so I expected to see some disturbing scenes but this takes the cake!! I was so disturbed by this movie it just gave me a weird feeling for days after seeing it.I do think that child and teenage boys need to see this movie as something like a \\"scared straight\\" tactic so they'll know what jail is REALLY LIKE and maybe they'll try to stay out of there!Personally I can't stand this movie but some of you may not have a problem watching it if you don't mind the \\"hard core\\" rape scenes!

It's bright, sparkly, with the parts surgically detached, sounding anywhere from alternative (think: opening riff) to cardboard cut-out neoclassical. There is no sense of despair or dread. The vocals don't add to the atmosphere and seem rehearsed. I didn't delve into the lyrics because the music didn't prove engaging, but they're probably the high point here. One song reuses the line \\"I cannot be your God.\\" (At least the \\"I am the universe\\" goth pretension isn't present.) In a single word, this release is lackluster. Even at an EP price, your money is better spent elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOTALLY AWESOME!","review":"Lacuna Coil (Italy) is probably one of the best CD's I've bought in the past few years!

You'll find yourself listening to this CD over & over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Gathering's very little sister","review":"I hereby suggest to everyone who wants to buy an album with metal guitars, haunting melodies and female vocals: buy The Gathering. Lacuna Coil are merely a shadow of the the five Dutchmen, their songs are not nearly as original, the melodies not as catching as those of the Gathering. The vocals, I must admit, are good (this goes just for the female vocals), but cannot compete with the chilling voice of The Gathering's Anneke. This CD, I believe, is just suitable for those, who already own every single record of Anathema, Moonspell, Paradise Lost and The Gathering and need to have more Gothic Metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN ON THE RUN","review":"This connect four set can be played anywhere!

This book focuses a lot on Ella, who by this time is a fussy teenager and does not really interact with her younger siblings unless it is to complain about them embarassing her in front of her boyfriend Jules. The family dynamic was what made the other books in the series so delightful, but in this book all we see is Ella struggling to be free of them as she tries to find her independence. However, Ella is not charismatic enough to have the bulk of an entire book devoted to her. Her siblings, who rarely appear in this book, are the saving graces to the slow and weak plot. Here they are the same witty trouble-makers that they'd been in the previous books, but they do not appear enough to make this book as good as the others. If you like the other books in the series, this one is a big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low carbs and low taste...","review":"I'm a cheese lover, plain and simple.

As a Wisconsin native, all I can say is YUMMY! If you don't know what CHEESE CURDS, you might not want this to be your first experience. Just sayin'.But, four-stars, rather than 5 due to saltiness -- even the lower salt is a bit too salty.---------------UPDATE (Aug 2010): I just ordered again, my third or fourth time placing an order with Amazon. This time the Popped Cheese was STALE, soft, and old although expiration is for May-2011. Clearly, this food product is not being stored properly and/or the manufacturing has changed.

I have loved Arch Enemy since I first heard them, but it was on Anthems of Rebellion, so I'm a bit of a new fan. I had been wanting to find the older Arch Enemy albums with Johan Liiva on vocals because I like the band so much and it seems the earlier material is always the best for any band. After hearing Wages of Sin, Anthems of Rebellion, and Doomsday Machine, I would say that this is easily my least favorite Arch Enemy. I do like it a lot, though, but Angela Gossow just flat out KILLS Johan Liiva, in my humble opinion. Also, I like the songwriting and production better on the later ones.As far as this album goes, I do think it is a great listen, and my favorites on here were Sinister Mephisto, Bridge of Destiny, Black Earth, and Beast of Man. So, to sum it up, it is great and worth the money, but if you haven't listened to Arch Enemy, I think you should get any of the Angela Gossow albums first."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Of the Best of Arch Enemy","review":"This album, a great one i must say. Features one of their previous drummers who is known for his bell work on the cymbals. Listen to Sinister Mephisto to get what i mean. A good album for any melodic death metal fan. If you like In Flames, Opeth, Soilwork, or any other swedish death metal outfit, check Arch enemy out.

However, to be fair, I think the actors went out of their way in this film, which is the only reason why I didn't stop the movie halfway through. I kept thinking it was going to get better but it only got progressively worse.The big disappointment for me was the fact that they never showed what this crying woman looked like.

It's because it has absolutely everything in it, even the stuff you're unlikely to do yourself. And hey, you never know when you may have to fix that thing that you never thought you would need to fix.Even if there isn't anything that currently needs fixing in your house (hah, unlikely), it's great to browse through to get ideas for things to improve upon, or to just look at some pictures and learn how things are done.

The author did a lot of research on this book, and it's true that the casual fan will find he is being told more than he wants to know about Cy Young. Young says the secret to his longevity as a pitcher lies in taking care of his body and not throwing more pitches than necessary to get a batter out. Hence, he never set any strikeout records.

It is so unfinished, so \\"clever-highschool-band-like\\". Bought it because of the dark sound, after listening to some pieces on Amazon. On the other side, the guitars sound good, and the sound of the vocal is ok, so I listen to it smiling, but this comes from the thought that Katatonia like many great bands have had a start that might not be too convincing.(It is reaching for a three star rate..) You hear the base they are building for the years to come. For the hard-core fans, go get it, to get the total picture of this great band. You others, stay away. The catalogue contains much better stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the boundaries of melancholy","review":"Katatonia has built a magnificient atmosphere of sadness, depression and melancholy in the Discouraged ones. The guitar riffs and the vocals support this feeling very well. I didn't take the cassette out of my Walkman since I've put it in for the first time. I like this mood in music. It is very close to doom metal. I especially like Last Resort and the song in which at the end it repeats, \\"In my eyes you're a lie...\\" and a perfect melody comes in. If you like to be depressed or you are in a situation like that I strongly advise you to listen to this album so that you can think to yourself, there are people who are much disappointed than I am."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good melancholy metal","review":"The Discouraged Ones is a good, but not great album. Of course, that's just my opinion and there are others out there that love this album. There are things about this album that I really like as well - songs like \\"I Break\\" and \\"Deadhouse\\" are catchy well-written songs that must surely evoke feelings of melancholy in all that hear them - and I mean \\"melancholy\\" in a good way. Unfortunately, the album drags for me at some points where Katatonia begin to sound like a less dynamic version of the Cure. I am a big fan of the atmospheric metal produced by bands like Type O Negative, Moonspell and Paradise Lost, but I don't feel that based on The Discouraged Ones, Katatonia is poised yet to join that pantheon of doom metal greats."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful sadness...","review":"it is incredible this band is the same band that start in 1992 with the black metal ep \\"Jhva Elohim Meth.. the Revival\\". yes, those of you who think that katatonia started as a doom metal band are wrong. just look at the photographs in that ep, they used corpse paint, and jonas renkse has a nickname: lord seth...but nevertheless, to the point: Discouraged ones is the best cd of the entire katatonia catalogue!!!is not only the change of renkse's voice... is the atmosphere and introspection that is stuck with this songs, that made them memorable...i can't say anything that is not allready been wrote in this reviews, except the fact that this cd has a gem that pass allmost unnotice by the mayority: the song \\"instrumental\\"that is a beautiful sad song that has the class and genius to transmit emotions without words...I love everyone of the songs in this cd, but that one is really especial to me...this cd is absolutely mandatory for any music collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Excitment and adventure","review":"Sedona Rain let's me feel like I am going on the adventures with Alex and Samantha.Each Chapter contains love excitment and adventure.

Of course, switching immediately to the other handset doesn't return you to the call-in-progress; when a handset dies, it disconnects the call.We replaced the OEM battery for $15 in one of the handsets a few months ago, and it improved battery life marginally.

You cannot see a display of how much battery life is left all the time. The Battery life display only seems to appear when you hang it up for a short instance...you cannot see it while you are talking, while it is just lying around, or while it is sitting in the cradle charging. In other words you cannot see if the battery has charge when you actually need it.2. The display seems to be chopped short of what was intended when there is an incoming call. For example when the phone is ringing the number seems to be cut in half displaying only the bottom half.

There are a few gems within, so any good Loudon fan should own it, but it's certainly not a good starting point for a newbie. T-Shirt is the better of the two. Final Exam has some seriously cringe-inducing moments (such as the title track).You'd be better off with literally any other album, prior or later.

There are better books on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good and complete, in just 144 pages","review":"Wanna know something about the US Army in the 2nd World War?

The movie did not have enough funny moments to make it worth the money for renting it, and was too predictable to make the message worth waiting for.I give it one star only."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Prada to Nada","review":"I enjoyed this movie. It's one of those that I can watch over and over again. The story can happen to anyone - it's a fact of life. I like the portrayal of the different types of personalities and characters, the typical everyday life that people experience just to survive, the conflicting characters, the hiding and outburst of emotions and that before the fall there is a realization that they already possess the qualities needed to survive such as planning, talent, beauty, compassion, intelligence that they inherited and learned from their upbringing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sense and Sensablility Modernized","review":"This is one of the best Modernized Jane Austin novels that I have seen.

This movie is BEYOND boring and quite frankly, a waste of the $3.99 I spent to watch it. I lacks depth and fails to give much insight into the cultures and society it attempts to portray.

Because this movie used all of them! i got this movie because i like Camille Belle who by the way how many trips she took to the tanning salon trying to make herself look hispanic? The problem with this movies is that they follow the telenovela format (Televisa produced it!) and they always are out of touch with reality the same happened with ''Under the same moon'' who make their characters cartoons of themselves if you really want to see something more real rent or get the Colombian movie ''Paradise Travel'' or ''Biutiful'' and the soundtrack is so lame!! There are some excellent contemporary mexican music and the scene with'' Cielito Lindo'' doesn't click. The funniest thing about some of these movies is the focus in family but you think that if i live in Beverly Hills i would have my sister living in a crappy house in East LA? And how old is Alexa vega she looks way older than she is!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cute Movie","review":"This is a fun movie to watch, it does have many \\"Stereo-types\\" in the movie and they become redundant.

I've loved Opie forever! In this movie he's at his cutest! It's nothing like the TV version was. This is Shirley Jones first non-singing movie and she's great with Glenn Ford. It's a great movie to watch with your kids. Eddie isn't like some of the snotty kids you see in movies today. He isn't overly sweet or sensitive. He's just lost his mother and trying to come to grips with both that and the fact he doesn't like not having a woman in the house. He's not afraid to talk to his dad about it, either. His directions on how to tell a \\"good\\" woman from a \\"bad\\" one kill me every time I watch it. I'm tired of the smart-aleck, know-it-alls you get in today's cinema. Sometimes I just would like to see a kid be a kid. And this movie grants my wish BIGTIME!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The matchmaking kid","review":"This is what every single-parent dad (Glenn Ford) would like to find- a woman (Shirley Jones) who really cares for his kid (8 year old Ron Howard). This is a cute, simple romance movie about picking the right woman. Ron is quite an actor in this movie as the matchmaker and anti-matchmaker. This is from the era of drama and character when you got caught up in the story not the special effects."},{"rating":"2","title":"great price","review":"This VHS tape arrived in a very timely fashion and in great shape.

This is a problem since she is the narrator and main character. The story is improbable and the characters are silly.

Mojo is probably the only band that has actually created a successful, seamless blending of the varying musical styles that are rap/hiphop/heavy metal. Rich Ward (www.thedukerocks.com) is also one of the best heavy guitarists (and very influential according to interviews with current guitar stars). Ward has a knack for creating very heavy, crushing yet melodic sounds that get in your head and you just can't stop listening to the songs. The music sounds genuinely unique, original, and authentically Mojo. You know Ward's sound whether you hear it in Mojo or his other band Fozzy. This band and musical effort will remain a timeless classic for the decades to come.

I couldn't put down this informative, FUNNY, comforting and chock-full-of-life stories book. Joan Leonard writes from the heart and offers her first-hand experiences with joy and tears. The questions I had about my second pregnancy, preparing my first child for a new brother or sister, life with two children were all answered here. You'll be much wiser (and feel a lot less alone!), as you read about the true happiness of a new life with baby number two. A must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very depressing","review":"I found this book to be very depressing. I got it when I just found that I was pregnant with my second and I wanted some advice and support - and it doesn't give you any. Most of information is a common knowlege, some is controversial, and what was probably intended to prepare you to all upcoming difficulties makes you think \\"What the hell I was thinking that night...\\".If you read something in your first pregnancy and if you have What to Expect the First year and Toddler Years (that have chapters about siblings), you already know more than this book can offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want subliminal birth control - read this book","review":"I found this book to be extremely depressing! It appears that Joan Leonard may have still been in the throes of post-partum depression while writing this book. Although I never expected that having two children would be completely idyllic, the picture painted in this book is one of pure torture, fatigue, and unrest. I recently miscarried during my third pregnancy and have been considering trying again so that my daughter has a sibling, but after reading this book - so much anger & resentment seething from the pages - that I'm seriously considering permanent birth control options. From Introduction to Epilogue, Joan Leonard tells the tale of frustrated women, sex-deprived husbands, & jealous siblings. Read this book if you're unsure of a second child, and leaning towards having an only child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, realistic book!","review":"I decided to read this book while waiting to be a mother for the second time.

I did feel like she covered the same ground several times, saying similar stuff over and over again. I enjoyed the tips from the trenches the best.

There was very little covered re: whether or not to have number 2, so it is best suited to people who already know they will have a second."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old fashioned clever entertainment","review":"This is my favorite movie of all time. I've been trying to buy it in Australia for years! Cary Grant is always brilliant but in this role ( a little older) he excels with very clever acting. Great love story and good clean humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Cary in is top form!","review":"This is Grant's last movie and he goes out in style. He may be in his sixties, but that doesn't stop the viewer from hoping that Cary will get the girl. His suavity and sophistication put young Jim Hutton to shame. Hutton should have stepped back and let the master work. Nevertheless, the film is a joy to watch and it's delightful to see Grant poking sly fun at some of his previous roles."},{"rating":"2","title":"A happy memory triggered","review":"I recently saw a list of Quincy Jones filmscores and came across Walk, Dont't Run.

Grant plays a business man in Japan who finds himself without a hotel room and nowhere to stay. In desperation he rents a room from an attractive young girl. Tons of funny antics abound in this light-hearted comedy. In his last film, Grant is as much of a charmer as he ever was. You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overlong and tiresome, weak script, but visually interesting","review":"I didn't think this film was that funny when I first saw it in 1966 at the age of 10, and after seeing it again nearly 40 years later my opinion hasn't changed.What is interesting are scenes of now largely-vanished Tokyo in the mid-1960s (note that the Okura Hotel, though, hasn't changed at all!). Exaggerated scenes of bowing, the apparent disgust of eating raw octopus, etc, are nowadays really not amusing.The film is pervaded by that tiresome style of American acting where the characters more or less yell at each other in a bad-tempered way (for instance when they can't get the coffee pot to work), this being construed as 'comedy.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"This film puts you into a entertaining world full of fun and","review":"Being a Cary Grant fan for years, Cary is at his best in this film with his wit. It shows the love that he has for his craft, a craft of entertaining the public. Hutton, a new comer at the time this film was made, picks up where Grant leaves off - and you hope the film will never end. Get lost in an evening of pure fun and enjoyment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Enjoyment!","review":"Very entertaining, charming comedy. A favorite! Perfect for the family, a sure hit with everyone!

Some high school teachers and students might not appreciate the SD approach to teaching Shakespeare because it's a little quirky to say the least. However, it's just the right thing for my 7th graders. The SD's use lots of humor, wit, visual aides, cartoons, and quick reviews to help students better understand Shakespeare and his works. This episode also does a great job of introducing students to the story of Oedipus Rex.

The Twiins are very nice. They are a nice theme that no other company has come up with. (as far as I know). They will also be a hard one to mimic, if Mattel's My Scene's come out with one, it will be blatantly copying. They are both much more beautiful than they look in the box. I highly recommend this, for a child or a collector. I've decided this will be my last Bratz, though, because of the prices. $35? Ouch. If you want the cuteness, but also want to be economical, collect or play with the My Scene. They do not come with as much stuff, or quality stuff (i.e. you can't put stuff in the purses...) but still, they are a lovely fashion doll and are very durable.

Readers looking for a broad discussion of Epicurean thought would be best served looking elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A geologist's opinion","review":"I guess I was already a believer when I ordered the book, but reading it has confirmed my suspicions that terroir is a very real contributor to what makes a good vineyard capable of producing a great wine. Wilson idolizes the vigneron, and in many ways the human touch is a part of terroir, as much as the soil profile, the microclimate etc.The graphics and sidebars in this book are superb. As a practising geologist I appreciate the details but feel confident that a layman will find the book just as interesting and informative. Wilson has a sense of purpose, a sense of humor and a sense of history which all in all provide for a good read.He has inspired me to make a study of the terroirs of Texas viticulture but I doubt if the results would ever be published in such a fine form as this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Misadvertised","review":"\\"Terroir\\" by Wilson is a very good book, indeed. Johnson, however, has very little to do with it; he just wrote the foreword, which he does to so many books. Wilson's book is comparable to the older \\"The Wines and Winelands of France, Geological Journeys\\" by Charles Pomerol, 1989, English language edition, a much more cut-n-dried account of much the same territory. Both are excellent sources of information for people like teachers and people who wish to gain some intellectual as well as sensory pleasure out of their vinous beverages."},{"rating":"1","title":"A text for geologists, not wine lovers","review":"Do not buy this book if you are expecting an easy read, perhaps expanding on the \\"terroir\\" writings of Matt Kramer of Wine Spectator fame.This book spends little space discussing the actual liquid that in contained within a wine bottle. What you get instead is an in depth examination of the geology which causes differences in the finished product. The feeling that the \\"product\\" is wine, seems to have no joy to the author. To me, that is what ruins this book. I get the feeling that if the author would have had as much enthusiasm writing upon the impact of different wavelengths of light on the lima bean.Not that this book didn't accomplish what the author set out to do. Just know what you are buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Freuds lamest book","review":"Freud speculated two Moses: an Egyptian nobleman who lived near the time of the Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaton, the founder of the world's first monotheism, who gave the Hebrews a modified version of that religion and was killed by them as a result; and a Midianite who resurrected this religion, modified it still further, and coupled it with the Egyptian rite of circumcision, thereby setting the Hebrews apart as a chosen people.Sounds weird, doesn't it? It is.Freud has an uncanny habit of failing to interpret the symbolism of his own theoretical work. The split Moses, based on the primal father (see Totem and Taboo) killed and eaten by rebellious sons: what more accurate picture could the reader want of the fate of Freud's Wednesday Psychological Society and its rebellious offspring?Stylistically, however, Freud reads a bit like Conan Doyle, and the interest he creates with his detective-story reasoning is matched only by his immense lucidity and command of the written word."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neurotic Book","review":"I still don't know how I could have finished reading the book after the part or theory where the sons kill and eat the father of the tribe, and then wanting to relate this, psychologically, to Judaism and Christianity, which I find it pretty absurd. The whole book is based on the author theories and unfounded ideas, or founded on his new discovered ideas, and few times trying to back up himself and his ideas with other writings. Is as if the author is in free writing for the whole process of the book; without even bothering to make a brainstorm or something, and just leaving the grammar to an editor. In conclusion, all I could say about the book is that I perceive as if the author was in a neurotic state on his whole writing. Who knows, he might had been, as he was having real bad personal experiences in the course of his writing. 0 stars was not an option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moses Legend Revealed","review":"An outstanding and audacious book.Not to many people have knowledge of this subject on Freud's writings.It is amazing to notice the author's courage exposing thesis where he attempt to prove or at least to demonstrate that Moses was an Egyptian and not a Jew.The argument of the existence of two Moses the one from Egypt and the other from Midia, a Medianite, is also surprising although in any way fanciful.In some bookstores this book is incorrectly classified in the psych area. This is truly a Bible history research, of course using an approach that places, in his words, religion phenomena as a model of neurotic symptoms of the individual.As I mentioned in other book comment, this kind of study always carries some dose of speculation. Freud was not an exception but without lost of plausibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"A violent book","review":"This book contains much violent material and may not be suitable for children.

Now the downfall, the blue tooth feature is great but drops you in the middle of a call with no reason. Also the battery life is a joke, if you get the phone with the non-color display the battery last maybe 40 minutes talk, and thats after lifting it off the charging stand. The Color display, well you might as well limit you call to half that. And I even bought differnt rechargable batteries (Energizers) with the listed talk times.

Not by any stretch. But this is the FOURTH Sylvers compilation to be released in the last ten years or so and they all seem to have the same tired songs on them.Perhaps it has something to do with licensing, but there are significant Sylvers tunes that have been left off these hits packages.Just last night I dug out 1978's \\"Forever Yours\\" album and put it on the turntable. The title track and \\"Swept For You Baby\\" (written by Smokey Robinson) should be included on any true greatest hits package. (I remember the songs getting some airplay in Chicago that year!)With the exception of \\"Don't Stop, Get Off,\\" this most excellent Sylvers album is generally overlooked with each compilation CD. I don't mind \\"The Roulette Wheel of Love\\" and \\"Ain't No Doubt About It,\\" but come on! Let's delve a little deeper into this family's catalog and give us fans something more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Young Blood Digs Old School","review":"The Sylvers are awesome. Being a member of Generation X, I dig music from the 1920's to the early 1980's. Music back in that era had a meaning, told a story, and touched your heart. You could relate to the lyrics of the song. This album talks about the innocence of being young. From \\"High School Dance\\" to \\"Lovin' Me Back,\\" took me back to middle school and high school. The music today is lacking all of that and then some. No feeling, no pride, just noise. The new recording artists could take a lesson from this group and others, a lesson on being real."},{"rating":"2","title":"A weighty tome on the collection of medical herbs.","review":"Considering the cost of the book version of this work, I specifically enjoyed the cost of this format. Also, it is very handy to be able to both search and highlight various passages.I found that is perhaps has too much speculation on the value of herbs to cure too much - but this obviously has more to do with the 1908 print date than anything else. Curiously, many of the terms for various herbs has also changed.So, this is a huge book on the period where herbs were the best (and often the only) curative. In modern practice one must take caution is just embracing all the recommendations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Herbs, etc","review":"Not relevant to my needs.

To the credit of supplier, the arrestor comes with similar safety warning, however I believe the warning should be much more urgent and commanding. A better warning may include following: ' The arrestor has extremely sharp (saw tooth) edges, where simple handling can tear the skin off your hands and fingers. Installing in a metal chimney cap requires it to be coiled, inserted and released. DO NOT COIL AND INSERT BY HAND! USE A METAL PLIERS OR OTHER TOOL TO INSERT.

Yeah, I'd wear a mask too if I was that hideous. The first ten minutes are pretty spooky, but once the kids grew up and became even more inept adults, the film fell short of being just alright.

If the movie had done a better job with the script, pacing, internal logic, general common sense that no character can seem to work with to any level of survival, and the length of the picture ringing in at 86 minutes (11 of which is credits), which is weak sauce even for a TV movie rather than a real film (\\"Salem's Lot\\" the 2004 picture by TNT starring Rob Lowe is actually 181 minutes and does an excellent job with everything \\"Darkness Falls\\" fails to do, go watch it instead). This movie isn't creepy, it is just stupid as everything beyond the first 5-10 minutes is just inconsistent loud nonsense.Salem's Lot - The Miniseries"},{"rating":"2","title":"Darkness Falls Up","review":"I'll admit that Darkness Falls only scared me once, but Istill had a lot of fun sitting there in the movie theater. I'll say that there is too much death, especially in one scene with the police. There is also some plot missing from the picture. Why have there been no other experiences with the tooth fairy? And definitely, why is this movie so short? I felt like the movie breezed through like nothing, which was sort of disappointing. Matilda Dixon's spirit/ghost was a neat creation, but I would've also liked to know how the people actually died. I respect them for sustaing a PG-13 rating, but I wonder how much better the movie could have been if it was R. It seems that I have mostly talked bad about Darkness Falls, but I'll admit that it is kind of a guilty pleasure, B-cheesey movie that I'll enjoy for a long time. Sort of reminicent to Pitch Black (for obvious reasons)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unoriginal and uninspired ...","review":"Some genuinely tense moments are scattered though an otherwise run-of-the-mill horror movie.Still though, it's not all bad. It's adequately acted. Don't get me wrong, nobody's winning any awards, but I wouldn't say anyone phoned it in. As I stated earlier, there are a couple moments that'll make you jump.The real benefit though, is that it's rated PG-13. A studio finally saw an advantage to cutting out some of the gore and language, thus widening their audience to include a young crowd.I know that most horror fans aren't going to give this film the time of day; but any parents out there that need a rental for a sleepover should give this an extra look. If the kids want a scary movie for the night, they may be able to rest a little easier grabbing a movie that still fits the bill but has a lighter rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch This If You Love Horror Movies!!!","review":"When I first saw the commercial advertising 'Darkness Falls' Iautomatically set a goal for myself: See that movie! As I told my friend (who is probably the one person to most likely be a movie critic) about this movie, she seemed to agree with me that it seemed like a good movie. And she was right! This movie is excellent for anyone who loves horror films. I would probably add a brief synopsis of it, but I wouldnt want to ruin for you if it hasnt already been ruined by someone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't watch if you want to be scared....","review":"To me the only thing that made this movie worthwhile was the CGI 'Toothfairy'. While there are some moments that will make you jump, you spend a lot of time rolling your eyes at the too numerous to count \\"Stay in the light!!\\" references. First off, the age differences in the children she's attacking is amazing. There's a 12 year old and a, um, 7 year old both losing their last tooth......O...K...... Then, they introduce characters into the story but don't reveal their names, plot devices, importance until 15-20 minutes later. You miss the scarier stuff trying to figure out who the latest idiot is. All in all, DON'T buy the DVD, you'll hate yourself in the morning. But it's worth a rent as long as you don't like movies to make you think."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a waste of what could have been great.","review":"dumb, dumb, dumb, can describe this film . it's great at first but loses steam very fast first 20 mins of the picture & the rules they made they broke which bugged me alot it was scary then it was joke avoid this at all cost , but if you want a heckle then rent it.

It did make me jump a few times, but not enough to make renting it worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"I was excited to see this movie after seeing Donnie Darko and The Ring recently.

Very surprizing scenes.","review":"I have to say this was a good movie. I heard alot about people saying the ring was good, it's not it was awful. People said the ending was good I have to say I didn't finish watching it cause it was so sorry. But this movie was pretty good it had scenes planned out as they go to the end when the villian dies. Like most scarey movies they have the hero's figure out how to kill the villian and have a plan. Whatever that what makes the movie sucky to me. They had little by little by showing things that you would usually just pass over not thinking anything of it. I liked the Tooth Fairy look. Even if it is a look everyone has seen, but it fit into the movie very well. Good very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Darkness Falls with a wimper","review":"Although not as bad as it could have been, \\"Darkness Falls\\" is most certainly not as good as it could have been. As directed by Johnathan Liebesman, we are served a non-stop plethora of rapid fire editing and gloomy visuals. While the idea is generally creepy, and the Tooth Fairy is quite scary to look at, we never really get to see the ghostly apparition because of the dark settings. The problem is simple, since \\"Darkness Falls\\" is like the billionth horror movie to be released in the last 10 years, the visuals are usually their saving grace. I'm sure the visuals are there, but the darkness that falls over this film won't allow us to see them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"If this movie made anyone jump, then please stick to Disney movies. Again, this was more cheesy than scary. The tooth fairy appeared way to often , and snatched people so quick that I lost count.This would be an ok film, for an amateur director, someone out of college maybe, but not a hollywood production.The only thing that I liked was the beginning, after that it gold old, really fast.Very predictable all the way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toothless","review":"Someone told me this was the scariest horror film he'd ever seen. I think that person should stay home more, and not rest his laurels on his movie reviewing skills. I can't think of another horror film in the last 5 years that was worse than this one--and I don't want to. The premise was interesting enough with its Ring-like introduction and legendary hooks. A woman wrongly accused of being a childkiller returns from the grave to kill children as the Tooth Faerie, upon losing their last baby tooth. Maybe the first 30 minutes of the film were interesting with quite creepy visuals, but beyond that very nonintuitive leaps were made in the plot--one too many changes of heart and nicks of time--and I just viewed its remainder as a comedy. After that shift in focus I liked it very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"My choice for worst horror movie.","review":"I like good horror movies. This is not one of them, however.

Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The unscariest film ever","review":"The un-scariest movie I have ever seen! It's about the tooth fairy! It's a bad movie about a stupid story involving the tooth fairy. Seriously, who is afraid of the tooth fairy?!!

I would give the overall movie 3 stars, but since I thought (the first time I saw it) it was one of the scariest movies I've ever seen, I bumped it up to a four. It's kind of like the counter to The Ring. The Ring overall was a much better movie, but when \\"the big scare\\" in The Ring was revealed, I thought it was really disappointing. I did see DF in the theatre first and The Ring on DVD, so that may have had an effect on the comparative scaryness factor of the two movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tooth Fairy Strikes Out...","review":"In the small town of Darkness Falls looms a Tooth Fairy legend where young children who lose their last milk tooth and peek at the Tooth Fairy will be killed by her. Kyle Walsh loses his tooth and during the night finds himself being haunted by the Tooth Fairy, whom Kyle glances at over his bed sheet. The Tooth Fairy attacks Kyle who escapes, but Kyle's mother is less fortunate. Years later, when Kyle has grown up, the Tooth Fairy seems to stalk another young boy and now Kyle has the opportunity to face his fear in the town of Darkness Falls. Darkness Falls begins with an interesting and haunting premise, however, after several turns and bends in the story the overall experience becomes a farce and not a true horror film. There are occasions where the audience will feel frightened and get startled, but the film becomes a repeated failure to its own demise through the overkill of attempting to scare the audience and the obvious use of elements of past horror films."},{"rating":"1","title":"I AM AMAZED!!!!!!","review":"Truly, some one had to have really dedicated themselves to every inch of film shot in this movie too maximze its raw potential too suck with out even a hint of remorse....

Even worse than the remake of THE HAUNTING...this absolute drivel fails on every single level. Except for the special effects which are very good. So you have a truly appalling film with cool monster effects. Remarkably banal characters that you just can't care about. The only effective part of this film is the first fifteen minutes and from then on it's a complete failure.The ghost suddenly fails to be affected by the light that is supposed to kill it or keep it at bay. DREADFUL does not begin to describe the incredible charmlessness of this sad piece of horse manure. The only good thing about it is that it made money at the box office. So at least someone got paid.

Shes about as frightening as a half eaten breakfast burrito. She dosen't even kill in an interesting way, it never really says how she kills but we think she scrathces or something. Oh scary, a monster who fights like a three year old girl. Maybe next there will be movies about a killer Easter Bunny. Also the monster makes a moaning schreching sound constently. Its really annoying. It sounds like RHEE! throuhgout the entire movie.We really liked the way the little boy was accused of killing his mother even though there was no way he could have possibley done it.

Things go downhill after a fantastic (and very scary) opening. Plot is sacrificed for cheap deaths and scares that just don't work, making what could have been terrific psychological horror cheesy, sappy, and boring. The legend of the tooth fairy should have been explored a bit more and the psychological tension of the opening should have remained throughout, rather than the awful death scenes being the film's only redeeming quality. When we finally get to see Matilda Dixon (the tooth fairy), it is disappointing. She was better left invisible because her appearence makes an already terrible film even worse (and I would omit that annoying laugh of hers from the soundtrack every time she's around)--UGH! The wonderful Emma Caufield is purely wasted. This ultimately fails after such a promising start. There is no imagination in its script or direction. The very similar THEY is SLIGHTLY better."},{"rating":"1","title":"So this is better scarier than The Ring? Yea right!","review":"I'm sorry to all the Darkness Falls fans, but I was laughing at how bad this movie was. I mean, I've seen scarier things under my bed! Everyone kept saying how creepy her face looked... the Orcs faces on Lord of the Rings are scarier (which aren't even scary!). The acting isn't all that bad but the consept is kinda stupid and it's so predictible. The Ring scared the crap out of me, literally, so if you say that Darkness Falls is scarier, you can't decipher scary from comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clever, but a real waste of time","review":"After the first 20 minuets of Darkness Falls, you'll never want to be in the dark again. However, this film really loses its at-first cleverness for the rest of the movie, and nothing exciting really happens, thanks to [weak]acting, no plot, a draggy chase sequence for 50 minutes, and a total of 75 minutes in length (what can you do with that?). The Ring of 2002 is way scarier and is a much better movie all in all with the most clever writing in a horror movie since the sixth sense. Darkness however, needed more time for writing, much better actors, a plot, and atleast 100 minutes in length.

The Idea is a beautifully told urban legend. The story in the beginning was great. The general idea of an kindly old woman exchanging teeth for coins in the 1800s is good. But one day she falls victim to a fire, which severely burns her face so She begins to wear a mask. One day, when children mysteriosuly disappear she is blamed and is executed. Now she returns to collect teeth in revenge and spite. Any child that looks at her face dies. This story was good. Then something went wrong. The movie's main character was introduced.

The script is lacking in any sort of realism, and the direction takes ideas from more successful and effective films like \\"The Ring.\\" It isn't a complete waste of time, because it does deliver a few scares (it's more of a teenager-Halloween-party-film).

The puffy-eyed, pale-faced 8 year old boy who sees dead people, the stupid slew of characters that happen to find their way in the path of the evil spirit and the weakest main male character I've ever saw.

I think this is their best effort to date. The production, lyrics, guitars and voice of Fernando are at their best in this work of art. The album begins with the relaxing Slow Down! which is a warm up to the whole dark exercise. Track 2-6 * 9-12 are the perhaps the best works of Moonspell in their career. Hanger Man, Mute, Magdalene are dark, down to earth and very very melodic. This is Moonspell displaying their perfect art, meloncholic metal with thrashing guitars. Handmade God wants you to headbang while Mute makes you cry. Totally this is an album that will make you a fan of Moonspell for life. In these days of superficial metal and fake melodies, this is a work of art. This will stand tall. Sin is smashing!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different...","review":"I was quite shocked when I bought this CD. After listening to Wolfheart and Irreligious, I was expecting more of the same, but Moonspell came out with a big surprise. Although I love their old roots (Even when they were known as Morbid God), this CD was a definite beauty.Moonspell started off with an eerie but appropriate introduction to the CD with Slow Down! Handmadegod was the first actual song and basically carried the theme of the CD very well. My favourite song is Magdalene, it's real smooth, spine-chilling, and beautiful.If you're new to Moonspell, then you should maybe try Irreligious or Wolfheart first to hear what they really sound like. This CD took on it's own personality and maybe took the time to share the views of the band. It was definitely mature and easy to get into. Now quit reading this and buy the CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Grab me the bottle of Vivarin. Hurry...before I...zzzzz...\\"","review":"Moonspell's stylistic changes have been a bit too drastic for me from album to album. I loved their first mCD, Wolfheart, and like Irreligious. They seemed to lose their raw edge too quickly, and some of their passion dissipated with it. The previous albums were enjoyable, but I can't say the same for this.On this new album, they've mellowed out so much that I'm not sure they're even alive any more. The vocals are painfully monotone and flat. It looks like they're trying for a subtle gothic dance-club theme while using the metal guitars to maintain their status in that genre as well. It doesn't work. I don't know if goth finds will like this, but I doubt many metal fans will. The use of strange percussion emphasizes their new direction, but it sounds like a bunch of pots and pans banging around in the back of a truck. I don't know why they did it, but it's all through the album, and wears thin as the counter reaches the 60th minute."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars for 2 good songs","review":"Except for HandMadeGod and 2econd Skin, this album is a huge disappointment.

This book lacks the charm of the \\"soup\\" books...most of the stories are drawn out from the one sentence in which they could be summarized. It seems as though Ford, in trying to solicit stories, accepted the first 101 and did not edit or improve any submissions at all. Some of the stories, granted, are interesting, engaging, and even a bit spooky. Unfortunately, the majority seem contrived and more the fare of late-night campfire chats or urban legends than genuinely inspiring stories of the \\"other side\\". In future editions of this book (which I am sure there will be), Ford could, should, and for her own integrity as a writer, must be more selective in choosing her stories.

She has many questions about spirituality and eternal life, and she loves the sensation of goose bumps on her neck. I wanted to reconcile these interests into something healthy for her soul and psyche. At first this book appeared to fit the bill nicely, touting its stories of \\"Angels, Miracles, and Healings,\\" but the old cliché \\"never judge a book by its cover\\" holds true! Having read a few of the stories myself, I can only conclude that this is NOT the gift to give my impressionable and daring niece. While many are first or second hand accounts with angels and miracles, several others revolve around experiments in the occult (ouija boards, witchcraft rituals, etc.) that are not meant as cautionary tales. If this book is a gift for a teen in your life, you might want to think twice about buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK","review":"I don't understand why people keep copying the Chicken Soup books and doing such a bad job of it.

The book goes nowhere, establishes texture and tone, has no drive, is holographic and can be read in any order, and offers consistently good and occasionally brilliant insights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outrageous, honest, provacative and all Eno","review":"Ever ready to confound expectations, this book tells the story of who Brian Eno is not by recounting his life but in a more subtle and intimate way; he gives you his diary from a year in his life. You come to know his tastes, his interests, his sense of humor, his way of thinking, his fears, his joys. The man is complex and not without contradictions. While reading someone else's diary may seem a bit creepy and big-brotherish, and while this one may have its slow points, it is ultimately as honest a revelation of the man as we are ever likely to see. Just as integral to the book is his \\"swollen appendices\\", a collection of his correspondences, speeches and stories. What makes the man so compelling to me is his incisive critical thinking; this is someone who enjoys and is quite good at thinking, an increasingly rare commodity in today's society."},{"rating":"2","title":"All the words float in sequence","review":"I expected to enjoy this slightly, since I've been a fan of his music and installations.

Compared to the old Sears contractor saw, this is a 1000% improvement. Wing extensions are about a 1/32\\" low from surface of table. Not a huge problem but it did require grinding the mounting holes to get a level surface. Shorted some parts but Delta quickly supplied. Only hang up I have is with Delta and their instructions. These are the worst instructions, particularly the fence installation, that it has ever been my misfortune to use. The instructions are particularly confusing because they try to cover an installation on a uni-saw, a contractor saw, hybrid, or another manufacturers saw. The pictures are not accurate, instructions are not sequential, and I ended up discarding them. Complete set up took about 4 hrs and should have taken 1 hour at most."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delta Saw tops in my shop","review":"The Delta 36-716 I ordered turned into a 36-714 on delivery, but I assume this is just a renumbering exercise by Delta, because it appears to be the same saw. Assistance was required to install the motor pulley and the extension tables, and by then you should have it exactly where you want it, because it is not going to be moved. The Unifence is as advertised, strong and accurate with its three-point lock. Micro-adjustments would be a plus. The safety guard is clumsy and must be removed if you are to get to the blade to measure cuts, or grow another hand to hold it out of the way. The saw is accurate and the miter gauge is accurate. It is quiet and there is little vibration. It is a good compromise between Cabinet and contractor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full-Duplex sounds great!","review":"This full duplex phone changed the way I am heard when I am having conversations with my soho client base.

The transfer to DVD seemed to have been made from a poor theater print, with lines and color dropout all through the video. The film itself is fun, and Delon makes one forget Tyrone Power, since he is so much the better (and better-looking!) actor. Additionally, Amazon neglected to mention that it is dubbed, passably, into English. Very jarring effect!

If your not a the biggest Carnaval fan it may not be up to par (intensity wise) with the Samba schools current recordings of today and might sound like just any other Samba school recording. I liked it because I was able to see how far these schools have come by gong back to older recordings and because I cant get enough of Carnaval!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sambas de Enredo 2001","review":"In the lead up the Rio Carnival, all the major Samba Schools participating in the main parade release their samba-enredo (samba theme song) on cd and radio. The object is for people to become familiar with of the songs' lyrics and so on. These songs, like those on this cd, are professionally recorded in a studio.I bought this cd simply to get a hold of the opening track by the Imperatriz school, a song about sugar. However, all the tracks are fast, fun, joyous and a wonderful example of the bright music which accompanies the Rio Carnival.This disc comes with the lyrics too.As a lover and player of samba music, I recommend the 2001 cd to all. However, if you're not familiar with samba music, it's advisable that you shop around a bit more. Though samba-enredos are the prime of samba music, they're quite unlike Bossa Nova or other slower samba tunes. Samba-enredos are heavily percussive."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Anthology. There IS Better Out There","review":"This anthology failed to impress me. Most of the stories were truly poor not worth the time to read. There are a couple of exceptions. Most notably where Denise M. Bruchman's \\"Lesser of Two Evils\\" and Edo van Belkom's \\"The Rug\\"; I would readily give these two stories five stars each. The two worst, most dissapointing works in the collection were Richard Christian Matheson's \\"Help Me\\" (a true waste of space), and--brace yourselves-- Stephen King's \\"Autopsy Room Four\\"; both of these works were pathetic sensationalism--I've not read any other R.C. Matheson (though I'm a fan of his father's), but I KNOW King can do much better.Don't waste your time or money. Check it out from the libary to read the contributions of Bruchman and Belkom; bother with nothing else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soft and cuddly. 3 and 5 year love it.","review":"Very cute.

It's cute, but very small. I didn't notice, but it is part of the Beanie Babies collection. Seems to be overpriced for what it is. $25 bucks for a little white fluffed up bean bag. Very quick shipping, but it was crammed inside a plain cheap first class envelope. I'm not impressed at all with this transaction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute, but not like the picture","review":"This picture of this puppy looks just like my bichon.

He had already gone through 4 rounds of chemo when my mom watched this. It is very anti-chemo.

I"},{"rating":"1","title":"Curing Cancer From the Inside Out","review":"\\"Curing Cancer From the Inside Out\\" - DVD takes the approach that western medicine's reliance upon medication, invasive/toxic cancer treatments and surgery are totally wrong-headed. The various presenters take to task the pharmaceutical industry, doctors who use radiation and chemotherapy to deal with cancer and invasive surgery. Instead they move to the other side of the spectrum promoting adoption of very specific plant-based raw food diets to avoid and combat cancers and other chronic diseases. My wife, with a BS in nursing was put off by the extreme views. As a vegan for over 20 years, I can appreciate the concept but the message was delieved too heavy-handed."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD is too biased","review":"I found the DVD extremely biased toward alternative medicine and too anti-medical model. There is benefit in both. An example of chemo being poison - poison can be good or bad depending on the amounts used and purpose. Everything has a place in life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Show Me HOW! This is not a Healing DVD.","review":"Blah Blah Blah!There is no direction given here just a lot of talk.

I have not read the book so I cannot comment about it in regards to the DVD, but I definitely did gain a lot of positive information. Buy this DVD and share it with everybody you know, because sometimes it is a lot easier to sit people down in front of a tv instead of a book! In my opinion you can spread the valuable information regarding Healing Cancer faster this way. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening and disturbing","review":"The only reason I rate it 4 stars is due to the poor filming quality.

Thoroughly enjoyed the wounded Jack McCabe character -- Hailey, I worried about but did not doubt her love for the child Megan.

Boy, was I ever wrong!While the soundtrack is good, it's not worth sitting through the vapid and moronic musings of the SGs featured in this film. This is something the military might want to look into using at Guantanamo Bay to torture the prisoners there, I know after about 30 minutes of it, I was ready to kill myself or at least put my foot through the set. In the end, I just opted to turn the sound off. The Suicide Girls are certainly beautiful to look at but, I won't be expecting any of them to make the next scientific breakthrough anytime soon.It's a NetFlix rental at best, it might be something you see on cable and catch snippets of but not to worry because it's something better seen in limited doses."},{"rating":"1","title":"New York's Alright if You Like Saxophones","review":"I honestly did not care for this video. I don't know whether its a post-feminist statement or high class porn but either way it doesn't work.

Now if Richard Kern had directed it that might be another matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goth Girls making good...","review":"This is pretty fabulous. It's a documentary about a troupe of Goth Girls moving out of the shadow of society's norms and making their own rules and following their own paths through life.

Missy is the visible face but this is not a feminist enterprise. Wake up. Google them and read some of the stories of how they've screwed over models, faked diaries, self-censored themselves and taken pictures down, then lied and said they were targeted by the FBI. Sean has become a multimillionaire pornographer but there's nothing \\"alternative\\" here. I've seen the whole thing from the start."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really wasn't expecting this!","review":"Well, when I ordered it I expected just the shows, not the interviews or the photo shoots. I was extremely happy with this purchase. The girls weren't all the same all of them beautiful in their own way.the clips from the shows are good but the photo shoots and interviews are what makes this thing really rock. A few friends of mine watched it and absolutely loved it and they aren't into the alternative beauty as much as I am. They had never heard of these girls at all and I believe were really shocked at first but quickly became oppsessed with but I think if you're into a new generation of women and burleque shows then this might be for you.This isn't soft porn if thats what you're looking for though. But I Absolutely loved it! Thank you Missy Suicide and all the bueatiful women who made it possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I saw this DVD and I thought it was boring.

As a visionary, she has put together this masterpiece. 5 stars... no question."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this?","review":"How incredibly disappointing. Not what I expected at all. It was boring and incredibly immature. I thought these women would have some amount of sophistication or intelligent/interesting things to say.

This is an excellent product, both for studying nutrition and for studying biology. Their explanation of the molecules of life, followed by tons of great and detailed information, presented in an easy to assimilate format, makes this an extremely valuable asset. If you, or your student, desire to understand proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids, this is the tool to buy! I've taught science in nearly every type of school setting for over 20 years and wish I'd found this sooner.

Singing in those two languages you sound more like Amalia Rodrigures (the Portuguese Diva) singing her old melodic FADOS. The difference is that Amalia does good work singing FADO and she does it with her soul, because Portuguese is her language and FADO was her life. Come on Zizzi, Italian or Napolitan are not your first languages and Portuguese is. So do what you do the best: Singing Bossa Nova and do it in your first language that is PORTUGUESE. I love you in Portuguese but I detest your voice and accent in Italian or Napolitan. Like said before you sound more like Amalia Rodrigues singing old FADOS when you sing in Italian. I wish I could give ZERO STAR to this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great, for about 1 year","review":"Good product for the price. The screen image was good, not great.

Would recommend ear phones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought this for my 3 year old grand daughter","review":"This has the clearest picture I have seen on anything in a long time. My grand daughter watches Cinderella III and Swan Lake Barbie on it and they really come to life. The only complaint I have is that when the dvd loads it makes an noise but it doesnt have any other problems and that is probably just part of the whole loading process. It is pretty easy to operate and we keep it in the box it came in while she watches it (just leave the screen open and slide it back into the box, I made a little slit for the cord) that way she cant play with the buttons or put her feet on it. :-) All in all, so far so good and it was a good price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Philips PET724 not working","review":"It is very sad to see that after just three and four usage of the DVD player.

So much in fact that we returned it. It never played the movies correctly and even scratched every movie we played in it. Do not waste your money on this thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A realistic heroine-----and a great role model.","review":"Moreta: Dragonlady of Pern was probably the best in the series. It tells the story of Moreta, dragonrider for the golden queen dragon Orlith. When a horrible plague is let loose by a inported feline from the Southern Continent, only the dragonriders can save the people! This book was well done in that it didn't contridict much mentioned about it in Dragonflight and other Pern books. Someone wrote that Moreta did not have the ability to speak to all dragons in the Weyrs like she should have according to Dragonflight. Well, she DOES! She just doesn't discover the ability until later in the book. Moreta is a very believable character and has become a personal heroine and role model for me. I recommend this book to any dragon- or fantasy-lover!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, but a tear-jerker","review":"One of my favorites in the Dragonrider of Pern Series (I love them all, though). The heart and courage of Moreta and Orlith are inspiring. It's interesting to see the devastation that a common ailment today could cause on an unaccustomed population and what it drives people - and dragons - to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most Beautiful Pern Novel Yet","review":"Finally the song is explained. Moreta is the seventh of the Dragonriders of Pern series and by far the most moving. The story is engaging and a quick read. It is well worth the time put into it, not only for the satisfying feeling that comes with the understanding of the Pern saga, but for the chance to see Pern as it was. A fabulous book that I'd recommend for any dragonlover or fantasy enthusiast."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was really not that good.","review":"I'm going to keep this short because this book doesn't warrent that much of my time. Nothing really happens in this book. I've read the prior Pern novels and they were good enough to enjoy for a light read. This book, yes, pertains to the history of Pern but does not add much to it. Nothing is really accomplished, except that this is a start of a different era of history. I kept waiting for something to happen that is notable but nothing really did. You get a few small tidbits of imformation about the origional colonists but not much. This book really makes me reconsider weither or not I will read anymore Pern books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book (all I have to say)","review":"I loved this book but the end was sad but I won't give it away. I was amazed at how their ways are like F'lar & Lessa's after how the Oldtimers are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely pitiful","review":"Moreta was perhaps the most boring book in the entire series! I mean, the characters didn't really show much personality in this story except the part about Moreta liking runner-beasts. And anyways, I thought Lessa was the one to have discovered how to travel into time and not Moreta. The story line was really sorry and the climax of the whole book wasn't excactly heart-pounding. This is perhaps the only book in the entire series that was really bad. So read the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, and different from other Pern books","review":"Some descriptions of situations are a bit too long, but it gives a different wiew of this strange and interesting society. Here the hero is a weyrwoman who has a not so good relationship with the mate thas has been imposed on her by the queen dragon. It has the same problem of other Pern books. Lot of people with strange names come and go, and you have to go back and look \\"where did I see this personage before?\\" (For that the Kindle is perfect)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for Pern fans","review":"If you are a fan of The Dragonriders of Pern this is a must for your library!! I love this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"Moreta: Dragonlady of Pern was certainly not the best of Anne McCaffrey's works, but much of it was well worth reading. The end was a surprising twist, something that one does not usually expect. That pretty much made the story. But I agree with one of the above reviews: wasn't Lessa the one who discovered going \\"Between times?\\" However, I enjoyed this book more than Nerilka's Story."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite in her series!","review":"This is another one of my collection of favorite fantasy books. I haven't read ALL her books yet, only maybe 3/4s of the Pern books, but this one is my favorite. In all her books she makes the characters just come alive, and make you feel like you're actually a part of the book in some way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving....","review":"I actually read this book a few years ago but I still think of it a lot whenever I read any of the Dragonrider series... This book is special because it shows how the people of Pern must face other threats than thread throughout their past present and future. For Moreta to die because of tiredness while involved in transportating medicine and get lost between shows how \`real\` Pern and its people are in Anne McCaffrey\`s books.
