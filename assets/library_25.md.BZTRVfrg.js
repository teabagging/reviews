Also, if you use a cell phone in the car, don't get this radio. The radio is not shielded so you will get interference from cell phone. Each time I use my cell phone I have to turn the radio all the way off. Lowering the volume does not help. You still get a loud buzzing sound. I didn't have this problem with my previous stereo.

I have been making one of her wire snowflakes every year now, and give them out as Xmas presents. (picture here at: http://webpages.charter.net/garyb444/Snowflake%20008.jpg).She also does not give illustrations for every single step of the projects, but I found that the instructions were detailed enough for me to complete the projects, based on previous wire wrapping experience and ordinary common sense.

Hanging a screaming pig upside down from a forklift, shooting it in the head, and slitting it's throat. A cow was killed as it looked directly into the camera. I didn't know cows had expressions, but after looking into it's face as it died, it is something I doubt I will ever forget. And the two still born goats? How do you suppose the Director managed that? Killed a female goat and two newborns, gutted the \\"mother\\", and pulled the dead fetuses out through her dead vagina?

That a film like this can be made is deeply disturbing. I do not pay to watch actors pretend to kill animals in American films (with the statement that \\"no animal is harmed,\\" whether or not that is actually true...I pray it is), and I certainly do not pay to watch animals being literally savaged before my eyes. While I abstain from meat, I understand that animals eat other animals and I feel that to respectfully take the life of anything for the purpose of survival has its place in the world. However these animals in this film are being driven to a studio or location setting and killed for the purpose of entertainment.

Then watching her toil through some of the harder jobs that are required in taking care of a farm/B&B, one has to think that moving from bookwork to practice is exhausting and daunting at times.

I understand every episode was based on an actual event. Though not a documentary, Combat shows the types of things our fighting men encountered. It is inspiring, informative, humorous and it grabs your interest. The actors went through a week of boot camp to learn how the military does things. This greatly added to the shows authenticity. I have shared some episodes with my wife, who had never seen the show before, and she greatly enjoyed them.One episode covers the liberation of some prison camp detainees and touches on their misery.

This is not one of them. Although mildly entertaining in the beginning due to the author's bombastic nature, the book becomes a truly tedious read. The biggest problem is that the book is dated (1984 copyright) and compiles poker strategy into general rules for five card draw and stud (forget about hold em or omaha). The author then expects the reader to extrapolate the given strategies into seven card games. As an added bonus, most of the strategy (if not obvious even to the most oblivious newbies) is either unsound or irrelevant. The only redeeming value of this book is for those who are seeking an encyclopedia of dealer's choice games. Please save your money or buy another book (Peter Steiner's Thursday Night Poker is superb for amatures, Slansky and Brunson are essential for aspiring pros)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scarne Knows Poker -- NOT Writing Books","review":"The content of this book is very informative and helpful. It focuses on specific rules of many poker variations and some statistics to go with them. There is no shortage of calculated odds tables in this book for you to try to memorize. However, John Scarne needs to get his money at the poker tables because his writing struggles. You will not be fond of this man after your first 15 minutes of reading. To get through this book, you must have alot of determination; you will not be reading it for fun. Perhaps the toughest, most boring read of my life.

The thing that i didn't like was that they didn't show how Ernesto's life came out to be. Like when he had met Fidel Castro.

There was no need to give more details or be more specific about this character. He was a young man at this point, far from becoming the infamous warrior the world came to know as Che Guevara. I love this film, in fact it is one of my favorites. I am appalled to learn about his actions in Cuba and his decision to stop practising medicine. I cannot deny that I both, admire and despise what he became, but the point of this movie is to depict his journey through South America, not how he became Che Guevara in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good ...","review":"Excellent film.

South America is a beautiful, exotic, and diverse continental rich in history and culture. Having traveled there several times I find the land fascinating.However.......It amazes me how today's liberals, who adhere to an ideology supposedly based on tolerance and pacifism, actually admire Che Guevara. The film glossed over the fact that he was a bigot at times and a murderous thug, having participated in the execution of untold numbers of political enemies. Young people today who sport \\"Che\\" merchandise are totally ignorant of the real historybehind this man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aye Carumba","review":"Does anyone have any information on any \\"buddy films\\" about Hitler. The early years of course. Before he became so \\"angry\\". Perhaps Stalin and Mao movies would be nice. Its high time we break down these taboos and see the lighter side of totalitarian dictators.As someone whose father was almost executed by this \\"social justice-minded doctor\\" who cared so much about the \\"poor\\" (except when they didn't want communism of course), I find it mindblowing that people who live in freedom would gush about this man.

I only wish my dead grandfather, my dead uncle, my dead aunt, and my imprisoned and tortured cousins could have been afforded the same basic human dignity."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Life of Saint Che","review":"This film is the cinematic equivalent of a \\"Che\\" t-shirt: a sanitary and simplified image of a complex man, custom-made to appeal to college kids. Some see Che as a hero and others see him as a monster. I see him as neither - I went to this film hoping to get a look at the human side of the young Che, so that I can better understand why he did the things that he did later in life. Instead, I was treated to a shallow hagiography which (as one reviewer so humorously put it) made Che look like Mother Teresa.

But this DVD has a big problem: the English subtitles are hardsubbed. That means you cannot turn off the subtitles.

Although the film should be a bit grainy for the style, it is also blurry which indicates to me that it could be done better.Audio: ACrisp and full guitars. Levels great, including excellent center channel. The music alone sold me on this movie, and the representation here in uncompressed DTS-MA 5.1 is the selling point.Extras:N/AOverall: B+A better transfer to really make those blues and oranges pop would sell me a second disc.

The first half is your typical \\"buddy film\\" with the cinematography stealing the show. There's not much substance here, but it's nice to look at and the actors provide some comedic moments. Unfortunately, the second half quickly degenerates into a preachy and embarrassing piece of communist propaganda.

I guess that's two hours and eight dollars that I will never see again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I-luv-commies","review":"Just kidding. I hate em. But this movie is great because deep down inside every ruthless killer and dictator-lackey is a human being who once felt bad for lepars. So we should make nice movies about them.

The movie showed what kind of person Ernesto was and the problems he's been through. I liked the movie because Che was strong and cared for the low class people and stood up for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK....","review":"First of all, I have no compliants about the acting or who this person really was. I didn't know about this guy before I watched the movie. I think the movie is somewhat over-romantized. It's supposed to be a story about how this journey had changed the main characters. But, the movie tried to put too many incidents together like I haven't developed enough \\"feeling\\" for the situation, and they had moved on to any place. Almost towards the end, the way the movie portrayed how he swam across the river just to celebrate his birthday with those patients suffering from leprosy, is a bit .... hollywood heroic style. In short, if I want to know more about Latin America's history, I think it's better to watch a documentary film. The movie is neither informative nor very entertaining (to my taste). But, if you're someone who like \\"artistic\\" movie, this may be for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"strange propaganda movie.....","review":"Yes, I watched movie. And then I realized movie is based on main character letters and in reality we had two main characters. Why we see movie from point of view of Che and not second guy? The reality was same for both why the evaluation and reaction was different?It is especially funny to see results 50 years later when violent struggle and revolution resulted in creation of concentration camp called Cuba.And now people risk their life just to get out of communistic paradise--is this Che vision? Or results always independent from our intentions?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Becareful --- Communist Propoganda!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Dumb me!!!I should read more reviews before I purchsing the movie.I though this is a movie about touring the beautiful South America with motorcycles. I did not even know who they portry in the movie. Then I found out when I was watching half way of the movie,I suddenly felt I saw this movie before! Ha, It is a communist propoganda! Somebody must learnt from either USSR or Chinese communist propogada machines to fool inocent people to believe those mass murderers are poor people's heros. I lived in Communist country for many years and this is exactly how they portry the dictators as heros who care about poor people. There are plenty of such movies in USSR and China to portry the dictators sush as Stalin and Mao in the exact format. Do not fooled by the movie.I gave it a one star because I can not gave it zero or negative.The beautiful scenes of the beautiful South America and the mass murderers can't be mixed together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big giant kiss-up to a terrorist, before he was a mall goth T-shirt","review":"Besides committing the worst cinematic sin of being boring and self-indulgent, this bromide of a film is an utter distortion of how Che Guevara developed into a sadistic murderer and rapist. This yawner shows him as a spoiled medical student who helps a leper colony, but does little to explain how he became a power-hungry militant with a notorious reputation for ruthlessness. He established forced labor camps to torture and kill innocent people. In one account, a child in his guerrila unit was immediately shot without trial for having stolen some food. He helped to destroy hundreds of years of a rich Cuban culture (see \\"Before Night Falls\\" to understand how the Castro government stifled free speech and tortured innocent people). Meanwhile, he was a hypocrite, living in a rich Havana estate like the so-called \\"capitalist oppressors\\" he tried to eradicate. But don't expect to see that story in this dull, droning film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but misleading","review":"Just a short and sweet review here.The movie is very good and exhibits the passion of a young Che Guevara, but it makes the mistake of assuming that being around the poor people in society automatically makes you a socialist.That just isn't the case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Lesson","review":"I liked the message this movie.

And there were parts were the charecters really captured my intrerest by doing things that would make there parents proud. I also thought it was a good idea that he went with a friend so that he did not have to go through all of this alone. And he would have somebody to share his expierence even though he was not that good of a friend and was not a very good friend. But the sad part was that he ended dieing in the end anyway"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Here we have an example of a filmmaker who is afraid (or unable) to look past the surface experiences of a character and dig for a deeper motivation and a deeper meaning. We are presented with the historical facts of Guevara's life (albeit in an entertaining fashion) yet we can only guess at what interior conflicts led Guevara to make the choices that he did.Great filmmakers such as Tarkovsky and Cassavetes have the ability to \\"humanize\\" their subjects. In other words, they avoid all biases and stereotypes and take us directly into the minds and hearts of their characters in a way that helps us to understand their choices and accept them on a more personal, human level. I believe this is what Salles was attempting to do here, but he failed to do so. Perhaps he was afraid to stray too far from the iconic facade of Guevara and socialist ideology or perhaps he has simply reached the limits of his artistic ability. Either way, this film falls short of what it could have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Romanticizing a socialist mass murderer.","review":"Is this a romantic well directed movie? Yes it is. It is ultimately morally bankrupt because it romanticizes a man who may have been an idealistic youth. That young man grew up to become a mass murderer. He became a man responsible for the loss of freedom of millions of human beings. Decades of oppression, injustice and tyranny are the fruits of Ernesto Guevara's actions. The young man in this film is the same man who set up an apartment over the execution grounds in Havana so he could listen to gunshots as innocent people were murdered for being opposed to Castro because it pleased him. Ernesto Guevara deserves a place in hell. Not made into a romantic hero. This is what we should expect from Hollywood though. I'm sure that soon some Hollywood socialist will make movies of the romantic wonderful lives of Stalin, Mao, Hitler and other twentieth century socialists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motorcycle Diaries","review":"The title is miss leading.

I saw this in a theater back in 1993 and loved it, because it wasn't meant to be taken seriously; it's Arnie lampooning himself (I'm Arnold Braunschweiger!) during his comedy movie era with other jokes tossed in. It doesn't always work, but it's great fun and this blu-ray was a long overdue re-release, even if it is bare-bones."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good movie with great action and clever cameos.","review":"I really loved this movie. I know I'm only in the 7th grade, but I could tell a good movie from a bad one. Another thing is the critics. Some critics take a movie so far that they take family movie and judge it as a drama.

And whats with the person that reveiwed for this movie on this site on 5/26/98 (just tryin' to be specific!)that said kids in 4th grade and up would not like this movie, I saw this movie when I was in about 1st or 2nd grade and i still like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"He really is the Last Action Hero","review":"Ok this movie is great if you're an Arnie fan...ARNIE FANS ONLY, no half assin here.

To see him in a comedic fashion parallels to Jackie Chan doing comedy in the Rush Hour movies. The movie goes at a slow, but decent pace. It is filled with tons of action, humor and of course one liners. It is interesting to see the movie, then play the pinball game. It helped to pull out quotes and actions. If you love action and comedies or just \\"The Governator,\\" get this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"a fine performance","review":"Schwarzenegger plays a double role here, that of himself, and that of a movie character.

A true homage to the action genre. The only people who would not like this film are the kind of people who do not possess a sense of humour. The play on the well established cliches typically attributed to the action romps of the eighties and nineties is handled with a pinache now rarely seen in films in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"What if they made a comedy, and nobody laughed?","review":"\\"The Last Action Hero\\" is a rare thing- an action comedy spoof that has difficulty remembering what it is supposed to be exactly. The action genre is certainly ripe for a mocking, what with the thousands of \\"Die Hard\\" clones Hollywood has thrust upon the public. This could have been the perfect spoof film- team \\"Die Hard\\" director John McTiernan with The Terminator and let the jokes fly. But instead the movie tries to be serious, then tries to make jokes about the genre, then goes back to being serious again. The actors are making one kind of movie, the directors are making another. It ends up a damn mess.Aside from a humorous bit with Arnold as Hamlet at the begining, this one is a real dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably boring","review":"In my opinion, this movie has got to be Arnold's worst movie.

Not that the filmmakers weren't trying to make a quality picture. For effort, THE LAST ACTION PICTURE tops a number of routine action flicks (COMMANDO, ERASER) Arnold has made.

I'm a big fan of Schwarzenegger and I was extremely disappointed with this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"How do you get from Hunt for Red October to this?","review":"Last Action Hero had all the markings of being a great film. A good director, good actors (Charles Dance would be a wonderful villian). What made it fall apart was a weak story, and this would follow nearly all of Schwarzenegger's films post True Lies. To say Last Action Hero was rushed is quite an understatement considering John McTiernan did such a marvelous job depicting Bruce Willis and Sean Connery as two badass heroes in two brilliant written stories. If your a Schwarzenegger maniac go ahead and pick it up. But if your looking for that \\"movie within a movie\\" premise, skip this and check out Wes Craven's A New Nightmare."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unremarkable, dull action picture","review":"Here are the ingredients for making a summer blockbuster hit: a big name star, a pretentious theatrical preview, loud action, and a PG-13 rating (hey, they want people of all ages, kids and their parents, to make it break records). But it fell flat since Ah-nold's prescense doesn't make up for a lack of plot, the action scenes were laughably substandard, and its competitor was JURASSIC PARK. Recently, I rented it as a time killer and what I got was just a total waste of time. It's so maniplutive and derivative in how it borrows elements from classic foreign cinema to the Hollywood classics of the 40's and 50's to Woody Allen's PURPLE ROSE OF CAIRO to all the successful teen comedies/dramas/adventures. Even die-hard fans of Schwarzenegger will be very, very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did nobody understand this film was a spoof?","review":"I don't understand these comments, Last Action Hero is a spoof of the modern action film, that's why it's so corny and at times, badly made. Both the director and Arnie himself explained this at length during the promotion of the film but nobody seemed to understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the critics say.","review":"I can see why film critics panned this movie. When has a critic ever given a straight up action movie a good review? However, the fans all seemed to not like it either. Why is that? This is a very entertaining movie! The classic cheesy Arnold one-liners are there, but it's done on purpose...it's part of the Jack Slater character. The action is great and the comedy is just right for an Arnold flick, although there's a bigger focus on it than most of his other action flicks. Not only that, but, to go with the cheesy one-liners is a stereotypical, nearly one dimensional villain. This is not a negative...it fits right in with the feel of the movie.This is a definite must see for any Arnold fan out there. I thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"cake hat","review":"Birthday cake hat was a hit served up with some blinking balloons as a fun start to an evening out for a 30th birthday.

I took 150 pictures this way(2 64 meg cards) on a socalled dead battery. Don't give the battery indicater a chance to come on. This battery used to charge in 4 minutes and die in 3.:). After I killed the battery to the point it didn't have the energy to pull the lens back in, it took 2 hours to charge and hasn't died yet!

It helped both my batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some success with these hateful batteries","review":"So after being frustrated with both the batteries and SONY support, I set up the camera to be as battery-intensive as I could, like so: DSC505V -LCD screen: maximum brightness white balance on, flash on and on high(+) with forced flash(lightning bolt), solarize filter on, AE on with moon and + symbol and the lenscap on...(this makes the flash even brighter) (sorry for lame technical terms.I figured this would drain the battery as much as possible... Then I fired off (get this) over 200 flash shots (of nothing) on a battery showing the low-batt indicator the whole time !!I did this untill the battery would no longer even start the camera. It charged for about an hour and a half and now it works fine!!I hope this works for you too!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Everyone is right - this battery stinks","review":"To me \\"rechargable\\" means \\"indefinite use,\\" not \\"conks out after 18 months.\\" We bought the camera and an extra battery ... For a long time everything worked well - we went on a vacation ... and took loads of pictures with only one recharge during the whole week. But sometime around Jan. 2002, the charges started being shorter and shorter. Eventually around May it got to the point where we could take 3 photos or one movie and then the battery died.

It is now Jan 2003 and all three batteries are completely dead and will not hold more than about 3 minutes of charge. If Sony charged \\"less\\" for these things I would not mind so much, but to blow about \\"a big amount of money\\" on 3 batteries one of which is dead after 5 months is ridiculous.

The drummer is the real deal, and vocals are dynamic to say the least. I believe they picked up where they left off with there last album and refined it. In other words they sound like they have entered big leagues now....it is my belief that if they ever totally harness their talent they will no doubt be the next great band of the future...like Metallica before them and Zepplin before that.....Watch out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and the same rehashed riffs over and over agian","review":"The lyrics aren't that wonderful (I guess their ok), the guitars just flat out suck, and every song is so freaking similar.

Listen to a friend's copy to hear for yourself. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I miss something here?","review":"Sorry, but this album didn't impress me at all. The riffs are really short and distorted, and try too hard to be heavy, but aren't. The solos (if you can even call them that) are more of the \\"use your distortion to make noise\\" technique that many nu-metal bands seem to be picking up these days, and the repetition is ridiculous. It's very easy to listen to this album, and think you accidentally hit \\"repeat\\". The vocals are not bad, the guy can actually sing, but a lot of the time he just gets on my nerves, and the guy screaming in the background is even worse. The only good song is \\"Denial\\", because it's different from the rest, but that's not really enough to save this album. The female vocalist on \\"Licking Cream\\" is cool, but Chino Moreno is (as always) just irritating. I don't see any point in buying this. If you like this stuff, go buy some Staind or Godsmack, or (the ultimate) Alice in Chains, but this just ain't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 great song does not an album make","review":"Sadly, what we have hear is a classic case of a whole album riding on the success of one good song: \\"Waffle.\\" I listened and tried but only \\"Headtrip\\" offered some truly trippy guitar work - not enough for repeated listens, though. They've got a decent sound. The singer's voice is great for a heavy band. The songs themselves just don't cut it. Tried hard to like this, but don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"If you *really* like this CD, then you have much more patience than I do. It sounds too much like wannabe-early-STP to me.

This album is nothing like the debut. Where the music should be hard, it is not, where Lajon should be wailing my ears off, I hear a melodic woman's voice. Sevendust has officially joined the group \\"I Was At the Top of My Game and Then I Went Bombastic and S**t\\", along with Korn, Metallica, and Megadeth.

I tell you this, unlike a lot of other band frontmen, Lajon Witherspoon can dish out some pretty good singing from his pipes. The band doesn't travel into new metal territory, but the outcome is still awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"I bought the first Sevendust CD after I listened to the song \\"black\\". That song rocks so much that I bought the CD and I couldn't wait for the next one. This CD is just as good! The awsome vocals merges with the kicking bass and guitar. There's something about Sevendust that I really like but I can't put my finger on it. Maybe because it sounds so different than some mindless hard-core. In addition to this the songs grow on you. Buy this stuff, pop it in and turn it up!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard Hitting in your face metal!","review":"This album is ten times better than their first release. Songs like \\"Home\\" \\"Bender\\" and the first single \\"Denial\\" are excellent. He doesn't rap alot, and there isn't alot of turntable action just kick @$$ metal. I gave it four stars because it doesn't really change throughout the cd which makes alot of the songs sound alike, but this is probably one of the better new metal bands out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Sophomore Effort","review":"I loved the first Sevendust album and couldn't wait for this album, especially after catching their blistering set at Woodstock this summer. Luckily, I was not disapppointed with this incredible album. Every song is extremely hard yet highly melodic. The title track, which opens the album , is unreal. I also love the track \\"Licking Cream\\", with Skin from Skunk Anansie. If you liked their first album at all, or are just looking for a great album to kick you in your a**, pick up \\"Home\\". You won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"You call this original?","review":"I bought this album hoping they would be as cool as Korn and Limp Bizkit, but Sevendust can't compare. Their guitar beats aren't original, the singing is horrible, and their sound is terrible.

It's really heavy, great deep rugged vocals, wicked hard guitars and bass, and jamming drums. Sevendust doesn't copy anyone. They are really original which is fairly hard to find these days.

A strong 4 1/2 star album!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Though I do like their self-titled album.....this one was the next step and what a big step it was. Very heavy and melodic. Great riffs and drumming. The vocals are so awesome.....these guys really grew into a tight unit. The songwriting is so much better.....it's amazing what in 2 years a band could sound like. I guess they are nu-metal.......but great original nu-metal. As far as Sevendust after this one.......well....they have gone down hill. But this one here is the benchmark album. You will be pleased!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great band","review":"Imagine a Nu-metal band that has some funk and soul mixed in with metal and you have Sevendust. This is one of my favorite hard rock bands. The music is enough to have this band standout but their vocalist truly sets them apart from most bands in the nu-metal genre since he can actually belt out some damn good notes much like (but doesn't sound like) Maynard from Tool and Mudvayne's front man. Standouts in a sea of ordinary."},{"rating":"2","title":"sweet second album","review":"This is the first sevendust album I got. After hearing waffle onthe radio I had to get this.

Every song is basically a main crunchy riff with slow vocals and screaming choruses. not much variation here."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Album is Fantastic!","review":"Having just got this, I have to say that it's one of the best albums I have ever heard. There just isn't a bad track on the entire thing. Get it now! NOWW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Do you like KoRn?","review":"If you do, then you will love Sevendust. KoRn started great, but then turned into noise and screaming, with no melody. Limp Bizkit has the melody and tunes, but it just ain't heavy enough. Enter Sevendust. Their songs are actually songs, and Lajon can sing better than Jon or Fred, and he screams better, too. The best tracks on this are Home, Denial, Headtrip, Waffle, Licking Cream, Feeling So, and Bender. This is one awesome 12 track CD (grasshopper isn't a song, it only lasts about ten seconds, and it is just Lajon talking). By the way, I have never heard the first CD, so that is most definately my next purchase. Gotta go, I'm listening to Home right now, and Denial just came on! Later!"},{"rating":"2","title":"hope it's as good...","review":"I have been a fan of Sevendust ever since i got their first CD.

Hope it's a good as the first one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This has to be one of the best Rock cd's out right now.

But buy this CD whenever you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has two really good songs.","review":"This album has two really good songs - Waffle and Licking Cream (with a good guest vocalist). Denial is not bad, but the yelling or screaming on almost every song is annoying as hell. I don't know why singers can't just stick to singing without the chanting/yelling that seems to be getting more and more popular. The two great songs almost make it worth buying, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than most, but....","review":"All I can say is thank god rock came back in the late 90's and brought these guys with it. While the record does have a lot of songs that have a similar sound it is a really good one. That makes me think they are maybe one or two albums away from a really amazing record if they utilize the considerable talent and willingness to collaborate that is evident on the album.

When I played the album I was surprised as they were actually really really good. A number of the songs sound very similar, which would be my only criticism, however 'Licking Cream' is one of the best songs ever written. Skins voice is beautiful and it has become one of my favourite songs. Other songs I like on the album are Denial, Home, Crumbled and Rumble Fish. Overall it's a really good album and I might look into buying the first one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special","review":"This album was alright. Sevendust is one of those bands I just can't get into for some reason. The only song that I liked was 'Licking Cream' which featured Skin from Skunk Anansie.

These guys are good...I just don't see anything original here."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic read","review":"I love anything fashion related.

I went into it knowing this was a business book but thought it could've been better. It might be ok for people who read the Wall Street Journal regularly (then again, if that's the case, you probably would know everything in the book anyway).

Here's a great option for you. The characters in this movie are overacting soap stars on the screen and in their real lives. Subplots are not limited to the on air drama either. I was most impressed with the stars ability to over-act like daytime soap stars but still show how good they truly are. Kevin Kline and Sally Field are amazing and Robert Downey Jr. plays my favorite character of his to date.Definitely worth a watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"five stars for laughs alone","review":"This film is not a gorgeous epic or an oscar-contender. It is a soap-opera spoof and the fun it has with the whole soap-opera genre is nothing short of hilarious. The writing, unlike that of soaps, is clever, and the comedy is subtle in places and then appropriately over the top.

I'd seen it when it was new, but completely forgot how funny it was - a case of art imitating life.The intrigue is on the set of a soap opera as female supporting leads vie for position and influence by trying to get rid of the star, despite her popularity.The ensemble cast is hilarious, the timing is just about right, and Terri Hatcher 15 years before Desperate Housewives is something to not be missed.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cute Family movie","review":"If your like me and are tired of the blood thirsty vampires, demon movies and nasty per vocative comedy and would like to take it old school. This is your movie. Even though it old, its still hilarious. And it may be a little a little conservative to some people if you are a straight Rated R person (No Judgment) but I personally like clean humor, because there's background to certain phrases they use and underhanded sly jokes kids wouldn't catch but adults bust a spleen. So if you have kids at the age of 10 (I'm 23 and not a parent) this would be a cute family movie to watch together."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product DVD","review":"I received this product.

This is but the tip of the iceberg in this incredible comedy about the soap opera world. Sally Field is without peer as the hapless diva. Kevin Kline is incredible as the has-been ex.

It's vulgarity is only surpassed by its sophistication.And what a phenomenal cast! Kevin Kline got his Oscar for \\"Wanda\\", but this movie is even stronger proof positive that comedy brings out his genius. See Sally Field do a Jack Nicholson and examine her own brain!

The film is set behind the scenes at The Sun Also Sets, a soap opera starring Sally Field that is suffering a ratings slump. To gain back ratings the creators bring back a dead star played by Kevin Kline, with whom Field and him where lovers. Whoopi Goldberg, and Cathy Moriarty steal away all the scene's they are in.

There are some good ones,like a color film clip where the Who perform live,but the many poor quality ones spoil it.For example,there is a poor live performance by Cream which has terrible sound and poor picture quality. There is a James Brown clip(filmed in B&W)where he is obviously miming on his own. Compare this to the Ed Sullivan DVDs where James Brown performs live with a huge band backing him and you can see that this is a very average collection of DVDs. I would recommend either the Ed Sullivan,Music Scene or Hullabaloo Music DVDs as they are much better quality than this mediocre set."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Rip Off !!!!","review":"40 or so minutes per disk of footage mainly taken from German TV.

With the Cardinals still playing ball in St. Louis, the storied if sometimes depressing history of the Browns is so often forgotten. In this title we get a glimpse of the 1944 season, when two neighboring teams that did not play in New York faced off for Baseball's ultimate prize. Of course, World War II had created manpower shortages among the better teams that allowed the lowly Browns to win their first and last pennant, but that is immaterial. Those who were unfortunate enough to call themselves Browns' fans got one season to remember before their team left for greener pastures in Baltimore, MD.

Few, especially in my country (USA) know anything about its origins or history. So many struggle with its apparent contradictory rules and baffling words. Why do we have words like through, though, and laugh which have a string of seemingly unimportant silent letters? Why is i come before e except after c a rule when there are so many exceptions? Why are double-negatives a \\"no-no\\" when other languages use them to emphasize the negative connotation? Why do some speakers have such trouble with syntax?

Flipper was about emotional pain and the torture of being alive in this world. I am angry that the live album set is not a cd that we can all pop in and experience the pain and sarcasm of all that was Flipper.

Force of idea, force of will, depth of feeling, and sense of humor produce music that takes you places way beyond what merely competent playing can achieve."},{"rating":"1","title":"A one-joke band","review":"Most of Flipper's schtick was based on the simple premise of playing slow in an era (hardcore) when punk bands were playing faster and faster. Which was funny in 1982 -- sort of. But it's not something to base an entire career upon, especially when a band has so little to say musically. \\"Ha Ha Ha\\" (a single not on this album) was a good song, a couple others (including two or three on here) OK and that's it. Sludgy, tuneless, and unmemorable. Oh, and yes, Kurt Cobain liked these guys, and this album was on a bunch of rock critic geek lists.

The music captures the dark side of the counterculture--it plays like a bad acid trip. Flipper creates a very disturbing, paranoid drone that really gets under your skin as it forces you take a look at the futility of life. If you aren't ready to make this journey, I wouldn't recommend Generic Flipper. If you are, brace yourself because it's a bumpy ride. I saw Flipper live once and the crowd quickly assumed Rolling Stones at Altamont mode--dazed, drunken, stoned and violent. It was one of the greatest rock shows I've ever attended--Sonic Youth are the Monkees by comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"Punk Does Not Get Much Better Than This!","review":"This is the ultimate middle finger to the generic, closed-minded hardcore that was rearing its ugly head at the time. Flipper were very clever at disguising the fact that they could write and play intelligent, clever music. On the surface it sounds like they are simpletons who can't play their instruments, but if you listen closer, you soon realize that the joke is on you, and everyone else. Ted Falconi's guitar playing, in particular, is inspired. You have to know what you are doing in order to sound that sloppy and atonal. If you want irony, this is it! Too bad Will Shatter took the \\"rock star\\" route to the afterlife by overdosing on Heroin. That's about the only cliche Flipper was ever guilty of."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's Flipper","review":"Well, what's to say, it's Flipper. You're either going to hate them or hate them.

Two as was stated by another reviewer the DVD itself seems at times to be spotty, I mean glitchy. Now don't get me wrong it works fine and all but still it acts up sometimes.

I first saw it in Japan, in Mandarin with Japanese subtitles. But I had no problem following exactly what was going on in every scene. The film is rich in Chinese folkore, yet bursting with special effects that are often splendidly cheesy. The actors fly through space on cables, hurling lightning bolts from their fingers and crossing swords in mid-air. But the love story between the bumbling but true hearted mortal and the beautiful but unearthly princess is the most memorable aspect. Unforgettable. (And so much better than the sequels!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dialog in Mandarin but songs in Cantonese","review":"My major complaint with the DVD version of \\"A Chinese Ghost Story\\" is that if you select the Mandarin language track, the songs remain in Cantonese.

There is a difference between being frugal and being a MISER! That is why they call it miser. Being Frugal is a state in which one is conscious of his/her expenses and gets the best quality that their money can buy, be it Target or Saks, because of the longterm investment.

There is also no explanation of how much you can save by implementing each idea--some people may not want to change their habits too save a few pennies, and others may be shocked at just how expensive cold cereal is compared to other options, for example. None of that is found in this book. The book also lacks any philosophy, ideology or principle (such as advocacy of living simply, rejection of consumerism, etc.) and therefore fails to inspire.

The arms are roomy and allow for full movement which I love. Its long enough to allow you to extend your arms over your head without the bottom coming half way up your stomach.

I verified this by going to a local store which carries a full line of the brand. This particular hoodie was not warm at all. It may be that this hoodie is specifically for excercising or that the looseness of the fit allowed too much cold tho come in.

I've also had to replace the keyboard batteries after less than 2 weeks of use. The keyboard loses communication with the computer occasionally. The only way to resync it is to remove the keyboard's batteries, wait a minute, and then reinstall the batteries. Only about 90 percent of your key presses are recognized, so you'll spend a lot of time using backspace to reenter lost characters. There is a slight delay between keyboard and computer too. Given those problems, when it works it works pretty well, but can be really frustrating, especially when you remember that you dropped almost $80 for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tepid music, tepid performances","review":"I'm sorry to have to say it, but this recording contains music that is undistinguished in performances that are competent only.

This book mentions the fact that mother and son could be in different states, but gives no useful advice as to how she can be of assistance in that regard. It also seemed that many of the scenarios and suggestions were not necessarily things that the mother of the groom would be responsible for. It seemed that according to this book she is involved in everything. It also made it sound as if every bride is a Bridezilla and that is certainly not the case in our wedding, nor is the mother of the bride disagreeable. I would pass on this one.

Not only does it have some of my old favorites \\"Near You\\", \\"Two Story House\\" but the cd ends with \\"Rollin In My Sweet Babies Arms\\".

I think the love/hate relationship they had over the years added to the \\"realness\\" of their songs.If you want a great album featuring two of country's original superstars, buy this one.

Johnny Horton was married to Billie Jean Williams, Hank, Sr.'s widowed wife. Just a few years earlier, he had lived in Alaska which may have inspired him to sing \\"When It's Springtime in Alaska (It's Forty Below\\") and the theme song to John Wayne's \\"North to Alaska\\" which I believe is his signature song. This CD recalls all those great songs of the 50s and 1960. Interestingly enough, the day after Johnny's fatal car accident November 4, 1960, John Wayne's old friend, character actor Ward Bond, died of a heart attack. This CD is recommended as it is an important tribute to the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Filled with Hope","review":"I read Arlene Romoff's book before deciding to have cochlear implant surgery.

The sound quality is excellent (although if you have a Treo 650, that phone has some volume issue - not a headset problem but a phone problem). This one is really easy to use and the button on it does so many different things depending on the mode you are in and how long you press it.

First, the build quality seems really cheap. The clip that goes behind the ear to actually hold the headset to your ear is flimsy plastic and seems like it would break off in a second. Second, the sound quality (indoors in a quiet place) is awful. Even with the volume turned all the way up, people were either saying that I sounded like I was in a barrel or that I needed to repeat myself. From the design, it appears that part of the sound quality problem comes from the fact that this headset is so small that the microphone ends up being too far away from your mouth to really pick up anything.Seems that the microphone would only be good for someone with a small head (like a teenager)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm glad I didn't pay for it...","review":"I bought this along with a T-Mobile RAZR and Amazon thoughtfully provided a code for use at check-out the made this headset free.

So if you're interesting in it, please make another selection. Hope this helps:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great","review":"Sound quality is lacking. I end up using a hand to push the earpiece closer to my ear so I can hear- not exactly hands free.

The design is nice looking, not to big, yet not to small, and the piece on your ear feels quite comfortable, it doesnt feel like its going to fall of, but it doesnt feel too tight at all. The cool blue light that blinks when on a call is more aesthetic than it is annoying, i would recommend this headset to anyone with a bluetooth phone, i've paired it with my 6600 (nokia) and ive also tried it on a v551 and a 6820 and the headset has worked beautifully. A great buy for anyone looking for a good reliable headset with exceptional call quality at a great price!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"I have used my bluetooth since Xmas, but wished it had more talk time..it's great to be able to drive, and not have to worry about holding a phone!

The clip which holds the headset to your ear is so loose that you have to hold it to your ear in order to hear anything if you are not in a very quiet environment.

At first it worked. After a while, however, I could listen to the other person, but the other person couldn't hear me for some odd reason!

It advertises that it fits on either ear, and it is really only designed for the right ear because the stick part does not rotate around the ear loop to accomodate the other side. Also, everyone you speak to while on this headset will get really frustrated because you sound like you are in a tunnel miles away.

The first and foremost issue is the echo everyone claimed to hear when I used the headset. Furthermore, if the headset was not perfectly directed to your mouth, people could not hear you.

Charging up to $80 for $.20 worth of plastic seems like a crime to me. This product is simply not suited to the everyday life that a Bluetooth accessory endures. It worked fairly poorly from purchase, with it's multi-function button being as finicky as a two year old child. Microphone quality is average. Ear speaker quality is below average. The range from base is quite over stated; at any more than 10 feet from the phone sound becomes very distorted. I have now owned the product for 3 months, and it has (gasp!) stopped working. I am amazed that it lasted this long. I believe that Bluetooth technology is a boon for the wireless nation. I think that it may even save lives. I also think that Motorola's entry into this world is an abject failure. A cheap, overpriced piece of garbage. For shame, Motorola.

The sound does not go high enough, and often the people I was talking to had trouble hearing me.After the first week or two, it would start automatically switching itself off, after and sometimes during a call.

All though I have noticed some static it is very mild and only when I am a considerable distance from my handset. I am able to use mine in the car and I can hear just fine, in fact I typically have the volume turned down a bit. I feel that the fit is secure, too much tighter and it would not be comfortable. Based on other reviews I guess that I must have the ear that the headset was designed around. I don't typically use it outside, but to those with problems with wind noise... even a regular phone is going to pick up wind noise. I love the voice dailing capabilities it works very well with my V710. Overall I am very happy and would definately purchase another if the need arose."},{"rating":"1","title":"useless!!!!","review":"1 star is generous!!

It has much better audio quality and even comes with more stuff for about the same price.And, you may not really *need* a wireless bluetooth headset because you can just use a wired one or use your speakerphone. But I admit that it's sort of cool to be totally wireless-you can put the phone in your pocket or purse and be totally unencumbered by wires, which feels a bit safer and freer, especially while driving or when you have to work with both hands and talk at the same time for example.A note about the battery-do not store this unit (or your phone) in a hot car!

While I've since seen alternate techniques that make creating faux bone or stones simpler, I've never seen an technique that does it more realistically than hers. I regret I've never had a chance to take one of her classes.In addition to the wonderful techniques for mimicking other materials, this book is inspirational. It showcases wonderful art or Hughes and a number of other talented artists. Exciting techniques, a wide variety of projects and beautiful photography combine to make this book remain one of my favorite books on polymer clay--and I now have quite a library of them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Puzzled","review":"I can't understand why this book has such rave reviews. This is the reason I purchased it but was very disappointed and sent it back. I think it is a waste of money and maybe my view is based upon the fact that there are so many good polymer clay books that followed this one. If I hadn't sampled these newer books maybe I would be like the other consumers here, giving it five stars. In all honesty, save your money for something better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Niiice","review":"It's been a while since I've bought a sleeping bag, so maybe all these fun extras are typical now-a-days, but they were new to me!This bag (besides being super warm and well thought out in terms of length and foot space, etc), has a little pocket for your glasses or ipod on the inside top of the bag. It also has a great hood that you can use to cover your whole head or to hold a pillow in place. The way its constructed means there are no cold zipper strips where air can get in when you're laying in the bag. More fun extras include a little thermometer on the zipper to tell you the outside tempurature, and a good stuff bag that's fairly easy to get the bag into. I'm very pleased with this purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"plastic parts are not good in quality","review":"Ive used this item for just few weeks and the rotating head part becomes sticky I send email twice to the seller but they dont give any response, I may consider it is really light in weight but not durable enough"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite design book","review":"I love creating my own designs and this has always been my favorite cross stitch sampler book.

We have two large dogs at home and I wanted to be able to keep them in a room while my daughter was having PT and then practicing on her own to walk. We were very concerned with them \\"loving\\" her too much and too close and knocking her down. The gate was a royal pain to install - actually messed up the 1st try. It was beautiful and matched the decor and kept the dogs out. Imagine our surprise when our Boxer mix figured out how to open it. Then 6 months down the road one of the PLASTIC pieces broke so now when you close it and then open it, it comes off the hinges. Why would they make a beautiful wooden gate and give it plastic hinges? I am now on a quest to locate a new gate to replace the $110 6 month old gate. Would not recommend anyone to buy this gate"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted Weekend","review":"First of all, I am not an engineer but am pretty savvy with instructions and installations. I have purchased several other gates and never had a problem.1. This gate is made of quality material but the hardware sent with it is crap.2. If you buy this, throw out the directions. They are COMPLETELY worthless.3. The gate latching system isn't easy to use and honestly hurts my finger as the day wears on. When my small baby arrives, I will have a hard time juggling him and my toddler while trying to open this gate. Not good.4. Your stair configuration must be PERFECT or this gate will not work. We were one of the lucky people that this DIDN'T work for. I opted to install it in our hallway versus sending the gate back. Honestly, I wish I had sent it back. It really doesn't serve my needs like I wanted since the stair option was out.5. If I could do this again, I would buy something else and forget about blocking my stairs (pressure mounted gate with foot pedal or something!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"low quality finish","review":"We didn't even get a chance to install this gate.

I just called evenflo and they are sending me the replacements hinge base... but will take over 2 weeks to get that. They claim that there haven't been too many problems...but I've read a few of this same thing happening on here.... well my son could've broke his neck or even worse. They really need to see why this is happening with these gates. The hinge base should not be made of plastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy if you have irregular walls or banisters","review":"Yes, the woodwork is lovely and I was very sad that I couldn't use these in our house, but what the description doesn't tell you is that it can only be mounted on a perfectly flat surface. So, if you have molding along the bottom of the wall or woodwork on the banister, you can't use it. The instructions even say you can't use it. I thought about buying a gate adapter to attach to my banister but it doesn't fix the wall problem. Yes, I could've drilled a piece of wood into the wall that was flush with the molding and then drilled the gate into it, but that is just silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother buying this gate, not safe.","review":"Please do not bother with this gate. I had mine for my 1st child, the hinge broke, but after 3 years, and he and friends were playing with it, so I thought nothing of it. Didn't need it anymore anyway. Now I have a 15 month old. I ordered replacement hardware after discovering that there was a recall. They sent me the LATCH hardware not the hinges. Re-ordered the hinges for $12. They broke after 1 week, and the lower screw heas was snapped right off. Ok... so I thought maybe I installed too tight, but nothing really explaines why the screw broke. Called them, orederd the hardware again, the credited me my $12, gee thanks. Started to re-install, and every screw I tried BROKE. I am NOT superwoman. This was completely unacceptable. The scres are now stuck in my bannister. I cannot re-install the gate at all, nor go I WANT to!I have filed a complaint with CPSC, they are doing a home study."},{"rating":"1","title":"Packaged too soon after staining","review":"This product is beautiful, but after 2 attempts to receive one without styrofoam attached to it - I gave up. You can tell as you take it out of the box that it was put packaged too soon after they stained it; therefore having styrofoam permanently on the rails. I even contacted Evenflo about this problem, but they didn't have a response. The gate is gorgeous though and I was sad to have to give up on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost a perfect match","review":"We bought this when we first built our house. Our house is all in red oak and is stained a very dark cherry color. This gate is dark enough to blend in with our current wood work. It isn't a perfect match for a cherry stained would, but close enough. We wanted something that wouldln't look plastic and cheap. We have actually had several visitors visit and ask if we had it custom made for our house. My son is now two and he still can't get it figured out to open it and it does its job.I would have given this a 5 star's but it is definately a DIY gate. It took my husband and dad about an hour and a half to put this together. I think that if it would have just been my husband the gate would probably have been put in the garbage because it is hard to put up. So before you buy be prepared for a difficult installation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gate is ok.","review":"First off, this product shipped from Target and they shipped the wrong color. Amazon handled the exchange well but it was an inconvenience. Second the installation instructions are not that clear. I had to use the spacers thinking that they should be directly across from one another. This is not the case as the latch catches are not on center, so when the gate is closed it is not parallel with the wall. Its not that noticable, but if you install it yourself, you are reminded of it every time you see it. The other thing is that I had to cut a board to mount the hinge side to my stair railing. The height of the gate is a lot shorter than a normal railing, so if you don't have square ballisters, plan on an additional piece you will need to make for a good installation. Overall the gate seems sturdy and my daughter loves to pull herslef up on it and look through especially if someone is on the otherside. I trust it, and I guess that is what is important."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated this gate","review":"This gate is nice in theory. I ordered it because it got so many good reviews. When I received it, I couldn't believe how heavy it is. It's very complicated to adjust and install. I also think this looks dated. Unless your home is early American or more country style decor, you probably won't like it. It's over kill for a safety gate and far too heavy to use at the top of the stairs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great looking product, matches natural oak well.","review":"Great looking product, really cheap screws, don't bother using them they will just break, use your own screws.

I half hoped Tyler would find someone less abrasive and leave her in the end. I found the short story at the end of the book much more enjoyable.

This is the first book I have read by Lori Foster, and the writing was well done. I enjoyed her writing, and I really enjoyed the passionate scenes between the two main characters. All in all, it is a decent book, but if you have read romance novels before then you should already know how the story goes. I would recommend this book to someone who has an afternoon to spare especially since it is only $0.86 on amazon for the Kindle book.

ENT is clearly the worst Star Trek series but however there are some good episodes in the first two seasons.It is the first season of ENT with Star Trek in the title but this season is a betrayal of Star Trek.

Most fascinating was watching Capt. Archer (Scott Bakula) evolve from the naive explorer to hard core warrior who willstop at nothing to achieve his mission however just as he is on the brink of losing his soul he retreats as the series comes to a finish. The cast is brilliant but Bakula's performance really stands out.It is truly sad that this series was cancelled as I totally enjoy the tying of lose ends between all Star Trek franchises and learning the origins of previous series episodes. Much Star Trek canon is validated in this series. I cannot recommend it highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Science Fiction. Great Story.","review":"Wow. Wow. What an incredible story! The entire Season 3 is good science fiction and good drama. Why wasn't it a blockbuster hit? Could have been the times...I quit watching television altogether as things started changing from the wildly prosperous and free exchange of ideas of the 1990's to the, well, let's just say \\"early 2000's\\". Too many science fiction fans like myself were too busy trying to save our jobs and survive the 2001-2008 disaster in the U.S. that tv was not a high priority.

It wasn't the best horror and suspense/sci fi collection but black writers haven't been showcased before. I thought Zane was out of place and just a way to get other fans into it. I figure Eric Jerome Dickey was the same thing for Voices from the Other Side but his story is very, very good. T Due, Banks and Chambers never disappoint, and the overall quality and depth of this collection is much better than Dark Dreams. I hope the third time will be a charm, and stand up there with anything Clive Barker, Stephen King & Co. come up with. This collection would make a great anthology on cable TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stories","review":"I thought most of the stories were very good. The story that I liked the most and very memorable to me because it was so funny was Smoked Butt by Brian Egeston.

That was the only way Mogami cables were available for many years. The problem is he represents them as the genuine article when, in fact, they are counterfeits.I contacted Mogami and they said, \\"Premium Audio Cables is not selling cables made by us.

I'm not a militant seperatist by any means, and this book left me feeling ill. I understand the need, especially for us women, to get in touch with the Goddess, but this book blames men and anything associated with them to be the sole problem with the world. As a straight women (who fully believes in equal rights for everyone, regardless of their sexual orientation) I felt that she was blaming me because I was \\"consorting with the enemy.\\"Some of her rituals and spells in this book are questionable ethically at best--I would really worry about someone picking up this book for their \\"introduction\\" into being a Witch (and this coming from a non-fluffy).

It might have been a bit much to take if I'd been younger or more impressionable. The author is uncompromising in her views, which are staunchly Feminist with a capital F, and very Dianic in her Pagan faith. There is a joke which goes \\"A good witch harms none, a better witch laughs at the good witch\\"...and Z is a better witch! If you are new to Witchcraft, take this book with a grain of salt; not all Pagans are this \\"in your face\\". However, this book contains a wealth of information, and is a far better resource than many of the \\"fluffy bunny\\" Pagan & New Age books out there.

If you are a fan of Warren Bennis, or one of the writers who regularly contribute to that publication, this is a good way to pick up some new material from your favored writer.

This includes information about the author, the city of Colossae, the church at Colossae, and the situations that were occurring there at the time. MacArthur also provides the same for Philemon.MacArthur's commentaries are mainly expository. Meaning, he takes scripture and explains it with other scripture. He does digress into other scripture or theological topics at times, but I believe he does this so anyone reading this commentary would be able to understand the other scriptural passages that he references.I would highly recommend The MacArthur New Testament Commentary Series to anyone looking for an in-depth Biblical explanation of Scripture."},{"rating":"1","title":"won't be trying any other studys like this one","review":"I won't be trying any other MacArthur studies after this one.

It slipped over my 10-month-olds head easily and fastened snuggly, although the straps attached to the buckles shown in the photo are tightened and held in place with velcro, which doesn't seem as secure. The major problem with this for us was that we were on a long overnight flight. Even though the vest isn't bulky, the buckles were placed so that they seemed uncomfortable when she was lying down in our laps. Also the loop that attaches to your seatbelt is on the back, so your child would have to be sitting up and facing forward for it to work. If you plan to shift your child from place to place, or have them lie down and sleep or nurse, I don't think it would work that well.

However, few of these stories deal with space travel, aliens, or the world of the far future. Some of them deal with the near future, some with an alternative universe, one, which is very fitting for the Spam age, a pseudo-alternative universe. With a uniquely Japanese sensibility to society, these stories are not only entertaining, but allow the reader with a view into present day Japanese culture.

Chuck Jones is similar to Walt Disney, he had his own crew of animation masters to create a whole new perspective of cartoon.One disappointing about this book is that its published date is 1997. Sadly \\"The Iron Giant\\" (released 1999) and \\"Cats Don't Dance\\" (1997) did not make it to the book; two of the most successful WB animated feature film.

They look so adorable, but alas, my feet have a bit of a high instep so the top put too much pressure on them. If the elastic 'V's were just a bit wider or deeper cut to provide more stretch, they would be perfect. But they don't stretch enough to not be pressing on the top of my foot, even wearing nylons or the thinnest socks. But there was plenty of room for my feet and toes width-wise, and the bottom was indeed padded for comfort.

He then follows a hummingbird on his migration south, and shows us the \\"dance\\" with which the male hummingbird seeks to attract a mate. Many other aspects of hummingbirds' lives are also portrayed. The book contains moments of both humor and suspense, and ultimately celebrates the beauty and resilience of these amazing creatures.The book's educational value is enhanced by a short but useful glossary.

It's a breathtaking love story between an interracial couple, whereas the lead male character is a young man from France who falls heed over heels in love with a very attractive black girl in the south in 1955. Although, the movie takes place in the south at that time, it wasn't to focus on the historical context of what would be happening at that time between an interracial couple, but to focus on true feelings between to people.

This has to be the most accessible text on the subject I have yet to see. The examples are simple, the language lacks complexity, and the logical order of text is commendable. For someone wanting to understand research methods that does not have the supporting background, this is a great primer text. What this text does better than others I've seen is that it does a nice job explaining the multitude of research designs available for researchers.The single weakness that I would attribute to this text is that it doesn't help the researcher pick which statistical tests to use for their particular research very well. With that said, it is obviously not intended to be a statistics book and does not go to the depth needed to complete doctoral level research by itself, but it is an excellent companion text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really, really needs a thorough editing.","review":"It's clear from the author's acknowledgements that he has a very hard time meeting his deadlines and it really shows -- it's obvious his publishers did not have enough time to edit this book!He will gloss over terms many new students may not be familiar with (variance) and define things that are obvious (e-mail survey). He veers from being cloyishly condescending (golly, doesn't \\"operationalization\\" have a lot of syllables!) to careening through complex calculations on reliability.His information in and of itself is valid, but frustratingly presented. Also, the dude is not nearly as funny as he thinks he is. He spends a lot of space making cutesy comments that could be better used to more fully explain concepts.Maybe future editions will be improved. These comments relate to the 2005 edition (which I believe is the first)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Epic? I don't think so...","review":"I don't understand all these people who are raving over ES Posthumus like they're amazing gods of music. Each track consists of literally a melody that is repeated throughout the song in almost the exact same way. It's as if they just copy and pasted the melodies, then threw in some different instruments, pretending that this justifies the length of each song. If they had shortened the song, the repetition would be minimized as a result, leading to a more interesting album. If I had to recommend this album to anyone, it would probably be to people who are just getting into the 'epic music' genre and are transitioning from hip-hop. For those who are long-time epic music fans, you have better options like Audiomachine, Two Steps From Hell, and Immediate Music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something else","review":"I was looking for a different type of music and decided to give this a listen.It is very intense and something I can enjoy for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"E.S.

It worked fine, it does what says it's supposed to do, wireless headset connectivity.It works, it does exactly what the box says with audio and data, but when using audio, it's a bit shoddy. The sound isn't clear like with my PDA, and the attachment gets in the way all the time.

And during the flight, we tried this on, but it only worked for the 10 minutes he was itting in our lap without moving. He was constantly moving between me and my wife or wanted his freedom and we ended up putting a blanket on the floor in front of us becuase there was no way he would stay within the 4 inches of flexibility this product offers.I am sure it would work in case of real turbulence, but only if your kid will stay in it through the flight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product !","review":"I wanted something that I could feel safe with my child on the plane.

Luckily we did not have that kind of turbulance on our flight but I felt secure that if we did my baby would be safe. The vest is very well constructed. I was initialy impressed with the way it is made. It is very soft. It did not bother my child to have it on at all. It also worked well as a short leash to keep my baby safe while standing in the airport. I would recomend this produt to any mom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not neccesary, you won't be able to use it on the plane.","review":"I bought this product in anticipation to our first flight with our infant son.

We brought our car seat with us and 2 out of the four connecting flights we were able to use it when there was a seat available. The other 2 times I just held him in my lap.The product clearly states on the packaging, that you are not allowed to use it during take offs and landings.

It fit him just fine (he weighs 22 lbs) and it will probably fit him next year too. I was worried about him being over-heated, but with a tee shirt under it, he was ok. The baby was not secured like he would be in a real seat belt, and it was almost silly to sit there with him attached to my seat belt by one little strap. But I kept telling myself that if anything bad happened, like the plan went into free fall or something, he would not go flying through the cabin because he was strapped to me.

It is basically just something for turbulence. The only way to fly safely is to have the child in a car seat and to strap it into a seat. There is no alternative.Never have your child in this for take-off and landing. Your weight could come down on the baby in forward impact. Their site implys that this product will be approved but that is not the case. They also claim that it meets some sort of FAA standard, which don't exist.A good baby carrier will do EXACTLY the same thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget it","review":"This flight vest is really pointless. The strap attaching the child to your seatbelt is so short (clearly for a reason) that you end up unsnapping it constantly to allow the child to shift positions. If your toddler is anything like mine, having them sit still for even 10 minutes would be a miracle. Even while sleeping, the child can only be in a limited amount of positions and tends to have difficulty getting comfortable in your arms.

This is Ms. Lash's final book and it is emotionally harrowing. She has exposed, and skillfully, the substance of not caring and its consequences down the generations. There is a terrible price to be paid. I found the story heartbreaking and the acts of alienation hard to forgive. Equally skillfully, Lash looks at what it means to love, the work of the imagination in loving and its power to heal. She is a writer driven by ideas but her work is specific and her people impossible to forget.

I figured a few things out about my psychology. Get fewer things. Throw more things away.

There were a few helpful suggestions if you truly have no idea how to get yourself out from under a mess of \\"things.\\" But this book does NOT go into the depth I'd hoped, providing any sort of insight into why things are overwhelming for the typical person (as in, one who is NOT a hoarder).

I blame myself for continuing to read it on the premise that \\"it can't stay this stupid throughout.\\" It did, at least until I gave up.This book is not about reconciling the dialectic between materialism and asceticism. It is not even about how to organize your possessions. It is a collection of trite observations along the lines of \\"Some Things seem to accumulate in piles.\\" Yep, that's as deep as it gets. Add to that some of the most sophomoric and even offensive propositions from the cesspool of pop psychology, such as a definition of autism as \\"staring at Things for a long time,\\" and you will have a clear understanding of this book without bothering to read it.

Instead of feeling a loss when I give away something I never use, I feel excited that someone else who can use it will have the pleasure of it.

There is no question that the \\"Grand Canyon Suite\\" is an attractive piece of music--definitely more \\"pop\\" than \\"Classical.\\" And, the performances on this CD are excellent. One could not ask for more! But, the rest of the music on this CD, especially the \\"Niagara Falls Suite,\\" is mediocre. The only exception is the \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" segment of the \\"Mississippi Suite.\\" It is great fun! Just keep in mind that this music is not really \\"Classical\\" in style.

They should be, and this version is a splendid (and inexpensive) way to own them. I bought the CD chiefly because I had heard of the \\"Mississippi\\" and wanted to find out what it was like. It is a fine piece of music, with much of the rolling expansiveness of the Big River captured in it. And the \\"Niagara Falls\\" ranges from Native motifs that will be familiar to all TV-Western buffs, to the Gershwinesque. Of course, there's no need to describe the centerpiece. I've always loved the kind of music that lifts you out of your seat, and all these pieces do.If this is a typical Naxos product, I'm sure I'll be adding a lot more of them to my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memories of a vacation!","review":"My brother went to the Grand Canyon by helicopter recently and I thought that this would bring back some nice memories for him.

The storyline pertaining to the bully and the crush are overly typical. The relationship between Alex and his brother is what could set this book apart from other young adult literature, but the portrayal of the main character leaves much to be desired.

Once he gets back to Poland, after many miseries, his luck will change and he will start to plan his revenge.There lies the 'equality or justice' of the story of 'White'. It is very funny to see the transformation of this man from a pitiable and abused person to a completely different one: socially and personally; intellectually and sexually. The transformation of this man parallels that of Poland itself from a bleak Soviet puppet nation to a member of the rich European Club, with all the possibilities involved.A Very enjoyable black comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ah..... huh??","review":"What the ----. \\"A tale of revenge\\"?

The warranty expired last month, and weeks later something failed in the zoom lense - it will no longer focus and makes an awful whirring noise when turned on an off.

This then produces blurry shots (I assume the lens is staying open to compensate for the low light) even if someone is just moving thier arm it most often comes out as a big blur. I also seem to notice an overall high level of noise in these situations, sometimes even with the flash. I don't think I'd be buying an HP camera again. If you plan on using it outdoors in the sun it may work great for you. I personally don't like the controls either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good Camera","review":"An awsome camera. The only bad thing about it is, it drains batteries very quickly when using the live view. Make sure to buy a more memory for it.

That is most likely because the pictures are so huge. Not a high quality image - disappointing.The HP 935 is surely not a professional camera. However, it is still fun, which is what I wanted. I think the Pentax lens is pretty good.But, read the other reviews. It is quicker and shorter to write what is good about this camera than it is to list the problems. I won't waste time with duplicated problems or PROs and CONs lists. If it's listed there, I had that problem too. The camera is FULL of problems - and I feel like I got ripped off. It if was my first digital camera, I would probably think it's great. I think that might be why so many people gave it 5 stars. If you compare it to other digital cameras, you'll see how poorly it compares. It's not a good camera, and doesn't deserve 4 or 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple to use, easy to share.","review":"First let me say I read all the poor reviews (mostly because of battery life) and I haven't had any of these problems myself. I am not sure if HP 935's had a defect which they have since fixed? Anyway, I acknowledge the problem, but have not expierenced it myself. I was able to take 70-100 pictures before charging my batterys.I bought the HP 935 just a few weeks ago and I love it. It is simple to use, but at the same time takes great pics! I also bought the docking bay and it makes it very easy to upload / print / edit pics.The only complaint I have is the fact that you can only take pictures in 1mp or 5mp. There is no way to take 2mp,3mp or 4mp pictures. That doesn't really bother me, but it is a small disadvantage.For the money this is a great buy.As far as accessorys go get some NiMH batterys, some extra SD cards, the camera dock and plenty of ink and photo paper!

It didn't. They were 1.5v lithiums,not rechargeable.It's a nice camera, but 2 1800 mah cells last about 20minutes, no matter what you do. These are good cells, butthis thing eats electricity like General Motors.Hard to believe that HP would produce such a thing. I'msticking with my 1-2 megapixels cameras.Then again, it might be defective.

I inherited the Bose center channel from a friend and have been looking to replace it for a long time. It's not a terrible speaker, it's just a lot of money for something that produces slightly average sound. You'll notice that people who were generous to this speaker claim that Bose is known for exceptional sound quality - but I challenge anyone to find an audiophile who would agree with that statement. Bose products are typically over-marketed and price fixed products built on technology straight out of the 70s. I strongly suggest anyone looking to purchase a home audio system turn to the web and do their research. For a lot less, you can get a lot more (e.g., Paradigm)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Center - A Bit Pricey","review":"I have an older set of the Bose cubes (plus the sub) for the front speakers of my surround system.

The sound is perfect for just about anyone who wants great home surround. I suppose that for the price ($200) there are probably some technically better speakers out there, but if you have Bose already and/or need/want a short center channel this is a great chioce. Voices really do sound better with a center channel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rangered","review":"There's a reason that Bose doesn't disclose the stats on their speakers. It's because they are very inefficient and basically only reproduce the middle range (in a muddy fashion). I sold my VCS-10 after 2 weeks and replaced it with a Klipsch..WHAT A DIFFERENCE!

It would be good for a very basic system. I have a pretty serious system and I had to cut the fronts down (Klipsch) to +5 and leave the center at +12 just to hear without issue.. It is not that it is not a good speaker - it sounds good - it just cannot keep up with my surround sound system. The delivery of it was fantastic - however I knew I was sending it back the same day. I have no problem with BOSE - just this speaker is showing its age - it has been around and not modified for around 10 years.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small, neat design, but very poor sound quality.","review":"I have a question for those people that rated this item with 5 stars: did it get 5 stars because sound came out of it when you hooked it up, or did you actually compare it to ANY other speakers?? Yes, it has a small, neat design, but it sounds bad. Try comparing this speaker before you buy and I guarantee you'll immediately see what I mean. The Bose VCS-10 sounds so much worse than even the cheapest ($50) bookshelf speaker you can pick up from any of your local stores. The center channel is such an important part of your surround-sound system - I wouldn't even use this in the $30 Kmart all-in-one surround-sound system.

In \\"Devil's Cub\\", a beloved son feels he must live up to his father's reputation, until he finds a woman who can match his mother's spirit. Then he truly understands what love is.

The hero, the Marquis of Vidal, is not so much a rakehell as a spoiled brat who kills duelling opponents in fits of temper and attempts to rape the heroine (who manages to protect her own virtue by shooting him, thus winning his admiration and love!) Many Heyer fans seem to find such plot lines irresistibly romantic; for myself, I find this book and its hero rather repugnant.

Once I started reading, I got hooked. It's not only romance, but a mixture of romance, suspense & most of al humour. I just loved her style of writing & the way she describes the people.

I have no problem slipping into this era but bare in mind that is exactly what you must do to appreciate these books. Going into them with 21st century ideas will simply make them seem outdated with the male characters looking harsh and egotistical and the females looking all damsel in distress.

My main criticism is that there is little reason for Mary, given the description of her character, to be in love with Vidal. The premise of the story was deeply flawed. It would have been different if he had been shown to have any redeeming qualities. The book would be much improved had there been some background on how his character became so selfish and indifferent to others along with examples of him showing glimpses of a good or interesting personality underneath the shallow and mean picture painted of his character.Also after reading These Old Shades, the prequel, I had hopes that Rupert's character, Vidal's uncle, might improve. Instead in this book he became unlikeable and unappealing. I could envision Rubert's character as originally written as the main character in this novel instead of Vidal.Some portions of this story reflected aspects of Georgette Heyer's stories that I enjoy.

The player has trouble loading DVD's, runs hot during playback and has a very annoying screen saver that kicks in automatically when the controls aren't touched for 10 seconds (this does NOT happen during playback). To its credit, the picture quality is similar to more expensive models but the sound output needs improvement.

Thumbs down..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD player","review":"This is a great DVD player for playing burned or bootlegged movies. However the remote could be better, the one I have crapped out on me after about a month. The remote still works but you have to be pretty close to the DVD player for it to work (I thought that the point of having remotes is so that you can be lazy and not have to get up if you want to fast forward or anything)."},{"rating":"2","title":"AD-1500, mixed experience","review":"I've had two of these so far and encountered a number of others, and my experience has been mixed. Their performance is great, they play anything thrown at them and I love the hackability of it, however it seems Apex got hit by the bad capacitor fiasco that plagued computer peripheral makers for several years. Every single one of these units has started acting up eventually and on every one the problem has been a single failed capacitor in the power supply. If you open it up you'll likely see it bulged at the top and possibly leaking. Now this is about a 50 cent part and it's not hard to change *but* most customers will likely have to find a technician to replace it as it requires soldering. So in the end, great player for me since I can fix them myself, but I hesitate to recommend them to non-technical customers unless they've been refurbished already since in my experience this capacitor *will* fail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I would like to say that I'm happy that the people that ordered this DVD player are happy with their purchase. However, I'm not. When playing my DVDs it pauses at 30 second intervals every so often.

The Apex was recommended by a friend for its ability to play MP3 and VCD movies. Both of these formats do not play on my Sony so it is nice to know I can watch VCD's that I press or my friend does. The DVD comes with all the features you will need for basic operation, it does have Dolby Digital Output so it can compete with the big boys. Yet if you are looking for 5.1 Decoding and Component Output look elsewhere. For less then $... this is the best DVD on the market, avoid the Oritron and other no names and stick with the Apex."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best deal After Much Research!","review":"I've waited a while and searched for the best deal on DVD players and this is it. I don't pay attention to name titles and have found that this DVD does it all. It plays DVD's, VCD's (nice and rare), CD's, CD-R's (nice), DC-RW's (nicer) and MP3's! Dolby Pro Logic is common in most players, but this one is Digitial and DTS/PCM ready. This is significant if you are going to expand your reciever and system in general. The sound from DTS is great, especially for \\"live\\" recordings. All the basic other features like slow-mo, fast-forward and stills are here. Also has multi-angles and captions and parental locking for those with kids. It is even compatible with PAL (if Region 1). Search no further!

The display indicated my choice, but the tray refused to open. Some mechanism within whined for a minute or two, until the player gave up.So now I get to return it.Granted, glitches happen. No manufacturer is perfect, and this may be an isolated incident.

I never got that far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap and plays anything","review":"Like other reviewers here, I could care less about anything other than playing a movie. I got this because it can play any format I've put in it. CDR, CDRW, DVD, VCD, SVCD, MP3 - you name it, this thing plays it. We've had this one a few months, but other APEX machines we have are over a year old and still going strong.

The price is certainly right, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good for rental dvd's","review":"Cheap player. Plays new dvd's fine, but freezes on the rental dvd's.

But, I read the reviews and decided to give it a shot; It seemed like a lot of people had dvd pictures that faded in & out. However, there were a lot of people (and the manual as well) who said that was because they weren't hooking it up directly into the TV. Well, I did hook it up directly into my TV and still got a picture that fades in & out and isn't really clear. Also, there is a clicking sound when a DVD is played, which is really annoying after awhile. I should've listened to my instincts and paid a little more for some quaility. The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars is because I like the size of it (very compact) and the size makes it a great bedroom DVD player...now if only it'd play the way it is supposed to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product","review":"Don't waste your money on this product.

And got my boss to order one. When the machines arrived, there was not a VCR in sight, just a DVD player. My boss still hasn't forgiven me.The biggest problem with this machine is the remote, which is erratic in its ability to control the machine. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes you press PAUSE and get VOLUME. If I had it to do over again, I'd pay more for a name brand. And for you folks who care about where things are made for political reasons, APEX machines are made in China."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brightness is a real issue","review":"My unit plays all disks and seems fine at first glance. But it has a seriously weird problem: when you play a rental dvd the picture appears very bright, as if overexposed. It does this only with rental dvds -- I have 3 or 4 bought at stores, and these play great. I haven't heard of others reporting this problem, so it doesn't seem frequent, but certainly it adds to the quality issues mentioned by others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy on the eyes, soft on the pocket book","review":"I bought the APEX 1500 on Valentine's Day and have been in DVD viewer heaven ever since.

I put the popcorn in the microwave and before it was done popping, I had the unit out of the box, set-up, connected, and was watching my first DVD movie before the popcorn was cooled.You know, until one matches a DVD player with a HDTV, one isn't getting the full \`visual value' of the DVD capability. So, until those HDTV prices drop, this unit's low, low price and great image delivery looks fantastic on my 27 inch, 12 year old, Toshiba television. .I watch only purchased or rented DVDs (about 2 or 3 per week) - I do not play MP3, CD, underground copies of movies and the like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"Apex Digital has only 90 day/ 1 year warranty, poor customer support, and incompetent service people.

They're fine right now, but I can imagine that if we had to disassemble and reassemble a few times due to moving that the little brackets would fail at some point. I'm sure they are easily replaced, but why not use a stronger part in the first place?A hint for assembly: those little brackets are not in the parts packet. They are already attached to the assembly where you screw into the speaker back.

Unfortunately, nowhere in the entire movie does an actual story line emerge, and the characters are completely obnoxius.

All of the buttons line up well so that it doesn't impede any use, except that the battery cover and compactflash card cover need to be finessed a bit when opening and closing. Also, the strap holders were a bit tight, but since you aren't going to keep doing that, it doesn't really matter.All in all, I wouldn't recommend spending the money on a digital slr unless you're going to protect it, and this product does the job well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it to protect your camera.","review":"I mainly use my XTi to shoot family gathers or when I go on trips.

Usually this means my camera will bump against a wall or something. Hiking it is good for too.Don't worry about the dust/dirt.

This is the story of an abused illiterate, mostly unskilled and uneducated woman, who goes to work as a housekeeper for a typical 1980s style wealthy family.The clever script makes you sympathize with the housekeeper, as she befriends a loony nut and goes off the deep end.The ending is one of the most shockingly brutal and upsetting I have ever seen.Rita Tushingham is perfect in this role and should be lauded for a great portrayal.The film is truly complex and definitely enthralling.

The game is attached to the head, with lights that shine into the eyes, producing a virual reality effect. The game is soothing and pleasurable, but causes a severe addiction to it, making the user play it constantly. The game is first given to Troi, who passes it along to others, they pass it on, etc, until everybody recieves the game from a person they trust. The game eventually takes over the ship, even after Wesley resists.

Also, the instructions say that you can only wear them for 40 minutes at a time because they can reduce your milk supply--not something you want to be doing during the first weeks when you're trying to get your milk supply up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves awful itchy spots on my breasts","review":"I was looking forward to collecting any let down breast milk. After wearing these shells for a night, the silicone shell left these itchy welts on my breasts that haven't gone away after 2 days. :(.

They were made in Switzerland and the silicone looks clear not yellow tinged."},{"rating":"2","title":"comfortable and gets the job done","review":"these are the best breast shells on the market - they can hold about 2 oz on each side. They come with both the ventilated cups and the nonventilated ones. I use the ones without the holes to prevent bending over and milk spilling. They are great for wearing around the house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome product!","review":"These shells work really well in early breastfeeding to occasionally protect sore nipples. They also work for increasing milk supply throughout the day without added pumping. I use them to collect milk on the opposite side during my nightly feedings, and have stored up a lot of milk that way. The only reason they got 4 stars is because they are kind of hard and sometimes feel kind of obvious under certain clothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"really really needed these! 4.5 stars!!","review":"I have purchased these breast shields twice, they are that good! the only reason i have it 4 of 5 starts is the cups with the ventilation holes, i tend to forget that when there is milk in the cup, i can't bend over, there by spilling milk in my bra and shirt. not a biggie, so just know that these shields will save your nipples from soreness and cracking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tried and failed","review":"I purchased these to attempt to use with my breast pump (Medela Freestyle) to ease the pain and to wear at night. Neither worked. The did not fit on the flanges and I lost a lot of milk when I attempted to use them with the pump. When I attempted to wear them to ease pain and collect breast milk, that also failed. The shape is weird (which means they cannot be worn without being very noticeable) and they seemed to leak no matter what I did. On top of that, they actually made me more sore. I would not recommend purchasing these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Itchy Shells","review":"They kind of worked but the soft backings made me itch and the little stoppers on the shells looked funny under shirts....

I bought these to collect milk as an alternative to using a bottle when I fed my son at night. I cannot use these on my one side because I leak more on that side and the shells would be too full and milk would start to overflow. Then, when I would go to take it out of my bra milk would spill out since they were so full. Also, If you don't sit up straight they will also leak milk. So, I have now gone back to using a bottle to collect excess milk."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not work for me!","review":"It made my breasts look funny, it made my nipples more irritable & it left painful marks on my breasts.

I had huge boobs when I nursed, I was a 42F. If you're smaller, they may work better, but for me, they wouldnt stay in place, and were not comforable to wear, nor did they work. Once the milk came in, they would slide down. Tell me how someone can hold baby to nurse in one hand, and for me, I had to hold my nipple down so my son wouldnt get his nose smooshed. AND hold this cup in place! Total waste for big boobies, get milkies instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"weird shape, not what I hoped","review":"I bought this for the leak side when I stay home, but the shape is weird, doesn't stay on breast very well. It's hard shell, not soft one that I hoped. when I put on with bra, feels hot; when took it off, the milk still spill out, lost the purpose.I will not recommend this, disposable pads works better."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are awesome!","review":"Within the first 10 minutes of having these on they collected half an ounce of breast milk. No more wet shirt and now I have additional breast milk to feed my baby/store. They are very obvious under my shirt so I wouldn't wear the in public, but they are perfect for around the house. They are very comfortable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"For the most part I am extremely pleased with avent products, which is probably why I was so disappointed in these breast shields. My mother gave me a pair of breast shields she used while nursing my sister 15 years ago and the avent breast shields did not even compare. They are only good for wearing while you are nursing and the rubber ring does not make the best seal to the plastic shield. You cannot move around very much while wearing the plastic shields that have holes for ventilation, which is a hinderance while taking care of baby. Since I leak throughout the day, these do not work too well for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"very patriotic","review":"I manage to view this film each and every July 4th holiday and finally, I set about finding the soundtrack and was able to do so.

We would also use it on vacation to inflate pool toys and air mattresses. When it was new it would hold a charge long enough to inflate low tires on a car ( all 4) five to six times between charges. In the last six months or so the unit will only inflate 3 to 4 low tires before needing another charge.

They flatten out when the dryer is cold and not running so when you start the dryer it makes an annoying thumping sound for a few minutes until it warms up.In my experience with LG Service techs, they tend to put bandaids on the problem rather then fixing the solution and replacing the rollers with a better material.The thumping noise doesn't seem to have any impact on the performance of the machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"fair dryer","review":"we bought this dryer 4 -5 years ago.

I would recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Intimate Look at The Sound of Music","review":"Charmian Carr received the opportunity of a lifetime when she was cast as Liesl in The Sound of Music. Her candid transparency in telling what it was like to be a part of making America's favorite movie (topping even Titanic!) is wonderfully refreshing. She brought one of the greatest stories on film down to earth with her enlightening account of what it was like to work with Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer, and the budding young stars who played her siblings, and yet thrills the reader with her entertaining \\"behind the scenes\\" anecdotes. She shares many letters and stories from fans, highlighting the resoundingly significant effect that the Sound of Music has had on people of all ages all over the world, and she brings the real von Trapp family to life as she tells about meeting them and summarizes the actual account of what REALLY happened to them in Austria. This is a wonderful companion to The Story of the Trapp Family Singers by Maria Augusta Trapp."},{"rating":"2","title":"For all who loved the film","review":"This book is for anyone who loves the movie, and it is especially meaningful to those of us who can narrate every single word by heart (and I know there are a lot of us out there! ) The author gives insight into all of the hard work that went into making the film, and how her life has changed because of it. I also liked all of the short anecdotes between each chapter from everyday people, sharing how The Sound of Music has touched their lives. It is a MUST READ for any fan of this beautiful movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even if you haven't seen the movie....","review":"OK, I confess! I'm probably one of the few people in the US who hasn't seen The Sound of Music (at least never beyond the first commercial when it's shown on TV). Being a perennial grouch, I've convinced myself that it's probably going to be tedious and corny. Nevertheless, I found this book delightful reading. My partner bought it for me when we were in Stowe, VT, on a hiking trip (they've got an entire Gift Shoppe there devoted to von Trapp stuff!), and I finished it pretty much in one sitting. Ms. Carr gives us a lot of insight into how movies are made; she sounds like an intelligent and perceptive person, and one who didn't get corrupted by her contact with Hollywood. Her account explains many of the reasons why people enjoy this movie.... maybe I'll give it another try next time it's on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Aimed at fans of the movie\\"The Sound Of Music\\"","review":"Thirty-five years have passed since Julie Andrews frolicked on an Austrian hillside to the Sound of Music.

Like many others I love the Sound of Music. This book is written with a positive spin on everything, so it seems a little contrived.

Sometimes even then it takes 2 or 3 times to get it connected. Rarely, it just disconnects for no reason while I'm talking. Both of these symptoms seem to go in waves -- they'll happen for a few days then it'll be fine. Doesn't seem to be related to battery life.

I wore it for a road trip and it got uncomfortable after 4 1/2 hours or so. I wish it could be a bit louder. but its definietely easier to hear than if I just use my iPaq to talk.

Its' small size and presumably few internal components is also detrimental to its' performance. I used it for a week. Every caller said I sounded as though I was talking as normal. They would hear an echo of their own voice however, delayed a fraction of a second, which they found very annoying. A short term fix is to lower your earpeice volume, and you can see the downsides of that. Well, when my girlfriend is not happy then I'm not happy, back it goes. Sorry, Motorola, nice try though. If irritated callers are not a problem for you, then this is a great product.

It's on my belt clip, and the phone tell me that the bluetooth headset is 30 ft away, signal is weak, and then disconnets. To me that's strange. It's also surprising that this happens randomly, so it's kinda annoying, b/c you can't anticipate it. Kinda annoying when driving, b/c you rely on the headset to work properly.

That is, if they could hear you at the time. Several times, the connection between my phone and the headset would drop and I would have to manually establish it again for it to work.The last straw was when I was almost two months into it. It ran out of power and I plugged it in to recharge (which is another minus point: why is the plug different than the phone?) and nothing happened.

This is the first record that Ogre does not use a vocoder or voice treatment and it confirmed what I have always believed, i.e., that he is a much better vocalist then he has ever been given credit for. This album does not sound like anything they had released before and I must say that it is one of the my favorite releases and I rank it right up there with the monumental 1992 release last rights and too dark park.

I have had this album since '96 and I still hear something new in it that I had never picked up. If you don't like electronic music because you think it is boring and monotonous, this will prove you wrong. This is a concept album. I can't even tell you which song is the best because they are all incredible and vital to the album.

The Iditarod was run to provide medicine for diptheria, not smallpox as is stated in the book. The dog museum is in Cinicinati, not in San Francisco. While this is corrected in the end of the book, it should have been correct all throught the book. The most grievous error though is that Doris and Richard were not provided a home within there village. A home in the village would be found for children in their circumstances. I feel this book should have been better researched."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I love all of Judy Garland's work and this early concept type of work I thought I would like better than I did.

Buy this amazing CD and support DG's efforts, please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just buy it - don't even think about it","review":"At last one of Judy's most exciting albums - concept album - has been released on CD. I have the original with the attached letter and the later album Capitol released. I would never part with any of Judy's albums, especially The Letter as it is so rare. To hear Judy laugh (she was a fantastic comic) and her way of phrasing a line - brilliant. Whenever I teach acting, I tell the students to listen to Judy. There was and there is no one better.The Letter still holds after all these years - and the combo of John Ireland and Judy is amazing. Great sound and includes the great art work on the cover - art work for which Capitol became known.I miss Judy terribly - The Letter captures for me some of the joy I remember."},{"rating":"2","title":"What happened to the women characters?","review":"As a fan of this long series, I would give this installment a higher rating than the one before it. But by now, how few women characters remain! Only Flora, after Mary the Terrorist is executed very early on. Either women aren't active in wartime (not true) or Turtledove's fans, being mostly male, won't notice the gradual disappearance of Sylvia, Anne et al."},{"rating":"1","title":"No surprises here, unfortunately.","review":"Wish I could like this book. I'm from south of the Mason-Dixon, and enjoyed the premise, an independent Confederacy, when Turtledove started out with it. But I hate Jake Featherstone, hate his party and state, and don't like the idea of Southerners being Nazis, much less how this series is going to turn out.If you know your World War II history, the ending is way too predictable. Turtledove seems on course to re-enact, in a couple more books, the entire squalid course of the Third Reich, complete with Dachaus, defeat and the end in the Fuhrerbunker. A twist would be nice, say a successful bomb plot, but no sign of one. Don't know if I'll keep buying these or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too 70's ish","review":"This is a fantastic series, and the Grappelli discs are a major reason why. All the earlier Grappelli discs in this series are excellent. This one, however, is too much a product of its time. The backup musicians are horrible and Stephane's playing suffers. It is interesting to compare this to the even later disc he did with Grisman, which is fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective on Arrival","review":"This unit was sold as \\"new\\" but when it arrived the box looked like it had been opened and taped shut.

I will never order from this supplier again."},{"rating":"1","title":"completely ineffective","review":"This product has done nothing to curb our pest issues in our backyard area. It does not seem to affect any above ground creature at all that I can tell. I looked out the window one evening to see a rat sitting about 2 inches away from it, completely unaffected. We still have squirrels, racoons, and mice. Though the blue jays don't seem too fond of the noise it produces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not effective in the long run","review":"I bought 3 of these for my mother's yard because she was having major problems with mole runs. When the repellers were first installed in early summer, it seemed that they might be working because mole activity decreased a lot. However, this was also when the wet weather ended and the hot, dry period started. Shortly after we got a fair amount of rain, the mole activity resumed. I think that the moles had just gone deeper underground when it was very hot and dry. The repellers are still beeping, so they have not broken, but they are ineffective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work for me","review":"Pros: Looks very well built, the plastic quality is good, battery compartment has rubber seal to provent water leak, so suitable for outdoor usage. The solar charges enough power to operate the device.Cons: Although, the device is running no problem, it does not work for pest repellance at all. I put is one feet under the tomato plant, the fruit was eaten the third day it was installed by chickmuk. Ok thinking maybe the tomoro is too delicious to resist for them. Move this near some plain plants, the next day, three plants were eaten to the root. Looks like it attract the animal come to here?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Still monitoring the performance","review":"I am surrounded by a forest and have a big problem with chipmunks tunneling under the cement floor of my garage and also into the footing drains of my house. Up until now we have used water traps very effectively but are a lot of work to keep up with and keep clean. Since using this product ( about a month ) we have seen a drop in activity with the chipmunks but they are still around. The directions say it takes a while to work most effectively so I am waiting and watching. Will update progress again in the near future.Update: 8/11/12I have changed my rating to a 1.

However, it only worked for 3 months, then quit. I contacted the company and they said the solar battery was probably not charging. They said if I would fax my receipt, they would send another one. I did so that very day;that was 6 weeks ago and I have not received a new product. You cannot get to the batteries to replace them yourself, I tried. Now when I call their customer service number, all I get is a busy signal.

At the time they were not running rampant in my yard. I have had the the two repellers installed for around a month. Since I have started using this product the moles have been attracted to them (as stated in the product guide). The only problem is they will not go away and keep coming back to my flower beds.Before spending money on this product, do your homework and research moles. They reportedly are more numerous when the ground is moist, which is what has happened this year. Traps and poisons can remedy the problem but they will still come back.This product did not work for me at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Effective","review":"The Sunforce 80001 operates as designed, emitting an intermittent combination of sound and vibration. Unfortunately the moles don't care. The unit has been in operation for about a month, and there are new mole tunnels with 15 feet of it.

My cats were having a hey day hunting the moles but my yard was on its way to virtual total destruction! I placed one pest repeller in the center of all the runs and have not had one new hill appear since then. It would appear that the moles have packed their bags!

Not a clue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that impressed","review":"One evening when I walked down to the lower back yard to see how our watermelons, cantaloupes, honeydews, pumpkins and bird nest gourds were doing, I was shocked and a little miffed that all but the pumpkin and gourds were nothing but stems...DARN THOSE GROUND HOGS!!! I came across this and thought that perhaps this would work...and too, I thought that I read in the instructions provided that it would deter rabbits, ground hogs and other rodents...well, no. I ended up purchasing a Havaheart trap and have trapped and released 3 ground hogs, 1 skunk (he was a little guy and cute!) and 1 oppossum and now my mellon patch is thriving...and those plants that were nibbled to just the stems...they've bounced back!

We have had these pest repellers in our lawn for over 2 years and I have yet to see any difference in the hungry pests digging patterns. I think they chuckle and use it as a beacon to know where in the garden are the tastier roots and bulbs.Maybe it works for some people because they have moles. I bet a lot of people don't even know what they have in their lawn - for months, my wife and I debated whether we had pocket gophers or voles. I know we have pocket gophers because we've captured and released over a dozen.These don't work. What works is the wash, catch and release program. My wife takes the hose, floods all of their tunnels and air holes. Sometimes it takes hours to get one to surface and doesn't always work. Once they surface, scoop them up in a bucket and take to a nearby national forest, open space or park.Also works to build garden boxes with tough wire mesh on the bottom.Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"complete waste of money.","review":"Like another poster mentioned, the mole actually seems to have an affinity for this junk.

What is wonderful about all of Goldstein's work is you can see how Jews have, for centuries, absorbed the recipes of the culture in which they live, adapting them for their own tastes and dietery requirements.

This time she is offered a fee to give a $25,000 cashier's check to a young man named Tony Gahan. The check for the fee bounces and Kinsey is now looking for the man who gave it to her, plus the young man she is to give the cashier's check to. Everything she finds out about her client is bad. He is a drunk, who has killed several people in a car wreck, and appears to be a bigamist. When he is found dead, Kinsey has plenty of suspects including survivors of the dead motorists and two angry wives. This book is written in Grafton's usual breezy style, and Kinsey becomes more independent and more likeable with each book. I would recommend the whole series to mystery-lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Grafton","review":"John Daggett, an alcoholic jailed for vehicular homicide hires Milhone to deliver a $25000 cashier's check to a relative of one of his victims then turns up dead. Re-reading it I realized I should have figured the murderer by page 200 but I didn't the first time.The atmosphere is dark - several children's deaths- but this also has some her greatest humor. Daggett married \\"but the warranty on his first wife hadn't expired.\\"The affair with Jonah is on again. Mike the likeable teenage drug dealer from B is for Burglat and Ron from the TipTop cab company have bit parts. Intersting parallels between the scuzzy LA apartment building where Daggett lived and the one on O is for Outlaw where her first husband lived."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's The Actual Killer Hiding Out?","review":"The client came to Kinsey Millhone with an easy job she thought-deliver $25,000 to a fifteen-year-old kid. A little odd, and Kinsey wasn't sure what to make of this thing. So she takes Alvin Limardo's retainer check anyhow. It turns out that his real name is not Alvin Limardo, but John Daggett. And the check of course, is as phony as he is. John Daggett has a record as long as your arm and a reputation for sleazy deals. But he wasn't just a deadbeat. By the time Kinsey caught up with him, he was a dead body-with a whole host of people who were delighted to see him dead. There was four in particular that REALLY wanted him dead. Kinsey knew his death was no suicide-it was a plan to kill John. But which one of the four did it? Kinsey must put her detective skills to work and find out someone's secret."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better and Better and Better......","review":"This is book 4 in the Kinsey Milhone Alphabet Mysteries and I am both glad and sad. Glad there is 22 more but sad there is only 22 more.Kinsey's new client doesn't last long. He appears in the first chapter but he makes a big impression. Somewhere along the lines of $25,000 worth! Kinsey is supposed to deliver the money to a young man but that proves pretty difficult because the young man doesn't want the money and a lot of other people do.I liked this one the best so far. The ending was an absolute stunner for me. I never saw it coming! (Doesn't that make for the best mysteries?) I really like the character of Kinsey. At first her demeanor was off putting--she's so emotionless and clinical and dry. Of course, those are also the qualities that make for such a good detective. Needless to say, I'm in this for the long haul and can't wait to see what Kinsey comes up with next."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST one yet !!","review":"Have read most of the series and this is the best one yet.

The best however were the Wise Woman series, of which The Bridge is the first. I was entranced from the beginning. A young princess saving the kingdom was already a \\"been-there-done-that\\" plot by the time I read it in the sixth grade, but the characters were well-developed, and, unlike some of Massi's other works, the religious overtones were extremely light, at least to twelve-year-old me. Although not the best in the trilogy, that goes to The Two Collars, it is by far a superior work of fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was the best book I have ever read.

Same title, different cover photo (scantily clad woman on a flying carpet,)'Legacy' label. Listen to all the samples here and ask yourself if there is anything you'd actually want to perform to - the sound quality just is not good enough for modern audio equipment. These are field recordings, mostly of ethnographic interest.On the other hand, if you want background music for a scene where Indiana Jones goes into a dive in some small Egyptian town, this may be just what you're looking for.Beware of compilations by Arc, Laserlight, Legacy, and any other label that lists performers only as \\"various.\\" Odds are good that you'll find the same old copyright-free tracks repackaged with a different dancer's photo on the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Figure out how to use this one.","review":"I'm pretty technical (OK, I'm a geek) but after nearly a year, I'm still tring to figure out how to use this phone.

I charged it up over a weekend while waiting for the phone company to connect our line and all I get while I am trying to talk to someone is a shrill buzzing noise. No matter where I walk to in our apartment it still is a loud obnoxious buzz. Also when talking to someone syllables and words are cut off even when scanning for another channel.

For example, the book references BountyQuest as a means of searching for prior art in patents, yet fails to realize that the BountyQuest website shut down in 2002 (remember, this edition of the book was (c) 2010). Also, I'm only 4 chapters in and I have already found some glaring spelling and editing errors in the book (\\"little\\" spelled \\"lilttle\\").The text of the book is well-written and easy to understand, but better editing and updating would have made me a much more satisfied purchaser.Update: Also found \\"Mastercard\\" spelled \\"Matercard.\\" Whoops..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is ok but kindle edition is pretty bad.","review":"The file is almost unreadable on my kindle because it will not aallow me to enlarge the font.

The romance was light and delightful without getting too detailed"},{"rating":"1","title":"I failed to see the 'Mystique.'","review":"I believe some of Amanda Quick's older works rank among the best in the genre. This selection, however, was tortuously dull. While I admire the attempt to give the story thematic symbolism, the constant references to 'lost Zamar' were only repetative. It was a mantra that inspired no emotional investment in this reader, but rather made finishing the book a chore. Turning each page was a duty, not entertainment. One of the strengths of previous stories has been the unorthodox nature of the heroines, but I found Imogen Waterstone to be distinctly unlikeable, thereby killing the sense of romance for me. I certainly didn't care whether such a rude, senseless character achieved a happy-ever-after. I intend to hold onto my copies of 'Rendezvous' and 'Surrender,' but 'Mystique' felt too much like my very own 'Rutledge Curse.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"I am disappointed","review":"I read all Amanda Quick's novels.

Amanda lost her touch here.I would not recommend her fans to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Quick Read Because You Can't Put it Down!","review":"This was probably the 2nd novel I've read by Amanda Quick and I did enjoy it immensely! The heroine 'Immodest Imogen' and the hero 'Cold Blooded Colchester' were both hoots in their own way. I found myself laughing out loud with both the dialog and the descriptive scenes that catapulted me into the room as a fly on the wall!I like the fact that neither were interested in impressing anyone in the 'ton'. They both, did it their way! It was a great matchup of two distinctly individual upper class folks!Great story - had trouble putting it down. Very enjoyable read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mischief - Nothing new for fans of Amanda Quick","review":"I've read and enjoyed all of Amanda Quick's previous books but wassadly disappointed in this one.

It's nonsense but it's literate nonsense. I am listening to it as an unabridged audiobook and it's very good at reminding me of what has just happened in case I'm half asleep, which I usually am. If I were just a bit more intelligent I might be able to ride a horse, phone my boyfriend and complete a sudoku puzzle without missing any of the story. As it is, my boyfriend will have to wait. Actually there are some delicious sex scenes in it which make the boyfriend redundant anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loyalty and love.","review":"Imogen Waterstone needed help to destroy the man she believed murdered her best friend, the man who participated in her social ruin. Who better than Matthias Marshall, Earl of Colchester, the man who discovered the lost island of Zamar? Imogen decides that Matthias is not the man of action she assumed he would be, that in fact, he is subject to nerves. No matter what his reputation or what others say about him, Imogen will not believe anything bad about Matthias. Bemused, Colchester finds his match in the strong-willed, unpredictable Imogen.The thing that most attracts me to Amanda Quick books are the strange and wonderful heroines. They discount anything bad about the hero and, ultimately, lead him like a dangerous panther on a leash. Then there is the witty repartee. Exquisite and delightfully humorous."},{"rating":"1","title":"this phone [stinks]!","review":"I'm writing this review to warn people not to buy this phone! I swear the one I got is possessed!

And I have it set on low (you can only set it to low, medium and high... nothing in between). After using the phone for about a month (I got good at holding it away from my ear), the calls now are too low to hear. The call intereupt noise is still painfully loud, but the voice on the other end of the line is almost too low to hear. Also, when I receive a call, about 1 in 4 times the handset doesn't pick up... instead it makes an awful screeching sound right in my ear... I absolutly despise this phone.

Left Eye is, to me, the BEST rapper of all time because she wrote songs with meaning. Before buying this cd I bought \\"Eye Legacy\\" (Left Eye's Posthumous album), but the reviews of \\"Supernova\\" were saying that it was way better than \\"Eye Legacy\\" and they were right. Don't get me wrong, \\"Eye Legacy\\" is a great cd too, but \\"Supernova\\" was Left Eye's own masterpiece. Buy it, it's worth it!R.I.P. Lisa \\"Left Eye\\" Lopes.

Even the single is just an ordinary song and it'S just nothing special. The only really good song is \\"A new star is born\\" (wich deals with the death of her father I think) It'S sad that she hadn't the chance to make another album because I know that she can do better what she proved on the tLC-album \\"Fainmail\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat disappointed.","review":"I bought this album a few months ago- didn't even know it existed until recently.

I hate to say it, but it was not that impressive. Tracks 1-4 were pretty much all I listened to, but this cd did not contain any hits.I think what I didn't like about it is that it sounds like she is at a poetry reading or something.

The set does have a small book with recipes, I was hoping for more recipes that are standard for this set. Extension cord is very short- need to be close to an outlet. I think I'll just keep trying. It's frustrating when you spend over $20 on cheese and it doesn't work out with company on the way over to your house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rival Fondue Pot","review":"I love this fondue pot, it's great for cheese and chocolate but also oil.

This electric pot makes fondue easier and lots more fun! I never have to worry about running out of gel fuel in the middle of eating. I don't have to wait 10 minutes for the boullion to boil. I don't have to melt the cheese in a pot on the stove before transferring it to the pot. It does it all, and it's amazingly easy to clean. This is a great product.

However, in 1998, two years or so after I saw this video, another tenor practically blew me away: Andrea Bocelli.I don't know about you, but Andrea, when I heard him, made the Three Tenors seem like the Three Stooges.

That fact that he could get through the concert is a testament unto his abilities. The Lamento di Federico is one of the most poignant renditions i've ever heard...even better than the Jussi Bjoerling version.I think the medley including \\"Maria\\" and \\"Memory\\" is a little corny, but I suppose if you want to hear an operatic and over-sung version of those songs, who better to hear sing them than the Three Tenors.That was a long winded version of \\"it's a great DVD, buy it.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Of course you've seen the Three Tenors","review":"Of course you've seen the Three Tenors before, but this is their best.

Robert Wagner is a bad actor, always has been, always will be. His Aleta, Janet Leigh is beautiful, graceful, and eager, but even she cannot arouse from our Sir Valiant more than his open-mouthed, handsome, vacant stare. James Mason, the consumate actor, must have wondered what he had done to deserve working with such amateurs. Still, as a child, I was enthralled and thrilled by the sets, costumes, and derring-go. It was just the wooden young man as Valiant that set my teeth on edge. I was much happier to curl on the couch and read my grandfather's original news paper Sunday comics collection of the Prince Valiant adventures, along with his passionate and adventurous family, instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"As a great fan of the Prince Valiant comic strip, I was eager tosee this film. If only the producers had spent as much on writers and research as they spent on locations and photography they might have had something other than camp.

I purchased the Black Shield of Falworth issed by Eureka and now that I've seen a second example of their product quality, I have to say that they have an excellent offering here and look forward to more titles.Here's the flaws: portions of the movie, particularly the opening titles suffer from \\"frame jitter\\" (the image moves horizontally slightly, but it is obvious). I also had image \\"sparkling\\" at the 1080p setting on my video cards, which disappeared at the lower 720p.Nothing is perfect but after seeing this, the old copies I have of this movie won't be watched. It is that superior."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prince Valiant","review":"A nostalgic trip for all those who have read the Harold Foster books. The film is reasonably true to the beginning of the Prince Valiant series .A young Robert Wagner is suitable in the lead role as the exiled Viking prince ably supported by the georgeous Janet Leigh and James Mason who portrays the Villainous Black Knight, Sir Brack.But it is Sterling Hayden as Sir Gawain , looking terribly uncomfortable in a wig that doesn't quite fit, who steals the show.A classic film that portrays the pageantry and beauty of mystical Camelot in Cinemascope but refreshingly does not focus on King Arthur. Instead it follows the adventures of Prince Valiant as he seeks to slay the Viking traitor Slygon and reclaim his father's throne.With an excellent musical score, this action packed movie is good value viewing for the whole family."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME KNIGHTS MOVIE","review":"This is a great movie for kids. We're strict about what we let our kids watch and this is one of the few movies that we did not have to worry about. There is sword fighting and a castle burning (boiling oil and all) but the overall story is excellent and very entertaining. Prince Valiant is a true good guy and true love and good prevail.

Especially if you're a filmmaker, it's good for your self-esteem.

Perfect movie for aspiring actors who want to know what not to have on their resume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not exactly Prince Valiant","review":"This adaptation of Harold Foster's fine comic strip is quite disappointing. While the film has high production values -- good costumes and sets and some engaging action -- the story is slow (and departs annoyingly and unnecessarily from the strip) and the actors preposterous. Robert Wagner is especially miscast in the lead role. He spends most of the movie scowling, or looking confused.

A youthful Robert Wagner wins the double whammy. He becomes a knight after killing King Arthur's treacherous enemy in single combat whilst also regaining the throne of Scandia for his family. The triumph of good over evil is personified by the victory of Christianity over paganism. What makes this film a \\"must\\" is the music of Franz Waxman who captures all the contrasting moods from humor to tragedy and from disaster to triumph.

One, because of Audrey Tautou, and two, if one looks at this as a Jewish genre film. If one has no interest in either, just pass on the film.As for Tautou, even if the film just had her searching for the best flavor of Jello, it would be worth watching. There just are some actors who have such a screen presence, one could even turn off the sound and enjoy them. Audrey qualifies. She is just so cute and quirky.As for a Jewish genre film, scholars do look for deeper reasons for the romantic attraction of Jews and non-Jews. This film takes a look at one such situation, and by doing so, makes one think deeper on the subject, if one is inclined to do so. As such, I do think the film shined, as it was interesting and entertaining to watch the couple's relationship unfold.I really can't argue with a lot of the criticisms of \\"God is Great, I'm Not\\". But, for the above two reasons, I really liked it."},{"rating":"1","title":"thumbs down","review":"I thought this was going to be an interesting movie. I've seen most of Audrey's movies and this one has to be the worse so far. It is pretty boring, slow moving, and the plots just doesn't grab you.

I have very small wrist and the length the bracelet was perfect for me, only a little loose with all of the links in. My wrist measures 6 1/2 inches. And seeing that I have small wrist it is difficult for me to find watches that do not swallow my wrist and have a decent sized face, and look more professional than feminine.

The book is full of wonderful images from so many different styles that the reader can begin to see that what is called realistic or representational has its own symbolic language and is full of its own abstractions and distortions of trying to represent aspects of our four dimensional world on a two dimensional surface.The book is full of paintings of all types and styles within this broad topic. There are also photographs of related sculpture and even photographs that are themselves the work of art.

Since he is has been collecting Elvis \\"stuff\\" for awhile, I was surprised he did not have it. HE LOVED IT ! Buy it if you are looking for a \\"different\\" type of Elvis book.

If that was the case, I could've went to my local store and picked-up the case for $5! This is definitely going back, talk about inflation :-|"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Flavor and another thumbs up!","review":"This is the second flavor from Izze I have tried. The first was the Clementine. Tasty and not syrupy I really enjoyed the flavor. I tried the Blackberry. Unlike the Clementine flavor the name of the drink also makes up one of the juices used to make the beverage, blackberry. Like the Clementine a cocktail of juices from concentrate are added like Apple Juice and Lemon Juice to give a balanced flavor.This is not a drink to hydrate in quantity so much as a tasty pick me up. The drink does not have caffeine or added sugars so I don't feel bad about drinking it. It isn't overly sweet so it adds a bit of energy rather then making me tired.90 calories for just over 8 ounces is starting to get up there for me. That is enough calories that I at least have to think about when I drink the beverage. A great drink, a good company and thumbs up in my book. The only issue I had is the calories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet and Healthy Soda","review":"*****This Izze Sparkling Blackberry Soda isn't exactly a soda and isn't a really a juice---it's a healthy alternative drink that's a bit of a combination of the two. It contains a lovely medley of healthy juices without sweeteners except for the actual juice concentrate. For fizz and refreshment it includes 30% sparkling water.The juices it contains are: white grape juice, apple juice, blackberry juice, and lemon and raspberry juice concentrates. It also contains sparkling water, citric acid, natural flavor, red grape juice concentrate for color, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), niacinimide, and pyridoxine hydrocholoride (vitamin B6). All of this together surprisingly tastes exactly like blackberries!Izze Blackberry is very sweet but light (not thick and syrupy). The adults in my household really like it and I think children would enjoy it too. There's really nothing not to like about this healthy juice or soda alternative beverage!Highly recommended.*****"},{"rating":"2","title":"Follow the Shakti and Float in the Divine Seas of Love","review":"Immediately upon listening to this remarkable CD I could feel the Shakti uncoil from my root chakra and begin swirling up my spine igniting each of my chakras en route to expanding my consciousness.

What strikes me about the chanting tradition is that it is the voice which is the primary instrument which must be the vehicle of this music. This CD has such a sophisticated sound mixing of the various instruments, and also highlights the instruments, to the point that the voice is simply part of the mix. I find the Vedic/Sanskrit chanting of Krishna Das, Wah, etc. to really put the voice out front even when a bunch of instruments are playing, and that allows the listener to key into the words (or more easily chant along), which strikes me as the point of chanting unless you just want it as some background music.This is not a bad album, but it just feels overproduced and a bit slick.

I thoroughly enjoy listening to the music - it's upbeat and catchy. I've played the CD while working and found myself humming along. If I ever see Bhagavan Das again it would be my pleasure to tell him Now has become of my favorite CDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do the Practice!","review":"Listening to Bhagavan Das' _Now_, you are invited to take up the practice of devotional singing.

I tried to fry fish, the thing kept shutting off, and I ended up with soggy, tasteless fish. I admitted defeat and started dipping the oil out and frying in my trusty fryer on the stove.

This CD exemplifies what the 1970's and folk/soul/R&B music were during that period. It also demonstrates the many talents of TC. From his acoustical guitar playing to his thought provoking lyrics.

You would think soul and folk are antithetical, but Callier's arrangements are like orchestrated folk, yet he sings like a soul singer. Play this a few times, and more secrets reveal themselves.

But Mr. Mcdermott needs to search beyond the notes to find a sense of life in each song. His interpretations are anything but inspired. Seldom does he move beyond the score to any sense of discovery of what separates the characters to which each of these songs belong. Instead, we get a litany of vibrato which, no thanks to the orchestrations, feels like musac without any kind of distinction between songs. What the album needed was a producer worth their salary helping to coach this fine vocalist into new explorations of these mostly over-recorded songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"gospel reggae","review":"If you never heard it - give this guy a listen, if you like reggae you will like PaPA San"},{"rating":"2","title":"Given as Gift....","review":"This book was given as gift to an architectural student that is in her first year, and is quite well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs other resources to be useful","review":"This book would be very difficult if you do not know someone who already speaks tagalog or have another book handy for translations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book for Beginners","review":"When I first got the book I thought it was basic Tagalog, but it wasn't.

This is what he will be best remembered and revered for - and to just quickly brush over this vital period of his career is really unforgivable. The author must have been just walking through the paycheck line in a hurry with this book. It reads like a college thesis in which the student just wanted a passing grade and really had no commitment or interest in his topic. Obviously the Hyer interview was easy to obtain and the author just sailed through with it and made it the bulk of his lazy research. Pretty sorry and poor stuff - what a disappointment for any movie fan who appreciates the classics!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It is Wallis","review":"Is it the author, is it the subject? Four of the five competent reviews so far seem to lean on the former.

The author reminds me of many older Americans who can't see that the world has changed greatly since the 1940's and that our younger generation has many redeeming characteristics."},{"rating":"1","title":"An exercise in weirdness, but little more than that","review":"Yo La Tengo fans should beware; this album is not exactly what they might expect.I give this 2 stars for a certain curiosity factor and for the kinda wacky lyrics, but in terms of music and production, this is a far cry from other Yo La Tengo albums. \\"Weak\\" sounds like an understatement.Even though the music is credited to YLT, this is much more of a Jad Fair album. Their musical talents hardly shine through as the production is a devil-may-care kind of lo-fi, the songs rarely extend beyond 2 minutes and seem mere fragmented vehicles to transport Fair's jumbled vocals. A major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"David Fair is a poor, poor songwriter","review":"Yo La Tengo's music here is lazy, but Jad Fair's decision to recite joke lyrics written by his brother David is what really kills this record. David's songs sound like they were written by a 12-year-old -- all obvious rhymes and stupid punchlines. It's ghastly."},{"rating":"1","title":"yo la tengo fans beware. . .","review":". . .jad fair's cutesy contrivances are so utterly unclever and outright annoying that they make this unlistenable. would the music stand alone as instrumentals (a la the infinitely superior 'genius + love')? i really can't say because i can't get past jad's pretensions (they're not even original; they were supposedly clipped from tabloid headlines). i saw this performed live and was so upset that i couldn't listen to any yo la tengo albums for weeks afterwards. however, if you're into jad, or think live introductions like \\"this is a song about a circus strongman who runs for pta president. it's called circus strongman runs for pta president'\\" are scintillating, then go for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with Coffee","review":"The store who sold this \\"AM COFFEE\\" was fabulous.

The items arrived intact and I looked like a kid on X-mas day. I opened the Vanguard VT-126 and extended it to test its features and on my first crank of the extension shaft...the crank stayed in my hand. Upon close examination, the shaft turned by the crank is made out of plastic, not metal. Hey designers, lose weight somewhere else, this part needs to be made out of metal or it will break, just a matter of time!I paid $60 for it, but I see lots of options on Amazon.com for less than that with more stars.Ohh, but if you decide you don't need to raise the tripod and looks are important to you, this tripod looks great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"it's a great tripod","review":"Just getting started with this tripod; did a ton of research and this one really seems to be the best built for the money.

It doesn't not remain just a simple reference of the XML grammar or specification, but provides a good overview of XML from the high-level, Manager's, viewpoint. Especially, Chapter5, Processes and People, Chapter6, Five XML Applications for Enterprise, and Chapter7, Five XML Applications for Vendors are the hearts of this book.

I can't compare this production to others, but the performances here contained the same passion and energy as those in the film. Patty Lupone, as usual, is first-rate. More important, this production makes us appreciate the vitality and eclecticism of Blitzstein's remarkable score, and makes us understand why he is credited with influencing Bernstein and Sondheim. The timelessness of the music allows us to overlook the somewhat dated nature of the material. As a bonus, this recording also gives us John Houseman's introduction, which provides some interesting tidbits about the world premiere that were not covered in the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"There are TWO different versions! 1 disc and 2 disc...","review":"I won't go into how much I like the product, but you should know that even though the product description and cover image refers to two discs, (the show is all on one and only John Houseman's intro on the other) you may get a version that does not have the Intro disc. The product number appears to be the same, so when you buy, especially from a merchant, just ask them in advance if they are selling a one or two disc version. Some may not even care about the intro disc. As for me, it was part of the description for the item I thought I was buying, so I don't think the single disc version should cost the same as the 2 disc set."},{"rating":"2","title":"One disc, not two. Intro missing.","review":"I purchased this CD recently through Amazon. The music and cast are excellent, bringing to life a theater legend that is very relevant to the times we live in today (2010).Unfortunately, this version is now one disc, not two, and John Houseman's 12 minute intro is not part of it anymore. I am disappointed as I was looking forward to hearing the story as recounted by somewhere who was a central character in the drama of the play's first performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blitzstein Revival","review":"I had wanted the 196? revival of this show starring Jerry Orbach which is not available on CD so I was glad to have one I did not have to worry about scratching it. However, it was my fault in that I really wanted the Orbach. This revival is somewhat lacking in the energy and the appreciation of the sarcasm of the earlier one. Perhaps someone who had not seen the earlier revival or the film about the infamous opening [and cloing] night of the original production would not know what was missing in this one but I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter love it!","review":"I had to purchase a used Ariel movie because I couldn't find a new one.

The most impressive quality of the movie has to be the music. Over half the soundtrack of the movie is a masterpiece (most of the rest is excellent), worthy of mention in any \\"top-100 of all time\\" music chart. Another great thing about this movie is that it has a big heart. There was obviously an unusual amount of love placed into the drawing, the acting of the characters, the voices, the colors, the photography, and the direction. If this is not the best animated feature ever made, it certainly is among the top 10 of all time. Well worth your money and time. A great gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arrived in Great Shape!","review":"Got this video in great shape. Wanted to expand my kid's video library without waiting for Disney to re-open their vault.

I love having it on DVD and the bonus features are extensive. I would normally rate this 5 stars, but I was a bit disappointed with the cover art. I'm a fan of hand-drawn animation. The cover is very obviously a computer generated version of characters. I wish the cover art matched the animation of the movie. Ariel just doesn't look right. Yes, I agree, this isn't a big deal...but it bugs me a little. However, I still am happy I purchased it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Little mermaid DVD Quality","review":"The sound is great (full-digital) and the video is crisp and clear. The extras on this DVD were extremly lacking. No extra audio or video selection (Widescreen or Standard) but the standard language selection! Also there was a slight video pause in chapter 17. Overall great DVD to add to the Disney collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful movie!","review":"I was upset to find that the Little Mermaid was no longer available in stores, so I was thrilled to find it here. While it may seem a little pricey for a kids DVD, my daughter loves it so much that it has already paid for itself. It's as wonderful of a movie as I remember from my childhood, with all the memorable songs. I'm glad that I got a chance to pass this movie on to my daughter. The colors seem brighter on the re-released version, but that may be because my tape was about 20 years old. A worthwhile addition to your collection, as it is a classic Disney movie the whole family can enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disney at its best !!!","review":"This is definitely one of the best animated movies of all time. After years of inactivity Walt Disney studios came back with this masterpiece. Everything on it is excellent; the lyrics for the songs are among the best. This movie combines cuteness and funny moments (BTW try to see Sebastian talking like Cuban in Spanish it is simply hilarious and much more fun than in English!). Definitely a MUST have for any collector. I simply love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Work Done","review":"This movie is all around a wonderful movie. The songs, the animation all of it is great. It is truly a classic that people of all ages will enjoy. All I have to do is put this in the DVD player and both of my children are quiet from beginning to end, they are 3 and 1 we know how hard it is to keep the attention of children this age. I will admit, I personally enjoy is as well. No doubt, this is a must have for any DVD collection, especially if you have small children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mermaid Manners","review":"The Little Mermaid has always been one of my favorite Disney movies. The night my oldest daughter turned three, we had a movie night and watched The Little Mermaid together for the first time. Athough she thoroughly enjoyed the movie, watching it through the eyes of a parent, I realized just how rebellious and disrespectful Ariel acts. So, enjoy the movie, but use it as a time to talk to your kiddos about personal values and morals and what you expect in your family!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but...","review":"If you love Little Mermaid, then buy it. Its great. The only thing which I can't figure out is where the bass went. The whole movie sounded flat. I know my 5.1 was working as when the disney dvd logo came up, I could hear the subwoofer working and even see the readout it was. In the actual movie, I couldnt hear any bass. led readout said SW was on, but no action indicated on the led readout. Btw, I loaded my Lion King. Sound was prefect.

It was only the second time I had been to the movies. I thought it was so good that I got it on VHS the following year.It's a tale that's great for young and old alike. It's also a movie that everyone has seen, at least in my circle of friends. The soundtrack is good, the animation is wonderfully done, and even a guy in the 18-21 range (myself included) can get a good laugh or two out of it.This is a film the current generation of teens will wind up passing on to their children ten years from now. Destined to go down next to Snow White and Bambi as a Disney masterpiece, Little Mermaid comes highly recommended for anyone with young children (or anyone who is either young at heart or has a sudden feeling of nostalgia)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The cost.","review":"The only thing I didn't like about this is the price. $50 is a little steep for a DVD, however my little girl wants nothing but this movie for Christmas so that's why I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disney Classic","review":"Love that I can watch one of my favorite childhood movies with my niece now.

I loved it when I was a kid, but now I see how bad it really is. Ariel is annoying, and an airhead. Just like everyone else has said, I find it ridiculous how she gave up everything just to be with a guy she saw from a distance. And Eric didn't know anything about her. He just saw a mute girl with a pretty face and just all of a sudden fell in love with her? Ridiculous. And I find how obsessed she is with Eric to be annoying and creepy. She was flirting with a statue of him for goodness sakes! Do yourself a favor and do not buy this movie for your daughters to be messed up like Ariel and make them feel they have to give up everything for a man. And FYI, in the Hans Christian Anderson story, she goes through excrutiating pain and risks her life just to be with the Prince. And in the end turns into sea foam b/c he does not marry her and she can't bring herself to kill him.

For the sake of completeness, though, I enjoy revisiting this film every once and a while.Technically, the re-release is much finer than its VHS counter-part. Additionally, even if you already own the VHS version of this film, you might want to pick up the DVD, too. Not only does the DVD have a few interesting bonuses, but DVDs have a much longer shelf life than VHSs, and more likely than not, your VHS version of this film is having some \\"tracking\\" problems.It's the same _Little Mermaid_ -- just a little better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disney does it again","review":"Believe it or not, this movie was a hit on my college campus 15 years ago and it's a hit now.

It just cannot be matched - Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea tried and failed - horribly! Disney did a wonderful job adapting this fairytale as well, the original Hans Christian Anderson story was a bit gruesome and... it had a terrible, NOT happily-ever-after ending! This story brings you excitement, fun, and touching scenes that are unforgettable (considering that this was made in the 1980's and I have seen this movie soooooo many times!). This movie is guaranteed satisfactory for all ages (yes, we teens like these \\"juvenile\\" films too!). Just listen to the beautiful songs, look at the nice animation, and LIVE the magic!

After being changed into a human, she falls in love with a prince and has three days to find the meaning of ture love otherwise she belongs to Ursula.

The Little Mermaid was originally a fairy tale penned by a Danish writer named Hans Christian Anderson, who wrote other fairy tales such as The Ugly Duckling, The Little Match Girl, The Red Shoes, and The Girl Who Troad On A Loaf. In the real little mermaid, Ariel dies. For she does not win the prince's heart and he marries another chick. But in this one, of course a beautiful female creature falls in love with a beautiful male creature, and of course marry at the end. God, this film should have made by someone else other than disney because if they stuck to the original story it would have at least been rated PG-13.

I guess I only find it fitting to write a kid's review, because all of the wonderful memories i have from it were when I was a kid. It simply is a stunning movie, regardless of being a disney classic.It chronicles the story of Ariel, a young mermaid who dreams of becoming a human to be with her love, Eric. However the only way she can be human is by sacrificing her voice to the evil sea witch ursula. She also has two sidekicks, the absolutely hilarious sebastion and the sweet, shy flounder. I found the story to be expertly crafted and entertaining for adults and children. After 16 years, I finally rented it again and it was as magical as it had always been. I can't wait until it is re-released in 2008 on DVD. It stands against such classics as the lion king, and beauty and the beast. All three of these movies have EXCELLENT music as well as wonderful characters, both comical and serious.

A young, spirited girl with a beautiful voice must ABANDON her IDENTITY (or the two most important parts of it: her identity as a mermaid and her precious voice) in order to get a man (a prince, of course). After a series of struggles this supposedly modern heroine triumphs how? By getting the guy and sailing off into the sunset, even though we've been told at the beginnin that she's only 16. My 2 year old daughter loves the images and the songs, so we'll watch it occasionally, but I wish Disney would make a few female characters that have more on their minds than giving up freedom for marriage.

Well upon opening this item the cardboard container was very grainy and dull and when the actual plastic contaner was opened the disc were chipped and scratched. It was obvious that this was a very poorly made copy and not an origanal NEW product as stated when I purchased it. I realize it has been over a year and there is nothing I can do about it but I did trust that this item was NEW so I wasnt concerned about it being FAKE. Anyway, VERY VERY unhappy with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD Skips","review":"The first time I watched the movie it skipped in a certain area. I thought it may be the DVD player.

The usual label was missing sealing the outside of the case and the usual Disney info from the inside of the case wss missing, including the Disney code for Disney bonus materials. Also the disc artwork looked different from our previous Little Mermaid DVD that got stuck in a DVD player. The video also gets stuck in the very beginning every time we play the movie and then jumps during the Kiss the Girl scene and then the audio doesn't match the video. I'm very disappointed that this was represented as new, sealed DVD and it was a copy. I didn't return it however because it is my daughter's favorite movie right now and I can't find it anywhere else. This is the second Disney DVD I have ordered through Amazon that has obviously been a fake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected.","review":"We recieved the DVD in a very timely matter, but when we actually opened the DVD, we knew immediately that there was something wrong with it.

We tried to get the movie to play on 3 different dvd players and could never get it to work. The bonus disc worked fine, but not the actual movie disc. I dont know much about bootleg movies, but if I was too guess, I would say this was one.

There are many good exercises given for the reader to explore further programming concepts. Some of the mini-projects that are discussed include pattern-matching, a library to deal with data in CSV format and program that uses a Markov chain algorithm to generate readable prose.One minor flaw in this book is that almost all of the examples are written in C, C++ or Java, whereas the title of the book suggests a more generic approach.I'd recommend this book without hesitation to someone who has been programming for 2 or 3 years and wants to really improve their productivity and add a level of professionalism to their coding and program design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!!","review":"This book is perfect for any computer engineer who wants to get more information about programming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably incorrectly priced by Amazon","review":"The back cover of the book says the price is US $25.

How can someone cover decently them all in just one 267 pages book? Once you finish each chapter remains the feeling that it was just a glimpse, far from a good explanation.It's certainly an above the average book. The authors know what they are talking about. But you would be much better served by the suplementary reading at the end of each chapter. At least, they sugest you the really good books.This is also an Unix biased book. Kernighan and Pike don't like interactive debuggers. And they don't care too much about user interface.

The liquid did not stay inside the pot when I tried it so I would say not to buy it if you make liquid necessary dishes. Then the lid has a tendency to lift off the crock and hot liquid pops out. Be careful for adults and keep this far from even older children if you notice this! I would never leave this unattended nor use it overnight because it clanks while cooking.

Plus, I made a pot roast in it and, even after washing it, see some slight stains probably from the wine I used. The little dipper is a nice addition but it takes too long to warm up stuff and when it finally does, it gets way too hot and you have to constantly unplug it.

If Nora Roberts is the author, then the answer is always \\"PLENTY\\"! Eve hand picks a young female biographer to help write the book and unwittingly endangers all of the people involved.GENUINE LIES touches on the Hollywood lifestyle, the glitzy lifestyle of Beverly Hills, what some people will do to keep secrets unknown, betrayal and of course romance.This was one of the first times Nora Roberts crossed the genre line from romance to mystery and does a very decent job of it. She excels in this quest in her later more recent books, but this one could be given a grade of B.As with most of her novels, Roberts throws in the unexpected and leaves the readers wanting more when they've finished reading the last page of GENUINE LIES!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Nora Roberts book I have read so far...","review":"This book was really good.

I'd put it down and it'd take me a week or two to get back to it. The story was drawn out too long and I couldn't warm up to any of the characters, even those that were supposed to be the protagonists. Eve Benedict was a manipulative user and not someone I could care about. (But then that's my opinion of most Hollywood types, past and present.) The climax of this story seemed foolish and I was hoping for a different twist on \\"whodunnit\\". Oh well...

This isn't her best by any means, but even Nora not at her best gives us entertaining, page-turning reading, and that's what this is. No, Julia's not the most sympathetic character in the world -- she comes off as ungrateful and just plain cruel sometimes -- but those very characteristics added some realism to what could have been a very one-dimensional character. Sure, Eve was a manipulative \\"Hollywood type\\", but aren't those the most fun? Not as easy to guess \\"whodunit\\" as in some of her other books, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This was the Nora Roberts book that I would not recommand to anyone. The story was very well thought out and written but for some reason during the course of the novel I started to really dislike Julia. I find her arrogant, ungreatful, stuck up, spoiled, and pathetic. And it's very hard for me to believe that someone like Paul could actually enjoy her company. I think because of this I couldn't bring myself to finish the book (it's still sitting on my book shelf unfinished) I really didn't like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"This is so far one of the most boring Nora Roberts books, ever. It was OK but it seriously was a PUSH to get through it, and usually I simply just fly through her novels. The characters are very flat and uninvolved. I was able to guess whodunit way before the act was even done, as well as guess some of the plot twists. The book was fun for the trip to Hollywood-land but besides that it was a LONG book (528 pages) that really would have been better off slimmed down. Lots ado about nothing which leads to boring repeat events and pointless happenings that in the end you discover served no purpose at all to the story.If you are a NR fan, you may like it but I suggest perhaps finding another novel to read first and borrow this one from a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious","review":"I devoured this book in one setting. It's suspenseful and engaging, as you find out all kinds of tidbits from a Hollywood star's life. Picture being able to follow Joan Crawford or Bette Davis around, finding out all the secrets they hold about Hollywood actresses, writers and dirctors, their kinky habits and glamourous lives. That's what Nora Roberts does in this novel -- she creates that world for you.My only gripe with the novel (and reason it gets 4 instead of 5 stars) is that I was able to predict the killer, and I'm not fond of how the book ended. Still, the romance was lovely (as expected from any Roberts book) and the Hollywood backround fabulous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"This book is too long and too melodramatic. I also take issue with the theories put forth. For example, the notion that a woman who has an affair with a married man is justified..even glorified...because it's 'love'. Tawdry behavior and lousy morals espoused in silly dialog do not make for a good book. If you're going to digest low morals, irresponsibility and so forth, at least do yourself the favor of reading it in a witty , intelligent, and sophisticated context."},{"rating":"2","title":"NIA is Life Changing","review":"NIA is \\"the\\" most extraordinary type of movement & exercise I have ever experienced!!!!!

All of the authors are world class, but with occasional exception the stories are not so well-known. My favorite effort was Doris Lessing's Homage for Isaac Babel, so I was disappointed to find that the actual Isaac Babel story in the collection--The Death of Dolgushov--didn't do much for me.

I want stories with a beginning, a middle and an end. Just because these are ultra short, doesn't mean you have to give those up.

I love good indie films, but with \\"Gerald,\\" the acting and writing seemed to match the film's low budget. The main premise of the movie required greater than normal suspension of disbelief; that's fine, but pulling that off requires top-notch writing and acting. I didn't think the man who played Gerald was believable as a mentaly impaired man, as his acting was 100% evident at all times and seemed to draw upon nothing but cliches and stereotypes (no Rain Man here, not even close). The characters of the lush and the transvestite were so cartoonish and one-note that they both seemed to have escaped a mid '90s Saturday Night Live skit.

Upon contacting Rival it was my fault; so I then explained in detail how it burns everything, even using their OWN recipes; should not be left alone while at work, etc. They sent me a condesending letter about how it meets all the federal regulations and labels. One thing they pointed out that I was unaware of - High on their cooker is 350 degrees. I don't know what kind of cooks they have working there but 350 degrees is a regular oven temperature NOT SLOW COOKING!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I got a good one","review":"I received this from Rival as a replacement for a smartpot that had the handle fall off of the lid on the first use. I was skeptical but gave this one a try. So far it seems to be OK--I have cooked some of my favorites in it and they have not burned, although the cooker did test a little hot when I tested it. It is very attractive to look at. I also like the countdown timer better than the old smartpots. Thank you Rival for making it right; I got a better, more expensive model that seems to be working well. Not only did Rival make it right, but they did so in record time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love my crockpot","review":"I love this crockpot. I broke my old one and asked my family member for one for Christmas. I would of not went for the extra bells and whistles, but I am glad they did! I love how while I am at work it turns to keep warm after I program it. I also LOVE how you can prop up the lid, great for parties when you don't know what to do with that lid (when you are getting out your meatballs)! I also love the carrying case it came with, better than my last model's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too Hot!","review":"Like others have said, this cooker is MUCH too hot. My model has a low setting, but even after an hour or two the food was boiling. Even after the appliance switches to \\"warm\\" the food continues to simmer rapidly. I've made several dishes in this thing, from stuffed chicken to beef stew, and only one recipe came out decent (corned beef). I plan to replace this one for a smaller unit. Even 2/3 full, which is A LOT of food - even for leftovers - everything burns and has an off flavor. The final straw came when I used the Duet insert to make oatmeal. I woke up to a sticky, brown, burnt, gooey blob. I've had it with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate it","review":"My reasons are similar to everyone elses. Even when 2/3 full this thing will boil your dinner. What good is thr programmable feature if all the settings are just too hot? Definitely do not leave home when this thing is on as it is like playing russian roulette as to when it will burn the food."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Hot","review":"The heat setting on the Rival seems to be a lot higher than other models I've used.

I'm very unhappy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Experience","review":"I must have gotten a lemon.

Lid doesn't fit right, steam escapes, uneven heat....terrible. I don't think Rival knows how to make 'programable' crockpots. My old 7 year old Rival is the only Rival that worked right. Low meant low."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy-Too HOT even on low with lid open on LOW","review":"I bought two of these hoping that the first one was just defective. I have an older Rival 4 qt. model but wanted a larger one that I could double the recipes with for parties and liked the stainless steel to match my kitchen. It cooks too hot even with the lid OPEN on LOW. Just keeps boiling. Taking it back - the old Rival with simple low/high setting works...these have great potential but are a disaster. I was making a special dish at night for an upcoming party the next day on LOW (which the old one does fine with). Fortunately I woke up in the middle of the night (wish I woke up one hour earlier) and saw the food boiling rapidly, sticking on one side. Would have been a nice crock pot with the supposed features that don't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"It boils, not slow cooks","review":"You have to watch this crock pot closely or it will start to boil your food, even on the LOW setting! It does not slow cook, and recipes that require 6-8 hours of heat are done in under 4 hours. Not a good product if you want to be able to add your ingredients and actually leave the house. This slow cooker is a piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cooker From He__!!","review":"Wish I had seen the reviews before purchasing this insane appliance. Nothing \\"slow\\" about it-- burns everything, even on the Keep Warm setting. Best you can get out of it is 4 hours before you absolutely have to return home and shut it off. If not, your evening meal is small burnt pieces of food welded to the bottom of the pot. I swear, this thing is possessed! My old Rival Crock Pot was the best appliance I ever purchased, this one is the WORST!"},{"rating":"1","title":"looks good, cooks bad","review":"I recieved this crock pot as a gift. I liked the oval shape and the chrome exterior -- nicer than my old round crock pot that wouldn't hold a roast and looked so old. HOWEVER, the performance of the new pot was horrible and I returned it. It cooks too hot even on the low setting (and yes, I did put an adequate amount of food in it). The lid seems like it fits, but the steam that built up during cooking rattled the lid loose and dripped water down the side of the unit onto the counter.To me, the whole benefit of a slow-cooker is being able to leave it unattended while it cooks (SLOWLY and safely) all day. Don't even think about it with this model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous Lid Design","review":"The lid on this crock pot is not designed with enough weight to keep the pressure in the pot. As this crock pot begins to build up heat, the lid begins to jump. As time progresses, and condensation begins to accumulate inside the lid and pot, hot water is splashed out of the pot with each jump of the lid. The first time I used this new crock pot, I returned home to find my cabinet top standing in water and the lid still jumping. I have since stayed home when I use the pot in order to try different settings but have experienced the same problem regardless of which setting I choose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beckwith and Native Vibe Hit a Home Run","review":"I have listened to a great many albums in my day but there are none better than the joint project of Jim Beckwith and Native Vibe.

The plot in this book is that Anakin must protect Padme while Obi-Wan looks for the Assasin thats trying to kill Padme. Then a war brakes out between Dooku's CIS droids and the Republic's Clones. The main conflict is that Anakin's mom dies and he gets so angry that he starts turning to the dark side. Anakin and Padme get married in secrecy.

Then the \\"prequels\\" emerged, and I happened to get my hands on this book a few weeks before the movie was released (just casually browsing through a bookstore). I sat down in the bookstore and read the whole thing.Ok, besides blowing a morning doing this, reading Episode II and the supporting novels written \\"around the time period\\" have greatly increased my appreciation of the Star Wars universe. The politics, motivations, relationships, and history go far beyond what can be depicted in a two hour movie. Or even three two hour movies.This book is well-written, interesting, and I believe it will motivate many people to seek out more information before the third movie comes out.The book to Episode III will be out in April (the movie will be released in May). I totally plan on reading it. I hope it's as good (if not better) than Episode II."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much more depth than the movie","review":"I really enjoyed this book, despite having seen the movie a few times already. The book provided a lot more information that there was in the movie.There was a lot more depth to both the plot and the characters, including a look at Shmi's life with the Lars family and her abduction by the Tusken Raiders, and the failed attempts to rescue her, also the love story between Annakin and Padme is developed much better so it actually seems they have a real basis for their feelings for each other. We also get to meet Padme's family and are able to see her much more as a person than just a political figure.These and a few others are the reasons to read the book. Everything else follows pretty directly with the movie, but there is enough extra information in the story to make the book well worth reading for Star Wars fans. I look foward to Episode III, both the book and movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"book review for school","review":"i really enjoy star wars movies and i also really enjoyed reading this book. i believe it is very informative and tells the story with a great cliffhanging ending. i have read the 1st star wars book(phantom menace) and this is my second adn i though it was a good follow-up. there are so many things that are in this book that are not in the movie, so i recomend seeing the movie then reading the book to fill in any blanks you may have. well i hope i get a good grade on this, and i also hope this review was helpful to anyone who read it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pay Attention NJO Boys and Girls!","review":"Ok, I want all of the authors of the New Jedi Order books to pay attention to how it is done. George and Salvatore are trying to show you what the star wars universe is about (new or old). You provide the readers with a variety of reading goals. You provide a love story for the fans who enjoy a good romance, action for the glory buffs, suspense for the mystery lovers, and comedy for the humorous fans. Blended together, you have a star wars novel for everyone. Yes, there is death, yes, there is tragedy, but it is all explained and detailed in a way to satisfy all of the readers (happy or unhappy with the circumstances).This novel brought it back to the way the star wars universe should be. The heros have struggles and failures and the villians have triumphs and successes, but not to the definitive extent...save a little for the next guy to pick up on..."},{"rating":"2","title":"great addition to the Star Wars Saga","review":"This novel is an excellent addition to the saga. By a novel's very nature, it is superior to movies. The extra details about Shmi Skywalker Lars' life since the events of the Phantom Menace were beautifully written. Its good that Salvatore was allowed to go into all the details about Anakin killing the Tusken Raiders in his revenge massacre. The novel is also able to go into more detail about the character's points of view. I'm glad Jar Jar was only in a small role compared to the Phantom Menace. Although Jango Fett is one of the bad guys, he at least genuinely loves his clone Boba as though Boba were his natural son. I highly recommend the novelization to anyone who's seen the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Episode II fleshes out the movie","review":"I just finished this book last night, and I really enjoyed it. Salvatore is a suberb action writer, but balances action with character development very well. If you've seen the movie, great, but now you should read the book. There are scenes in the novel not shown in the movie which flesh out the relationship between Padme and Anakin, and also the relationship with Jango Fett and Boba. I recommend this book to any Star Wars fan, or anyone who enjoyed the film and wants to read the deeper story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best SW book ever!","review":"WOW! BRAVO!I actually read this book before i saw the movie, so i was hoping that the movie would be as good as the book, but it wasn't. In the book, the romance seemed in perfect pace, as in the movie, one minute Padme is in her apartment blushing by Anakins' statement, \\"So have you, grown more beautiful i mean.\\" and the next minute their making out by the balcony. In the book, you can get inside their heads as Padme considers and argues mentally over Anakin and the family scene in the book, \\"Short and Sweet!\\"The movie does give little hints here and there, but the book realy captures the deep and dark demons, adn the actions and events that mirror what is soon to come abot Anakin. I loved the descriptions, every part of it was wonderful, except maybe the beggining with the Lars Homestead, i didnt like that part, not at all Salvatores' fualt though, it was just the certain scene i didnt like, it was very dull, and seemed superfluous, and unneeded."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as the movie","review":"I watched the movie and realy liked so I picked up the attack of the clones and totally fell for it's fun action packed book.They described the romance between padma and anakin so well plus I really enjoyed the characters of Jango and Bobba fett.

While I enjoyed the movie the book was at least as good if not better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost a great book","review":"This book was almost great. The problem begins when Anakin and Padme visit Padme's parents and lasts until they depart for Tatooine. I believe it was 2 chapters or so. That part of the book is PURE MISERY, and totally out of place. I mean, the book ROCKS up to that point ... I could not have put it down if I had tried. Then came the cheesy, lame, miserable love story that lasted waaaaayyyyy too long. Ughhhh!Other than the 2 consecutive chapters or so of the love story, the rest of the book rocks. By the end of the book I was ready to read Episode III ... the book leaves many unanswered questions and had me craving more. I hate that I have to wait another couple of years to see how it all plays out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome stuff","review":"This is a good story. I liked Episode 1. I thought it did it's job, to set up the story. This story also does it's job, to continue the story and darken the mood. Look, we all know the galaxy is going to go to hell in a handbasket in Episode 3 right? This story does a good job of pointing a finger at the path and saying, \\"here ya go, march onward.\\" You can already see Darth Vader creeping into Anakin, slowing clawing his way inside. Long and short of it, good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"cant wait for may 16th","review":"This book made me want to see the movie even more. It is a great story that makes you really want to see the movie. The book/movie is much darker than TPM.

The movie held new ground in Star Wars while keeping earnest with the spirit of the tale. There are some minor conflicts between the prequel and the original trilogy -storywise, but we can overlook the trivalities. I will say this, if Anakin Skywalker created Threepio and knew R2-D2, why is it that they don't recognize his son - has there memory been erased since the prequel days? In Empire, Obi-Wan claimed he was taught by Master Yoda - in prequel storyline, Qui-Gon Jinn trained him. Hmmm...right? Episode III we'll find out. All I can say about the book by R.A. Salvatore is this -simply written for any age, not as heavy as Lucas' 3 in 1 trilogy set. To understand what you have seen in the movie, to it's full extent, you need to read this book and remember the movie. When you combine the movie and the book - you've got the full story.reviewed by ROBERT ELDRIDGE"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for an upcoming movie","review":"Hello Everyone,This is one wonderfull book.

Terry Brooks did an excellent job with Episode I, he really made the movie/story enjoyable for me. I was so excited when I read that Salvatore would be writing what was to be potentially the darkest chapter of Star Wars....... then I read the book. I'm sorry, Bob, but this novel was terrible. You had a few good parts, but you rushed the entire 2nd half of the book. All of the fighting scenes, Force battles, military strategy... what happened? This was not Salvatore's normal writing style.

I was a little intimidated by the size of this book but when I opened it up and started reading the first couple of chapters; some good things became apparent:1.) This book is easy to read. This is not Faulkner or Shakespeare.2.) This book is well spaced out, typed in large font and divided into many small chapters. It's quite easy to read 4-5 chapters in one seating.I can't wait to see the movie. I came back from Spider-Man. What a blast that was!

I've seen fan fiction written by high school kids better than this.Again and again, Salvatore fails to deliver the goods, turning a fun, exciting movie into an exercise in drudgery and mangled prose. We are never given descriptions of any of the characters, location, ships and weapons, etc. other than the brief \\"long silky brown hair\\" on occasion. Anyone not already intimately familiar with the Star Wars milieu, and ATOC in particular, will have a hard time trying to follow just what the hell is going on. The emotional passages are flat, the characters completely undeveloped, and the battle scenes bland and uninteresting.I don't buy the idea that this book had to be dumbed down for the kids. I read \\"Dune\\" at age eleven, and didn't miss a thing. Kids ain't that stupid, Sal. But maybe your fans are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for a great movie","review":"The book had some extras that make it well worth the read. R.A. Salvatore is a staple in Sci-fi/Fantacy and also wrote the first book of the \\"The New Jedi Order\\" series. His imagry is vivid. He really knows how to put in to words what he wants us to imagine. Even harder, he can verbalize what we have already seen or will see on film. An author, not so good at this, will create a seperate image between film and book.

Now that I have read it, I am still excited, but in a different way. Of course, I know now every secret about the plot and in that sense I have spoiled the movie. However, there are just so many COOL scenes described in the book, scenes that are not necessarily brilliantly written, but that have so many interesting visual possibilities, and that I know will appear simply wonderful on the screen. Without saying anything about the plot here, just let me say that anyone with any interest in Star Wars will truly love George Lucas for this installment. If you were disappointed in The Phantom Menace, which I will not allow myself to admit until the Star Wars saga is complete and I can view it as a whole, then you will feel better now because Attack of the Clones uses elements from that movie and both are made better because of it.

Those who disagree should re-read the parts where Anakin meets Padme's family. It feels unecessary and silly.

I used to read Hall because of his original and quarky bad guys. I also read him for his use of language (he's also a poet) and imagination. In this book the bad guys don't seem very unusual, the language is that of a dime novel, the coincidences are to many, and certain important events are left unexplained... such as an explosion that plays a key role towards the end of the book.This novel seem like a novel that was rushed and nobody double checked.

Being unfamiliar with the characters, I had no pre-set notions or expectations. I found the characters to be less than fully fleshed out, though the other books may help in that regard.For me, the story moved along, but at no great pace or with breathless action.

I can overlook the Kindle's poor support for things like maps or other graphics because there are many books that aren't impacted, but its hard to overlook messing up basic text.Maybe Kindle has a thing against James W.

I hated it. To be fair, in general i hate books where the device to explain an otherwise unbelievable set of characters is: one or more of them is a psychopath, so nothing needs to be explained, he or she is \\"evil\\" and could do anything. In addition, the characters are cardboard, the plot, such as it is , is dumb, and the most sympathetic character is a fish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Modest juice for a modest squeeze","review":"This book was one of NPR&#65533;s Alan Cheuse&#65533;s picks of the season. While I admired it for its intense brevity, there were simply too many unfulfilled metaphors (a certain pink buffalo comes to mind) and lamentably lame high-techery to truly engage the reader (a hand-held neutron bomb, in essence, devoid of any calamitous health effects!). Although the well-sketched characters are praiseworthy, the mind boggles at the slipshod editing: the cause of, motivation for, and perpetrators of one entire scene (the conflagration in the marina) are never revealed, nor even implied. Just another, uh, fluke in a sea of editorial red herrings, intentional or otherwise. That said, there is a hint of Hemingway-esque majesty in the prologue and scattered throughout its 300+ pages that somewhat ameliorates these shortcomings. In sum, modest juice for a modest squeeze."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sarah B as the Nightingale is Worth Buying the CD.","review":"This is a magical old-style musical with excellent operatic singers.

Cute little show recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best example of Sarah's music.","review":"Much as I love Sarah's music, Nightingale isn't her best music.

The beautiful thing about this collection is it's just Sam's show, but he brings out the best in so many others. In addition to this masterpiece, try to find RCA's now deleted \\"The Man and his Music\\" at a used CD store. It's the best single disc collection of the greatest singer who ever drew breath.

For $15 bucks shipped you can't do any better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I Could Like It","review":"We really wanted the simplicity of a pop-in, pop-out gate. Since we have no stairs, a 100 percent impenetrable barrier was not needed, so this seemed to fit the bill. But there are just too many problems. First, and foremost, we find it cannot handle a single doorway in out apartment. In some cases there is a runner along the wall at the base...no go. In another, the walls on the two sides are not perfectly parallel, and the thing twists and torques and will not stay put. And once you install with a little too much force, it will never go straight again. Also, when it is not installed, we can never figure where to put it. The baby is always finding it leaning against a wall somewhere, and dragging it down. A pain.In contrast to some reviews, I do find that the \\"memory-lock\\" works ok. Just don't expect the directions to explain it to you.Did I mention how ugly the thing is?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this gate","review":"I have grandkids and dogs and this gate didn't last 6 months with them.

We've been extremely pleased with it. Now, obviously it's not made of titanium for this price, but it works perfectly.If you're like me and don't read instructions except when absolutely necessary, here's a little tip: Once you get the gate set where you want it and you have it tight, there's a little plastic piece that slips over both parts to keep it from moving. I didn't figure that out for a couple of times, and it actually still worked well. It's a lot more secure if you use the little plastic piece though.Once we saw how well it worked, we ordered another one immediately. Buy this with confidence. Just don't expect something incredibly strong as some of the reviewers apparently did. It could break if you're rough with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"This gate is a total waste of money.

Clunky and hard to use","review":"I ordered this gate based on other Amazon customer reviews. It seemed most people liked it and only commented on the ugly appearance but were happy with the functionality. Yes, it's ugly. Aren't most gates? But this gate in particular is also clunky and hard to use. We already had a great gate, although it was priced a bit higher and we got it at Target. Our other gate looks very similar (gray, plastic...) but works like a charm, while this one and its weird \\"memory\\" clip make it difficult to set up and take down.I hated this gate so much that we just donated it to charity. I didn't even want to bother returning it through Amazon because come on - what a pain! I would have to re-package it and lug it to the post office. I would not recommend buying this gate - get a tension gate that locks into place, as it's much easier to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"not satisfied","review":"these are very difficult to fit into a doorway.

I cannot comment on the level of safety."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice price, but not worth it.","review":"This gate didn't work for us at all.

They took a bit of effort to get into our doorways, but now that we understand how to do it, it's pretty simple. They don't stay in place very well, especially if you accidentally kick it or if your kid is determined to get through.For those of you who plan on stepping over this gate regularly, be sure to do so with care or wear socks/shoes/something to protect your feet. Both of my feet already have scars from having chunks of skin cut off while hopping over them. You never realize just how useful your toes are until they're injured!!All in all, it does the job well enough for our needs, but if you need something that's sturdy, this might not be the best option."},{"rating":"1","title":"cumbersome to use","review":"bought this gate as barrier for my dogs. gate doesn't open and close easily, and doesn't lock with ease either. would buy a more reputable maker next time especially if it's to protect children or large dogs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad for the price","review":"As others have said it is a bit difficult to install. However, we have tried other gates that were far more problematic.It's not pretty, but what do you want from a baby gate?It IS sturdy. We bought it to keep our FIVE pit bulls out of the living room. They have bashed at it and it still remained standing."},{"rating":"1","title":"So stiff and outsmarted by my dog","review":"Packaging has no instructions on how to install - it's a gate so it should be easy to figure out but the design is not intuitive.Once I figured out how to install, I then had trouble opening and closing the gate because it doesn't slide very easily without two people pulling on either ends of the gate. Anyhow, it proved to be a solid gate once installed. I kicked it and it didn't budge. Satisfied, I locked up my 6lbs puppy in the kitchen behind this gate and left home.But alas, my tiny puppy used her little paws like a rock climber / spiderman to climb over the gate that very first day.I'm impressed by my dog, but not impressed with this product. If you have a crafty dog, get a gate with bars, not a gate with criss-cross barrier like this one that dogs can use to climb."},{"rating":"2","title":"North States Supergate..is a super gate","review":"This product was received promptly and packed well..I love this gate, no brainer to use and won't hurt my walls or doorways.

It looked sturdy but if you extend it more than 35 inches it bends. I had to use a small rope to tie the locking mechanism back to the fence.. so yes I made it work but wow. I'd give it zero stars but it didn't break with the rope helping. It will scratch your child if it isn't put all the way to the ground (and your child reaches under) as there are rough edges. And it will scratch your leg if you flip it over and brush against it on the way over. Definitely not worth the cheap price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy and Stiff","review":"This product Sounds like a great idea, but it's flimsy construction makes it a loser. The locking bar bows out when you have it in place, looking like it's going to snap. When trying to open it and select a locking position, it feels a bit like an off brand 80s transformer action figure- like if you move it the wrong way and arm is going to snap off. The plastic breaks easily, as evidenced by it arriving with the bottom corner broken, leaving a jagged piece in a dangerous spot.

Oh well will be returning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"cheap, solid, good!!","review":"For the cheap price, i expected a POS to arrive, but this gate is very solid. The latch, however, is almost too sturdy and can be tricky to unlock. If you frequently remove the gate during the day, or have weak hand strength then this one might not be your best choice. If you set it and forget it once or twice a day... this is the least expensive way to go, while still having a sturdy gate that won't be problematic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps dogs where I want them!","review":"We purchased this gate to block off a door from our dogs.

Mine had some broken pieces of plastic in the box when it arrived just like other posters. It still works though, and I use it on the guest room door to keep baby out. It's low and easy to step over, but we don't use that room much anyway. Baby hasn't messed with it so I don't know for sure how well it would hold up to that.If you just need a little barrier like I do then this is a cheap solution. If you need a good gate to use on a busy door or where a child will be pushing on it and trying to climb then I'd go with something better.Update: Once my child began pushing on the gate, he did push it right over. It was also difficult to adjust and put back into the door whenever we needed to take it out and put it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I needed","review":"I bought this to keep my cat in an enclosed space while I am not home.

But for me it's perfect and you can't beat the price.

I have a number of blood-red bruises the size of pinheads on the palm of my hand below my thumb from the last couple of times I tried to adjust it to fit a door size.My suggestion is to go to a store and try out a few gates before you sacrifice your flesh and blood to one of these things."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"This gate is inexpensive, which is great, but it is difficult to use unless you enjoy jumping over it a lot.

Also, unless you are putting the gate in a really easy place, like in a flat-sided doorway with no trim, it doesn't stay up, or if it does stay up, falls over when the baby pushes or pulls on it.

It's not fancy, a little difficult to adjust if you want to move it to a different width doorway, and definitely requires 2 hands to put up. However, it holds really well, and even manages to fit in the uneven doorways of our old and crooked farm house where no doorway/trim is perfectly level or even. We have two of them, and if it weren't for our desire to have walk-thru gates in other doorways, I'd be thrilled to just save money and buy a bunch of these.Bottom line, this gate is not fancy or particularly attractive, but it's sturdy and more than sufficient for the great price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good gate","review":"This gate does its job for the price.

I was dissapointed that there were limited extras--multiple camera angles would have been wonderful, considering that there is a lot of action going on the two stages and the camera offers a limited view. Also, this may sound a bit picky, but I wish the menu had larger print. It took me a while to realize what I was choosing... Overall, only Peter Gabriel fans will appreciate this DVD..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really really bad mix.","review":"I owned the VHS of this concert which looked and sounded great. The transfer to DVD was really disappointing. The sound fades in and out and the female back up singer (can't remember her name) almost seems to have been intentionally subdued in the mix.

I probably will not watch this train wreck of a DVD again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Video - Horrible Quality","review":"I was surprised with the number of poor reviews for this video being that it is one of the best concert videos ever produced.

Some of the complaints are justified, such as the grainenees at times in the picture and the lack of bass which has been taken out of the audio mix in several songs, in particular Solsbury Hill. There are however improvements over the original in the audio, in that both guitar and keyboards are given more prominence than before. Some of the vocal parts have also been re-done and sound alot better, particulary on songs like Kiss That Frog and Sledgehammer. The highlight for me however is the audio mix on San Jacinto which blew me away the first time I heard it, as it was the song I would always fast foward on the video. All in all a great dvd well worth buying despite some minor complaints."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Concert DVD in my collection","review":"This DVD is an embarrassment to my growing collection. I struggled to sit and watch the full DVD, and put it back on the shelf. I cannot bring myself to watch it again.

The only way I will ever use this DVD again would be with the picture off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Secret World Live: So So","review":"I like Peter Gabriel's voice and some of his songs, but I'd say that perhaps it's better to listen to his music than watching his DVD.

The sound is phenomenal. Someone here also mentions \\"questionable SACD\\". I can play both DVD-Audio and SACD and there is nothing questionable about either format. They are both much better than CD's (which I quit playing and buying about 6 months ago as stereo is dead) and Dolby and DTS.The person that said there wasn't enough bass should turn their subwoofer on. This disc rattles everything in my room especially near the end of San Jacinto. Do yourself a favour and get rid of that theatre in a box and get some good equipment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-diehards be warned: this dvd is awful","review":"I'm a huge fan, have all the CDs, DVDs, etc. blah blah blah. BUT, this concert BARELY sounds live. In fact, when they're not inbetween songs, it COMPLETELY doesn't sound live. And what's with the pedestrian synching? Watch Manu Katche's drumming to see what I mean -- the sounds he makes come a half beat AFTER you see him hit his drums. The same problem can be seen with various mouths not matched up to the words being sung. I've read the other reviews and I can tell you (with my musicians ears, mind you) that I don't have a sense disorder and I have a stellar TV. After this recording, it was brought back into the studio and simply OVER-remixed, OVER-edited, and OVER-produced. If I wasn't such a huge fan of the songs and the artist, I'd call this DVD \\"awful.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Great show - bad transfer to DVD","review":"I have owned the VHS of this show for several years. It is one of the best shows that I have ever seen. The DVD on the other hand is pretty bad. The picture quality is no better than the VHS, is sometimes even compromised (watch MK's drum fills on \\"Come Talk To Me\\" - they cut off the bottom of the picture - you can't see his stick work on the snare drum anymore).My biggest gripe is the sound. What happened ? The sound is out of sync with the picture - it is terribly remixed. The vocals and drums have been mixed higher (and possibly added to ??) and the bass is GONE !! T.Levin's playing is great on the tape - but he is only there to watch on the DVD. Too bad.Maybe it will sound better on a 5.1 instead of a stereo - but that still won't put it in sync."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"i was counting the days,waiting for this dvd to come and now that i have finally got it,i am very disappointed!i hate being negative like this but i really didnt like what i heard and saw.first of all the video/audio is out of synch.its not a big deal(someone would say)but the whole time i had the feeling im watching via satellite.but what really bothered me was the remix,and the fact that i did not hear many things i was expecting to hear. entire passages that are on the cd were missing(example:drum solos on \\"shaking the tree\\").and i really do not understand why this has been done.i have listened to the cd 1000 times,and i know every small detail.further more i consider it one of the most beautiful pieces of so called pop music recorded and i think things should have been left just the way they were.for me as a result of this remix some great pieces of music have been lost on the dvd.i was really disappointed to see all this damage done to such a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's amazing...

I first bought the 2 CD set which I found astounding. Then, a couple of years later, I bought the VHS and was floored. I recently bought this DVD and was extremely disappointed. What I was hoping for was the exact same performance on DVD that was on my wornout VHS cassette. What I got was an approach of \\"more is always better\\". The DVD has been enhanced with guitar overdubs and remixing. The visual portion of the DVD isn't very good quality either. If I knew then what I know now, I would search for another copy of the VHS tape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignore the obvious, and have fun!","review":"If you are a \\"purist\\" who does not wish to listen to a concert DVD with any studio overdubbing, then you should not buy this. If you want to have a wonderful time watching an excellent \\"performance\\" (which I do almost once a week)then this is among the best concert DVD's you could buy. Yes, the vocals are overdubbed, and yes it certainly appears as if Tony Levin is playing a bass with frets, but sounds like most of the recording is done on a fretless. However, if you can \\"forgive\\" these anomalies you will experience an extraordinary concert DVD. The bass work of Levin is alone worth the price of admission, the drumming is excellent, and the energy is overwhelming. My girlfriend, my kids, her kids, are no particular fans of Gabriel but everyone likes this DVD. $15 couldn't be better spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think I'm gonna cry....","review":"[$$$] theater system including a plasma TV.

I'm so disgusted that I can't even write anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"As sick as it sounds I watch this video at least once a week","review":"Absolutely bar none the best concert I have ever seen. The stage show is creative yet never a distraction from the music. The musicians Peter uses are all top notch, especially Paula Cole and Shankar. If you even remotely like Peter's music then this is a must (and if you don't you need therapy). I guess to summarize, I am actually panicking that I can only get a VHS tape of this instead of DVD and that the tape will someday break."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good transfer of an outstanding performance","review":"If you're a Peter Gabriel fan and have seen this concert before, this print is the one you've come to know.

I waited for quite a few years to finally see it go to DVD While still recovering I got to see Paula cole in Concert here locally and it too was a good show. This is right up there with \\"Pulse\\" Not in light wattage but in showmanship!!! It is simply great!!

While the overall quality and clarity of sound is superior on the remastered DVD, I have to say that I like Peter's vocals much better on the original VHS version. They are more natural, more \\"live\\" and far less processed. There is no sense that you are listening to overdubs. I don't know why Peter felt the need to improve on his impassioned performance in the first place. He is one of those rare artists whose voice is as amazing live as in the studio. That said, this is one of the most moving and uplifting concerts I have ever seen. Watching the band's childlike joy during 'Solisbury Hill' will never cease to put a smile on my face."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful concert, horrible DVD","review":"This is a great performance by a really exciting performer backed by a first-rate band. Unfortunately, this DVD contains the worst video transfer I've ever seen, with compression artifacts visible throughout.

But I think a campaign needs to be started to demand a re-issue of this DVD with the problems fixed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry they have NO EXCUSES","review":"No excuses. I own a video facilities company and we made DVD as well. This DVD for reasons I can't understand is the worst quality I ever saw. It's simply too compressed. It's not only \\"little graininess here and there\\", it's not a\\"television set's fault\\". It's the trasfer that is not done properly. Incredible from a production like this and an artist like him.Save your money and wait for the DVD of the new tour shooted in Milan this May....and let's hope they choose another company for the dvd compression.........."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor video killed great DVD!!!","review":"All I can say: great audio, audio engineer should be proud of highly professional job. On the other hand, video is absolutely unacceptable and video tech should be ashamed for ruining what could be one of the benchmark concert DVDs. Five stars for audio, minus five stars for video!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Find the VHS version!!","review":"The negative comments from other reviewers about the poor video and audio quality on this DVD are 100% correct. I was shocked to find that the sound is out of sync with the picture over the entire course of the DVD (well, I presume so--I finally got so disappointed with it about 2/3 through that I turned it off to come on Amazon and replace my old VHS version!). Also, the picture is extremely grainy.The remastering job is horrible and Peter's studio-recorded vocals lack the urgency and energy of the live vocals they have replaced.I am a huge fan of Peter Gabriel's work and I can strongly recommend Secret World Live--but not in this butchered format. You would be much better off finding a copy of the original VHS version. That recording is absolutely enthralling, whereas this DVD version comes off as lackluster, amateur, and poor quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I agree the picture is a little grainy but the sound and the performance of Peter and his band make you forget about the imperfect picture.

I've looked high and low for a DVD of that concert. So, when I saw this dvd and some people claiming this was the 1994 concert....I bit. Big mistake.The picture on this dvd is poor. The sound not much better. But what really disappointed me is the fact that this is a highlight reel from the 1994 concert. There are so many cuts from the real concert that it is like trying to watch a classic movie that has been reduced to scene highlights.If you think you are buying the 1994 concert dvd you will be sorely disappointed. This has to be the most disappointing dvd I have ever purchased. Anyone want it I will gladly send it for cost of postage...otherwise, in the trash.

I just couldn't take the fakeness of it all. In addition, the song selection did not flow together. Did I mention this concert was boring? Sorry to all fans of Peter Gabriel.

The story is interesting and easy to follow with some surprising twists and turns.

Both times when it has come back to life for me, I had it plugged into the wall and I put in the USB cord to the palm but not connected to the computer.

After a year of great use it lost its screen callibration which isn't a part of the regular 90 day warranty and neither is tech support. The only reason that I purchased a second one is because of the documents and programs that I use at work with the Tungsten E2. Palm has a horrible warranty policy.

This power switch is only attached by two very thin wires to the circuit board. There is no other mechanical support. As such, routine usage of this switch WILL result in one of those wires breaking in time.My advice is avoid using this switch. Set the unit up so that the keyboard never locks and use the front panel buttons - which are of a much more robust design - to activate the unit.And if you are having a problem with the speaker not working, it is likely due to the fact that a pressure contact is used to make the connection. Over time corrosion can build up between the spring and press plate and again you will have a failure.Its unfortunate Palm has not corrected these two obvious design flaws in an otherwise quality unit.

I searched on the web, and this seems to be a common problem with no real solution. Palm apparently knew about this, yet they did nothing. This is totally different from Canon. I had a Canon digital camera of three years. The display screen went out. When I searched on the web, Canon had issued a recall for this.

So, only purchase this device if you either don't care about synchronization with Outlook, or you are willing to pay 50$ to buy a third-party synch package.

There was absolutely no mention of this in any of the literature I read before buying. Nothing in the owner's manual either. So now I'm stuck with a device that I cannot synchronize with the PC. (2)When I tried to install the E2 in my PC, the PC(by HP) cycled endlessly (several hours). There was no ph. # to be found in the materials that came with the device, I finally called HP to solve it. To top it off, my previous E2 (about 2 years old) died unexpectedly, no obvious reason why (it was synchronized with an older PC). Well, I guess I'm a sucker for staying with Palm for the replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK","review":"This is my second PDA from PalmOne. I had high hopes this PDA would last longer than my previous PDA from PalmOne, which lasted two days.Well, to my dismay, after buying all sorts of software and accessories, it broke on DAY TWO!!! Unreal. PalmOne produces abosolute JUNK. Do NOT buy this PDA!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't buy this.","review":"I have been a palm user for 8 years starting with the M30 which is still working. But this particular model is permanently stuck on the callibration screen. Palms customer service has gone from mediocre to impossible. Plus this particular model has only a 90 day warranty. Something that is totally unacceptable for a 200+ price tag. To get any service one must buy a service plan. In all of my twenty-five years of electronic use I have never come across a more blaten excuse for bad workmanship than this company has. For my next handheld I'm going with a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Expensive","review":"My old Palm TX died, and I didn't like it. The browsers are horrible; you can't see anything on the screen, it's too small. I liked the Tungsten E2 I had before it, so I wanted to get another Tungsten E2...but $579! Yikes! No way! I guess my PDA days are over as I don't like Smartphones either (and they have smaller screens than the TX!), especially given they can't communicate directly with the computer (we can't have people using the phone as a modem for the computer now can we?). Too bad, they are a real convenience, especially being able to create EXEL files, but that price is way too out of line for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Palm PDA","review":"I am extremely happy with my Palm PDA that I purchased through Amazon. I was unable to buy it in a retail store because it has been discontinued but wanted to replace my previous model. Amazon was the only place that I was able to find the exact PDA that I wanted. The seller was reasonably priced and prompt. They also followed up with me to make sure I was happy with the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful support for Windows Vista","review":"You would think by now that Palm would have figured out that Windows Vista is the software that all of the new Windows based PCs are running now. The best they have for software is a Beta version (yeah, giving you nightmares yet?). The Beta version for Vista and the Tungsten E2 does not support many of the items that the XP compatible software version has AND if you have Vista on one computer and XP on another (ergo - XP on my work laptop and Vista on mhy home computer) it will make your life miserable as it just won't work.I had to dump the Tungstgen E, find and buy the older Tungsten E handheld and install the old version of the software on both computers in order to have my life back again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon got it wrong","review":"Although we ordered the Palm Tungsten E2, Amazon sent the Palm m515, a much older model. We paid approximately $250 for this. Meanwhile, we ordered the Palm Tungsten EZ through a private party on Amazon and, for ~$125, we got what we ordered. I chose the one star ratings because they did not send the item they want me to rate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Palm Pilot","review":"I am very satisfied with the product although I believe the user instructions could be printed rather than found on the computer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Desktop Software","review":"Palm's desktop software has steadily deteriorated over the years. When you download the latest software, it doesn't save your data from the prior version. It simply wipes it out. So make sure to sync before upgrading, or you will lose data from a simple upgrade. Second, the save feature on the latest software (Version 6.2.2) takes a full ten seconds, using a Windows Vista operating system. This is completely unacceptable, since the machine is locked up for the full ten seconds while the Palm software processes. Third, the font on the desktop software is very small, and cannot be adjusted. Fourth, syncing can be a nightmare. It just not easy, even when you are not trying to sync with a third party software. All in all, Palm used to be a great company; however, I get the impression that it just doesn't care about its customers anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not worth the money!","review":"I had problems with my PDA the first day I received it.When I called the customer service guy in India, he tried different things to try to solve the weak connection problems(which made it unable to syn) but nothing worked.

This product has poor quality control."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the old ones.","review":"My E2 is one with all the problems you may have heard about. I replaced my E with the E2, despite reading the issues about the digitizer, etc. They were right, the thing is a real lemon. There are goods things, the battery life is great, the screen is bright. But the bad is so bad! The screen won't stay synced very well, it is nearly impossible to use graffiti to write, despite downloading and trying every fix ever suggested. The stylus' silver coating wore down to a brass color in only a few weeks, then its tip fell off. After about 6 months I find that unless I really carefully ensure that the charging cable is seated, it won't charge. Palm really blew it with this unit, they cheaped it to death. I really wish I had bought something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Max Life 3-5 years,","review":"After having mine for just over a year, it quit working. Palm offered to repair it for $150 and told me that they only last for 3-5 years. Less if it is used more. As you may guess I am very disappointed. It is a nice tool but by the time you buy 3 of these you could by a laptop. Too much money for a disposable item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from Palms","review":"Palm Tungsten E2 - worst purchase I've ever made. This is the 2nd Palm to simply die. Can't recharge it. Lost all data. Most people are busy enough that daily backups are not reasonable (especially with travel). Tech support basically said there is nothing they can do.If you need an electronic calender and phone book, it's better to go with paper. At least if your dog eats the paper, it's partly recoverable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy an E2","review":"Once upon a time, there was a company that made great PDAs. I purchased a Palm Pilot m200 from them, and it was wonderful. Durable, great screen, solid controls, good battery life. It was stolen one day. I tried to replace it with a Tungsten E2. It turns out to have a cheap plastic case, a power button that eventually stops working, and a touch screen that wears out after a year and becomes impossible to calibrate or use. And the power supply only works with 115V and not 220V. It is really a shame that Palm stopped making good PDAs. I certainly do not recommend the Tungsten E2. Please take my review seriously. I should have listened to the reviews when I purchased my E2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"This PDA is disappointing given the price. I used to have a Toshiba that ran on the Windows platform. It synchronized smoothly with my Windows based laptop and all of the programs worked together. The Palm is difficult to set up and has an inadequate user manual that is horrible at explaining how to use the darn thing. I gave mine away and bought an HP IPAQ 111."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad overall, but a couple of issues kill the deal","review":"Nice Palm product, but:- horrible reliability and warranty support; big probability of being stuck with non-working device.- humongous USA-only power adapter means you can't use your PALM when traveling abroad.

So after i updated the new Palm I was ready to go.I use mine every day, all day, so it got a work out fom day 1. Now the problems 1st it is slower, 2nd, in the middle of writing it freezes and you have to wait for it to catch up, 3rd you cant read it in the sunlight, 4th The battery does not last as long. All in all it has some better features (MP3, bluetooth) than the others but its not all its advertised to be. Actually starts to make me want to look at other brands for a PDA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tungsten E2","review":"Tungsten E2 was great, would have rated 4.5 UNTIL I bought a new Computer W2, Now NOT Compatible with Win 7!

On field trips, some of which last many hour and entail miles of walking with an array of optics, camera gear and assorted other accoutrements-field guides, portable CD player and 4-5 CDs. This stuff get heavy. The Tungsten has a memory card slot and National Geographic has developed an SD memory card with their field guide data on it and accompanying bird calls, songs, whistles etc. Not only does the device function as a calendar, notepad etc. it has allowed me to dispense with a book, the portable CD player and several Cds. A great saving of weight and space in the pack. I've never had the battery run down in the field, but I charge it up prior to the beginning of the trip and carry a car charger with me. The screen protector works well. External speakers need to be used for listening to the songs and whistles, but the Altec iM4 Portable Speakers are clear and have great volume. Very satisfied with the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"Well I got this device 1 1/2 years ago. I was at first pretty impressed. It worked fine and I had nothing to complain. Then about 6 months ago, the software crashed (and I had no warranty any more). My husband was able to temporarily fix the problem, but it keeps recurring and we need to reset the whole PDA. Maybe I am just unlucky (cause his is fine), but this means that they have some devices out there causing all sorts of problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Like Palm, You'll Like the E2","review":"The Tungsten E2 is a solid, inexpensive Palm for Palm lovers. If you're not especially a fan of Palm handhelds, I can't imagine you'll especially like the E2. It's quick. Hasn't shut down on my in the month I've had it. Responsive touch screen.Comes with SMS software that lets you read and send text messages from the Tungsten if you have a Bluetooth enabled phone. You can dial calls too. I don't know how practical these features are, but I use them. It's nice being able to write text messages with Graffiti.Speaking of Graffiti, if you haven't bought a new Palm in a while, Graffiti is now Graffiti 2, a clunky, many-stroked shadow of its former self. Still usable though. Hacks are available to revert to old Graffiti.If you like Palm, and don't have enough money for a TX, the E2 is solid. I'm just coming off a Treo (that broke after less than a year) and the larger display and added features (notepad, for one) are big improvements in the E2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nightmare Palm","review":"This was the first haldheld I ever got (September/05).It started to work fine but after I deleted a software itgot frozen.

It worked fine for a while but then itstopped turning on after you turned it off. The only wayto put it back on was by doing a hard reset all the timeyou wanted it to turn on. The warranty period expired (90 days),so to get it fixed I'd have to pay almost the price of a newhand-held."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quitting Palm","review":"Palm is such a great idea, but they make the on/off button too cheaply.

The unit just stopped working. I called Palm for help, I was told to pay $25 for the first call and $145 to repair the unit. The unit can be bought for around the same price new on the net. What a sham!!! They lost a customer, if they care......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for what tis' designed to do","review":"This is a great device for what it's meant to do. It's designed to store and organize pieces of imformation, personal data, notes, etc. not function as a mini-laptop. For these purposes, it works great. The screen is large and clear, everything is easy to navigate and the battery life is incredible. The PIM functionality is good. Being able to attach notes to to-do list items that are then cross-referenced in the calendar is very useful for keeping things organized. The address book holds everything you'd ever want to know about a persn and then lets you add your own custom fields. Bluetooth is a nice feature and easy to configure, but not necessary for what the palm does, so I consider it an added bonus. This certainly isn't the be-all and end-all of mobile devices, but if you're looking for a well-designed tool to store and organize information that nees to be readily accessible, then the Tungsten E2 shoudl do the job jsut fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great starter book","review":"This was a perfect start to my daughters collection of winnie the pooh stories.

For instance, all those who give StarOffice one star and compare it unfavorably to OpenOffice. StarOffice is *based* on OpenOffice ... the look and feel and functionality are *identical*; StarOffice is just enhanced to do a better job of reading MS Office files.

What is going on with this, did the people who wrote this live on Mars or something..... More problems, the icons on the screen are un-readable they are so tiny and sometimes they do not display correctly. This was a mistake, I hope it the java un-installs with the rest of this Star Office to the recycle bin on my desktop.Next stop, buying MS Office something that works, and does not require a computer science degree to operate...I recommend MS Office, it actually works and is used by ALL home users and businesses!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Java is full of bugs","review":"This needs java to run and it is the worst plug-in you can put on your PC.

This can also be done when working on two separate documents of the same or different types. A spreadsheet on one screen and a word processor document on the other, for example.Another useful feature is the 'Export to .pdf' option so that any document can be sent to a recipient, confident that it can be opened and viewed as intended.Star Office 7.0 is a good choice for many users at a very modest cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great deal!

The dilemma he ensnares his family in is quite disturbing. I love how Haneke defies many standard methods of storytelling, much of the violence occurs just off screen.If you liked Funny Games, give this a look.

Her motives were foreign to me; her actions often unfathomable. This is not a plot-centered book, but that is not its chief fault. There are plenty of highly successful books that are less story-line than they are explorations of character. What makes this particular book excruciating is that one cares not a bit for its flat and unbelievable protagonist.

The bigger question is what is Peggy Cort, a thirty-something librarian, doing falling for a teenage boy?

Why do I get this image of Ms. McCracken dutifully leafing through Nat'l Enquirer, dutifully sitting before her computer, dutifully writing not to bore herself? The best parts have Peggy Cort talking about being a librarian; those parts are dry-as-dust, too, but have a lived resonance, albeit a hypothyroid one. Peggy is bookishly self-absorbed, chattily comatose, knowingly obsessive. I do not care about chilly Peggy (and she is the only character).

Wadlow, who floundered throughout his life seeking a career that would preserve his dignity, was a lot more interesting than her character; not that McCracken's giant is as much a factor in this book as the muted, whiny, navel-contemplating -- in other words, standard dirty-realist --pack of lame supporting characters. McCracken should punt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsettling","review":"I am not a fan of books written in the first person, but the person who lent it to me had nothing but rave reviews! The book to say the least was unsettling and quite disturbing. I found the story line long, drawn and boring. The characters lacking depth and emotion. The only character you feel sorry for is Mrs. Sweatt, who is honest and outright from the start, she hides nothing. As for Peggy, she comes across as pitiful, selfish and \\"stalker-like\\" in her obsession with James.I know evey book does not have a happy ending and I have read those, but I was relieved when I could put this book back on the shelf and forget the characters in it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Giant Miss","review":"The only reason it didn't take me long to read this book is because I kept waiting for the story to get better...And waiting.

The ending made it even worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Romance Novel","review":"This is one of the most boring and cliched books I've ever read.

McCracken delivers such beautiful prose in this novel, I actually had to reread some chapters as I finished them. These are words worth savoring, delightfully delivered through metaphors.Giant is a story of TRUE romance. Hang up those Harlequins and read a story that will touch your soul and make you a believer in real love and emotion. McCracken has taken two characters and thrown in a bundle of troublesome issues to make the reltionship doomed (the boy's size, their difference in age, etc) yet moves the characters closer together and shows that the bonds of love can cross any boundaries.Buy this one and keep it.

The book is well-paced, with wonderful action and a sizzling romance.The feel of the book is refreshingly 'now', without the usual 'medieval in space meets Star Trek' feel that dominated the futuristic-romance genre for so long. Ms. O'Shea's use of present day terms along with the special operations teams sets the story not too far in the future, and the references to earth and current earth politics give the book an extra layer.Don't mistake this book for sci-fi! Although it is rich with detail, the main focus is the romance. I love the growing romance between Damon and Ravyn and the secondary love story is just as intriguing. Those of us who are familiar with great futuristic-romance writers like Justine Dare and Jayne Ann Krentz will love Patti O'Shea's Ravyn's Flight. It has the same powerful love story and paranormal elements.I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"At last a new futuristic.

You know what to expect when you pick up Sidney Sheldon - there's an entertainment value at the least. This is one of the worst books I've ever read. The book is highly predictable, when author first tells you story and then what follows is an investigation of what has already been told to you. You can't put the book down - simply because you won't like taking it up. This was my first Arthur Hailey book and boy, I swear this will be my last.

It also reveals the exposure and danger of being a popular anchor person. However, this book has its share of let-downs. For example, the bad guys are meticulous but they are uncharacteristically careless when they did not clean up their hideout before leaving. The ending is uncommon - not one that you will find in a Hollywood movie - the bad guy did not die, the good guy did. On the flip side, this is the reality, bad guys don't always die."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formulaic, predictable, and highly inaccurate.","review":"This one is very likely Hailey's worst book. In fact, in my opinion, it stank. The plot is formulaic, and Hailey, as he has tended to do over the past 20 years, mistakes overpessimism for profundity. But I digress.In \\"The Evening News\\" we are supposed to believe that the electronic news media functions as a form of superagency that can and does outperform the FBI and CIA while simultaneously acting at a level above that of the government. What nonsense. The whole plot is permeated with this tripe.I will give Hailey credit for keeping the book moving.

This tripod is suitable for a small digital camera. It is not suited to a small palmcorder or larger camcorder. It may hold it but you will have to balance things carefully. It will be even more difficult on uneven surfaces. The flexible legs are not flexible in the ways I would like. They cannot be contorted into positions that would allow versatile settings. Their useful range of flex is rather limited. I bought a folding, rigid leg mini tripod from vivitar for about the same price. It is much more flexible in terms of supporting the camera in odd positions on odd surfaces like a fence post where the post is not level. I wouldn't recommend this tripod for the reasons mentioned, plus it is no smaller than the vivitar, and won't support as much weight. The normal rigid leg tripod is also way more stable and not so likely to collapse or fall over with the camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke in the first two minutes of use.","review":"The thread is plastic.

Except for the smell, item appears to be high quality for the price, and the relatively light weight Panasonic ZS3 is comfortably and securely supported by the three legs, as long as the legs are widely separated and on a firm surface. Since the ZS3 is a much a video camera as it is a photo camera, when pushed together, the legs provide a nice handle for shooting extended video while looking at the nice LCD screen without obstruction (it's especially secure when using the wrist strap at the same time). A highly practical item that makes handling of the smallish ZS3 much easier."},{"rating":"2","title":"The little tripod that could","review":"This is a cheaper version of similar tripods out there.

It's nearly unbearably suspenseful in some parts, but it's wonderfully acted by Peter Lorre especially. Lorre plays a perverse child killer who is discovered by whistling a tune from \\"In the Hall of the Mountain King\\" and having a glow in the dark chalk letter \\"M\\" branded on the back of his jacket. The movie is very intelligent and absolutely fascinating. You will NOT be able to tear your eyes away from this classic - from the opening killing to the ending confession, it's classic and wonderful filmmaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful Movie _ A Criterion Transfer Failure!","review":"I have seen this movie once on a german video-edition and there was no annoying thick white line in the upper part of the picture for nearly 2/3 of the movie, which distracts you a lot while viewing.

At Criterion's high prices print quality should be outstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect example of subtle terror.","review":"This film left me numb. The final scenes hit me with a power I had never before experienced. Peter Lorre plays a child murderer (immaculately, I must add) being pursued, throughout the course of the film, by not only the police, but the underground crime syndicate as well. Lang's use of the newfound sound technology is absolutely brilliant, as is his visual style. The opening scene shows shots of empty alleys, stairwells, and a lost balloon stuck in power lines over the sound of a mother calling for her child, instead of showing the actual killing itself. And its worth seeing for that alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrifying","review":"Terrifying, disturbing film of a child murderer sought out by both the police and the criminals.

Given his dimunitive size it is odd to watch him entice his next victim, hardly smaller than himself. He is disgusted with his own desire, frightened of the pursut that builds during the film, twisting and slimey, like some newt or toad, trying to escape. The story has several clever plot twists, such as having the underworld capture him, but it is Lorre's face,posture, acting that carry this movie.

But 72 years later, it's lost a bit of its edge. Peter Lorre was primarily a stage actor at the time he appeared in \\"M\\" and by today's standards his performance in the famous \\"underground trial\\" scene verges on scenery-chewing. And while the print used to produce Criterion Collection DVD is mostly clear, the subtitles [are bad] ... sentences are broken in odd places, and often several characters' lines appear all together, before an exchange is half over. If you've never seen this movie, and you have any serious interest in the development of the art form, you definitely ought to see it. But don't expect edge-of-your-seat tension throughout!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing, unforgettable... a must-see!!!","review":"In his first sound film, Fritz Lang takes full advantage of the medium to produce a haunting masterpiece.

Let's not forget Peter Lorre's groundbreaking role as Beckert, the child killer. This edition is a must have!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Filmmaking","review":"This is what every filmmaker should try to produce.This film is difficult to rival. It was and still is an influential movie that discussed reality with realism and never shied away from continual controversy. One of the first films about a serial killer, with details ripped from the headlines and extras ripped from the streets.Peter Lorre is a genius in this film. Even though you know everything, he still manages to illicit some sympathy from viewers. Lang is excellent at creating a story that draws in his audience and captivates.This movie also solidified Edvard Grieg's \\"In the Hall of the Mountain King\\" as a terrifying piece of music.Although made in 1931, this film looks and feels well beyond its time. This new edition of this film will ensure its legacy to continue well beyond as a masterpiece!Highly recommend for anyone, especially those who consider themselves cinema connoisseurs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Criterion DVD: excellent sound, but far from perfect picture","review":"I own a beamer and normally see quite well how a film was transfered. Here, the picture isnt clear, you can't distinguish faces far off, cannot even read the newspaper-article, though I am certain you can on the source that was used for the transfer. I certainly hoped for better stuff, and now will have to to tape the film from an emission on TV and dub the sound or something similar. A disappointing transfer indeed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dated","review":"Maybe this shocked in its day, but it's terribly dated, with long dialogue scenes that could have been condensed way down. Interesting to see Peter Lorre so young and speaking German. But I thought I'd be caught up in the actual movie, but was forced to watch it as a piece of film history, like a college film class. The one thing that prevents film from being the greatest art form is movies date so quickly. This is a perfect example."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor early Fritz Lang work.","review":"Reality check:Plays like a simplest TV show. Main character is NOT developed. A highly overrated movie not even having good cult elements.Plays like an early work for a person who has just gotten a camera in their hand and doesn't understand the need for playing out detailed subtle story elements. Instead it is like watching a show made for children.The worst American TV shows are this good.A classic 1 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price and performance","review":"bought it for my Canon camcorder (Optura 200Mc). Just put it in and it worked great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't write to it!","review":"I had just gotten a Toshiba e310 Pocket PC and wanted to take advantage of the SD slot so I could load up some music files. Each time I tried it I got error messages saying the media was write protected. This card comes with a \\"lock\\" so you can protect your data but I tried it with the lock in both positions and nothing would work. I emailed SimpleTech and was informed that the card must be defective. Hence, the low rating. Maybe I was just unlucky but I'm going to try another brand. At least their customer support got back to me quickly. Too bad the product didn't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great in my Palm - more storage!","review":"Have had my new color palm for about 3 months and started to learn how to use it more. So storage has become an issue. Purchased the simple 128 mb sd card to keep family photos and map data, when I travel. The card has increased my data storage capacity enormously. Like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will Die, Don't Buy","review":"It's very simple, everything I have ever owned by SimpleTech has died on me including this SD Card, 4 USB sticks, 1 Hard DRive, and 1 CF card. Not one of their products lasted me more than 2 years and caused me a lot of headache."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less a novel than a propaganda piece for Spiritualism","review":"Sir Arthur Conan Doyle lost his son, brother, and two nephews in World War I, and this led him to believe in Spiritualism. This book is less a novel than a propaganda piece for Spiritualism; it uses characters from the Professor Challenger stories, primarily the journalist Edward Malone and Enid Challenger, with a few appearances by Professor Challenger himself, and lectures the reader on the characters' conversion to Spiritualism. There are a few passages reminiscent of Doyle before his reason was affected, and an interesting although shocking suggestion in chapter two that the deaths of \\"ten million young men\\" in World War I were punishment by the \\"Central Intelligence\\" for humanity's laughing at the alleged evidence for life after death. But the bulk of the book is unreadable."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to Write a Non Fiction Book Proposal, Mettee","review":"Thanks to Mettee for providing authors with a template for the nerve racking task of how to format a book proposal. Under his guidance I have produced a concise proposal and sent it to publishers with the confidence my book idea will be selected for publishing. A must read for new and seasoned non fiction authors!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A concise excellent guide","review":"I am an attorney and literary agent so I make it a point to read books on how to prepare proposals. This is one of the shorter books on how to write a book proposal but the advice is very sound. Following the guidance in the book should result in an excellent proposal. One thing that distinguishes this book from most others on the subject is that it is written from a publishers perspective. If you are interested in writing a serious proposal,it would not be a bad idea to read more than one book on the topic since a proposal that looks professional and provides the information an editor considers necessary will garner extra attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our recommendation for authors","review":"As a publisher and publishing consultant, this is the book I recommend to writers and new publishers. It is direct, concise, and engaging. Writers serious about professional nonfiction book projects would be wise to read and use this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Springboard for Success","review":"Mr. Mettee's book is practical, concise, readable, and attractive. My success will depend on how thoroughly I combine the advice contained in these pages with fingers-on-the-keyboard persistence."},{"rating":"1","title":"When it works, it's fun.","review":"this was our son's only requested gift. he loved it, but after two days it stopped working properly. we returned it for a new one and again after a few days it didn't work. we returned it and got our money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable - often requires \\"restart\\"","review":"My 3-year-old twins like this toy, but it is difficult to use (won't always snap back down), and it frequently stops working. Usually turning it off and on again fixes it, but not always. I'm surprised something this buggy got to market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good toy","review":"I bought this for my five year old son, and he liked it a lot. He played with it for some time. I bought it about one year ago, so after some time it stop using it, but from time to time he find it and it begin to play with it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of money!!","review":"I purchased this truck as a Christmas gift. As a parent of 5 children (boys ages 12, 10, 8 and 2 and one girl age 2) I was happy to see how much they enjoyed it.But by New Years Day it was done for. We changed the batteries and nothing. My children are so disappointed and heartbroken.Just a total shame.I wouldn't recommend this truck to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun while it lasted!","review":"This is such a cool toy. My 5 year old begged for this over and over again. It was the number one thing on his Christmas list last year. It is very inconsistent. Half the time, if not more, King doesn't pop out which is the best feature of the toy. I hope they do something to fix the design problems because it would be fun. Within six months it was malfuctioning."},{"rating":"1","title":"It simply doesn't work!!","review":"I bought this product thinking I'd have a PDF generator that was cost effective and would be simple to use. WRONG! Firstly files that I've saved suddenly wouldn't open and had to be generated and saved again - and again - and yet again! Then, files I've emailed to people sometimes won't open (I sent 3 files to 1 person - he could open 2 but not the 3rd!). Finally the software just stopped working altogether when I'd done NOTHING to my PC (this after about 7 days). Finally, the customer service is non existant. You have to post messages on a forum - and no one has as yet answered mine (the forum is full of questions asking for fixes to various bugs - that is, its like a beta version you're buying), and finding an email address is nearly impossible - I think I found one for the customer care dept, but as no one has bothered to answer it I'm not so sure.My advise in one breath is quite simple - AVOID IT!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Billy's back again","review":"It's great to hear Billy Preston again. I'm still waiting for his classic albums to become available on CD. The music is this new CD is really good. He still knows how to play that organ. The vocals are a little slurred at times which slightly take away from the over all effect. Still a good effort after being away for so long. PS Get those other alblums converted to CD's for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why we got these terrible reviews?","review":"The former reviews are simple terrible. I suppose that they were'made' by samsung as well?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mama mia, I can see ya!","review":"Wanna a midrange digital camera from a good brand WITH LCD screen and flashy looks?

Great stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch","review":"I agree with the guy who wrote about the drums. What a mistake letting this guy play the drums on this album. he used to be in a band in Philly, and they sucked. And I hear that downset kicked him out anyway. I saw them at Tattoo the Earth and they sucked. Don't waste your money, get something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good drums","review":"The drums aren't very good on this CD...I don't listen to the wurds on CDs, so I don't even know whut is it abut. I hate this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Range","review":"Features and sound quality are great, BUT the range I experienced was horrible. I tried moving the base unit around my house but the range never improved. I have a couple of 2-3 year old 900Mhz phones that provide at least 3 times the range of this phone. I also noticed the phone causes nearby radios (stereo, clock-radio) to buzz. I love Sony products, but this was one of my worst experiences ever with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap but inadequate","review":"Don't buy this if all you want is a cheap, functional monopod. Alhough it has a quick release plate, the head has no tilt function, which limits youto using your slr only in horizontal composition mode. I ended up buying a separate ballhead, which raised the cost of this monopod to almost twice what I had intended to spend.I would have been better off getting a good quality one like Manfrotto or one of the cheap models available on ebay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Monopod","review":"Very light and easy to tote around sporting events when a tripod is too hard to get out of the way. Great height too for 6 footers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its a commercial","review":"This VHS is nothing more than a commercial for Japan Airlines. Having lived in Japan, the depiction is pure fiction. Approximately half the time is spent on JAL or the national train system (which is probably a subsidiary of JAL). Adding insult to injury, what's not an ad for JAL is an ad for Travel Preview which shows this video can be purchased from them for $12.95.Not having seen any of the other Travel Preview videos, I can only suspect they are nothing but commercials and fictional accounts of the subject area."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little review for Molly Donnelly","review":"Molly Donnelly is a great book about a girl growing up during WWII. She takes on a lot of resposibilty in her teenage years with her mom going off to work and having to watch her brother, Dusty, who is quite the little brat.As she grows up she learns new things. She makes new friend and loses a couple. I think this book is a great book and i recomend it to anybody who loves to read about serious books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantastic Read","review":"This was a wonderful book, and it really opened up a new idea of America to me. I had had no prior idea of what life was like in the U.S during World War Two, and loved reading about it, and taking in a great story at the same time. When I first recieved this book I was hesitant about starting it (as it didn't look very appealing), but am I ever glad I sat down and read it! I recommend this book to anyone age ten and over, and I am proof that elder teens can relate to this also."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Supplementary Method : Using Range Base ANOM","review":"The \\" Blue Book \\" is about Dr. Wheeler's version of ANOM using the \\" Range \\". This is different from the Traditional ANOM as introduce by Ellis Ott. The Range Base approach is an advantage of being less sensitive to the effects of nonhomogeneity of the variation than the traditional ANOM . This book is a supplement to the \\" Red Book \\" ( Understanding Industrial Experimentation ) with same clarity and force in its practical application .

It has the same story line just from a different perspective. I have heard from some people that they thought this movie was too scary for their little ones but I felt that it was no more scary than the Disney version! My 5 year old daughter loves it and has watched it over and over again! I fell in love with it when I watched it as a little girl and still enjoy watching it today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfull childrens movie","review":"I've looked everywhere to find this one on DVD, wich has been quite troublesome living in Norway. Me and my sisters used to watch this movie over and over as kids. We adored it, and we've been looking for it for years. The same day we got it in the mail, us three sisters sat down in our sofa with wide grins, excited to see if we still would love the movie as much as we used to do 15-20 years ago. Unbelivably enough, we still knew all the songs, even the words wich only shows that this movie really did an impression on us. It was great to see it again, allthough now that we're (supposed to be) grown ups, we couldnt help notice a few funny things here and there. But we love it still, and had a great time watching it even now, so we can all recomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings Back Memories","review":"This is a movie I remember renting at the store a lot when I was little. Every time I tried to search for it online I could never find it. When I finally did I bought it right then. This Snow White is based on the Brother's Grimm version of the story, and as much as I love the other version, this one is the best. The songs are catchy, and I think that any child would enjoy it, my nieces did."},{"rating":"2","title":"snow white","review":"When i saw this version of Snow White, it became my vavorite.

Of course, I did get it for my granddaughter so she will be the final arbiter. Congrats to Amazon for offering such a delightful video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie I ever bought","review":"I think I must have hit the wrong key on the computer when I bought this movie, it is beyond terrible. At best it is a camp version of Snow White. What a waste of Diana Rigg's talent. The seven dwarfs are probably the best characters in the movie, but even they can't save it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird and ...... weird....","review":"Fun, but not as much fun as I remember it being. This is silliness, but when you're not really exhausted, drinking, or in a silly mood, this movie just sort of bores you. It really drags in places (no pun intended) and in others it's just not funny. Good for when you don't care enough to rent the very best."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie ...!","review":"Ignore all the \\"I loved it\\" reviews. They smoked way WAY way too much <something> before watching it. This is a low budget, slow paced, boring, plotless waste of time. But at least the acting is bad! In fact I think the 'actors' smoked more than the those reviewers did.\\"Drag is cool, but this movie is not\\". We were forced to turn it off and sent a group to the video store for an alternative; and our group has a pretty high tolerance for bad movies (heck, we launched into this one without an alternative on hand).Save yourself some time and brain cells, buy a better movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Campy, and damned good at it!","review":"I first saw ViS in an art-theatre, having no clue what kind of movie it was. The largely-gay crowd should have been a tip-off. It's a campy drag-queen movie, sort-of a take-off of '50s Flash Gordon, with '50s special effects.But it's GREAT. Nothing even remotely offensive, but a lot of spoofing going on. Not a high-quality movie, but a lot of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Debut","review":"Of all the bands coming out from NZ Blindspott are definately one of the best.

Since then, over a dozen CDs have been made and bought by the millions not only in their homeland but in America, Canada and elsewhere.Their songs, as you hear on this debut album, are not only worshipful but catchy and are played by worship bands in churchs all over North America in the past dozen-or-more years. Hillsongs have to proven to be right there, if not above, Christian \\"stars\\" like Amy Grant and Michael W.

The craft and artistry in this CD are the result of a mature and skillfull performer. It is refreshing to hear from someone with vison rather than imitation. I had never heard of this artist until he was the opening act in my small local flok music club. I felt like I was hearing a combination of Bob Dylan, John Prine, Bill Morrisey and Bruce Springsteen with a whole lot of parts that I could not identify, except that it was very good.

They have not once scratched the furniture. People are amazed that the cats understand me when I give them commands. It's all because of Ray Berwick's book. I am so sorry it's out of print.

While pregnant with my son I had awful morning sickness and was getting quite depressed. I was obviously traumatized since I ordered this book and my son is now two! I'm extremely scared of being pregnant again and this book kind of reinforced how bad I felt. So I wouldn't recommend this for anyone who wants to get pregnant as I think it might scare them. But if you are in the midst of that awful feeling this is a good read just to assure you that you are not alone. I started feeling better at the twelve week mark and enjoyed the rest of my pregnancy, but oh how I remember those days of wanting to just die and wanting to strangle everyone who said they never got sick."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Morning\\" Sickness wearing you down?","review":"I am now in my 13th week of morning sickness and I'm finding it difficult to see the light at the end of the tunnel. The continuous nausea beats you down until you feel like you're all alone and there is no hope for relief. This book, unlike every other pregnancy book that I've read, really addresses all the issues surrounding the nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Elizabeth Kaledin is extremely knowledgable and uses humor and empathy to reach out to women going through this difficult time. She offers advice, personal stories, and testamonials from other women throughout the book. She doesn't gloss over of emotional aspects like so many other authors (and doctors). I found it all extremely comforting and it helped me to feel less alone and hopeless. I highly recommend this to all women (and partners) going through \\"morning\\" sickness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wate of Money even for 11 bucks","review":"Hi,This is the most crapy wide angle I have ever come across.

So, I'll give it a good rating based soley on its use for researchers and advanced math students. However, it is very terse. Do not pick this up expecting a lot of discussion about the topics. Most of the time it is basically a list of definitions and theorem/proof's with exercises. Because of that it is great for use in a class, but might be a little difficult for independent learning. It could use a few more pictures, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great expectations, unmet","review":"The author is a very good mathematician (and a grandfather of Google) so I was expecting a short and lucid introduction to dynamical system. Imagine my sadness when I found the book barely comprehensible. Apparently, the author learned his writing skills in Russian in the 60s, where paper was scarce, and any sort of explanation was viewed a waste thereof. If you actually want to understand dynamics, Katok/HasselblattIntroduction to the Modern Theory of Dynamical Systems (Encyclopedia of Mathematics and its Applications)is vastly superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"I own this set too","review":"I've had this set since it came out and I agree with the other reviewer.

I learned Bulgarian fairly rigorously. I liked this book because it helped teach me some of the intricacies of Bulgarian through studying the dialogues which are very good. The book also gives fairly good explanations of grammar rules.The book could have been organized better.

Lots of suspense. A real page-turner. You really get to know and understand the characters. It has a touch of humor but not silly. I didn't give it 5 stars because I didn't think it was as good as Gator Prey -- not as descriptive and the characters in Gator Prey were more fun.

Most custom coachwork is reserved for post WWII while there is not much of a spectrum in the pre-war models.The printing of the book in a landscape format instead of a portrait format my seem a nice way to presenting full views of the cars but it also cuts down on the author's need to write a whole lot of text.Give me one of the Dalton Watson books on the Rolls any day of the week.After all what do you expect from the publisher of a weekly car newspaper - quality?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent overview of the RR and Bentley story","review":"I purchased this product as a gift for my 12-year old who loves exotic cars of all kinds.

I agree; it's all that and more. Terry Callier possesses a gorgeous voice and the material on this album perfectly suits his style. The songs have a gentle (mellow is too lame a word in this case), soulful, and atmospheric quality to them. Callier's voice floats and soothes the listener. But don't think that these songs will put you to sleep. There is also has a power and vibrancy to this music that demands your attention. You might even call it inspirational. But in the end, this is just gorgeous, beautiful music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious, torturous, and terminally tepid","review":"Ugh! Finishing this book, I felt like Sisyphus eternally rolling the (book) stone up his hill - the task never ended. Random words on a page would have been marginally more entertaining and could have possibly held more meaning.There is one character in this book. The rest are just names (with an occasional, conservative dash of personality). This single character is completely unlikable, uninteresting, and ultimately incomprehensible, as he is split into multiple \\"personalities\\".The story covers a couple hundred years taking 20-40 years at a leap between every other short chapter. This gives the story a rushed feel or makes the reader feels like he's reading a history without much detail (or an outline).Strahd makes an appearance and is equally uninteresting and has no personality. The ending is confused and sad..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ideal for beginners and casual listeners","review":"This set of four cds is an extraordinary collection to get introduced to the richness of Indian classical music. One can get the basic 'chalan' (movement) of as many as 74 ragas. One can argue that the expositions are too short to bring out all the nuances of a raga, but that's not the purpose of these performances.The best thing about the performers is that they kept things simple, yet enjoyable.One suggestion though. Rather than arranging the ragas alphabetically, it could have been better arranged by the time of the day they are supposed to be played. That's just my humble opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good explanations, also good to listen to","review":"I bought this originally because I had bought other raga recordings and I wanted to know what the various raga types meant. (If you want the book, you have to order the CD set and not the MP3s, but if you just want to listen, the MP3s are fine.)But it's also really nice to listen to. I listen on shuffle play; the organization of the CDs is in alphabetical order, and it made me expect that no one would ever use this except as a reference. I think they should have grouped the ragas by time of day instead. (I would knock off part of one of the stars if I could, because of that.) This does the musicians a disservice, because the performances are beautifully done, and are not just academic demos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous purchase","review":"The Ragas themselves are great. 5 stars, in my opinion. So is Amazon's speedy delivery. I managed to get mine within three days, and had selected the 3-5 business day shipping plan.However, the packaging sucks. I thought I was getting a box set. It ain't no damn box. The four CDs come tucked into plastic sleeves attached to the inside covers of the books.At least two of my CDs were RUINED in removing them from their packaging for the FIRST TIME! And know, I'm not some idiot who can't take a CD out of its case. There was no case. They were practically stuck to the plastic they came in. I had to use force to remove them; not much force, but enough that they scratched against the plastic when coming out of the sleeves. And the worst part is, I can't return them, or get a refund, or a replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, poor packaging","review":"This is a fantastic set of 4CDs and a book for anyone who wants to start learning about Hindustani Classical music. Highly recommend it.It does not get 5 stars because of packaging issues.

It had the best rating on the eevblog $50 multimeter review and also highly rated by adafruit so that's why I chose this one. It works OK but the thermometer is next to useless, the capacitance is not accurate and very slow. There are a few other annoying things about it, but when you look at other multimeters, you'll probably want the one that sux less in the $50 range. I like the no-touch current sensor, a nice add-on. If you want a thorough review of it go to eevblog.com and look for the $50 multimeter video blog. If you're not crazy about accuracy and only need it for hobby work, it's quite good.

This unit has a great combination of features for the price.Unfortunately some of those features did not work \\"out of the box\\". If you take a closer look, the quality of the meter is not bad, but as you would expect, it does not compare with the professional meters. I am one of those people who buys a tool and expects it to last a lifetime and so I decided to give up the thermocouple, spend a lot more money and bought a Fluke. The price was considerably higher, but I was replacing a digital meter and an analog meter that both had died, so I felt it was time to bite the bullet and get the better meter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Package is missing test leads, Type K temperature prob..","review":"Product arrived with no test leads, Type K temperature prob.Description clearly indicated they should be included Without those, it is not functional. Test Leads and probe online is almost the price of the whole unit. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad continuity, but ok meter","review":"Multimeter seems to work fine and has good build quality. Great deal at 20 bucks.My only complaint is that the continuity beep is terribly static-y which ended up being a big deal for me. I felt that I needed to hold the probes and sometimes move them around on the contacts to get the continuity beeper to work. The beep sound it makes is pretty awful. I don't think it is the speaker though, rather the signal going to it.I tried this one after I tried the MN35...which had the exact same problem.I am going to stay away from Extech for a while, I think the algorithm/circuit they use to check continuity is messed up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very accurate","review":"While the unit overall has a solid feel the accuracy lacks a bit. Mine read 4.95 volts for a precision 5.00V. The temperature reading was off by 3F compared to a precision temp meter. I expected a better product from Extech.I returned this unit and bought a Fluke which costs about twice as much but has the accuracy I need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good mid level multi meter","review":"If you are looking for the best Fluke is the cats meow. If you are looking for something between Fluke and harbor freight this is a great multi meter. I needed a meter solely for verifying Hz on standby generators and was finding it difficult to justify buying a fluke for just the single function I needed. This meter at $50 fits my criteria just nicely. As a fun added bonus the temperature gauge is great to see exactly how cold it is when you are working, I never realized just how cold it was at several job sites. Display is easy to read. My only complaint is the non contact tester is a joke, I'm not sure if I just got a bad unit or if that's how it's suppose to work but it's too inaccurate to use as a trouble shooting aide, for non contact testing the Fluke 1AC can't be beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well for the most part","review":"Solid construction, appears quite rugged. I certainly don't intend to drop it, but it looks like it could withstand a significant impact. It tends to \\"ghost\\" and \\"drift\\" quite a bit, with numbers flashing and constantly changing, as if it was picking up an electrical current in the air. Once it locked onto the current the numbers stabilized and I could get an accurate reading. I'm mainly using it for AC and DC voltages, so I can't tell you how well this works with electronics. It would have been better if it came with at least a minimal case to protect the screen, but I'll come up with something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"I primarily use this multimeter for home use. It may seem a bit pricy for home use since you can find a lot cheaper options out there for less than $20.00. I wanted some thing a bit more user friendly but not as expensive as a FLUKE meter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to beat for the price.","review":"I just recently got in to electronics prototyping and felt it would be good to invest in a mid range MM. I've used a Fluke MM at my work and love it but didn't feel the 150+ dollar price-tag was worth the initial investment for the type of work I'm doing. Having said that, the Extech has been great and will work perfectly fine for someone working on small projects. If you're looking for spot on accuracy and perhaps a bit more functionality, fluke is absolutely the way to go.This MM is fine for your average hobbyist and is leaps and bounds better than the cheap ones you'll find at Radioshack.If I had to make this purchase again, I'd go with the Extech."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extech ex330","review":"Item arrived in good time.

I pushed the batteries back into place & it worked like a charm. turns out there is a big enough space in the battery compartment to allow this to happen.

The mice characters are alright graced by headliner actors Bob Newhart & Eva Gabor. Its also a nice dvd package with some great extras, with one outstanding in \\"The Water Birds\\" which was one of Disney's True-life Adventures series.

Not just a great collection of wonderful, charming songs from the beginning of Tin Pan Alley [this material goes back to the turn of the 20th century], but a conscious effort to place them in the context of nostalgia and memory. There are non-musical audio portions of the CD that place one firmly in the firmament of Manhattan, and a lot of the music is either peformed in front of a boisterous tavern audience or made to sound that way. It's a modern trick that doesn't always work - the quality of the crowd is definitely turn of the 21st century on occassion! - but it does add a rich context to the music and the listening experience. It's not jazz, but it's jazzy and great for anyone who loves good American song-writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amusing Nostalgia","review":"This recording presents distinguished songs from 1892-1915, by a group of stellar jazz musicians.

The popular songs of this period are noteworthy more for their amusing and catchy lyrics than any musical distinction, and yet many of these pieces are strictly instrumental. The background sounds of chatter and dishware make it difficult to understand the lyrics in any case. The CD case is very handsome, yet contains no liner notes, only photos whose relationship to the music is unexplained. If you love the songs of this period, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"Great songs and perhaps great performances, but one cannot tell beacause of the background talk and other noise that goes on constantly during the music.

Bunnell did write that Chief Tenaya's band were Paiutes. Not once did he write they were Miwoks. That was mistakenly written later by those who did not meet the original inhabitants of Yosemite, but met those who followed the soliders and miners, there guides, scouts and workers...the Miwoks.

She populates The Year of Our War with original, absurb creatures, but unlike Mieville, she doesn't make them interesting, believable, or logical. They are scenery; they make cameos, but they never add substance to the story. That's the flaw in this novel: Too much style, not enough substance. Once the weirdness factor becomes familiar, the novel's allure wears off. All of the supporting characters are flat, and the protagonist is barely likable. There is not enough backstory and exposition: For example, some of the characters are immortal yet they die in battle. What's the point of immortality of some thug can stick a knife in your back?

Still, Brown's systematics, based on his seminary lectures, should be read and re-read by modern theologians and laymen; after all, how many systematics end each section with words such as: \\"Now, O my soul, think what astonishing displays of Jehovah's perfections appear in this covenant!\\" Buy it, read it, live it."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad auto shut off.","review":"This item claims that it's auto shut off but I haven't used this item for a while few months to a year and when I tried to turn it on, the battery went dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inexpensive and nicely engineered","review":"What more could anyone want from a digital caliper beyond accuracy, durability, and functionality.

This fit the bill. I know the product description says up to 62 inches only but I took the chance and it worked out. It would probably go another half inch. Installation was a breeze and each side is screwed into the wall by 9 screws so you know it's sturdy and well fastened. My 1 year old runs up to the gate and collides with it constantly and it shows no sign of breaking or weakening so far. I do have one gripe, it's not the easiest to collapse or expand. It tends to get stuck on itself, but a little tugging and it's good to go. That's while I only gave it 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition and easy to use!","review":"This is a GREAT baby gate! I love that it folds up and swings to the side to sit even with the wall, nothing sticks out in the doorway when its not being used and its sturdy too.

Thanks and I would definately recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really what I was looking for","review":"I returned this item soon after I purchased it. I was excited that it expands without having to buy the extra pieces other gates would require for my large opening. This just didn't work out. It's too big. I don't know that it's fait to give it only 2 stars just because it didn't work for me, so if you're looking for a gate that expands pretty much the entire distance it says it does, then this may work for you.

We took it down and returned it. This was for a kitchen entrance where there is high traffic, and each time we go through this gate, we had to be very patient, for it is wobbly and you need to latch it shut - have it aligned just right and it is soooo frustrating!

The thing is ugly. It's just a lot of plastic, everywhere. I knew it was plastic, but once I saw it, I just wasn't impressed. I gave it a chance anyway, because we have odd doorways which are wider than most so I wanted to see how it would work. It's clunky. It's a pain to open and close. It wobbles back and forth and if you have little ones, it could potentially pinch or catch their fingers. Plus, it seemed a bit difficult for our 6 year old to operate. It would make a great pet gate, we just don't think it's a great kid gate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gate for dogs!!!","review":"I recently purchased this gate hoping that it would work better than the wooden ones they have out there and I was so pleased!

There are other machines ranked a bit higher but they will cost at least $100-$200 more and it didn't seem like you would begetting that much more value. I decided if we liked this one in our bedroom it would still be cheaper to buy a second one for our living room than to buy one of the other brand's larger and more expensive versions.It came today and within an hour my boyfriend and I both seemed to already notice a difference. The air feels fresher and cleaner--and smells better. Not to mention it is really quiet--even on high. The only mode that is a bit more noticeable is Turbo and even that just sounds like a fan turned on high. It was easy to set-up and is easy to use.

In theory changing the filters should restore all function. Winix seems reluctant to do anything as they tell me \\"We've never had one fail.\\" All I can say is there's always a first time.

Well, not impressed - i can't see a difference at all in air quality and my husband is still suffering. The auto setting is a great concept but operates far too low so it might as well be turned off and also it isn't sensitive to light so it doesn't alter in daylight (i thought it was supposed to - maybe I am wrong). The turbo setting is the only setting where I MAY get yellow or red lights indicating dust or smell which I know being in the room is totally inaccurate - but it sounds a bit like a freight train coming thru your room.

A prize in Cannes and Academy award in the Best Foreign Language Film category. This adaptation of a ballad of the XIVth century tells the story of a young virgin who's raped in the forest by three vagrants while riding to the church. I don't know what to admire most in this film: Ulla Isaksson's screenplay that is so keen with its references to fairy tales (the Little Red Riding Hood, for instance) or the description of the antagonism Paganism/Christianism, Sven Nykvist's photography which literally re-creates before our eyes paintings of the Middle Ages or at last the formidable artistic fusion that existed between Ingmar Bergman and his actors. No place for improvisation in Bergman's cinema! I also must praise this Criterion release because of the added boni, such as the 2005 Gunnel Lindblom/ Birgitta Pettersson interview or the recorded seminar given by Ingmar Bergman in the American Film Institute in 1975. Masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"not for the weak of belly","review":"Never been a great fan of Bergman's films.

But I'd say Last House On The Left (directed by Wes Craven) is just as strong and gut-churning, if not stronger. The only thing that is hard to take is the absolutely moronic and UNFUNNY keystone cops segment that takes place between all the wrenching mayhem.Hey, Wes, people who love and respect horror DO NOT WANT TO SEEANYTHING BLATANTLY FUNNY TAKE PLACE BETWEEN THE HEAVY AND SERIOUS ACTION. Get it?Sutle, dark humor (as in the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre) is acceptable...but nothing beyond that--unless you're doing UBER CRAPlike Scream #36 (for the bucks...that you grubbers can't seem to get enough of, no matter how much you take in.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth owning.","review":"If you are like me and don't have the opportunity to get to see or record all of the Giants games for reasons beyond your control, this package is just right for you.

The only postgame feature they had was the ceremony...NOT the best. The rest include conversations with Manning, the receiving corp and David Tyree. Personally, I look for the post game analysis as the most interesting. In addition, the physical nature of the Game with San Francisco was one of the best -- that was omitted.

Plus, the set only comes with VERY basic instructions that are really only suitable for use on the smallest (red) loom and looks awful in the suggested worsted weight yarn (it's very loopy and would get caught on everything).This product might be better if 1. it came with more/better instructions and 2) didn't warp so quickly.If you're going to be making flat panels, stick with the round loom and read up on stitches that will lay flat.

Just this evening, I got out IF YOU WERE MY BUNNY and had him snuggle into my lap with delight.IF YOU WERE MY BUNNY manages to hit a wonderful balance. It is purely sweet, without seeming overly so.

Are we making the world a better place for the next generation by implying to them over and over in children's literature that absent or irrelevant fathers is a universal law of nature?Go ahead and read them this book, but dare to switch the genders around every now and then.

Any freak error, slump, bloop single, hailstorm, heat wave, domestic disturbance, sore arm, mental block, drunk-driving arrest, broken toe, hamstring pull, bad burrito, tainted shellfish, or attack of hemorrhoids at the wrong time, in the wrong set of circumstances, was enough to tip a potential championship season into the Dumpster.\\" Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Carl Hiaasen of baseball!","review":"If you like Carl Hiaasen, you'll love this completely dark, twisted, and hilarious tale of Red Sox baseball, a rookie phenom, and serial murder.

My biggest issue - There was only one person in the entire book even remotely likeable. And he was constantly abused on a grand scale.

Often likened to The Princess Bride, it is much more realistic. It gives us the lost domain, or the dream of what once was, and kindles the desire to find it again. But as we are questing for the recapture of the dream, so to does Alain-Fournier give us the reality of what we will find. In this respect, the meaning of this novel continues to be applicable today. Certainly a story for the ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"unimpressive translation of one of the greatest novels ever","review":"I taught this novel in my French Lit class this week. I was terribly disappointed by this translation, which is British, and very old. My students, for the most part well-read graduate students, didn't get the novel at all. This shoddy and dated translation does not grasp the lyricism, the poetry, the imagination and the easy flow of Alain-Fournier's prose. There are many better translations. I fear this one was chosen because it was easiest to get a hold of, probably because the publishers didn't have to pay a fee.

They do have sharp blades on most of them, but i'm not sure how quick they wear down or break. Good for dirty jobs that you don't want to get a $50 knife messed up.

But I had to skim the last 100 or so pages because I knew how it was going to turn out and the dialog wasn't fun or enjoyable to me. It may be true that Randall and Emma are true to life, but they're just not people I wanted to spend anymore time with. It's too often that teasing is confused with bulling and I think that Randal in particular was abusive and domineering towards the end, with the excuse of he's the cop so it's Ok.Authority figures are tough to portray well, but authors can write characters as roll models. When there are those ideal authority figures, children can be children and that's very dimensional and rich. For Randal to be the love interest and not be nice to Molly is just un-excusable. And for Emma to be un-parented and friend to Molly is un-healthy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great mystery from Elaine Flinn","review":"Elaine Flinn, one of today's best writers of traditional mysteries, returns this month with \\"Deadly Collection,\\" the latest installment in her charming series about Molly Doyle, an antiques dealer in Carmel, Calif.Molly is hired to auction the contents of a grand estate that once belonged to a pair of Hollywood set designers.

I didn't really expect that energy and emotion to carry on to their cd, but it did and the cd didn't leave my cd player for a week. Both women know their instruments (they each play multiple) which leaves them room to have fun in their performances. Their songwriting is fresh, creative, contemplative, and makes you want to dance. It's a great road trip cd, or can fill that quiet void when you just want to listen to some good writing put to music. They fact that they have fun at what they do comes through in their music.

Those who know this film surely love it. But let me continue with what a previous review stated...the DVD stinks.While the film elements are probably the best available, it would appear no work went into its mastering. There are some annoying (and distracting) twitches that go on throughout most of the film. These are undoubtedly a result of the poorly maintained film element. The soundtrack is serviceable, if a little too low. There are also no real extra features here (of course for a little over 10 bucks, one can't expect much).

This movie is about love and how each character finds love and loves in a certain way. I have enjoyed Doris Day's comedy, but being young, I had never heard her sing before. I was truly surprised to hear such a sweet voice. I got this movie just so I could see Frank Sinatra sing \\"Someone To Watch Over Me\\".

I love the design of the case, the picture is great and far clearer than most fans are used to. But how is the film itself? Excellent.

If you look on the side of the case in the upper area above the title you will see the words \\"rental\\", I did some research and found that an authorized chinese dvd company was renting these out, so it wasn't really for the general public to own but no matter how you cut it its a chinese import with a nice case that will fit into your collection nicely. Plus the Chinese writing makes it look ultra cool in your collection. as far as the movie itself, it is one of the best, its a little move violent then most godzilla movies but the concept is very cool and creative. I would jump on this now before they release the official american dvd very soon because I have a feeling this will be rare. Oh and yes, the behind the scenes feature after the film is so COOL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad to have it in my collection...","review":"These DVDs (Godzilla DVD Collection) are made in China and are not of the best quality -- the special features simply run at the end of each film (I still haven't found a menu to access them directly), and the digital transfers are a bit sloppy. However, because a number of G films are either unavailable in America or have been heavily modified for our market, I'm glad to add them to my Godzilla collection, despite their flaws.

Godzilla, haunted rose bushes, missile launching hover-crafts, psychics, Supra driving asassins. Theres alot of stuff going on in this movie for sure. However, unlike Godzilla's 60's adventures, this movie definantly has a dark and more serious feel to it. I really appreciated that touch when I saw this movie for the first time when I was a kid and still do today. I prefer Godzilla as a menace to society, and thats what he is here. Godzilla provides as much fear to the military figures in this film as the mutated monstrocity, Biollante. This movie is probably not for everyone though.

Years later Shiragami creates the mutant plant Biollante, using his daughter's and G's DNA! When Godzilla is freed from the volcano by an explosion, the creatures clash. Godzilla is only defeated by a combo of Anti Nuclear Bacteria and Biollante. An excting movie and I Highly reccommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Godzilla.","review":"Interesting Gonzilla flick.

That's a very thoughtful idea since most people remember the original English dub on VHS and it would be a disappointment to hear only an entirely new rendition. Of course, it will also contain an updated 7.1 mono original Japanese version. Biollante was never released on DVD in the U.S. so now we, finally, get both the blu-ray and dvd. Aside, from the nuts and bolts of the package lets not forget most importantly that this a lovely, thoughtful, well-acted edition to the Godzilla lexicon. It's my favorite and I'm not going to mince words with anyone who disagrees. We all have our favorites and, of course, there are those who prefer pretentious films like \\"There Will Be Blood\\". To each is own.

Godzilla vs Biollante","review":"HiDoes anyone know if the DVD version is also widescreen, the Amazon info just shows fullscreen, I would rather not have to get it on Blu-Ray, the reasons, its been my experience that most old movies look like crap on blu ray, if your lucky it my look like a regular DVD. Sometimes they look better than DVD. For me if its before the year 2000, rent it, or borrow it from the library on Blu first, to check it out, before you buy it.. A few examples Blue Thunder, no difference between blu or dvd, Casablanca, very almost not noticeable difference between blu and dvd, the Wizard of Oz 75th anni edtion, brighter, sharper on blu, but a grainny mess, who glued a screen door to my tv....The Avengers Blu is the only way to watch, outside of a theatre.....the 5 stars are because i can't put out this review without a rating, and I do love the Godzilla movies, except the American one, where they forgot to put Godzilla in it.....lol"},{"rating":"2","title":"biollante blu ray","review":"i bought both dvd and blu ray of this movie, been waiting forever for this. the blu ray picture is good, considering its a 1989 movie, and its a godzilla movie, it does say 1080p on the box, maybe the original films/transfers were not as good? though imo the destroy all monsters blu ray might have had a better picture. the english dub is low mono. i had to turn up my surround sound way up to hear it. but i did switch between english and japanese to see if it was the disk itself. and it is only the english version that is low, the japanese sounds amazing. the movie is in widescreen and my dvd does say widescreen on it too. being this was only 7.99 for blu ray and 4.99 for dvd i can't really complain. they did a great job with this release and i'm happy to finally own it on blu ray/dvd. godzilla fans will love this, and we can finally retire our old vhs tapes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disapointed...","review":"I've been looking for this title on DVD for a long time as both this and it's predecessor \\"Godzilla 1985\\" have not had an American release on DVD for some odd reason - all the rest of the Heisei series have DVDs for sale here. So knowing that it's likely an \\"un-official\\" copy I expected a poor print. The good news is that the print isn't that bad, the bad is that like the previous try this disk gets about half way in and starts freezing up. Unless you own a universal DVD player, my suggestion would be to avoid these disks and continue to wait until ToNo or Sony decide to release the two disk themselves, which for the life of me makes no sense why they didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"BIOLLANTE IS HUGE!!!","review":"Godzilla was cool on this movie. I did not like the reason it was widescreen. The title picture is very impressive. The beginning of the movie was just like destoroyah vs. godzilla beginning the ending fight or final battle I really liked. I can't beleive a little rose turned into a 120 meter 200,000 ton big ugly monster that can stand up to godzilla! Without biollante Spacegodzilla would not be complete. The funny part was when those army guys started acting crazy. I do remember the funny song when I heard it for the first time it cracked me up! It had a black godzilla and I really like black godzilla's alot! The title cover over exaggerated biollante. Overall I give this movie 5 stars, good job toho!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was lousy back then and its lousier on blu ray now","review":"This is one of the worst blu-ray transfer I have seen, its just lousy, worse than say an upconverted regular dvd.Second and finally the story is slooooow and forgettable, not much godzilla in this one. And the rose godzilla monster copy just falls apart when smacked up a bit.Personally this is my least favorite, mostly due to minimal godzilla, the maudlin pacing wooden acting, the godzilla ray reflector, and silly story in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Biollante alone","review":"I love this movie for the Godzilla suit design, but especially for Biollante.Biollante was and is the largest kaiju suit ever created, and by far the most impressive. It Hollywood can learn to create a monster as life-like and awesome as Biollante we wouldn't be rolling our eyes at every singe CGI monster they shell out for us (cross your fingers the 2014 Godzilla movie somehow does it right)For Godzilla fans it is worth the buy, but for others it i probably worth just a rent."},{"rating":"1","title":"My review thoughts","review":"I chose this rating because the DVD dose not give you many options for choosing English translation.

What's NOT to Like?","review":"I have only seen the American version of this movie and found it very enjoyable. The situations are interestring and sometimes funny. The action is great. The motorcycly stunt with Yeoh near the end, I have read, was a first for her. They basically put her on the bike, aimed her and let it go.It's great to see more and more people getting into these movies as the actors give thier all when doing them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoyahhhhhhhhhh...........","review":"For all of you people that think that there is too much non-Jackie action, you are wrong. There is one 8 minute action scene where there is grenades, handguns, machine guns, and bazooka's. Thats all. There is tons of acrobatic Jackie action. INcluding the ending in which he has a hand to hand fight with 2 thugs. The fight with a karate master, the party fight, the helicopter battle, and the roof battle. Their is tons of Jackie action. And a boat race, that doesnt have any Jackie action. But sometimes you need some other action besides his typical cheesy fights. Thats why this is a good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Action movie + decent Chan movie = Woo hoo!","review":"Let me say I'm a big fan of Michelle Yeoh, whom Co-stars in this movie, but she ends up not showing off her martial arts prowess as much as I'd like. At any rate, this was a good action movie, all you new fans of Chan will probably not want to get this one yet, but you action fans that liked \\"Blade,\\" or \\"Universal Soldier\\" will love this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plenty of action, but not JACKIE action.","review":"While this film obviously had a huge budget and high production values, it seemed to forget that Jackie was the star. SUPERCOP relies heavily on car chases, gunplay, and explosions, and Jackie doesn't need those; we Chan fans want the action to come from his acrobatic body, not from an arsenal. (Oddly enough, though Jackie didn't do much martial artistry in this film, someone -- an American distributor, I'm guessing? -- thought it would be cute to have \\"(Everybody Was) Kung Fu Fighting\\" playing over the credits/outtakes -- OUCH!)I also get the feeling that this was really meant to be a star vehicle for the worthy Michelle Yeoh, and Jackie was included just to attract a larger audience. Nevertheless, the breathtaking climax on the train and the helicopter ladder are worth waiting for -- however, thanks to the fast forward button, I doubt I *will* wait through the rest of the action when I want to watch those final scenes again."},{"rating":"1","title":"stick with original","review":"Why American production make HK movies look so cheap? First of all, they cut off so much scene, second of all ruin it by making look act so dumb by English Dubb. ALWAYS stick with ORIGINAL LICENSED HK RELEASE. Be careful with cheap imports, boots, and bulls though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Supercop","review":"The movie is ok but it is a superior film in Cantonese. The dubbed English is awkward and detracts from the film. I find the \\"dubbing\\" very annoying and would prefer the vintage Hong Kong Jackie Chan films marketed in the US be provided in the original language. Argggh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The adventures of Kai-Kui (Kevin Chan) continue!","review":"Among all of the American releases of Jackie Chan films, this one is the best. Though it is the third chapter of the \\"Police Story\\" series, the tone is much different from the first two. Jackie directed the first two and they are surprisingly really intense. Sure, there are some funny bits, but the action is razor sharp and Jackie gets really pissed off several times. In \\"Supercop\\" the tone is much lighter, maybe due to the direction by Stanley Tong. But don't get me wrong, this film is still great entertainment. Jackie and Michelle Yeoh (Billed as Michelle Khan) make a great team and trade stunts right and left. The final chase scene involving an armoured car, Chan hanging from a ladder of a speeding helicopter, Michelle jumping onto a moving train with a motorcycle, and the two of them taking down thugs on top of the train is something to behold. Maggie Cheung also returns again as Jackie's girlfriend."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his best action movies","review":"This is one of his best action movies that he\`s done.

Since when do you find sex in a Jackie Chan movie. Every Chan movie I've seen has been appropriate for kids under 8 and then I saw this and I did not think some scenes were appropriate, plus there weren't too many great \\"Chan\\" stunts. It was a watered down Jackie Chan. Before you buy this, rent it, or buy Who Am I?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Since when does Jackie let a woman upstage him!?!?!?!","review":"From what I saw of this film, The girl that he was with did most of the fighting!

That film is better then this mess of a movie..."},{"rating":"1","title":".","review":"Eh. Less exciting than Chan's other American movies, with precious few hand-to-hand fights and many notable lulls.

Ondaatje does much justice to his home of Sri Lanka, lavishing its beutiful jungles with his beautiful words. The book follows an internationally appointed foreinsic pathologist, Anil, and her search for the cause of the deaths of young men on Sri Lanka. She stumbles into a web of politics and murder that becomes dangerous, greusome and heartbreaking.

However, having finished it, I had to ask myself what, at bottom, it was all about. My conclusion: here it was again, the old elaborate, poststructural striptease. Ondaatje may be Sri Lankan in origin, but he has clearly bought into the by now hoary Parisian cliche that there is no ultimate truth, no way of getting at the ultimate non-truth, but a lot of teasing and withholding to be done in the process. I could not escape the thought, that in this process, Ondaatje enjoyed impressing us with his vast knowledge of all kinds of non-related topics, which furnished the veils for his striptease.

Skipping all over from Anil's past to the present action of the story, the reader works very hard to stay on track, but which track? The characters seem little more than cardboard cut outs who move through a hostile landscape. The author offers, early and often, the message that man's inhumanity to man is to be expected and that nothing can be done to change that.

Anil is intropective, but surprisingly numb. She seems disassociated from herself and her feelings.Suddenly, the book turns into a heavy handed political statement. Anil is lost as the author takes the cheap and easy route to make a rather banal point, which just kills any legitimate emotional involvement.

All of the characters are drawn in broad strokes inspiring little interst with the exception of Gamini. Could this have been a manuscript that the author started years ago & went back to finish?

Whatever you do, don't read this first."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of beautiful writing","review":"This was one of those books that I only pushed through because I was reading it for book club. And even then, I didn't finish it completely, getting the gist of the end from others in the club. There was just so much of the book I didn't care about. Some parts were interesting, but others just seemed to be there as a writing exercise.I generally read a book like this because I want to learn more about the event in the background, in this case, the Sri Lankan civil war. But I really came out of it no more knowledgeable than I was going in, and even worse, it didn't even ignite a desire to learn more from other sources. The war and its circumstances really get lost in all of Anil's... stuff.The one positive thing I can say about the book is that it really is beautifully written. I just wish those beautiful words were woven into a more cohesive and interesting story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"This was so bad I just scanned the last half or so and I almost never do that.

Some of the sections are just haunting, and the prose is beautiful. But the overall pace of the book is very slow, and there is no compelling plotline. It's possible to pick the book up, read a couple of pages, and then put the book back down again for days. So it's not a summer, take to the beach, book. But if that's not what you're looking for, this is a beautiful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"I have to say that when I bought this book I thought it would grab me from the first page, but sadly it didn't. It was extremely slow and too factual, most of it was in \\"past tense\\" and made me feel as if perhaps there was another book that I should have read before this one. Maybe it just wasn't my style. I was part of the small population of people who enjoyed \\"The English Patient\\". I feel like I let someone down for not finishing this book.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drudgery","review":"I really wanted to give this book a chance, but am abandoning that notion. I'm halfway through it and it has become a chore to finish it. I came to this site to check out the reviews to see if other readers say it gets better towards the end, but it doesn't seem so. Overall, it seems that the readers either loved it or hated it. Unfortunately, I am of the latter opinion for the very same reasons that the ones who didn't enjoy the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rare Beauty","review":"Ondaatje has, in Anil's Ghost, managed to convey the full horror and senselessness of civil war/genocide. Through all-too-human, vulnerable and flawed but deeply honorable characters, he takes us through the madness that has taken hold of Sri Lanka (but could be any other country riven by warring factions) and personalized it so that we get a clear and painful inside look at how people are destroyed, both physically and emotionally. His language is simple yet profoundly eloquent, spare (as only a poet can make it) and sharpened so finely that the overall effect is akin to a slim blade through the heart. For anyone who's ever wondered what it might be like to have your homeland eviscerated from the inside out, Anil's Ghost will supply all the answers. It's an exquisite, heartbreaking book. Most highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sri Lankan Beauty and Sri Lankan Horrors to Haunt","review":"This book was beautiful and disturbing. In and through the weavings of human grief and beauty, Ondaatje also characterized the country of Sri Lanka. The discriptions of rampant political violence were frightening and heart rending. But I came to love Sri Lanka more than any character. It would have been nice to have a map of Sri Lanka handy to locate the frequent references to place names.As noted by another reviewer there are many memorable phrases. One quote I liked was:\\"The important thing is to be able to live in a place or a situation where you must use your sixth sense all the time.\\"I loved Anil's Ghost, but would recommend it only to those who love Sri Lanka, poetry, or Ondaatje."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fragmented, hopeless story.","review":"An ill-defined investigation into the identity of a murder victim's skeleton forms a shaky framework for \\"Anil's Ghost,\\" a story of civil war-torn Sri Lanka. The story, such as it is, is told in disjointed bits, unrelated in time or place. This needn't have been a problem; many effective novels aren't linear. However, the scattered glimpses of people's pasts and characters that comprise \\"Anil's Ghost\\" are more just shards than functioning pieces of a larger whole.This is a fragmented, hopeless story, and reading it was a chore. The only reason I'm not sorry to have spent the time on it is because I could, sometimes, appreciate how its (sort of) poetic style might appeal to another reader.By the work's end I was simply glad to have it over with. I'm not in a hurry to read more from Michael Ondaatje."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anil's Ghost","review":"Didn't really \\"get\\" this book.

I've picked it up, I've put it down, I've picked it up again, and finally the last time I decided to put it down on the seat on the subway next to me and pretend I never bought it in the first place.

I thought the subject matter and the characters would be very compelling and interesting. Alas, I was wrong. The book plods along endlessly, with excruciatingly slow plot development and very poor character development.

I was in Sri Lanka in '88-'89, the peak of the JVP vs government vs LTTE war that serves as backdrop for the book. And at times he really captures the images and moods perfectly. But there's too little Sri Lanka and too much of Anil's (a girl with a boy's name) uninteresting ruminations about her past. Gamini is a little more interesting, but I kept wanting to just get on with the story already. Not a \\"thriller\\", not much suspense or mystery or action. I never got interested in \\"Sailor\\" or understood why this one skeleton was a big deal. What little action there is happens blandly. Bo-ring. It reminded me for some reason of John Le Carre's \\"A Perfect Spy\\" (which I read while at an abandoned resort in Sril Lanka), another tedious, boring and disappointing book about what should be an exciting topic. In both books we get lots of dreamy reflection and an ugly but strangely anticlimatic ending"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, Slow, Slow, and did I mention, Slow!","review":"I couldn't get pass the first 70 pages. The book is so dark and dreary that the story doesn't really moving fast enough. There are too many mysteries that don't really make sense. I really tried to stick with it to see if it would go any where because I like the author's previous work, but I just lost my patience.

After spending some time in the town, however, he discovers that he feels differently about the situation that he thought and carefully plans to preserve the town, eventually enlisting the assistance of the extremely eccentric CEO of Knox Oil, played by the wonderful Burt Lancaster.The comedy in this film is generally quite subtle and sly, but it is a joy to behold with attentive viewing. All players are perfectly cast, and the direction and photography is first-rate. The icing on the cake is the beautiful and haunting soundtrack by Mark Knopfler, which was actually what drew me to the film in the first place.I recommend \\"Local Hero\\" highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie - so, so DVD","review":"This is a funny, quirky comedy with a great cast, great characters, and beautiful views of Scotland. If you are too young to remember Burt Lancester, he is totally out of character in this film and he is great. Peter Riegert is gorgeous and does wonders as the Houston oil-man slowly being transformed by this little Scottish community. A shot of the oil men striding across the beach in full business uniform, briefcase in hand is contrasted nicely with a later scene of Riegert strolling with his pants legs rolled up and his expensive watch forgotten in incoming tide. The timeless wonder of this movie is aptly descibed in many other reviews. I mainly wanted to comment on my disappointment in the quality of the DVD. With a Mono soundtrack and 4-to-3 TV-quality views it could have been much better done. What happened to the original film?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The finest of quirky little films","review":"If you love quirky films about real people just trying to make their way in this world - you will love this film. Burt Lancaster is marvelous as the head of Knox Oil and gas. The writing is relaxed and honest and as \\"Mac\\" is heading off into the sunset to the lulling music of Mark Knopfler, you feel a tragic loss to his character."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful comedy","review":"A very quiet, warm comedy about the pleasures of life found in pristine places. A Houston-based oil company wants to buy a whole village in Scotland for an oil refinery and sends a representative (Peter Riegert) to make a deal. The twist is that the townspeople can't wait to sell and make all the money they can. Gradually Riegert comes to love the place and wants to chuck his yuppie lifestyle and move there. Bert Lancaster is the CEO of the oil company, more enchanted with astronomy than oil. This is a rare comedy of a different sort - more like the pleasure of warm brandy on a winter's night than raucousness. Very appealing and well done all around. Definitely worth a watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mixed reviews","review":"Lent this to a friend, and she said after watching it, \\"What was that about?\\" This movie hit me on the deepest level, but apparently the eye of the beholder has much to do about how one enjoys this. This is one of my favorite films, but the DVD is a pretty poor transfer. The late scene where the female biologist/geologist departs is nearly invisible. Still, the sense of finding something one didn't even know they wanted, then losing it, is the heartbreaking conclusion of this extremely funny film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scotch Whimsy","review":"\\"Local Hero\\" is a sweet film that falls short of greatness through overlength and a self-consious cutesiness. The story is a good one. An Texas oil acquisitions man named MacIntyre (Peter Riegert) goes to Scotland to purchase unspoiled coastal land from the populace and they want to sell! This is more of a character piece and there's plenty of good ones. Burt Lancaster delivers another classic performance as Felix Happer, the stargazing petroleum company president who subjects himself to abuse therapy to keep his ego in check. I was also enchanted by Jenny Seagrove as the amphibious marine biologist. Director Bill Forsythe introduces to many cute elements that detract from the film most notably an African town minister and a lovable Russian fisherman(this came out during the Cold War) with an affinity for cowboy songs. The film is sumptuously photographed by Chris Menges who later won Oscars for \\"The Killing Fields\\" and \\"The Mission\\". Charmer that just falls a wee bit short."},{"rating":"2","title":"Local Hero Movie","review":"A fun little movie from the past.

You just keep gaping: how can anybody be that bad?The little girl, Melissa Hart, is very cute. I hope she got the parts she deserves.The story is the length of a short-short, so there's a lot of treading water in this show. The gratuitous nastiness to the woman customer who had traveled all the way across town in the snow was stunning.

I'm waiting for the RMA now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hallstrom - Genius.","review":"This film underlines the genius of Hallstrom, in as much that he gets two actors working together, like Phoenix and Reeves in My Own Private Idaho, or the two kids in My Life as a Dog, and you can't imagine anyone else in their parts. In this movie, DiCaprio as the near dysfunctional Arnie gives the performance of a lifetime and one day I hope to see him acting this well again. Depp, as Gilbert, gives a strikingly austere performance of someone who finds strength from the simple optimism of being alive. Surrounded by an ensemble of actors who give their all, it turns into, simply; a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"OFFBEAT AND ORIGINAL!","review":"Here's a film that didn't do well in theaters, but is a fine example of good filmmaking. This offbeat story is filled with colorful characters and many great performances. Johnny Depp in a complex role delivers a subtle performance, Dicaprio is equally as good as his retarded younger brother and Juliette Lewis is wonderful as a free spirited traveler who enters their lives.

AND, let me say that I was gravely dissapointed. Since I loved the book so much I thought the movie would be great. Other than Leonardo DiCaprio's performance, I found the movie just boring. And another complaint: They turned this movie into a comedy! IT'S NOT A COMEDY. It is a sad, moving story. I am not the kind of person who is going to crack just because someone in the movie is ovverweight.

It makes jokes about obesity & retardation. I find neither one of these issues to be humorous. I also found the movie to be quite depressing. I expected so much more from Johnny Depp. Also I never believe it to be a good idea for a non mentally handicapped person to portray one in movies. To think Dicapprio was nominated for an Oscar is enough to make me doubt the sanity of the Oscar committee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect, just what i needed","review":"This was just what I was looking for, brand new and fast shipping. thank you for being a fast shipper"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best movie i have seen in 15 years-i'm 15 years old","review":"What's Eating Gilbert Grape is the most spectacular motion picture ever made. I have watched it so many times, I have it memorized. Seriously, give me any scene and I'll recite it for you. It is so deep and meaningful. My brother and I sit around reciting scenes from the movie for our entertainment. We decided that it has every good quality that a movie should have: humor, drama, romance, violence, profanity, nudity, etc. If you are ever in the mood to see a freakishly outstanding movie, consider this one. Words cannot express the way I feel after watching this movie. You'll have to watch it for yourself. If you have any appreciation for a true work of art, you'll watch this movie. Take it from me- I've seen it thousands of times and it never ceases to take my breath away."},{"rating":"2","title":"DiCaprio astounding in this","review":"When I first saw this sweet and unpretentious little slice-of-life film, I was impressed by its quirky appeal, but, because I had no idea at the time who Leo DiCaprio was yet, I'd assumed that they'd hired a little mentally challeged kid who could read lines--- I had NO IDEA it was just a \\"regular\\" actor.Wow. And Depp is pretty good too."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best movie I've seen with Di Caprio in it.","review":"Apart from the \\"Titanic\\", this movie is probably the best with Leonardo, playing a mentally disordered kid. His acting was superb and made a good illustration of the character \\"Arnie\\".The plot is pretty straight forward; Gilbert Grape, the main character, played by Johnny Depp, goes through a stranded life, having to look after his family: his mother Bonnie (a 500 pounder), his two sisters, Amy and Ellen, and last but not least, Arnie, the star actor of the whole film.You all watched the movie, so I won't bother talking about it, but I'd have to praise Leo. His acting is funny, dramatic and completely surprising. The best character I've seen him playI don't know about the ending though. Rather sudden..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Johnny's movie all the way!","review":"Yeah, Leo was OK, but Johnny Depp was the best in this movie! He did a wonderful job @ playing Gilbert, and he would be a wonderful brother to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Action flick? No. Good film? Yes.","review":"Although this film may not entertain the masses, it has qualities that make this a great film. Not only does Hollywood attempt to deliver a message they attempt to do so while pitting to great actors with each other. Leonardo and the legendary Johnny Depp, make a fantastic acting duo.You can read all about the film through the reviews here, but I will honestly tell you this is a good film to see and just possible own. I have added to my collection due to the fact I've become star struck each time I see a Johnny Depp film. Each time he is doing something completely different than the last character wise. But acting wise he always the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Quiet Gem","review":"This is a quiet, intriguing, and odd little film. It has it's little charm. Johnny Depp, who is very good, plays Gilbert Grape wrestling to take care of his family, which includes his morbidly obese mother, and his mentally retarded brother played by Leonardo DiCaprio, who will knock your pants off in a flat out brilliant performance. He deserved the Oscar for this. This is an interesting film. It's sad, in a way, and that's why it's odd. You want to be sad but the characters themselves don't show enough emotion. It's like they don't care enough. That's one of the oddities that fill this movie. Darlene Cates, who plays the mother, is wonderful. She, and Leonardo, are real. They bring it off so believeably. Do yourself a favor and give this hidden gem a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Story...about the Greatest Person","review":"Gilbert Grape is obviously looking for a new life...an escape from his tiny town, Endora. In this movie, Johnny Depp portrays a small-town boy who accomplishes his goal as being a good person.Gilbert is the brother of a mentally ill boy named Arnie(Grammy-winning performance by Leonardo DiCaprio), a motherly sister, and a bratty teenager. His mother, who he compares to \\"a beached whale\\" is overweight and ashamed of herself. In this movie, Gilbert helps his loved ones realize that they should be doing more with their lives.I recommend this movie to everyone who has dreams to reach."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this movie for a different reason every time I watch it.","review":"There's so much wonderfulness here, it's hard to pinpoint exactly what it is about this movie that makes it so great.

Leonardo D. is so great when I first watched the Movie I didn't even realize that it was him, he play's the part so well, and of course Johnny D. is also awesome in this movie. Depicts how a Family works together through some tough times and in the end they make a tough choice, which ultimately is to honor their Mother. I will watch this movie again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"whats eatting gilbert grape?","review":"this movie reminded me of a brother and saw it once but never could find to buy it when i had the money. i am amazed that it was new for the price i paid, arrived so quickly i was thinking i had the order date wrong and to see stars sooooo young and so good at the work they do is amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible movie","review":"I didn't care for this movie at all. The characters were forgetable and undeveloped. I didn't care about the story line. There really wasn't a plot. Other than and couple of actors who went onto do better things, there is nothing about this movie that I would recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sour Grapes","review":"Story was long and confusing. Gilbert Grape played by Johnny Depp was moody and depressing. He seemed to be quite confused and misguided and one had to assume what he was thinking most of the time. Leonardo DiCapprio's acting was the saving grace for this movie. He had evidently studied his role of the handicapped brother and was very realistic. Would not recommend this unless you have nothing else to do on a rainy afternoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watchable","review":"Fine acting, fine performances, in a realistic enough setting.

I watched half and then gave up."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was a great move....but...","review":"I thought this movie had a great story line. But it just wasn't one of those movies that you could really get into. Nothing exciting ever seemed to happen, it wasn't a movie that made me wanna reach out, or cry over. I just sat there stunned at the idea of how poor this movie was. My friends also saw it, they thought it was a good movie with good actors, i just found it depressingly boring expcially for starring Jonny Depp and Leo..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchable","review":"Okay, granted, I watched about eight minutes of it, but not only did it not hook me, but it repelled me. Before I rake it out, I have two positive things to say: Johnny Depp acted well, and Leonardo DiCaprio, whom I generally cannot watch at all, portrayed the developmentally disabled boy impressively.So, my beefs:1) It reminded me of a non-comedic version of Pink Flamingos, which itself was only watchable because it was comedic.2) Too much weirdness, not enough hook. I'm not into gratuitous freak shows.3) I didn't like the sexual undercurrent vibe -- creeped me out. And when the middle aged lady started coming on to Johnny Depp's character I turned it off. Too pervy and weird.Enough said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"It arrived quickly and the price was right.

See you at the 20 year Valley reunion Peter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exellent acting!!!","review":"This movie opened my eyes the first time I saw it. Well, actually, I had to wait until the movie was over to open my eyes, because they were filled with tears the whole time. Leonardo Dicaprio portrays a eightteen year old, mentally retarted boy. Dicaprio's great acting shows people what it is really like to be mentally retarted at such a young age. Johnny Depp also portrays his brother Gilbert, very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"santafantas","review":"I have seen this movie on TV several times, but wanted a DVD to keep for my own viewing instead of waiting until it came back on TV. It is a good movie. Johnny Depp and Leonardo Dicaprio are fantastic. I actually believed Leonardo to be mentally challenged the first time I saw this movie. He played a very believable role. The show was entertaining and emotional. I have watched it again after receiving my own DVD. I would recommend this DVD to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"must view","review":"This film has a lesson for everyone.

It had a great message about family love and understanding and how family is the most important thing no matter what. And the great actor Johnny Depp was the perfect person to play Gilbert Grape.

I bought it so I could watch it over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's Eating Gilbert Grape","review":"I teach the film, \\"What's Eating Gilbert Grape?\\" at the high school and college level. It's the best vehicle I know of to teach symbolism, foreshadowing, tone, irony (all those English Teacher things that kids usually think of as BORING). Generally speaking, my students love this movie as much as I do. I only teach the film, not the novel. I was disappointed when I finally found and read the book because, in it, Momma is very much the pitiful un-funny joke that she fears herself to be. I do, however, include excerpts from the book to illustrate how differences in tone can change the impact of the story. This is the most carefully crafted film I've ever seen. Every scene, almost every line, reinforces the theme and illuminates the main characters' motivations. In my opinion, \\"What's Eating Gilbert Grape?\\" is as nearly perfect as play writing gets."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"What's Eating Gilbert Grape\\" A must see film!!","review":"Watched this movie for the first time last weekend and I must say, this is one of the best films I've ever seen!!I had no idea Di Caprio was such a marvelous actor!He for sure should have received an Oscar for this performance!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What's Eating Gilbert Grape","review":"Adapted by Peter Hedges from his novel, Hallstrom's endearing, offbeat drama features soulful heartthrob Depp as a fatherless young man with lots of worries and little time for his own happiness. Oscar nominee DiCaprio gives a remarkably tender performance as Arnie, a mentally challenged kid who's difficult to deal with but impossible not to love. Hallstrom develops the quirkier aspects of Hedges's story--including Gilbert's involvement with a lonely wife and a worldly newcomer--with a light comic touch. Excellent support from Lewis, John C. Reilly, Crispin Glover, and nonactress Cates kick things up a notch. Beneath its unusual skin, this \\"Grape\\" is quite sweet."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's Not Eating Gilbert Grape","review":"A poignant, character driven plot about the conflict between responsibilities and longings of a tangible, human soul.

I can see it over and over again. Everyone in the cast is excellent but Leonardo is just so amazing. How does someone so young get such insight into portraying someone totally different from him without making him a caricature? I shouldn't be surprised though - every movie he's been in, he's totally believable. There are many actors who are good looking. What separates Leo from the others is he's not just a pretty face - he's got the talent to match. END"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting movie ... well worth seeing","review":"I've never been a fan of either DiCaprio or Depp. I don't find the former to be of much appeal to me as a heartthrob (LOL!!) and the latter tends to make movies where he portrays someone pretty weird. So, I wouldn't have walked across the street, normally, to see a movie with both of them in it. Well, I'm just out of the hospital, and the movie came on the television, so I watched it.LD did a truly masterful job of his portrayal of the mentally handicapped Ernie. JD did a great performance showing the angst and drama of Gilbert, the oldest sibling who is dealing with the burdens of providing for the family and \\"turning off\\" his own emotional needs. In other words, they both CAN act.I bought the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never go full retard","review":"Nobody gets eaten in this movie?!I watched this with my wife, waiting for some cannibals to chow down on Gilbert Grape. No such luck. No gore whatsoever? No murders, explosions, car chases, or wild stunts either.This is a nice slice of Americana. Movies rarely do half as well at giving a glimpse at real life in America.Depp does an excellent job in a James Dean type role--the charismatic, brooding young flyboy that is stuck in a little one horse town. He takes care of his half-retarded brother, played with natural precision by Leonardo DiCaprio. Juliette Lewis tones down her dysfunctional persona and turns in a stellar performance as the girlfriend.This movie has no real plot, the family just prepares for the son's big 18th birthday party. I had almost forgotten what a normal, coming of age movie was like. Surprisingly, I actually enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's Eating Gilbert Grape","review":"Super plot, great acting, and good scenery of Lockhart Texas.This movie encourages me to remain thin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Small Town Drama","review":"Small towns are great, but we wonder how many small town residents are curious about what else life has to offer. What's over the mountain? What's across the river? What does the new maga-grocery store across town look like? This is the theme of Gilbert Grape, a wonderful character study of some real \\"out there\\" characters. Young Leo DiCapria is totally convincing as a retarded tower climbing youth. Johnny Depp is strong as the young man in the family, who spends so much of his time caring for his brother and grossly obese mother, that he has no time or energy to care about himself. Juliette Lewis plays the pivotal role of Becky, who literally walks into this plot because her grandmothers car breaks down, and helps Depp open his eyes to his own life. Sometimes funny, occasionally sad, and often touching, this is a beautiful movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic!","review":"Classic performances by an awesome cast of actors/actresses!!

I returned the product. Maybe I just got a defective set, but Bodum shouldn't put his name on this poor quality. I can't imagine someone paying full retail.

For the first time since the first movie, Godzilla destroyed Tokyo without fighting a enemy. The Japanese version was good and had a more serious tone to it. The cheap American version had scenes put in with Burr and a couple U.S. Generals and officers. Don't get me wrong, I like Raymond Burr, But those weird officers, drinking their Dr. Pepper, are what almost killed the American version. The new Godzilla looked good and I liked the added dorsal plates on his back. His face looked funny though, his top lip was gigantic and those fangs were too big. The only good thing about the American version is Burr's little speech at the end, something the Japanese didn't have. Overall a o.k. movie with good action scenes and a pretty creative ending. END"},{"rating":"1","title":"A travesty!","review":"What a hatchet job!! Once again, the Big G suffers at the hands of his American distributor. A lot of material has been deleted to make room for goofy scenes of Raymond Burr and Dr. Pepper sipping military officers. These scenes are pointless, irritating, and detract from an otherwise serious film. The humor will invoke the \\"nails-on-chalkboard\\" principle for anyone over five-years-old and, of course, the dubbing is hideous(Contrary to popular belief, this is NOT the fault of the Japanese filmmakers!!!!!).

It is probably the darkest of the series and once again stats Godzilla as a force of nature more than just a monster. The special effects are very good for 1984 and I love how it always focuses in on Godzilla's mouth when he rours. I don't have much to say about this movie becides that I thought it was well done and is worth buying if you like Godzilla.

The editing is just terrible - there are extended scenes of Godzilla just standing about, and the whole thing seems to run out of steam halfway through. Added into the movie are badly-inserted appearances by Raymond Burr, right-wing propaganda and some truly laughable scenes of military types swigging cans of Dr Pepper.This film gets two stars as it is at least better than the dreadful 1998 so-called Godzilla film."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is it?","review":"Godzilla's costume stinks, he barely attacks, and the actors stink.

The plot is \\"Godzilla returns and raids Japan after 30 years\\", thats good, but listen to this,\\"most of the time, he's following BIRDS!\\" mostly he just walks. The plot also is the biggest drag-on in the series. I gave it two stars because of the amazing ending, Ramond Burr returns and Godzilla looks great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hack, slash, edit.","review":"First, an elaboration on the rating: *1/2 for the Americanversion and ***** for the Japanese version.Once again, a seriousJapanese sci-fi film is transformed into laughable trash by its American distributor. The Japanese players have been reduced to basically cameo roles to make way for goofy jokes and shameless product placement(the end of civilization brought to you by your friendly neighborhood soft drink company). The film's themes, fear of nuclear apocalypse, trigger-happy Superpowers desperate to rush to the brink, and the awesome burden placed on the Japanese people by the atomic age, are all either dumbed down or thrown out all-together. No wonder The Big G can't get any respect from the general American populace. All they have to go on is dreck like this. See this film for the spfx, which are excellent.

The lead singer sings way out of her limited range and whoever suggested to her that she attempt to sing Heart songs, well....maybe she might want to rethink that relationship. I'd highly recommend re-playing or re-buying old Heart CD's and listening to the real thing.

The plot, such as it is, is about private eye Harry Angel's attempts to track down a has-been singer by the name of Johnny Favourite, supposedly for a solicitor, Herman Winesap (Dann Florek) and his client Louis Cyphre (Robert DeNiro). In fact, Cyphe is really Lucifer in disguise and the whole film is simply a showcase for New Orleans-based voodoo with thoroughly gruesome effects. The lovely Charlotte Rampling has a brief part as fortune teller Margaret Crusemark before she too is butchered. Angel (Mickey Rourke) has a brief fling with another sorceress Epiphany Proudfoot (Lisa Bonet) before she too ends up in a bloodbath. This film is totally missable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic 80's","review":"This movie is creepy, deep and dark and wouldn't have it any other way.

Robert DeNiro is verrry spooky and if you don't know the story, DON'T ask anyone and be surprised and pleasantly, tingly shocked at the ending!"},{"rating":"2","title":"extraordinary work","review":"Though it may sound like hyperbole, this is one of the best films ever made--and one of the most complex in terms of its references to other films and texts. Though reviewers almost always miss the allusion, the film is a remake of Sophocles' Oedipus Rex. At the conclusion, when Satan says to Johnny, \\"How unlucky is wisdom, Johnny, when it brings no profit to the wise,\\" he is directly quoting Teiresias from the Sophocles play. (Whenever a detective with a foot problem goes looking for a stranger and finds instead himself, Oedipus is usually lurking in the background.) In addition the film contains playful references to the classic film Chinatown and to Diner, where Mickey Rourke first became a star. Also there are literary references to the Book of Genesis and to Poe's \\"Telltale Heart.\\" But even ignoring the references to other texts, this is a marvelous thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great on three accounts","review":"Based on a great novel by William Hjortsberg (Fallen angel).Great actors.Great director.One of the best crime films (with a touch of occultism) I've seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angel Heart","review":"Top Stars for a great drama with lots of thrills. Love The Black Magic perspective. Bounty Hunter with an attitude!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Creepy","review":"Here's a movie that combines suspense, creepiness, and violence. It's shortly after World War II. A New York detective goes in search of a missing person, on behalf of a mysterious client who claims that this person owes him a huge debt. The detective makes his way to New Orleans, visiting a world that is now mostly gone. Like Chinatown, this movie takes you to places that you never imagined at the beginning. The end is unforgettable. And the music is not only good, but enhances the peculiar, atmospheric quality of this strange film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A creepy, haunting thriller...four and a half stars.","review":"Mickey Rourke is a small-time private detective hunting for the whereabouts of a missing man on behalf of secretive client played by Robert DeNiro. A trail of gruesome murders and black magic take him from New York to New Orleans, to an alluring voodoo priestess played by Lisa Bonet and a truly shocking end.Not for children or young teens - the original (uncut) version was edited to avoid an NC-17 rating due to explicit sex scene, and murders are of a brutal nature. However, the uncut version is definitely better than R-rated. Scenes are not gratuitous - this a very dark, creepy tale of evil with enough mystery that you want to watch to the very end to find out just what the hell is going on.Excellent acting by Mickey Rourke - nobody else had the acting intensity to play this character in my opinion.Good use of sinister lighting and images to give film a darker, creepier aspect throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"One CREEPY Flick","review":"I'm a big Mickyey Rourke fan, as an aside, what in the world happened to him, he blew up like a ballon. Steroids? Anyways, this is my favorite Rourke movie and he's superb in the roll of a private eye on the downside. Alan Parker creates an atmosphere that's dark, evil, and builds in creepiness. Watch for the fans, even into the final scene. I've seen this movie 10 times and I still get goosebumps watching it at nite, alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's the NR version???","review":"I can't believe they went to all the trouble of transferring this to DVD and then didn't release the 'Not Rated' version! The R version is great, though, and I highly recommend it. It's fantastically filmed... very atmospheric."},{"rating":"2","title":"search for personal hell","review":"Eventhough the performances of Mickey Rourke, Rober De Niro and Charlotte Rampling earned a lot of praise and are mostly talked about when this film is discussed, its greatest value is its ultimate noir quality. As Raymond Chandler once put it, every detective in a real good mystery is really in search of himself, simultaneously trying to evade his personal hell. Harry Angel, the detective in this film, is epitome of that kind of detective. I also liked the New Orleans-style blues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy Film Noir that will scare and delight you!","review":"This film is full of haunting imagery, stellar performances, superb dialouge, and pure terror. The theme teaches us that old cliche, we have met the monster and he is us. How can I convey the pure wonderfullness of this film, the New Orleans setting, the marvelous Rourke and DeNiro, the relentless pacing as the mystery is unravelled. Look for the meanings of the elevator, Times Square, blood being washed from the wall..... Symbolism abounds"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kind of strange noir, horror, mystery film","review":"This movie was extremely fascinating. Micky Rourke plays a private-i in the 1950s given a job by a creepy Robert DeNiro to track down a former singer who disappeared over a debt owed. Rourke ends up in Louisiana to track this man down and uncovers a web of deceit, murder and voodoo. I don't want to spoil anything but it is very well written and unique.

The movie was excellent and I would recommend it to anyone.If you are going to buy it from either a seller or Amazon, make sure you are getting the correct version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it.","review":"Skip this horrible piece of dreck. Not scary, just plain stupid. Along with a few other select actors/directors, De Niro is one whose work I never miss because I know that, no matter what dreadful flaws a movie might have, his performance alone will be worth watching.Unless you're a die-hard Rourke or De Niro fan, then this will be a colossal waste of your time and money. The only reason it even did as well as it did in theatres is because of the De Niro/Rourke name power and the fact that you get to see a naked Cosby kid. Whoopee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now there are better vodoo movies like Skeleton Key","review":"I bought this movie for two reasons. Robert de niro and its excellent reviews. But in the entire movie Robert de niro has only 3 or 4 appearances which was very disappointing.

Out of all \\"The Devil Made Me Do It\\" based thrillers, I think this movie is the best. The fact the movie is set in New Orleans, a city rich in the occult, adds volumes to the story. But when you add Robert De Niro into the mix as the rich benefactor with an elusive secret, you get next to perfect. All the characters come together so well to give an outstanding performance about a man's search and ultimate fight for his soul. If you love a challenge and this movie does not draw you in, then I would be pressed to recommend a movie that would. And to add more intrigue, sex and excitement, the scene between Mickey Rourke and Lisa Bonet will surely cover that aspect."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the most underated","review":"I love horror movies.I really do. every kind from extreme splatter to the mildest chills.

Lisa gets very naked....... buy it now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More Like Unsavory Heart","review":"I admit that I was first taken in by the movie due to the title. Mickey Rourke (Iron Man 2, The Expendables),Robert Deniro (A Bronx Tale, Stardust, Limitless), and Lisa Bonet (The Cosby Show) performed their roles with great intensity and clear precision. The reason why I ranked it two stars is due to the fact that I felt that the plot could have included at least one to two characters that had a dominance of \\"good\\" in them. Additionally, the movie seemed to imply that an intentionally evil person may be unaware of what they are doing. I can understand if the character came from a background of little emotional warmth and/or affection. However, the fact that a street smart detective seemed to be \\"controlled\\" clashes with the idea of free will for mankind. Due to these reasons, \\"Angel Heart\\" would be more for those who are horror film fanatics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angel Heart","review":"You can watch this edge of your seat thriller several times and get something new out of it every time.

But I bought this for a friend, to add to his horror collection. In fact I purchased this and another movie called Mr. Frost, also from Amazon. The gift's running theme was the Devil and I thought Robert De Niro's performance as Satan in Angel Heart was excellent. Along with Jeff Goldblum in Mr. Frost. Just wonderful acting. For myself, my favorites as far as who played God's most beloved angel but got the boot are these 2, plus Viggo Mortensen in The Prophecy, and John Glover in Brimstone.

Director Alan Parker manages to create a tense mood and atmosphere in some moments, but the result is still tedious and dull, whose only non-boring parts are the long and unecessary sex scene and the obvious, poorly conceived and ridiculous ending.\\"Angel Heart\\" is a flat, uninteresting movie that lacks in substance, entertainment, tension and credibility.

These amazingly sleek and compact planes are as fast as they look.Thus with this background, I watched the SR-71 segment but found the narration repetitive and uninformative. There's dead air, dark images of the Blackbird in darkness, duplicate scenes, and no drama or insight.

It's opportunities,threats and what you have to do to win on it. Nevertheless, it's written not in a very clear way. Some people may face some difficulties in understand its concepts. The first part Reach vs Richness is great, but the following sections fail to consolidate these ideas... This book doesn't worth the time and money for reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"This book is sound on the whole if a little convoluted and unnnecessarily complicated. The points the authors raise are valid - richness,reach and affliation are going to be important determinants of competitive. However, these are not readily applicable to business. So do not expect this book to be be a practical guide to internet strategy. It is not, and I believe it was not intended as such. The book does succeed, however, in bringing the reader upto speed in terms of internet strategic thought from the perspective of established companies and new startups. Though even here, a less economic style of writing (my training), would ensure a more enjoyable read. Overall, a good book on a complicated subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass the no-doz","review":"Yet another in an endless series of books that drones on about the transformation of the economy through technology.

Its value could be summed up in a two page article."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the reviews here make it out to be","review":"Perhaps I have read to much on the subject, but I found this book to be poorly written to the point that it was difficult to read quickly, and I thought that the subject matter was not very well backed up. I would recommend several other books on this subject before reading this one at a last resort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly insightful; very useful for managers & entrepreneurs","review":"This is an important and thought-provoking book. In a world full of hype and simplistic answers, the authors have provided a very powerful strategic lens for understanding what's happening in today's business world. Their \\"richness-reach\\" framework and the stories that illustrate it are fascinating. More importantly, it provides compelling logic for why the many businesses not yet affected by the Internet must begin to \\"deconstruct\\" their own value chains and get ahead of the curve. This book is already being passed around in at least two major companies I know and is contributing to a rethinking of next year's priorities. While it's a bit dense and does not provide easy answers, I think it's a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good discussion of eCommerce Dynamics","review":"Blown to bits provides a good review of the fundamental issue in eCommerce, what are you going to be when you go virtual. The premise, that you compete on reach or richeness, provides a way of distinguishing the various paths through eC as well as the impact of eCommerce on business models and market structures. Overall, the book is worth the read, however, the authors rely too heavily on the richness/reach framework so it shows some wear-n-tear latter on in the book. This is a strategy/economics type work, so if you are looking for implementation guidance this is not the book for you. If you are looking for something that will help explain what eCommerce may be doing to your company and markets its as good as anything out there and better than most."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overated","review":"Although once you cut through the authors esoteric and obtuse writing style this book manages to make some good points.The weakness in this mini-tome is in its feeble attempt to create new terms and labels for the \\"e\\" generation. Terms like \\"disintermediation\\" (this word doesn't exist anywhere but in the minds of the authors) and the appellation \\"navigators\\" belongs more to a Star Trek scenario.The authors also seem to be unaware that we do not live in a linear world.

It's not a serious site, and anyone with half a clue in web marketing knows this.

It is a great unconventional drama series with some dark plots following the likes of the X-Files. So I will just review the DVD set. It comes in a box with 9 slim DVD cases, each with 2 DVDs for a total of 18 discs. Each season consists of 3 of the slim DVD cases and 6 total discs.Season 1 is full screen (1.33:1) and Season 2 is widescreen (1.78:1). The product page had only listed full screen, but it is because season 1 is full screen, even when you purchase seasons as separate sets. I was very happy to see the widescreen versions in the set.Arrived in perfect condition for me, no loose or scratched discs as can happen in some poorly packaged DVD sets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Millenniun TV Fox Series","review":"I thought the Millenium on Fox was the best SFi/adventure series on TV,I actually started to like it more than the X-Files series. I never knew that it was being taken off the air untill I waited for it to come back on in the Fall season and to my dismay it did not. It would be nice if the Sc-Fi channel would become interested in it and started a new series. Chris Carter have you thought about \\"reinventing it on a channel like the Sci-Fi channel\\". My comments will probably go by the wayside...but just maybe some how \\"Out there\\" someone will think about the possibilities of bringing it back.

Frank Black is one of the most intriguing characters that I have ever seen portrayed on television, and Lance Henrikson did a superb job of portraying this dark character. The series really found its voice in the second season, mixing crime-drama, paranormal and spiritualism. Season two was largely the work of Morgan and Wong, who did a phenomenal job of taking the series to new heights. The second season finale was the most intense finale that I have ever seen. The third season was *good*, but unfortunately, Chris Carter felt it necessary to take a step back from the novel and visionary storylines that Morgan and Wong created. There has never been a show like this on television before, and unfortunately, there will probably not be one like it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why only 3 seasons?!","review":"ONE OF THE BEST SHOWS EVER ON TELEVISION...Maybe if enough fans make their voices heard, we can get a movie version of this fine TV show...Just as good , if not even better than Chris Carter's other big show \\"X-Files\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow moving and plots are full of holes","review":"Especially in season 1, much time is wasted with Frank exchanging soulful looks with his wife. Frank has \\"visions\\" so the writors don't have to bother with things like evidence or clues. Every episode has the same feel, dark and brooding. If you have any sunshine in your room you won't see a thing. Frank shows just one emotion, anger. The rest of the time he's lifeless. And the daughter is too perfect.

As with most thing in life, life got busy and I was never able to finish the series. Now it's time to do it.Lance Henriksen is a great actor who I have always appreciated. From Aliens to Millennium. :)The story telling from the series was incredible. This sort of apocalypse story telling is what I love.FYI: If you're a fan of the X-Files and Millennium you need to watch the Millennium episode from X-Files. 4th episode of the 7th season. The episode serves as a crossover with the series Millennium, also created by Chris Carter, and brings closure to the series.Great stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Manose Music","review":"Manose music evokes deep listening - he seems to disappear and only the flute notes move like rolling waves in a vast sea of melodic change.Bansuri is very sweet.

Disappointing because I use that color throughout my website, often coordinating the print with particular photographs.Color really matters to me but I am loath to change it on my site as all the Gateways, Toshibas, Dell and Macs I have checked out show the correct hues.For the price and all the features, this is a fine laptop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oddly Modern.

I thought maybe it was not screwed on straight, but that is not the case. I can't believe they changed the design of the top (which isn't reflected in the picture of the product here).

On the second day of using it I accidentally brushed up against a piece of equipment at work. The clip held up to my surprise, but the silicone case tore all the way around the clip.

I had a simular clip on a Bell rear flashing red led light which broke off and fell to the road while I was Bicycling. I would not trust this product to hold the player securly and will not use it...What a waste of money especially the rediculous shipping cost for such a small lightweight item.

As equally important as the characters is the atmosphere of Rain City, and the life it has to offer. Alan Rudolph manipulates the characters to interact with the city expertly, as if the city were a living, breathing character all its own. This is direction perfected by Welles in A Touch of Evil, and was so common in many films with Humphrey Bogart.This is Film101, and needs to be on a DVD. The storyboards need to be published.

Now, this may be in part because we live in an older house, and the walls may not be completely straight, but truly it feels like a design flaw.

The shipping label had a rather large imprint of a boot on it. Brackets could not be reattached to their intended location. I had to relocate these brackets in order to make this item useable. Item is poorly constructed out of cheap materials, the fair price reflects this. Once repaired, item is useable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well!","review":"Bought this gate for an extra wide opening at the top of my stairs to keep my grandson from going down the stairs. Works like a charm and is easy to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!","review":"This gate can expand to 50\\", but when expanded that far it will not stay in place.So you have to use wood shims on both edges to keep it in place or the unit will easily push over.AND...talk about hard to use..you have to have 8 arms to get it in place and then clamp it down.So I am considering hiring an octopus to help!This is really poorly constructed,I already snapped my fingers twice when closing it (!%#!&%@$),As for the clamp that tightens the gate, it is so cheap,I expect it to break off at any moment."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent product","review":"I like the gate. It works perfect for keeping our dog out of area that we do not want her in"},{"rating":"1","title":"the always open gate","review":"I am very disappointe in this product. The gate will not stay in place more than a minute. The locking mechanism does not hold. It is of some flimsy material that will not stand any pressure at all although it is supposed to be a \\"pressure mount gate.\\" The gate might work well for a narrow opening, but the reason I purchased it was to fit in a wider doorway. It just simply does not do what it is supposed to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good product, but didn't work for me.","review":"The gate actually works fine, it is tall and wide enough. It's just as described. However, my dog just climbs over it. The wire mesh is far enough apart that he just climbed right over it. Unfortunately, he also chewed up the top of the gate so I can't even return it because it's damaged.This might work well to stop the dog from jumping over, but if you have a determined dog then they'll climb over it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"This gate is the right width and the right height for the space, but now matter how we tried, we were never able to get the tension right and it kept falling over. We gave up after less than a day and moved on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exactly what I needed!!","review":"Was bought to keep 3 large and 1 small dog in a room and it works great. Pretty sturdy and easy to operate! The price was much lower than the other gates I found which is a plus!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted about 1 week.... See photos","review":"I buy a ton of products off of Amazon and rarely rate them... This time, I had to.My wife and I bought this gate to restrict our beagle to the kitchen/dining area while away. We have another gate of similar size (from another maker) and bought this to replace a smaller version that the beagle had managed to knock down several times. Our beagle is not a large dog... Very mid-sized and though we love him... Not overly smart.We came home today and he was free! He had managed to pull the mesh from the wooden corner and escape. The mesh was mangled. Upon closer look, the mesh wasn't attached into the wooden frame very well.I wouldn't recommend this fence due to the poor attachment of the mesh. The wood was firm and it feels structurally sound, but if the mesh doesn't stay in the frame, what good is it??"},{"rating":"2","title":"good little gate","review":"I bought these to keep my dogs from scratching my nice doors when I need to lock them in a room. This gate is excellent because the mesh is wire and they can't scratch or chew through it. The wire mesh has a rubber/plastic coating so it doesn't have a harsh or ugly look of metal, it looks just like an other gate. It's easy to use and I recommend it for children and pets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wire mesh gate","review":"To my surprise, the gate is more substanial than I had suspected. It works perfectly to keep our weiner dog at bay. Works for us!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong Solid Gate","review":"Very solid, secure gate, high enough to keep the dogs out but the cats can get over! I can easily move it and use it on two different width openings. Once you set the width it's easy to open with one hand but I need two hands to set it back up. I would buy a gate with a hinge if I had to go through the opening on a steady basis, it's too tall for an adult to climb over.(that's why the dogs stay out!) If the gate works loose it's not tight enough and you must set the width 1/2 inch wider. I wish I'd bought this years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke the first day!","review":"Unfortunately this item is very cheaply made and broke the first day we used it. It's very inexpensive so maybe that's the problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely tough.","review":"This product is a little awkward to adjust, which makes moving it to different locations a little annoying. If you're going to leave it in one place, it's great. This is the biggest gate I could find, and it is pretty tough. We use it to contain our dogs in the house, and they have chewed on both the wood and wire, and it has stood up well."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book needed a good editor","review":"I could hardly wait to read this book! It seemed to have everything! Henry V111, Anne Boleyn! Celtic Heritage! Just my kind of book! The inside cover notes that it is an unpublished manuscript, and apparently, an unedited one! The author must not know that sentences end with a PERIOD! Almost all her sentences end with an exclamation mark! By page 70, I gave up the ghost and decided to wait till the edited version comes out!If reading my review with all the exclamation points doesn't bother you, then the book is for you. But it bothered me to the point it ruined the book and I didn't finish it. It seemed so amateurishly written it was a waste of my time to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whaaaatttt?????","review":"This has to rank as one of the most ridiculously premised, awkwardly written and badly edited books I have ever attempted to read. I had really high hopes based on the summary ... but wow. I couldn't keep reading after the first few pages. And I am a voracious reader of books on Anne Boleyn and Henry VIII, AND I am open to New Age ideas, so I was a receptive audience. But this one .....no way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book. One star is too much.","review":"If you are looking for a book on past lives, keep looking. Ditto if you are interested in English history or want a good paranormal novel. This is one of the worst books I have ever tried to read.Poorly written, not edited at all, nor even proofed.Nuff said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jungle Book Poster","review":"I ordered this item because I really needed it for a particular project. The seller mailed it out a week AFTER my order (and I used paypal so they were payed instantly). Then I get the item, and its a photo copy of the poster!

My Sony's wore out after like 4 or 5 years so my husband got me this 3 pack for listening at work. The sound quality leaves more to be desired (& I'm nowhere close to a tech/audio snob).Every pair was crap within 2 weeks of use-- the sound would cut in & out. I would be at work jiggling the cord and tilting my head inadvertently trying to get sound to both headphones. How ridiculous is that... I've never paid for something & had it fall so short of the basic functionality it should be delivering.Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"These were very uncomfortable, they are hard plastic and have no covering to cushion them against your ears.

The sound quality is horrible. Don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Dollies Don't Always Play Nice!","review":"Most people balk at \\"killer doll\\" stories. But Ms. Jensen has a talent for creating them with original twists. In this tale, little Jessica moves to a new house and finds pretty dollies to play with. She swears they can move all by themselves.The dollies talk to Jessica. They call her \\"Annabelle\\" instead of Jessica, and they don't want anyone to hurt her. Anyone who's not nice to Jessica will make the dollies mad. Don't get the dollies angry at you, for they have vicious tempers. The dollies have their Annabelle back, and no one is going to take her away from them!Oh, you will like this one! If you're a killer doll fan like I am, especially, this will please your creepiness needs. If you suspect your dolls and stuffed animals are alive, make sure you're very, very nice to them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eerie chiller","review":"Abandoned by her mother and neglected by her emotionally distant father, a little girl is drawn to an old derelict mansion in the woods near her home. To the lonely little girl the house is her very own castle and it seems to call out to her with a ghostly chorus of voices. Inside she finds a family of dolls that welcome her along with a strange portrait of a woman who smiles down on her like the mother she lost. But this house is no playground. It echoes with the memories of a tragedy that took place nearly a half century ago and the event is still being played out by forces beyond the grave. Dolls come to life, seeking to protect a mysterious girl named Annabelle and a ghostly wraith stomps through the old mansion, crazed with a demonic rage... Ruby Jean Jensen delivers a creepy haunted house chiller with her trademark style and resident killer dolls. A must for Jensen fans and a fun read for horror lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Top Notch Ghost Story","review":"Great elements of the classic ghost tale; violent death, beyond the grave revenge and a lady in a long white dress. What more can you ask for? Of course, Jensen uses her favorite \\"evil doll\\" theme to see the action through. Annabelle manages to be both suspenseful and spooky, a slow beginning really picks up later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fall read!","review":"This is one great doll horror read! This book is so descrptive you can almost see the overcast sky, feel the cool fall breeze, and hear the fall leaves crunch as the main character a little girl (Jessica) makes her way over to the abanded Victorian next door where an abandon doll house seems to \\"come alive with 19th century dolls that move and talk by themselves. I loved this book, this was one of the best doll horror books that I have ever read! The begining wasn't slow like an another review said it was actually really interesting. Make sure to read the pro log in the front so you can actually \\"see\\" the family that used to live there in the Victorian days when Jessica sees the house for the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"hey it's good!","review":"it controls everything. it is very easy to program. it, though, takes a while to get used to especially if you have digital cable. the up, down, left, right, and OK buttons are below the number buttons instead of on top."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"Didn't work worth a D.....

I've owned HP, PNY and Memorex flash drives, and the Memorex is by far the best of the three. They transfer at lightning speeds, never fail, and quite frankly, the handy strap that comes with it makes them easy to find in a travel bag or wear around you neck as you go from meeting to meeting. I own four Memorex travel drives (this model, identified by the length and grey/silver color) for the four different areas of my life: work, home projects, finances, and volunteer work. They help keep me organized and never fail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tremendous, and a lot of heart put into this!","review":"I knew of Steve Canyon as a newspaper comic. I did not know it had been a 1958 television show as well. I checked it out on this special edition DVD, and it COMPLETELY blew me away! The first thing that grabs the viewer is that actor Dean Fredericks looks just like his comic pages counterpart, and is fantastic in the role. 4 episodes are present on this special edition and the quality is unbelievable. As I understand it, this was one of the most expensive television shows at the time, and it certainly shows! Action is jammed packed into every story and is beautifully done. Well directed, acted, and produced! I was glad to see it also came with a promo feature, and a stills gallery. I am looking forward to picking up the full series on DVD. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN and great quality!","review":"Love watching these and great quality to watch!
