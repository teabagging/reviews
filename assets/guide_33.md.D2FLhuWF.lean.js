Granted, I love Robert Ludlum's creations, but I read The Bourne Identity so long ago I truthfully don't remember much of the book's details. And you know what, I don't care.I was thoroughly swept away. The story was inticing, the cinematography wonderful, and the action just thrilling. And whoever took it upon themselves to tutor Matt Damon in the kissing scenes deserves a raise. I had an ear-to-ear grin on, because I found I was expecting a certain kind of kiss, couldn't believe it when it unfolded just the way I wanted.If the fighting closeups had been sped up just a tad less, and the corpse-as-an-air-flotation-survival-device been ELIMINATED, I would have given it 5 stars.

Not only does Matt Damon with his superb acting make you believe in the reality of what happens onscreen, but the story is complex and darkly fun.I think what distinguishes this series is how realistic Damon makes it seem. THere are no techie fixes or superhuman feats, just disciplined improvisation by the ultimate assasin. Then there is his personal crisis, worked out in amnesia and his desire to start a new life, perhaps with a woman that he is endangering. Finally, there are the shenanigans of the CIA, with its covert program gone awry and the brutal power maneuvers of the flacks trying to save the situation and their careers. Very fun and interesting, with a nice space for the viewer's imagination to take hold.Recommended with enthusiasm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring - Didn't make it past the first hour","review":"I really tried to get into this movie, but I just could not.

The book of the same name by Robert Ludlum is a gripping, tight, suspenseful novel that is hard to put down. This movie should definitely not be called the Bourne Identity. What a joke! Please don't waste your money on this movie. Read the book instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted my time and money!","review":"This movie was not only unrealistic (scaling buildings, driving a car through oncoming traffic, and remaining unseen after changing only their hair color) but hard to follow as well. I was extremely disappointed with this movie. I was expecting a captivating espionage thriller with excellent, well thought out characters and a fast-paced plot. Viewers were left with unfinished turns in the movie and characters that were left unexplained. This wasn't the worst movie I have ever seen, but it certainly wasn't the greatest. The best part about the entire movie was the scenes from around the world. The movie includes excellent shots from various different locations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Anybody Involved in This Project Read the Book?","review":"I ordinarily like Matt Damon movies, but this one was an exception. I didn't like it at all. Furthermore, it was NOT \\"The Bourne Identity.\\"If you go to this movie expecting Robert Ludlum, you're going to be sadly disappointed. There's very little connection between his book and this movie. It should have just been titled \\"The Spy with Amnesia.\\"If you want to see the real thing, order the video or the DVD of the 1988 TV miniseries with Richard Chamberlin. That version is real Robert Ludlum.I like Matt Damon, but Robert Ludlum and I go back over years and years. I don't recommend this movie to anyone who reads Ludlum faithfully.

So this one will go back for a refund.Too bad, Amazon has a great price and my two other Bourne discs that I ordered from Amazon did have the Universal 100th Anniversary slipcover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captures Ludlum's spirit","review":"Ludlum's stock and trade plot development involved a man caught in extraordinary circumstances with all sorts of people trying to kill him.Certainly, the Bourne Identity was one of Ludlum's better books, and the movie captures the helter-skelter, holding on by the edge of your finger tips tension found in the novel.Matt Damon continues to surprise me with his ability to enter into different roles and pull it off. His performance as Jason Bourne is great. I particularily liked the scene in the Swiss bank where he opens up the security box and finds a dozen passports and lots of cash.The fight sequences were believable (unlike the trend towards using wires and performing impossible jumps).The DVD talks about an alternate ending, but I wasn't all that impressed with.I appreciated the director's commentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"DIShonesty in advertising","review":"I enjoyed both the book and the movie. The movie, fortunately, bears virtually no relationship in plotting to the book, as the book would be out-dated (or, use intelligence-community jargon, \\"overtaken by events\\").The \\"Explosive Extended Edition\\" is, by amazing coincidence, exactly the same length as the UNExplosive, UNExtended Edition.I had thought the \\"EEE\\" would be the Director's Cut, or something similar. It is not.If you already own the original DVD version, purchasing this would be a waste of your money, unless you want to buy a back-up copy.Still, I hope plans are in the works to film \\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\", the 3rd of the Bourne trilogy. (There is also a 4th book, \\"The Bourne Legacy\\", but that was not written by Robert Ludlum.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Cumbersome","review":"I was disappointed with this movie. The movie is too long and I found it confusing. It was hard to focus on the plot while at the same time trying to figure out who all the characters were. At the same time, Damon as Jason makes some pretty stupid decisions. I just didn't buy any of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Serious Miss.","review":"Any similarity between the book and this movie is purely accidental. In adapting the book to the screen the scriptwriters have stipped away all of the pacing and logic of the book, as well as a good deal of its intricacy. The characters become hollow and one dimensional.The only redeeming feature is that the actors do what they can with a lousy script."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong title, but the movie is ok","review":"It is VERY loosely adapted from the Bourne Identity and not much related to the book. I like the book very much, it's like a Harry Potter for adults, you need to read all of it to know what happens, reading the front and end doesn't make you wiser.If you are interested in the movie The Bourne Identity, I'd suggest the version with Richard Chamberlain acting. In my opinion, a Bruce Willis or Harrison Ford would be better suited for the role of Jason Bourne."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste...","review":"of time...so much potential...wasted. This is one stupid movie. The story is not believable at all, if you can even call it a story as most of the film it doesn't even make sense. It could have been really good, but it is just dumb entertainment for dumb gullable people. Rating should be NO stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flipper Defect Nightmare","review":"Universal decided to put flippers back on the market rather than pack in a DVD copy into a 2 disc case. Ooooh. Bad move. No more disc art, defective discs everywhere (rampant reports of Bourne Identity freezing for 15 seconds during a car chase are already surfacing). Universal executives, if you are watching....PLEASE STOP THE FLIPPERS. THEY WERE BAD IN DVD DAYS. THEY ARE BAD NOW. Pack in the DVD with the blu ray in the future, your end-of-year bonus check and family will thank you"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Yawner......Don't Waste Your Time!","review":"I started watching this on a weekend away with 2 other couples. By the time it was 20 minutes into it, I was the only one who hadn't given up and gone to bed! It's very slow, and the ending is a letdown......it just sort of, ends. No real character development, you don't really care what happens to the characters. There are much better choices out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Matt Damon","review":"Maybe it's just me, but I think I've seen cars that give their lines with more soul than Matt Damon. The story seems weak as well. I have no desire to watch this again, but if the wife was to pop it in the DVD player, I might not leave the room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Seeing","review":"I saw this today and thought it was an excellent movie when considered on it's own. I also read the book (one of my favorites by Ludlum,) and the movie doesn't follow that very closely. By the end of the movie I was still asking myself who he was supposed to be. (I know from the book, but don't recall it being mentioned in the movie.) I guess that could be material for a sequel if this one does well. So much was left out, but then this was a long book.When I just consider the movie without comparing it to the book, I thought it was quite good. My sister agreed, and said she was impressed with it. I would definitely say it is worth seeing. It is a violent movie - not for the kids - but I fully enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best spionage movies ever!!!!","review":"I really loved this movie. The plot, the acting, the flow of the events... It was just excellent! I can see this movie every once a week. Has a lot of action, good fighting sequences, and you can feel Bourne's adrenaline flow."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you liked the book, skip this movie","review":"I am a huge fan of the Ludlum novel and was anxious to see the movie version. Other than the title of the movie and the name of the main character, there is very little resemblance between the outstanding novel and this very standard Hollywood action movie. And I really do not understand why the screenwriter decided to divert so dramatically from the novel. It sure was not to add more suspense -- Ludlum's novel was full of that. The movie even left out the villian of the book -- Carlos the Jackal. Hard to imagine leaving the bad guy out of a supposed spy thriller. My advice, read the book. You will enjoy that much more than this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Switch to Netflix","review":"Did not know it took a special DVD machine to play this. No problem sending it back for credit.

Damon has no personality whatsoever on screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still-\\"Bourne\\"","review":"It takes a lot of skill to make a crackling good action pic. It takes talent of a different sort to make a film this listless and dull. So dull, in fact, that I turned it off 10 minutes before the end. That's how much I didn't care. Great actors like Brian Cox, Clive Owen and Chris Cooper are completely wasted, and are we really supposed to believe that 18-year-old Julia Stiles runs the CIA's covert Paris offices? There's absolutely no chemistry between the co-stars (the director wisely pulls the camera away when they start to kiss) and Damon proves that, as good an actor as he can be (\\"Good Will Hunting\\" and particularly that Meg Ryan/Denzel Washington pic), he's really not a movie star. A big \\"who cares.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Too little time to view","review":"While the movie is great, you only get 24 hours to view the film once you start watching it. I don't understand why there is such a short time frame to watch. Also, you have to watch it within about a month of downloading it. I didn't understand either of these limitations when I \\"purchased\\" it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"If I could give this movie 0 stars, I would. This movie was the surprise movie at the Edinburgh Film Festival. I could not believe how awful this movie was. Apparently everyone that made the movie felt the same, as not one person from the film showed up to support it. One \\"action\\" filled part had me and 5 or 6 people around us laughing embarassing loud. This movie is a complete joke. It ranks as possibly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Bad acting, see-through plot, horrible directing. Just all around bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real snoozer","review":"First of all, I could barely follow the storyline. Secondly, Matt Damon executing all those perfect self-defense techniques? Please. Ladies, you know who we would rather see in a role like this, right? (I'll give you a hint, his first name is Arnold)This is actually a remake, and the earlier version is sturdier as far as the storytelling goes. But this movie simply does not do justice to the novel. I know, it's a common complaint, but never truer."},{"rating":"2","title":"GUY FLICK ALL THE WAY","review":"It is my experience that women won't like the movie too much unless they enjoy gazing at Matt Damon for 2 hours. Guys on the other hand get it all...spider-man like moves, james-bond like charisma, and a girl who gets more beautiful with each scene. My Wife said \\"what was the point?\\"...I said \\"the point was to entertain...which it did!\\" The truth is that critics may be thinking \\"As if any of this is believable..\\"....maybe it's not, but if it was...it wouldn't be worth putting on the screen in my opinion...so maybe it's not the best flick...but it's the kind of movie I plan to own and watch over and over and over...because it's S-o-o-o-o exciting!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie!","review":"It is a very good dvd set!

I couldn't see how a movie could capture the depth and detail of Ludlum's best book. Fortunately, they didn't try. They took the basic premise of the book and delivered a solid action-packed thriller. It's hard to make a good movie from a great book, but they probably did as well as could be expected taking on Ludlum in two hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bourne","review":"This movie is great. Its extremely entertaining without lowering itself to vulgarity. It is very sad that Ludlum's masterpeice was not more fully adapted, but I don't think that anyone could adapt the book without creating a day long movie in the process.

Franka Potente is good, she fits her character as a German-born American. Matt Damon is good too.I rented this movie, perhaps one day I will own it too (along with The Matrix!)<SPOILER?>As for the Collector's Edition, the alternate ending is probably not worth spending extra money (I don't know how much the normal edition costs). But Widescreen is better, as the movie's supposed to be seen.Maybe they will do a _good_ sequel (unlike Reloaded!), though the ending left me wondering how they would achieve that.Good cast, good director, good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd give it 4.5","review":"Wish you could give a half a star!

He ends up being in some very tight spots and demonstrates that he has a wide variety of impressive fighting skills.In his quest to figure out who he is, he connects with a young German woman, Marie (Franka Potente) who assists him throughout much of the show. As it goes along, he (Matt Damon) discovers that his name, or one of them, is Jason Bourne. It turns out that he is a CIA assassin. While he has amnesia, his employers think that he has gone rogue and are attempting to kill him.All of this makes for a story with lots of action. The events take place all across Europe.

For someone who will never travel to Italy, it presents details of the Cistine Chapel not presented anywhere else.

However,somewhere along the way, it seemed to degenerate into cliche and wooden, cartoon-like characters. It would have been nice to have cared more about the characters. Alas, the only sympathetic person in the story was Rose. Too bad she doesn't have a bigger role.The ending was -- well, I can't think of a better word -- horrible. There were no surprises, and the writing slipped into a pit of cheap melodrama and unbelievable dialogue. I cheered when almost everyone died. Wish they would have died sooner...."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Gothic","review":"I found this story to be a little slow going in the beginning, but the description of London at this time period, 1794, was rich and informative. Being preoccupied by our own revolution just a few years earlier, we Americans tend to forget the state of affairs between England and France at this point in time. This tale reminds me of the Gothic tales similar to 'Mill on the Floss' and 'Jane Eyre' with some of todays' issues added in to it. It starts with a civil servant intent on finding the killer of his daughter by a strangler remenicent of Jack the Ripper. It adds the conplexities of the French and English intrigue(spying) and concludes with a brutal ending of one family and the uniting of two brothers. Lovers of historical suspense will enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book With No Heart Or Soul","review":"It's hard to say what gives a soul to a book and its characters. While one work, even a small one, will breathe, and spring to life, another simply won't. In its flatness, The Music of the Spheres is, sadly, the latter type of novel. I don't know what would have changed this. Certainly Elizabeth Redfern put an obvious amount of time and effort into her tale of madness, political intrigue, murder and astronomy, all set in a 1790's England similar in its heightened state of alert to America in our own time. And yet...despite what I'm sure were her best efforts, I could not like these characters or care what became of them.I purchased a paperback copy of this book at a dollar store, and when finished, it did not find its way onto my shelf, I donated it to a thrift store. I didn't feel sentimental fondness for it, and I did not enjoy reading it. At the end of the novel, I felt cheated of the time I put into it, and that's a rare experience for a lover of books, like me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for faint of heart","review":"It always amazes me how many people can't read anything more complex than Sue Grafton.

Even without the astronomy, it is still a thoughtfully plotted, well-paced, exciting piece of historical fiction. I can't tell you how many historical novels I have read about 18th-century France and England--but this is definitely the best. I found a used copy in a little bookstore in Isla Mujeres, Mexico, and spent my beach time reading--couldn't put it down except to enjoy the dark skies when the stars came out over the Caribbean sea."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Literary Thriller","review":"It's not often I read a book that not only teaches me something about science and history, but provides a great read as well. \\"The Music of the Spheres\\", by Elizabeth Redfern, is one such novel. The level of detail and description of late 18th century London's taverns, back alleys, and environs are very well done and the historical context (after the French revolution) was a fascinating look at a historical era that I knew very little about.The mixture of murder, astronomy, history and plots within plots was a great effort, and reminded me, at times of a Le Carre novel. As in Le Carre, you find yourself in the middle of a world that deals in intrigue, shades of gray, and very few happy endings.My one criticism of this book is that I would have liked to know more about the inner government intrigues and villains who were pulling the strings that put the back dealings and treacheries in motion.I look forward to reading Miss Redfern's next novel, Auriel Rising."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't go by the cover.","review":"The cover says \\"reminiscient\\" of Caleb Carr's \\"The Alienist\\". For that alone I figured I'd pick this one up. I loved \\"Alienist\\", and even though I didn't like \\"Angel of Darkness\\" as much, it was still better than this. There wasn't much that made me \\"feel\\" for the characters. I wasn't sure if the book was more about wartime intrigue or a serial killer. Maybe I'm just not into spy thrillers and espionage. By the time the plot started to come together at the end, I really didn't care much about whodunit! Caleb, where are you? We need another novel from you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"History, but not Mystery","review":"As a fan of both history and mystery, I really wanted to like this book. Unfortunately, I was unable to find more than a small portion intriguing. In isolated sections, the prose is almost lyrical, and the details of this fascinating period in history are well done. However, the main characters are just plain unlikeable and descend into tediously melodramatic cardboard figures by the end of the novel. Not since the Duchess of Malfi has mass death been more appealing.Perhaps the morose nature of the plot would be bearable if there was a real mystery to solve, but anyone who is an avid mystery reader will recognize the real killer and motive by the end of the first chapter.Since audio listeners seem to be more favorable, it may be that Tim Curry really does have the power to entertain us no matter what the material. Pity there's no talent of that calibre to redeem the printed version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spherical Mess","review":"Being a fan of Caleb Carr's THE ALIENIST and ANGEL OF DARKNESS, I was eagerly awaiting the time to set aside and read Elizabetth Redfern's MUSIC OF THE SPHERES, highly touted by People Magaziine as 'reminiscent' of Carr's novels. A 'lifetime' is what the reader needs to get through this abominable first novel by Redfern. Unlikeable charcters, a dull telling of history, and storylines filled with no surprises, 'spherically' come together for the reader to snore through for what seems like an eternity. Where as I didn't want either of Carr's novels to end, I couldn't wait to close the covers on this inane attempt at a novel. For serious insomniacs only!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Snore","review":"I was thoroughly disappointed. The \\"mystery\\" is totally predictable. The drama was over the top.

Some of the songs' beats are fast but they are properly tempered with a seemingly strong knowledge of aggressive rock. The structures echo Black Flag, a mature Necros and, of course, Articles of Faith (singer Vic Bondi's former band). The lyrics are so crucial because they are brave enough to be specific and no holds barred. This disc is further notable because it is something NEW and not merely rehashing the members' former bands (GI, Jawbox, Articles of Faith, Alloy) on what is now the boring hardcore reunion circuit.

Miss Marple does not appear at all in the novel THE SITTAFORD MYSTERY, which does not in the least resemble the TV show of the same name. Which is a shame. THE SITTAFORD MYSTERY (the novel) had one of Dame Agatha's more clever plots--one which the BBC decided to distort beyond recognition. In THE MOVING FINGER they decided to replace a heroic RAF pilot with a suicidal motorcyclist, Heaven knows why, and to replace the incredibly beautiful governess with a rather ordinary-looking one who, in my opinion, would not have inspired the passion required by the book. All in all, I much prefer the late Joan Hickson as Miss Marple."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of Place","review":"Agatha Christie fans be forewarned: the screenwriters have plunked Miss Marple down in the middle of a Tommie and Tuppence story in this series.

I've enjoyed both other ladies, but McEwan brings a life and sparkle to the role that the others seem to miss. She just seems more inquisitive! The beef I have with this series is the incorporating of the Tommy and Tuppence story \\"By the Pricking of My Thumbs\\" into a Miss Marple mystery. I probably wouldn't have minded if they just borrowed the story, but to turn Tommy and Tuppence into an insensitive bureaucrat and an insecure lush is sacrilege. Tuppence is an intuitive adventurer and Tommy, her sweet and sensible rock. Leave their characters alone! Let Miss Marple solve the case by herself. The story here bears little resemblance to the original story anyway. Other than that I love these Miss Marple mysteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like crowd noise?

Allegro Non Troppo is also a film that grabs your heart strings and wrenches them......just have a look at the scene with the cat in the deserted building to the tune of Sibelius' Valse Triste......a box or three of Kleenex is strongly recommended for this segment. The linking non-animated sequences are a laugh too.

It keeps moving and it keeps you laughing at the new antics of the residents of the \\"Aunt Hill\\". All the characters are delightful in this, but you have to get the sequel, Rose in Bloom, as well.

It's not even an average book. I'd say that it is rather a disappointing book. I am not impressed with Ms. Roby's writing. She's an average writer -- nothing to get all hyped about. In the past, she tells the same old boring stories that have been told over and over again. But to her credit, she did bring out a new fad in \\"teen phone sex.\\" It would be nice to hear some new stories from fresh voices. Naturally, Terri Mc is the girl.

If you read one you have read the other.That to me, dosn't show any creativity on Ms. Roby's part,but then again it could be the publishing company and theeditor responsible for this duplicity.As a consumer and avid book reader I thought Ideserved more in a sequal to a great book and greater author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Is Not Enough","review":"Very seldom are sequels up to the same level as the first one and I usually try and keep in mind that the story may go into a new direction. Sequels are stories that are somewhat new or new to the reader because it is the telling of events unknown heretofore.

I was in the chapter of the rape of Curtis daughter and I went to a revival on Friday night and when I saw all the deacons and Pastors up front I literally got sick wondering how can a man get in the Pull-Pit and feel good about hisself. Maybe that is why it is called the Pulpit because they know they got pull ...and the pit is a play area for some (I'm just thinking out loud) Will Curtis ever learn..will God have vengence on this liar, how much sex can one really stand, how many marriages will it take...will he get ill with a disease?????

It is a definite dance friendly song without lyrics, just a beat you can dance to abandone with.I have found the remixes to 'Standing' much better than the original album release version. My favourite is 'Standing: Motion'. Ronan and Mark have treaded the fine line between electro and fused it with dance to such a perfection.

The script is very good though, as usual with Disney, not as enlightened as one would wish or hope. The animation and design are breathtaking, the characters are fun and the songs are minimally intrusive. All-in-all, I was pleasantly surprised by this film, and look forward to re-reading the book so I can see how it compares.Disney's forte continues to be their state-of-the-art dvd extras, and this disc is no exception.

Captain silver was the kind of character you find yourself really liking even though he's supposed to be the villain."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better films to watch","review":"I bought this DVD mostly based on the other recommendations. This is not a good film. It isn't horrible, and it shares the universal appeal that all animation has for children, but there are better things to do with your time.The animation is good, but not great. A game like Final Fantasy displays more imagination when fusing sailing ships and space travel. You certainly see why hand-drawn animation is being replaced by computer animation.The plot is abysmally shallow. The lead character was obviously designed by a committee, hoping to create someone with which today's teenagers could identify. Most of the sidekicks were even more bland than the lead (was there any question how Morph would impact the story? Did Martin Short's robot character contribute *anything*?).I'm sure Disney consulted many focus groups to patch together this script. I wish they had taken a chance with a more inspiring storyline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite colorful, but hardly child-friendly, more for grownups","review":"Treasure Planet is supposedly based on Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island. The animated movie was more specifically similar to Terry Brooks' trilogy about the Voyage of the Jerle Shannara. The special effects bring this book to life, as does the important \\"lost\\" treasure which, when found, proved useless because it is antiquated. In Brooks' story, the forbidden treasure was all the words in the language changed into a computer system which became outdated and was totally lost as all the books had been destroyed.The creatures are reminiscent of those seen in the bar of the first Star Wars movie. The action is what you'd expect if a movie were made of the Brooks' trilogy, the flights and fighting scenes with dangerous pitfalls.Not much of Stevenson's book written so long ago is in this modern sci-fi parody. Be sure to observe the four babies at the end: the future of our world?"},{"rating":"1","title":"o.k.","review":"i thought movie was o.k. it wasn't that great. sure i did like the animation but disney is losing their touch. it just didnt have much of a plot it just dragged on and on. it never touched me.disney should look out cause things like shrek and spirited away are rolling in the cash. but if you are a huge disney fan go ahead buy it but its not a huge loss if you dont id go for studio ghibli related items"},{"rating":"2","title":"More Underappreciation","review":"In reviews I read before purchasing this I found some stating this was one of those that got caught up in Disney politics and didn't get the publicity it might should have. Now having seen it myself I agree. The story is a take on Treasure Island set in a slightly different future. The animation is great and the voice work just as good. Its amazing to see how a big smart company like Diseny can screw things up from time to tiem and not stand behind a product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good option for boys.... enjoyable for parents.","review":"Is this the best kids movie/Disney movie ever? Not quite - but, it is certainly worth watching. With the onslaught of girly, princess shows/films, it is sometimes difficult to find a fun, age appropriate show/movie for little boys. My son is four - we just watched it for the first time, and he loved it. Most super hero movies interest him, but are way too violent - hence, he doesn't get to see them. There is a lot of action in Treasure Planet, enough to spark the imagination of my four year old - but not so scary/violent that it scares him.I don't look at this as a replacement of Treasure Island, it is just a fun, pirate-space movie. Realistic? maybe not to the critics, but it is wonderfully real to my kid. (the opening sky surfing scene had him shouting \\"That is SO cool!\\" at the TV. ) This will have a spot on our shelf next to Meet The Robinsons, another fun \\"boy\\" movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Take on an Old Classic","review":"I'm generally wary when Hollywood makes movies of any book, especially a classic, and so I was a little worried about \\"Treasure Planet,\\" and yet it turned out to be one of my all-time favorite Disney movies! I can't figure out why it wasn't as big a hit as Disney hoped, because a movie like this definitely deserves it. It's a great family film full of adventure, and I just love the idea of setting \\"Treasure Island\\" in space! Who could have come up with such a fun idea but Disney? Silver is even a cyborg! How perfect! Voices, special effects, everything seemed to be spot-on, including the music (which also included a specially-written son by The Goo Goo Dolls just for this movie). I fell in love with \\"Treasure Planet\\" the first time I saw it and watch it all the time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Animation & Surprisingly Touching Characters","review":"I am not a Treasure Island fan, but I loved this movie. Jim and the Cyborg have an awesome rapport -- which is saying something for an animation, and Morph is great comic relief.

The animation alone is just incredible, along with an adventurous storyline and unique, likable characters. Also, I personally love the fact that the main character is voiced by Joseph Gordon-Levitt & some songs in the film are performed by Johnny Rzenik (lead singer of the Goo Goo Dolls, my favorite band).

Although it doesn't have the classic Disney feel, I would say Treasure Planet is my favorite movie ever.Treasure Planet, which I own on DVD, is a movie many people think of as sci-fi, at least those who haven't watched it. If they had, they would see this is no cheesy alien-attack video. Instead they would see a beautiful retelling of Robert Louis Stevenson's masterpiece. This movie captured my heart.Partially computer-generated, partially animated, Treasure Planet blew me away. Still true to the storyline of Treasure Island, it added humor and bits of story to the original tale, as well as blasting it off into space.All in all, a very clever movie. I recommend you buy this and watch it as soon as possible. Hope to see you at the Montressor Spaceport!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Treasure Planet","review":"This was a really cute movie, and has an awesome Goo Goo Dolls song in it. I purchased it for my 4 year old after he saw the preview for it on another movie we have.The reason I didn't give it five stars is because my son was not happy with it.

I knew the $140 million animated epic bombed on its theatrical release($38 million gross) but I figured it was probably just bad advertising and promotion. and the DVD would reveal itself as a gem. I was wrong.This is a bizarro adaptation of Stevenson's Treasure Island. It mixes futuristic sci-fi elements with 18th century props. The idea of adapting Treasure Island into a set-in-the-future race to a Treasure Planet is a good one, but co-directors Ron Clements and John Musker's ill-conceived execution of this concept derails early on. These guys missed the boat by light years by trying to force a pointless retro future look and numerous, tired Disney formulas into their vanity production. Admittedly, the images are often stunning, but that alone does not a picture make. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big thumbs down on this one!","review":"This was one of Disney's worst movies. I collect all of the Disney movies, but this one will not be joining my collection. Even my kids hated it. It was actually painful to sit through this whole thing. I kept telling myself it has to get better, it's a Disney movie, but it never happened. The only good thing about this movie is the animation. I would suggest renting it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not dreadful, but not underrated","review":"Certainly a much better film than I had anticipated, I thought it was gonna be awful from the look of the trailer. But I was very surprised. I actually didn't mind it in the end, but unlike the previous release, Lilo and Stitch, Treasure Planet lacked the urge to make me want to buy it or watch it again. I love to watch any Disney film that's designed to make people laugh, except for Finding Nemo-that was rubbish, so this film lacked humour, and B.E.N. was more irritable than funny, especially his voice. The rest of the cast is good though, the animation is visually great, as is the soundtrack. But unfortunately, I loved Lilo and Stitch, and this wasn't nearly as good. But I doubt this was ever going to be in the first place.Lilo and Stitch: Excellent, worth buying now!Treasure Planet: Entertaining, worth a rent, but not worth watching more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truely A Treasure","review":"Of Trash. Michael Eisner is a money crazy freak. Disney is not how it used to be, and this movie shows it. The classic musicals are no more. This movie is a take on of Treasure Island, so why couldn't they just make it treasure island? They have to make everything so \\"Teen\\", because it is not about the kids anymore, or even the teens, just the money.PS: Walt Disney would roll around in his grave if he see's his name on trash like this movie, and the disney channel stuff, and the expensive tickets to get into the park he made for ALL kids to enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real yawner","review":"Like \\"Sword in the Stone\\",\\"Great Mouse detective' and \\" Atlantis\\",this movie is a real dud.It's barely faithful to the classic \\"Treasure Island\\",and the characters are dull and uninspired.Skip this dud and watch \\"Muppet Treasure Island\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Some may call it a cult classic, I just call it awful. I saw this movie in Chicago with my wife when it came out and nearly walked out before it was over; had it not been a slow night with bad weather I probably would have. My advice, don't let the Disney name draw you in because this movie isn't worth watching for free on cable."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Disney's Most Underrated Films","review":"I remember when we had this at the theater I worked at and hardly anybody was going to see it. I was bored on one of my shifts so I sat in it for about a half an hour or so and I was amazed! The story may not be a total adaptation of the original classic and it may not be a very traditional or memorable Disney film (not much vocal music put into it), but nonetheless, it was a very interesting retelling and it is very sad to know that Disney won't be doing many films of this caliber or with cel animation anymore. I think it will be their undoing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Disney's best, but not their worst","review":"Treasure Planet was a a movie I took with a grain of salt. It's not one of Disney's better known features, so I didn't expect much. At first, I thought the movie was going to live up to that idea, but once you get past its first half hour of awkward character introductions, it proves to be a fine entry to the Disney library. Beautiful animation and strong story prove to be one of Disney's better final attempts at classic animation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Treasure Planet","review":"I must admit that I bought into Disney's hype machine on Treasure Planet, and I wish I hadn't. Treasure Planet is a pathetic movie. Nothing is orginal at all, there's no character development. It's like they took a bunch of ideas from previous kids movies and threw them into this mess. The animation, which was one of the big reasons I wanted to see it, was nothing special at all. I wouldn't waste anytime watching Treasure Planet. Lastly, Treasure Planet didn't fail because of production fiascos, the reason it failed is that it's just not very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's up with Disney?","review":"Once again Disney disappionts me by making yet another action film to target young boys. And in the proccess making a movie with no heart I could care less about the relationship between that 17 year old and Captian Long John Silver or whatever they called him. Why can't Disney come up with more orginal stuff like Lilo and Stich that movie was halrious! The future for tradional animation is looking darker and darker. Hopefully Home On The Range will brighten things up but not likely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible movie for kids","review":"this movie looks like such fun on the previews but its horrible.

I think it is very close to how Robert Louis Stevenson would have done it if he had done it in the future. Morf was hilarious! I loved the scene where Jim was solar surfing - VERY cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"Disney has made lots of flaws (not including Pixar movies) since the Lion King. Pocahintas, Hercules, Atlantis and all the dumb sequels and then we got the amazing Lilo and Stich and now Treasure Planet. This movie has the best animation in any animated movie I have ever seen. All the characters are well drawn and it has a good story. Some parts may be to scary for kids but thats why its rated PG. The Supernova part was one of the best climax scenes since the Lion King and Mulan."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best animated movies ever","review":"The animation in this movie is so much better than in most Disney movies. It is perfect. Lion King and Hercules have such ugly animation and crudely drawn characters. I thought that Disney was going to keep making ugly animated movies like those forever until they made this movie. The animation in this movie is gorgeous, fluid, and perfect. The characters are great. The combination of computer & traditional animation is spectacular. The story is very excellent. I've seen a lot of people say this movie is \\"flawed\\" or otherwise not good, but those people are [bad]. This is a great & perfect movie. I think it is one of the very best animated movies ever. By the way, the robot reminds me a lot of Floyd, the robot from the adventure game Planetfall."},{"rating":"1","title":"not widescreen","review":"Was going to purchase this release but it's in TV format. 1:66:1.

It is a cool concept...taking pictures with your Visor and I was taking pictures within seconds of opening the package. However, the pictures are blurry and very small when viewed on the PC. Enlarging the pictures to a useful size results in a grainy, poor quality image. It's a fixed focus lense that requires a lot of light to capture an image. This product is a great idea and is very easy to use, but overall it falls short of being useful and is definitely not worth [the money]."},{"rating":"2","title":"A focused addition to the handspring module line.","review":"The idea of creating a digital camera using the Handspring Visor platform has merit especially for the person on the go. The unit is easy to use and easily transfers to the PC the graphics for image manipulation and e-mail applications. The problems with the unit is based on the need for a well-lit environment, that it is a fixed focus device and has a small image resolution. The fact that no additional power supply is needed and that the unit is small and can be used to grab quick images with little fanfare makes this module one that I am glad to own. I have already used it for personal reasons and professional work. If Block Products can create an advanced module that can address the above concerns this unit would then rate 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's great for what it is, just don't expect photo-quality","review":"Let me start by saying that I love this little gadget. It amuses me endlessly. I take it to otherwise boring meetings, and it just looks like I'm making notes on my Handspring, when I'm snapping quick and funny pix of people. The camera is so small that nobody notices it. I take it on the subway and get great \\"a day in the life of a commuter\\" pictures. I use it to take pictures that the kids can include in school reports. I enjoy it thorougly! It is SO EASY to use!!!That said, the resolution isn't very good. Forget taking pictures of people from beyond 10 feet -- 5 feet if you want to see facial expressions. Forget taking pictures in rooms with uneven lighting. Don't even think about printing the pictures, unless they are real close-ups. It just doesn't capture that many pixels. But -- keeping that in mind -- it's a great little camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive Toy","review":"I bought the eyemodule thinking I would have photos decent enough to e-mail and/or print out with minor touch-up in Photoshop. Not the case. The 320x240 color resolution just doesn't give you sufficient material to work with and the \\"camera\\" is very sensitive to light (needs a lot). I returned the eyemodule after a few days of experimenting with it hoping that the design team will improve the resolution to at least 640x480 and include on-board memory so that the internal memory of the Visor isn't such a limiting factor."},{"rating":"2","title":"everyone thinks this is awesome....","review":"when they see me tinkering with the visor and then come over and find that i'm taking a candid picture they are so in awe that they are more curious then upset. this add-on is worth the bucks. for the price and the size (and the james bondishness) of it the color pics are more then okay. now if they only made a digital camcorder..........."},{"rating":"1","title":"eyemodule disappoints","review":"The eyemodule is a great idea, poorly executed.

I carry it everywhere. There are endless opportunities to capture images all day long and you don't have to worry about film. No, this is not a great camera, but for its size and convenience you can't beat it. My photos have been generally very good. Only a few duds done in poor light.Sometimes you can't tell how good the shots are until you've loaded them on to your PC (which is a snap). I have started sending daily photos to all my friends via E mail. Yes, you can take your own photo.

The customer service rep was helpful and willing to refund my money when I called to complaint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eyemodule not Ready!","review":"Disappointing is an understatement. Even with the best 'photo' enhancing software, you were hard press to clean-up the image. The concept and use are great, but developers should of waited til they could get a decent pixel count before releasing this not ready for primetime module. I took mine back within a week. You can get a very good 1.3 million pixel digitial camera for about ... and they are very easy to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful and fun.","review":"This item was a lot of fun until I dropped it. Will probably buy another.Although picture quality fair to poor depending on available light and hand movement, it provides images that are really useful. It captures the essence, if not the detail of the subject that can be edited into sketchbook images and saved to an address file an email or an illustrated newsletter. It is also great as a visual memo pad or recorder, capturing images on the fly for reviewing later. Stealth factor makes it fun, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just one word: \\"WOW\\"","review":"Terrific li'l gizmo I picked up the other day. Awesome quality with my Visor Deluxe.

I was hoping for somewhat better quality than what was delivered. But after using it for a while, and seeing how handy the product is, I began to soften. Don't expect 3 megapixel quality. It's a springboard module, for goodness sake. It does EXACTLY what is says it will do. I've used it to take pictures of people I've just met at business meetings. I've take pictures of scribblings on white boards. All spur of the moment when no one has a bulky digital camera at the ready. For all those who hate the Eyemodule, I say: If you want super-duper quality, but a 3 megapixel digital camera. If you want spontaneous photography and fun, go for the Eyemodule. Enjoy. It's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional Company Great Product-Made In USA","review":"I've had the Face Caddy about a week and as someone with TMJ I highlyrecommend it!!

While I have this book in a paperback and had enjoyed it, the formatting on the Kindle download is so totally screwed up that it borders on unreadable. Specifically, everything is left justified with no paragraph indents. Indeed, I slogged through about 10 pages or so in the hopes that it was just a glitch with a page or two before it became apparent that the entire book had this problem (and spot checking proved it so.)

Of all the books I have in my Kindle library this is the worst formatting job I've seen.Every line in this book is left justified, there are no indents, and no spaces between paragraphs. What RosettaBooks has done to this book is a travesty. And what is completely baffling is the first half, Part I published in Space Science Fiction magazine in 1953, was converted by Guttenberg and is available for free AND IT LOOKS BETTER THAN THIS VERSION. Unbelievable. A group of volunteers did a better job formatting than this publisher.The one-star rating for this book is only for the formatting.

The warranty clearly states that the product has a 2yr warranty and instructed me to send it to Gaggia repair center, which I did. They sent it back saying they do not repair grinders. Then Gaggia Milan told me the product only has a 1 year warranty and therefore it was no longer under warranty, even though I have the warranty details which clearly state it is a 2yr warranty.

I just use a dish towel on top when I am using it. That breaks the sound. 2. You have to hold down the button the entire time you are grinding.

The USB cable comes out the right side which is rediculous. It should come out the top. The USB cable doesn't reach my computer, so I had to move things around to connect it.

If you like Benigni you will certainly enjoy this film--as usual he shines with comedic brilliance. The movie is absolutely hilarious in some parts, and very touching in others. Benigni's acting is great, but there are also great performances by the supporting cast members. This movie is beautifully photographed and cleverly written and it's a shame it was released in 'dubbed' form in the U.S. Dubbed movies are always bad, but the actor who did the voice for Benigni's Pinocchio was just not a good choice at all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad at all!","review":"Ok, I was expecting this film to be bad based on all the bad (press) reviews but it actually isn't bad at all. As a Benigni fan I had to buy it and it's very much worth seeing, and I'm sure many other adult Benigni fans will agree. Much beautiful scenery and I laughed aloud through many scenes, such as the lollipop scene and a scene with Pinocchio along with the puppets and Fireeater... Benigni's facial expressions make it all worthwhile. Ok, so Benigni seems a little \\"out of place\\" playing a young boy, but it's fun and different. One thing though, best seen in the Italian with English subtitle version... Haven't even bothered to watch the English dubbed version. In my opinion, dubbed movies lose much and arent worth watching.*Note* This movie is not based on the Disney version so things can be unexpected unless youve read other versions....Oh and why don't my copies come with an insert? That part disappointed me, not the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely beautiful!","review":"This film was absolutely wonderful. I have no idea why it would get bad reviews. I am in my 20's and enjoyed it thoroughly. Being a huge fan of Benigni and Braschi helps. But I am going to say DO NOT watch the english version it's not good. I have no idea why they dubbed such a beautiful film with someone's voice that does severe injustice to Roberto's exuberant voice. But the Italian version is beautiful. Roberto is NOT to old as Pinocchio he is Pinocchio. In all of his films you see a touch of Pinocchio in his performances. Nicoletta Braschi as the blue fairy was so beautiful. I think it's her best acting yet. She was just amazing. I would recommend the Italian version to everyone. Really visually beautiful and it's a beautiful story. Don't listen to the bad reviews this is a beautiful film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't End Fast Enough for Me!!","review":"This film was TRULY painful to watch!! The scenes seemed totally unrelated and character development was weak so it was impossible to connect with or really care about any of the characters. Also, I am surprised that this dark, gloomy, bizarre and somewhat scary movie is rated \\"G\\". The scene where Pinnocchio is eaten by the whale was too much for my 3-year old. What was up with the \\"Blue Fairy\\"??-- I never understood her relationship to Pinnocchio. AWFUL, AWFUL movie-- don't spend money to see this one! Worst thing I've seen in a very long time! I'd pass on the video release also, but at least with the video you could FF to the end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ciao Pinocchio","review":"I found the movie to be a visual delight with Roberto as the mischievous boy puppet and his wife, Nicoletta as the Blue Fairy. The scenery was soothing and the special effects highly entertaining. I would have left the dubbing out. I was disappointed not to hear the movie in Italian, only to hear Roberto singing while the credits were rolling. The dubbing took away from the fact that it is an Italian story. I would like to see it in its native language with english sub titles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Benigni's Pinocchio - The Anti-Disney","review":"Roberto Benigni has done it again: he pulled off a fantastic experience by bringing a fresh approach to an over-worked genre. And by doing so, he has delivered a humbling blow to the Disney Studios - the monopolist of the genre. This is a children's story worthy of adult viewership. It melds the best of both the cinematic and theatrical worlds to an astounding effect. It is a movies' movie: It would have been viewed enthusiastically at Cinema Paradiso, had it preceded that wonderful memoir. The soundtrack works its magic in this composition of color and light. This is a seminal work, free and clear of any obligation to formulaic convention, while speaking eloquently the lanuage of the medium.This film, however, is dubbed into English. I would appreciate the option to view it with subtitles in the original Italian."},{"rating":"1","title":"PINOCCHIO ES MUY ESTUPIDO !!!!!","review":"Wow !!!

The dubbing of the movie in English couldn't have been worse. Watching Roberto Benigni jump around in his pajamas and bread hat for almost 2 hours was so very painful.

This movie just moved me to do so, however. It nearly moved me out of the theater after 45 minutes, too. If not for the fact that my two children were watching, I would have split.OK, so the English over-dubbing was to be expected, but it was done poorly creating a soundtrack that seemed not to fit with the movie. Either the volume or the synchronization or the character of the voice was off. The characters had so little connection between them that you wondered why some of them cared about each other (e.g. the fairy caring for Pinocchio). Benigni was, at times, so farcical as to be annoying. Things happened in disjointed sequences.All in all, I wouldn't even wait for the video. Be a good boy and spend your gold on something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting performance","review":"Having read a lot of the reviews, I was a little sad that many people didnt like this film. I had always wanted to see it in the theatre because I'm a big fan off Benigni. I went ahead and bought it anyway, and I think its really delightful. Roberto's portrayal of Pinocchio is amazing, and the film is really well made. I enjoyed it from beginning to end, and am now back where I started, wishing I had seen it in the theatre!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wooden","review":"Forget the technical problems, the bad dubbing, the muddy sound, the cheesy sets; these things are mere trifles in this monumentally bad movie. It takes a special kind of hubris to think that a fifty year-old man can successfully portray a pre-adolescent boy/puppet and Roberto Benigni (no surprise) fails. His acting isn't so much energetic as it is schizophrenic, water bug skitterings followed by shallow musings. Benigni's Pinocchio is a bounding, incongruous, humorless, vapid stick clad in a ridiculous costume.In the middle of this G-rated movie Pinocchio is floridly hanged by two robbers. The Blue Fairy (Nicoletta Braschi, as teeth-achingly beautiful as ever) brings him back to life-this is, after all, a fairy tale-but this scene is waaaaaaay too graphic for young children, as is the scene where Pinocchio gets swallowed by the leviathan.This movie ain't good, ain't funny, and ain't worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth purchasing","review":"Even if you are a true PLAID fan, you won't like this CD.

In some places the author even confuses the names of those she is has been discussing for the entire chapter.It fails to deliver any \\"hardships\\" that were claimed other than the loss of Lilly's parents. The abuse allegations are completely unbelievable since they never happened to her, but are told in second hand from her sisters. Lilly never really shows how they were \\"made to pay for our enjoyment.\\" The author fails to do her job in making the reader even the slightest bit interested in in the Lilly Bennett's plight. The author even fails to show how the three sisters overcome their \\"Uncle Georgie and Aunt Mabel.\\" Music? Humour?

Not much of a surprising reveal, but a great deal of suspense that will keep you on the edge of your seat and have your heart pounding with anticipation.The only reason I did not give this a full five stars was because the romance part of it was lacking. It definitely did not have the intensity like \\"PURE DYNAMITE\\" did, but was still okay. I do hope that the next book follows up on the missing brother story line. To leave us hanging and not finish it would be a shame. This book is definitely worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateurish","review":"This album represents the poorest example of the female fronted goth metal genera that I have yet heard. Overall the album has a cohesive feel to it with a unique overall tone, but the songs lack any memorable hooks, and the album is plagued by a host of problems. The production is sub par, leaving the guitar tone totally undefined and intermittently muffling other sections. The male backing vocals are laughably poorly done and the violin total overused, soloing on just about every song. Amateurish moments abound, such as the use of a heavily processed/synthesized vocal track at the end of \\"Partial Insanity\\" which comes out of the blue and is totally pointless, or the absolutely terrible keyboard solo during their unfortunate attempt to cover Metallica."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing great...","review":"IMO this is just an average work: cheesy lyrics, repeated formula (beautiful girls - ugly guys), lack of harmonies in the \\"cookie monster\\" vocals... the only track with \\"something\\" was TTTSNB.

After about a half dozen flights, one of the stabilizer fins tore away from the fuselage and the rocket failed to attain even its earlier disappointing altitude. I had to apologize to my 5 year old son because this piece of junk had been one of his birthday presents.I emailed Monkey Business, but they never responded. I also purchased a 99 cent rubber band-launched heli-rocket at the dollar store. It goes higher and still hasn't broken. Don't be a sucker; don't buy this or any Monkey Business product.

Also, it seems to offer a tighter seal of the window than the old regulator that I replaced with it. Anyone who is replacing a regulator with this item on a 98 Corolla (also possible for newer vehicles) needs to make note that it will may not bolt in the exact same manner as the old one. Also, you may need to make sure that you have one or two 10mm nuts on hand before starting the job.My vehicle used only one nut with a series of bolts to mount the regulator. Luckily the one nut fit the two bolt stems on this regulator, and I happened to have another in my tool box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early Work: 1970-1979 By Patti Smith","review":"Excellent compilation of the early stuff that would be hard to get now.

Both my 8 yr. old and 10 yr. old daughters have found this software entertaining, challenging, and educational. The software has four different skill levels that is challenging to both their learning needs.

However, my daughter and I find it extremely frustrating. Even when we know what the task is to be done, we often cannot figure out how to do it. The math puzzles, when we come across them, are fine, but most of the time is spent figuring out where to click for something. This game is very linear, so if you can't figure one thing out, there's no way to move to another task where you might eventually better understand the gestalt of the game. You just sit there, with Mia tapping her foot, repeating the same clue again and again and again and again and again. The help at kutoka.com was good to find, but it wasn't sufficient to solve the problem.Even with the parts we have played, I don't find it terribly compelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game, has it's downsides.","review":"I used this when I was a lot younger, and I remember it being the funnest and most educational game I had.

Bright flowers, glorious hiking, historic landmarks, mislaid keys, heavenly meals, a canny cat, travel to the dark and mysterious island of Staffa, even a cure for seasickness, factor into a fun and clever whodunit. When one of the members of an acrimonious church group is lost and presumed drowned in Fingal's cave, Dorothy senses more than knows that it is murder. Back at the beautiful island, she puzzles out the numerous motives, as a major storm blows an ill wind across the island. Better batten down the hatches, this one is exciting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A charming English cozy","review":"This is the third in Jeanne M. Dams' delightful English cozy series featuring Dorothy Martin, a retired American schoolteacher living in Sherebury, England. In this adventure, our heroine, en route to a vacation on the Scottish island of Iona, finds herself on a bus with an ill-assorted, bickering American church tour group headed for the same idyllic destination. Dorothy's holiday turns out to be anything but peaceful: An obnoxious American is killed in a fall from a cliff in Fingal's Cave, and Dorothy suspects murder. As if that weren't enough, the island is hit by an extremely violent storm. This is a wonderful series, with a charming sleuth and many likable characters. I recommend beginning with the first novel, \\"The Body in the Transept,\\" and reading the books in order, so you can become acquainted with Dorothy and her friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonexistent plot.","review":"I really enjoy the Dorothy Martin character; she's wonderfully self-confident and true to herself at all times.

She jumps right in to convince others that it wasn't but no one seems to believe her....she is surrounded by a group of Americans who don't like each other...don't worry, Dorothy to the rescue!

There is an interesting mystery here but it is put in the context of a person who continually makes derogatory comments about Christians by selecting nasty characters who are purported to be Christians. It these were nasty African Americans or Gay/Lesbians this would be totally unacceptable but Christians can be bashed with no reservations.The author clearly has an anti-Christian agenda that she chooses to push in this manner.It would have been an interesting mystery without being heightened in any way by bashing Christians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, what a great album","review":"I was very excited to get my hands on this CD. Her first, Patchwork Heart is one of our favorites. This CD does not disappoint. True to form, Valerie covers a lot of ground. My favorite is Dancing By The River, a country swing tune about the family picnic's on the Mississippi River. Big Ole Train uses some great harmony technique to evoke the sound of a trains horn echoing thru a valley. Don't miss the dark Simpsons Holler, and the haunting Oh Mandolin. As usual Valerie has a list of guests on this album that read like a who's who in Nashville. Its a must have for fans of easy going Americana that will keep you bouncing in your seat or Dancing By The River."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor","review":"This was a very poor document. I had met the swami that takes you all over, and spent some time with him. He is a complete fake with a huge ego problem.This documentary is an embaresment to Hinduism and the Kuhmba Mela. They only showed one true saint in this documentary and that was Ammachi.There were far more true saints there that could have been shown.There were true Guru's there. True renunciantes and holy men.Instead, they showed ego driven teachers, false prophets, and naked men begging for attention by stretching and pulling things with their penises.How enlightening can that be?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed Opportunity","review":"Short Cut to Nirvana, lacks proper research about the grand Hindu Festival, it is purely sensationalized. It misses the basic essence of calmness, devotion of people going to the Ganges River, rather it focuses on exotic and naked sadhus.

In other words, it is more meditative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sensationalist and Exoticizing!","review":"This film has no depth. It barely skims the surface of Kumbh Mela--and that, from a naive, outsider's perspective. It focuses merely on the sensational, and in so doing, exoticizes Kumbh Mela and the people partaking in it. Moreover, the slow-motion scenes and music were so melodramatic, it almost seemed like a parody (especially the scene with the trance-dancing girl)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So so, more freakshow than spiritual journey","review":"I wasn't too impressed with this film. It was hyped up quite a bit when it came out, but I don't think it delivered. It seemed to be, basically, a small bunch of wide-eyed naive Westerners being led around by a young swami of dubious character. He showed them all the crazy far-out gurus and swamis and guys who stretch out their genitals, etc. I think that had the filmmakers known their subject matter a little better the film would have been much better. Instead we are experiencing a proxy version of these young astonished, but ultimately ignorant, foreigners' quasi-religious carnival ride. It also seemed to wander around in it's subject matter. By the end I was just glad to be able to move on to watch something else. Also, why did someone tag this film with \\"Bhutan\\"?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointed!","review":"Shortcut to Nirvana:If you are looking for the sensational aspect of mystic India, this is perhaps a good movie to watch. I was dissappointed! This film fails to capture the spiritual intent and solemnity of the Kumbh Mela. Pilgrims eagerly look forward this rare festival for spiritual reasons!

The story line of the film was weak and failed to inspire many of those who watched it with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"This album is dissapointing at best. The best song is the single \\"Dem Boyz\\".

Instead of saying hyperspace, the author put faster-than-light. And there's only small mentions of the Empire, and Lando's hanging around systems barely anybody's ever heard of before. But the conversation Lando's having with the Hall in the pyramid of the Sharu was kind of humorous, so I recommend it if you're a big Star Wars fan (like me) and want to expand your knowledge of the Star Wars universe."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quirky and hilarious look at the young Lando Calrissian","review":"Lando has just one the Millenium Falcon in a card game and, against his will, also finds himself the owner of a brand new droid named Vuffi Raa.

The mystery of an ancient and highly intelligent race of beings who leave no trace of their existance except giant and impenetrable monuments has only one clue. Guess who gets to play detective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best dustpan around","review":"OXO International 33981 Dust Pan with Brush I have had this for years sitting under the sink in my small kitchen. It is perfect for the small spills or the bigger sweep-ups with a broom. The edge is flush with the floor so all gets swept up. The brush nestles securely in the groove of the pan's handle. The teeth on each side of the pan clean the bristles of brush and broom (a boon for a cat owner.) There is the great Oxo handle on the brush and it cleans easily, so it sill looks great."},{"rating":"1","title":"bristles too soft","review":"The bristles of the broom are much too soft. They don't correspond with the weight and heavy duty construction. They flex too easily making it very difficult to use. Dustpan OK."},{"rating":"1","title":"OXO Good Grips Dust Pan and Brush, Silver, does not work","review":"There must be considerable variation in this product. Mine arrived with a definite wave appearance to front of dust pan, making it impossible to place on a flat surface to make effective contact with that surface. Therefore, one can not sweep dust into pan without a good portion of the dust going under the pan. I would return it except for the return postage of $ 5.99. Unfortunately, the dust pan is a worthless piece of junk. I can use the brush with other dust pans that are more functional."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lexus of Dust Pans?","review":"According to Big Mama, yes. Looks good doing what it does while maintaining a contemporary look about it. Big Mama is always using it and I, for one, encourage that kind of behavior, for it not her then it probably would have to be me and as an adult male I abhor domestic chores even though I must confess I am very prompt on taking the trash out the day before trash pick up. What more can be said about a dust pan without sounding too inconsequential? Big Mama likes it, uses it often and considers it the Lexus of dust pans? As long as she keeps doing what she does with such enthusiasm and commitment who am I to deter her dutiful demeanor? 4 Big Stars and keep up the good work is what I say! Go Go Go!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Material","review":"I agree with another reviewer that the bristles are a bit too soft. The dust pan itself it made of a plastic that holds a lot of static. Because of this, when I try to empty the dirt out of the pan there is a lot of dirt that remains in the pan. Would not buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing - misshapen","review":"I am usually a big fan of OXO products. Ordered this pan, and when I used it the first time, I realized that half of the dirt goes underneath the dust pan. Turns out the front lip on mine is warped and doesn't completely touch the floor. Kinda defeats the purpose of a dustpan. The brush seems nice. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"OXO made a mistake","review":"I'll begin by saying that I typically LOVE OXO products. In my experience, they're a step above the competition. They look better, feel better, perform better and they last longer.Not this time. Here's the deal.The handle on the \\"broom/brush\\" is bizarre. I don't know, it's like ergonomic-friendly for a gorilla. The black rubber \\"knob\\" that you hold is just wrong. It's too fat and angled weird. You're not sure how to hold it. This is the case for girls and guys alike.Plus, the bristles on the brush aren't firm enough at all. They're soft as feathers and barely sweep up a thing.What a bummer. I had the rubbermaid version in my shopping cart, but switched at the last moment when I saw the OXO choice. (Which again, is more $$ but usually worth it.)Choose another dustpan and broom/brush."},{"rating":"2","title":"lightweight, durable, sturdy","review":"We have had this broom for almost 10 years, and it has been wonderful. We killed the bristles by sweeping out a hot oven with it (the nylon bristles squinched up like shrinky dinks), but if we had not done that, I'm sure it would still be 100%."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buggy and incomplete","review":"This book is an adequate introduction to the creation of custom controls, including design-time support.I give it only two stars because:1) It does not give you enough in-depth information to create real-world custom controls. It is just a brief introduction.2) The source code is rubbish. It is poorly formatted, has annoying typos (with no errata on the SAMS website, though you can download the code) and looks like it was written by people with shaky concepts of how .NET code should be written.I especially like the content-free XML comments. Nice.Unfortunately, I don't think there is a better book out there. The only other source of custom control info is the web, which can be kind of spotty. If you are an author and you know custom controls, please write a better book than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very useful","review":"This book is quite luke warm. Most of the book is source code that actually has a few errors. The source code included makes up ~1/3 of the already slim book. I would have rather seen an attached disc or a website I could go to to download the source. The book breifly discusses some main topics including distribution and GDI however the book is too thin to actually be very benificial. Most of the concepts are readily available on MSDN or GotDotNet.com. I hate to be harsh but this book failed to introduce so general important concepts including typical custom control layouts invloving a custom arraylist amd arraylistitems.. I have yet to write a control that hasn't used these. Anyway... two start because it does hit some basic concepts but really lacks the warmth and depth need to fully be a custom control development book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish there had been another book on this topic...","review":"To be honest, I bought this book because it was the only one I have found so far specifically on the topic of custom controls.In retrospect maybe I should have looked harder or waited longer. While this book does outline the basic concepts pretty well, the author should have spent more time on it.If you're a little compulsive about coding style and consistency (like most professionals are) the examples in this book are going to drive you crazy! Weeks doesn't stick to any particular naming convention - the code just looks like a hack job. Sorry...But it's true.In all fairness, the book does put all the pertinent topics in one place and it's pretty short. So, despite it's faults the book will get you up and running faster than reading the online help and other resources."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOULD BE MUCH BETTER IF PROPERLY REVISED","review":"This book has got one two positive qualities, but, readers who expect comprehensive details should condition their minds for some sorts of disappointments.It did give a general overview of .NET Windows curriculum, but faltered in its bid to teach .NET developers the intricate procedures, which they need in order to create their own custom controls.On going through the first three chapters, I realized that the author of this book is a brilliant mind who experiences difficulties in teaching others what he knows.Subsequent editions of this book would be sound, if reviewed and edited by more experienced teachers."},{"rating":"1","title":"JAlden","review":"Disappointing! This short book is mostly sample code, with much repetition. There is very little explanation of the concepts. Code generation(serialization) isn't covered at all. The MSDN site has more and better code samples, also without much in the way of explanation, but at least they are free."},{"rating":"1","title":"ARRRGH!","review":"Beware! This is not the show Mostly True Stories: Urban Legends Revealed that was running on The Learning Channel and Discovery a few years ago. I goofed and bought this disc, which dramatizes 3 stories per episode and challenges the audience to guess which one really happened and which ones are only Urban Myths. The trouble is if you're an Urban Legend enthusiast like me, you already are familiar with these stories and this show doesn't fill in the background on the legends like \\"Mostly True Stories\\" does. So you end up with some hokey dramatizations which would tip off even someone who has never heard the stories to which ones \\"actually happened\\".

I saw all the other \\"Brat Pack\\" movies but , I never even heard of this. I was happy to sit down and see a cast of actors who would become more famous in later years. The film's first act has some very funny(and ridiculous!)court rooms shenanigans and then it turns to a little more serious side. The film flips back to more outrageous comedy and then gets kind of dark, it's all a little uneven to say the least but, I did enjoy it. If your a fan of Judd Nelson you should check this out."},{"rating":"2","title":"surprizing twists and turns","review":"This movie entranced me on the first viewing. You see, it begins with young,cocky lawyers trying to get ahead. Two of them work at a highly reguarded law-firm. In a trail that to say the least is comical we are led down a path thinking the movie will be light and funny. Suddenly, with the second trial the viewer is thrust deep into a murder trial! The defendent is a quirky, wierd scary type who seems smarter than the young lawers but also crazy at the same time. the movie gets more and more serious as we find out the killer is trying to force people to his will. The young lawyer is caught between a rock and a hard place. IF he gets the creep off he knows a killer got away with it. If he lets the truth come out he could lose his carreer. The swing of emotions from the comic trial to the serious ending is about a dramatic as any movie I have ever seen. I still havent had another film drag me to laughter and then fear. Highly recommened."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly entertaining from start to finish","review":"Comedic lawyer shenanigans reveal the brilliant legal minds of recent law school graduates.

If a 130 pound girl was forced to fight a 225 lb. heavyweight cage fighter and the girl asked me for a good book to read I would not recemmend Tedeschi's book. I think Tedeschi must spar with one-armed old ladies--- thats about all his book will prepare you for. I don't know about the striking section of the book so I can't comment on that. Check out Jwing-Ming Yang's Chin Na books for the advanced locking techniques. I would recommend his chin na books to that girl I wrote about above (I was actually thinking about Whitney Houston vs. Mike Tyson)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning!","review":"This book covers all the basic techniques of a wide range of martial arts. It is not a manual on Brazilian Jiu jitsu but does include some fundamental techniques.It is not a manual for cage fighting or mix martial arts competition. It is an over view of Hapkido (and I would say traditional Japanese Jiu jitsu).It has a good deal of stand up grappling that is missing in most arts so I found it very useful in that respect. Throws, joint locks, leg locks, arm bars, weapons, etc. are covered in detail.This is a must have for martial artists of all backgrounds, you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reference.","review":"This volume is well written and extremely well photographed.

Like other people have said it is a pain to put together but it's hard to get certain screws in. My biggest complaint is that I think a coffee table should last more than a couple of years. The paint job didn't even hold up a year. There are big junks of wood missing. A little excessive for everyday wear and tear. The drawers are falling apart and the bottom shelf broke off a year or two ago.

But, as I started putting together, I realized that, it would greatly help if there is step-by-step instructions along with the pictures. When I was doing it, I forgot to look carefully at the pictorial illustration, and screwed all the four legs without fitting the middle panel, and later I had to take two off and screw them again, in order to fit the middle panel. That is one thing you might want to look carefully while assembly. Overall, I am happy with the table and its good for the price. I should agree that the table is not too big, and if you have a large living room, you might want to check the dimensions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some flaws in paint","review":"I recently ordered this coffee table after buying the matching TV stand and I am glad I ordered it when it did. It has gone up in price $30 since I ordered it. The coffee table was easy to assemble but did have some paint flaws. On the drawer side of table the edges of the drawer were worn and the paint was missing. Also on the curved portion of the top there was a noticeable spot where the paint had been missed. All in all I decided these add character to the table and touched them up myself. Seeing as it is black it was easy enough to cover up. I wish they would have done a better job painting, but for the price I am quite pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"my coffee table","review":"arrived with crack on wood, cannot see when assembled, top surface bumpy looks cheap, bottom shelf does not allign.

Some seem a bit off -- in the socializing area there are invitations to go home with strangers (and a way to say no..but still...) Dining out, drinking, tourist areas, camping, even complaints are briefly covered.This book has details beyond what I hope I'll need in Turkey. Aside from the foods, it offers all the parts of an automobile (including a diagram of the inside of a car) and body parts (no diagram!).Interesting reading -- it has little bits of information that could be useful.

Even at the lowest setting it still is uncontrollable, unless it contains only a small ampount of liquid. Why weren't we warned? The spare instructions make no mention of the need to firmly hold down the cover (however vainly).

It is shipped with a nice cover which prevents the filter having any troubles while not mounted to the lens. And when the filter is mounted, it acts as a cover for the actual lens as well.As expected, when the filter is attached to the lens the image darkens a bit, so shutter speed tends to decrease. Thus I would suggest you to use a tripod if you have a lens without IS capability, as I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slim and clear","review":"This is a very fine, thin filter.

Anything that B&W makes tends to be high quality. But, of course, you get what you pay for.

I strongly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"verdict still out on this ...","review":"Maybe I just don't get it. This Polarizer works differently from previous circular polarizers I have owned. Sometimes it works and the results are dramatic, however most of the time there is no polarization even though conditions dictate that there should be. It is advertised to work w/ a 24-105MM lens which is what it is attached to, however I still get vignetting at the 24mm setting. Expensive lens protector at this point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected...","review":"I was really excited to get my hands on a quality B+W filter to see what it could do compared to my 20+ year old Vivitar c-pol and man was I disappointed. Pictures look desaturated and the effect of the polarizer isn't right. Skies became more gray and reflections weren't reduced in the same fashion as before. Some colors shifted pretty badly in pictures. Overall I feel like this was a bad purchased and I'm looking for another filter. I bought the slim version to reduce vignetting, but not at the expense of picture quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"always great","review":"Love they quality and this one is of the same high quality as I expected. Like the way it is packaged also--simple and pro."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK for those on a tight budget.","review":"Purchased this in hopes of not having to spend the hundreds for a better quality filter. Well end the end I ended up returning it. It was an OK filter, but I could see a strong polorization spot in a lot of the photos. This only happened with the wide angle zoom lens wide open. While that was kind of a pain, the most annoying part of this filter was definitely the cap. The cap does not stay on at all and I am still not sure why they even bothered including it in the package. Disappointed. If you can afford a better filter I would suggest looking at other models."},{"rating":"1","title":"No cap for this filter !","review":"I can understand that this filter wont hold a common cap, lets say a Nikon original 72mm cap, because its very slim. But for me, the fact that the B&W cap that COMES WITH THE FILTER doesn't works neither is A FRAUD. What a joke !!! B&W must alert you for the fact that there's NO cap that holds on it. BIG desing mistake. Big shame. If you need a CPL for continous outdoor use, DONT BUY THIS SLIM CPL."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first one worked well, but...","review":"The first one I purchased worked like a charm, even though the custom B+W lens cap would fall off while stored inside my camera bag (FYI a normal lens cap will not fit over this filter) thus the filter apparantly received a few scratches from scraping other equipment inside my bag. Now, after shelling out an extra hundred bucks to replace the first one (which was almost brand new) its identical replacement has a colder blue cast in the glass... They don't even match!!!So, besides the useless lenscap which never stays on, I seriously question the scratch resistance of the glass and B+W's quality control, hence the two different colored filters I have sitting right in front of me. I know B+W is supposed to have a great reputation, but my own opinion has been swayed. I just hope I don't have any problems with the return of this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"a really uncomfortable accessory","review":"This B+W 82mm Slim-Line Circular Polarizer is really uncomfortable because the original cap lens don't fix wit the filter.

Shakespeare study notes that are really authoritative, accurate and enthusiastic. This new edition of Cliff's notes on Macbeth is outstanding. There are all the usual things that would be expected in notes of this type, but added to this is a real sensitivity in the appreciation of the language, and also an awareness of Macbeth as a play to be performed. it is perhaps this sensitivity that sets these notes apart.

I hope this feature is improved and designed to be used as a slide show presentation. I've been looking for this feature for a long time. During a live video conference I've often wanted to show recently taken digital photos while chatting.

I bought this cam as a replacement for my quickcam pro 4000 and am greatly disappointed since the image quality and clarity is no where near as good as that of my previous cam which happens to be at least 4 years older than this one. No amount of tweaking or driver updates have allowed me to get an image as defined and pronounced as i was able to with my previous logitech camera and to think this was more than twice as expensive as the quickcam pro 5000 which i now feel would have given me far better value for money.I would not recommend this camera to buyers who are serious about streaming image quality and I sure did not expect this from logitech whose products account for over 50% of extended arsenal of computer peripherals"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this camera","review":"Don't let the attractive specs of this camera lure you. This camera looks good on paper but will provide nothing but instability and mediocre image capturing.Logitech claims it is a software issue that causes poor and impossibly dark images, constant BSODs and hardware incompatibilities. Regardless, the camera simply does not work and should not have been released yet.I worked diligently troubleshooting but ultimately wasted many hours of my life on this paperweight. Do yourself a favor and buy another camera or wait till Logitech is kind enough to release stable drivers (hint. Don't hold your breath)Also avoid the forums if you are looking for support as they will offer one of two responses:\\"Repeat issue, search!\\" or \\"Try a clean install of the drivers\\"This product severely lowered my opinion of Logitech."},{"rating":"1","title":"Causes crashes, image not great in low light","review":"This camera caused the BSOD every once in a while. Previous Logitech 5000 never did that once. Today, downloaded new software (v 10.5) from the Logitech site, and the BSOD problem occcurs every other time the camera is turned on.When the camera doesn't cause the computer to crash, the picture is okay in good lighting. It is very hard to adjust manually and the right-lite software barely makes a difference.Stay away from this camera until Logitech comes out with a solid software fix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it!

Looking back on it and having not been such a big horror fan then, I realize now that this is a great episode of GOOSEBUMPS. I agree with another viewer in saying that this is quite creepy and might send chills up even adults spines, and if that can happen, the children will be ferociously scared with this one. There are only about 3 episodes of GOOSEBUMPS that can generate chills and thrills like movies such as HALLOWEEN and THE EXORCIST, and this is one of them. The dad is quite the odd-ball and I felt sorry for the kids for ever having him as a father.

As the savage tribes fall one by one to this conquering enemy, they hire a small team of assassins led by The Rock, to exterminate the swordsman. Due to a betrayal, he turns the table and The Rock is suddenly thrust alone to confront the enemy. Alone that is, until he steals away the swordsman's ace, the Sorceress.

As Mathayus, the Arkadian assassin, he is a force to be reckoned with, hacking his way through his enemies with nary a backward glance. His one weak spot is the Sorceress (Kelly Hu) he was meant to kill, but when he realizes the depth of his feelings for her, he will do anything to protect her. Dwayne Johnson manages to combine both these elements into one film without making the story into a total joke in the process.I would like to point out that this movie is not for everyone. If you're one of those out there who are looking for a film that is gravid with meaning and emotion, then The Scorpion King isn't for you. If you just want to see an action-packed film that happens to have some fine acting in it as well, then by all means, grab your wallet out and buy it.

But Scorpion King isn't really a movie. I've forgotten the basic plot already and really don't care (which is normally ok if there's good special effects and a little more money thrown at the movie). But in this case, it borderlines low budget and isn't really interesting at all. It's pretty clear they spent INFINITELY more money on advertising and cable specials featuring \\"the rock\\" than they did on production.

The longer the movie ran, the more accutely aware I was that the star of the movie is named \\"Dwayne\\" because even his charisma of the ring falls away in the face of his terrible acting. \\"Acting\\" here means squint-eyed stare with mouth closed OR wide-eyed stare with mouth open.

Really [bad] special effects. Basically just an extremely boring movie, with tiny humerous points which are a desperate attempt to liven it up. Plus, where is the great relation which makes him the Scorpion King? Nothing special, he just gets stuck with an arrow with a little bit of scorpion venom on it and doesn't die. WHOOOPYY! What is really funny is the music video by Godsmack has better computer animation than the movie itself. Even in the music video the Rock forms out of scorpions and then dissolves back into scorpions which didn't even happen in the movie.

If I were being more mercenary (ie: not taking my personal preferences into account), I'd probably rate it as 3 of 5.

It was enjoyable from start to finish, not a boring bit in the entire film.

I know he's popular, and very charismatic, but these qualities will only get you so far, and I think he was in way over his head. In the sequel to The Mummy, we saw him for a brief time and he had little or no dialogue, and it worked. Here, I just had a hard time believing that he was the character he was trying to play, and not just some professional wrestler transplanted into role that demanded more acting ability. There were some exciting parts in the movie, but overall I just got really bored. If you really want to see an excellent movie of this genre, go get Conan the Barbarian. This one is pretty much a stinkeroo, albeit a slick and glossy stinkeroo.

If you like adventure, humor, and legends this is good. The action is great! When it comes out on DVD I will buy it. Go see it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply awful","review":"Now don't get me wrong - I like the Rock. I thought he was terrific in the cameo that he had in The Mummy Returns; way better than the CGI scorpion at the end of the film. His Saturday Night Live episode is one of my favorites. This foray into entertainment, though, should have been left in its entirety on the cutting room floor. The story is completely predictable and trite. There is nothing lovable about the character; there are no higher values explored than an undying need for revenge and there is no subplot of any real interest. Arnold did it better in Conan, without digital effects. Read elsewhere the plot if you must, but I am sure you can already predict the story line. Don't bother buying it new, for I am sure you will find plenty of used copies at bargain prices. The very worst thing about this is that there is probably already a sequel planned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible B-movie","review":"The first few minutes set the tone. In the opening scene, the Rock shoots someone with an arrow, and they fly out of the room like they were hit with a scud missile. This movie is similar to the early hercules B-movies. A bunch of people running around in loin cloths, lots of exotic unrealistic weapons and no plot. If you enjoy campy muscle flicks, get a Conan movie, they are much better than this advertisement for the Rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would give this movie a negative rating if possible","review":"The Mummy and the Mummy Returns, both excellent movies should not be associated with this movie.

Make an ancient style action movie with the rock. I don't know, but they did. You'll be able to tell that it's really bad in the first 5 minutes of the movie, but by then it's too late. The only thing I found entertaining about this movie was the Rock's commentary with easter eggs. While not exact, this typical: The Rock: \\"This is my favorite scene\\" very very long silence... \\"It was 3 in the morning when this scene was shot\\" very very long silence, etc... Click on an scene easter egg(a scorpion in this case), and a small screen with the Rock wearing headphones pops up and you get to see him saying lines like the ones I just listed.What a waste of money, theirs, not mine. Thankfully it was a free rental for me.I suggest a target audience of no higher than young teen, but then you should screen the film first for violence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops.","review":"The spin off from the Mummy movies see's the Rock expanding his part of The Scorpion King. This time he is a good guy for some reason and is fighting some guy in egypt who has a British accent(?). He falls in love, has a Comic sidekick, conveniently named Comedic Sidekick. This name alone shows how little effort has been put into this cheeseball of a film. To get its low certificate we never see anyone get stabbed, we just get those annoying noises. Performances are terrible even Michael Clarke Duncan. With no CGI this really can't expect to stand up to The Mummy, but at least it had the guts to not use much CGI, or could they just not be bothered?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculously Xena-esque","review":"I watched The Rock play the Scorpion King in \\"The Mummy Returns\\" and what little battle scenes they had were excellent and had a good degree of historical accuracy (before the Anubis Warriors showed up). The Rock did an excellent job in this and when I heard that his movie was coming out, I was glad because I knew that this character had enormous potential.The movie, however, was a collosal disappointment. No attempt was made for historical accuracy. Half the battle scenes were filled with Amazonians who would not last past the first shout in real battle with Ancient Warriors. Instead of being a historical extravaganza in the tradition of \\"The Egyptian\\" or \\"Quo Vadis,\\" what we have in this film is just another Xena-like butchery of history, making people know less than they would if they knew nothing about early Egyptian history.Thumbs down, release the lions into the arena!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Rainy Day Movie","review":"This is a cool movie to watch on a lazy day, stay home and watch a movie day.

Conan the Barbarian from 20 years ago was far better than this piece of trash.The Rock has the body for this kind of film but his acting talents and his charisma are disappointingly tragic.This film had the set-up and the plotline to be a fantastic fantasy film but the producers decided to simply milk the connection between this movie and The Mummy Returns (kinda the way the producers milked Aliens 3 from Aliens 2) and spent nothing in terms of sets and special effects.Please, people, don't waste a single second watching this total letdown."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This movie totally rocks!!!

That story called him a fierce and ruthless conquerer who made a deal with the devil. Well, this doesn't seem like the same guy. The story is goofy and filled with cheesy lines and sub par acting. The movie does have it's good points, such as the action sequences and beautiful cinematography. Worth a viewing.BLU RAY THOUGHTS: A sharp looking disc with great audio.

The setting isn't in egypt, its in something like Pakistan or something! There is no mention of the dog like creatures that he ends up controlling. NONE OF THAT!!!!

So if you go to this movie expecting another version of The Mummy Returns, then you probably wont be too disappionted. The problem with this movie is that it's too safe.

I also must complain about the special effects. The special effects are very poor. I expected great special effects like what I saw in The Mummy Returns.If you want to get a movie with The Rock, then buy The Mummy Returns instead.

He's really getting into board games and is also a big Disney buff, so I thought he would like it.Turns out, he loves it. We play almost every day. The game offers many different methods of matching: by picture, color, letter, and number, so children of any and all ages can play together and not have to worry about being at different comprehension levels. At four, my son matches the color and picture, but it's also a great tool to review numbers and (limited, true) letters.I suppose the only con would be that there might not be enough chips included. It's fine when it's just my son and I, but if we were playing the blackout version (fill up the entire card) with more people, we would probably run out of chips. But that's no big deal; you can use pretty much anything as extra chips.Any game that we can play as a family and has even a little educational value is tops in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for all ages!","review":"Our whole family can play this game right down to my 3 year old who does not need to know his letters or numbers to play. Younger kids can look at the color and character on the screen and match it to their board.

Anything that helps me accomplish that is priceless in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game","review":"This game is a big hit with my 2 and 5 year old! My 2 year old can play this on her own, since they show the picture on the TV and she can match it to her card. The wild clips are their favorite (where they show a short clip of a disney movie).

But wait, there's more! This book trancends the label of \\" science fiction\\". It is also part biography , part history novel, part adventure, part damn good read!Critics of the book mainly get all caught up in the fact that the writing is perhaps not as brilliant in a literary way as the great authors. But you need to give Farmer a bit of leeway here.The great authors could never have come up with a concept like this, and sustain the excitement throughout the novel. It is also very well researched and he brings characters like Sir Richard Francis Burton and Alice Hargreaves back to life. The concept is also so incredibly grand and breathtaking, that it would really take 20 books to do it justice, so Farmer is doing the best he can in one short book, and the trade off is that the pace just keeps you on the edge of your seat.Do yourself a favour and read this book!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Fantasy Series--Not to be missed!","review":"I was lost in the adventures of Sir.

Highly recommended, though the series gets a bit tedious by books four and five."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"Not your dad's science fiction.Farmer shows his love of throwing strange casts of characters together in this novel, where those who die wake up on the Riverworld - which as you might guess, has a really long river.

Nazis, famous adventures and more, in a strange quest to work out what is going on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astounding concept, inept execution","review":"I read this back in 1979, and recently reread the series through \\"Magic Labyrinth.\\" It was better the first time. This first volume has a gosh-wow factor second to none, but the writing is so amateurish that it could never get published today. That really doesn't improve much as the series progresses, so I must rate the first volume as the best of the bunch. I DO recommend the series as an SF classic, but it also shows how far the genre has advanced in the years since it was published."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best sf book of all time!!!","review":"hell, that's quite a plug isn't it? Well this book deserves it!I first read this amazing book in 1979, and have re-read the series many times. I have read an awful amount of sf in my time but I have to say this is the best book ever. The idea is ingenious and Farmer turns it into an exciting mystery-thriller as well as a brilliant work of science ficton.I suppose that if true literary writing ability is your criterion, then Farmer is only an average writer. But this man's imagination and talent for ideas is unmatched in my experience and , taking this into consideration, he is the best sf writer ever! If you never read another science fiction book, you MUST read \\"To Your Scattered Bodies Go\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent adventure story in original setting","review":"Partly a wish fulfillment fantasy (there IS an after life, and it comes with free food, free booze, free love and free weed!) and partly Farmer's chance to share his banal opinions on religion, sex, the death penalty, and various Victorian personages. As one might expect from something written in the late 60s and early 70s we also get predictions of mass famine and a shortage of oxygen due to pollution by 2010. There is also a wise alien whom humans are too foolish to listen to.The book also includes the usual adventure stuff, with people fighting, people being taken captive, people escaping captivity, etc. I actually thought the adventure stuff was pretty good, and along with the interesting and unusual setting, and the interesting and unusual characters (including 19th century British explorer Richard Burton and 20th century German aviator and Nazi big wig Hermann Goering) the adventure elements make To Your Scattered Bodies Go an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One intriguing concept from the mind of P. J. Farmer...","review":"This is a very absorbing book that makes you ponder about why we are here, and what is soul? I read the whole Riverworld series multiple times about twenty years ago, and found it really fascinating with all the possibilities of humankind being resurrected all at one time on a strange world. After re-reading this book again, the idea is still very interesting, but I think the book is bogged down too much with personal observations and details, so many details, so the story seems a little choppy. You can tell that Philip Jose Farmer really admired the people he made the protagonists in this story and described them very well, but I think all the detail detracts from the story quite a bit. The biggest thing that you can take away from this book is your own ponderings - what would you do, do we have souls that travel the Universe after we die or does life begin and end with the physical body?"},{"rating":"2","title":"One hell of a ride!","review":"Without a doubt, one of the best books I have had the pleasure to read!

The Church teaches that salvation is offered to all men, and that it is up to each individual to embrace it or not. I also noticed that, in these pages, it mentioned the 10 Commandments and the natural moral law but made no reference to Christ's moral teachings which make much greater demands on one and distinguishes Christian behavior. The 10 Commandments and natural moral law oblige everyone, not just Christians.

That doesn't mean the schism was right or valid but pretending it was down to a dodgy king (Henry VIII) when it was actually partly caused as a backlash to a particularly nasty loyal Roman Catholic queen makes me inclined to believe the rest of the book is a pack of lies too.Yours in deep disappointment"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Informative","review":"This book is really easy to understand and is helpful in explaining about the church to other Christians.

There's no resisting \\"Kristina\\" or \\"Calling All Girls\\", simplistic though their lyrics may be. \\"Black is Black\\" isn't bad, just unnecessary.

Still, this is also the album that produced \\"I Get Excited,\\" \\"Don't Talk To Strangers\\" and \\"Kristina,\\" a song which has been given new life during Springfield's 1999 KARMA Tour. This is also the album that contains \\"April 24, 1981,\\" a song Springfield wrote about the death of his father and the beginning of a theme that runs throughout the rest of his later work.

However, it also tends to peel up at my cuticles, and eventually my polish will catch on clothing or a towel and peel off in a large sheet. It makes removing polish easy and fun (but horribly unhealthy for my nails).As a top coat, this product is the worst. I can let my nails dry for 4 hours, go to bed, and wake up with imprints of my sheets in my nails. Hours after using it, I can still leave fingerprints on my polish or smudge it.

However, for the more experienced practitioner it is limited in its usefulness. The phrase \\"beyond the scope of this book\\" becomes too repetitive whenever the interesting and challenging topics are mentioned. And it is precisely these modeling areas that differentiate the convertible bond from the more trivial option pricing problems that are covered well in other books. This lack of detail in the meatier areas is the biggest disappointment of the book.

(Though to me Zarkon seems a more original, believable character than Doc Savage.) But when I read Volcano Ogre (note to Amazon.com - I believe the word in the title is \\"Ogre\\" not \\"Orge\\"!) I think back to those great Scooby Doo cartoons I used to watch as a kid. Scooby and the gang were always battling some villan who was masquerading as a mysterious monster. Volcano Ogre has the same feel, though of course Lin Carter's novel has a lot more depth than a 1 hour cartoon. Doc Menlo is like the brainy Valerie, only more so; and Scorchy can be likened to Shaggy. Of course, no cartoon character compares to the towering literary figure which is Prince Zarkon. I guess you've got to read this book - and I highly recommend it - to appreciate what Lin Carter has crafted here."},{"rating":"2","title":"an intelligent & sometimes funny Woody Allen gem","review":"This movie is never shown on television.

This is precisely what Edwards does in this book. The language he uses that reviewers have called 'lively' or 'witty' is actually nothing more than empty rhetoric against a straw man. The only value of this book is that it is a perfect example of what philosophy should NOT be. Unfortunately, I'm sure many readers will not see this book for what it is and walk away from it thinking that they understand Heidegger's philosophy. Of course there are problems and 'confusions' in Heidegger's philosophy, but this is hardly a proper way of addressing them. My advice is to read 'Being and Time' for yourself. Shame on Prometheus Books for publishing this and calling it 'a thorough critique of the philosophy of Martin Heidegger'. Misrepresenting and dismissing a thinker as 'obscure and mystical' is hardly a critique...and it is certainly not thorough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"This book is infuriating. This is not a serious engagement with the thought of Heidegger, one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century, but rather resorts to name-calling and knocking down strawmen.

His story really is very interesting, but the book doesn't capture it.

Williams is obsessed with a young family with Connie Nielsen playing the mother, who are frequent customers in his Savemart store. He is enamored with Nielsen's young son imagining himself to be part of the family. We learn that this is in response to Williams own wretched childhood.When Williams developes a roll of film belonging to an attractive young lady he detects the family's father played by Michael Vartan, having an affair with the gal. Williams though devastated decides to take matters into his own hands.One Hour Photo plays like a symphony, starting slowly and building to a crescendo which is quite disturbing. Williams was excellent in his role."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst movie ever","review":"this is one of the worst movies ive seen and i am a big robbin williams fan ive seen every thing he has done even the birdcage i thought thet insomia was ten times better then this garbege but thats just me im sure there are heeps of poeople out there who like it i thougt it was bouring"},{"rating":"2","title":"3 stars out of 4","review":"The Bottom Line:Though the advent of digital photography may render the theme somewhat obsolete, this well-directed and acted horror film acts on the audience's fears convincingly for a majority of the film until the not-entirely successful ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"About Schmidt is the better, fat, old guy on a toilet movie, but","review":"...One Hour Photo is the more watchable film. Romanek's MTV eye betrays the absurdly phony family scenes, but the SavMart stuff has a unique aesthetic appeal, if only because big-budget movies are rarely set in brightly-lit stores and malls where so many of us spend so much of our lives. After nine plus hours of dank and dark Hobbit opera, this film is the perfect palate cleanser. My favorite scene involves Sy arguing with the technician about color shifts or some such thing--it's just so relatably banal. Nobody's saving the world or falling in love. The predictable third-act hysterics bring us back to movieland but, overall, a memorable semi-cult flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 Stars, Good For What It Is...","review":"For what it is, this movie is great. Very not typical of a Robin Williams film, but that's just my opinion. I have seen Robin do so much, from comedy, to this. I was very impressed with his acting. He made the movie and played the character perfectly.PlotThis movie is basically about a photo obsessed freak who is lonely and shares his time constrcuting a collage of a frequent customer's family at the photo place he works at. After he is found out, the movie really starts to get interesting. \\"Cy\\" (Robin williams) does a variety of things to give off that \\"freaky, stalker vibe\\", and in the end, I really appreciate the orginiality of this movie, and I truly think it was an underdated release.Pro's:Of course Robin Williams acting in the film, Original plot/story line....Cons:Wasn't the best quality, sort of low budget.OverallI was very pleased with this release. It's probably cheap enough now that to buy it would be worth it for any true Robin Williams fan, indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark, involving, challenging","review":"I was never a great fan of Robin Williams as a comedian, but he has proved himself a great actor time and again, including in this superior psychological thriller. As \\"Sy the Photo-Guy\\", Williams is as chilling as he is sympathetic.For the most part, director Romanek eschews predictability and takes us on an ambiguous journey that challenges us and involves us on every level rather than presenting an easy, black-and-white universe that cues us to gasp or scream in the appropriate places. This is a tale told with a great stylistic flair that fleshes out rather than detracts from the thematic material. Certainly this will come to be regarded as something of a minor classic in years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Robin Williams' worst movie to date....","review":"Okay so that may be overstating but honestly there was not much to like about this movie. The oddest moment is when he breaks into someone's house essentially to use their toilet.I get it... he wants to be a part of their lives. He lives vicariously though those with whom he is connected via their photographs.What should have been an interesting plot starring an uber-talented actor falls flat in the less than talented hands of either the writer or director. Not sure which one dropped the ball here but somebody did... and Robin Williams's best performance couldn't have saved this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie ever","review":"This movie is the worst I've ever seen. The worst part about is that it's suppose to be scary, but it's just stupid. It's poorly writen and it has a terrible plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolutely pathetic","review":"This is one of the worst movies I have ever wasted my time on. I don't mind suspending my belief in reality for a few hours while watching a movie... in fact, I enjoy it. But there was no way to suspend as much reality as this film asks you to. The idea that the police would expend all of the manpower and energy on what was (at the time they were first called in) not even a crime, is almost funny. Well, it would have been funny if it wouldn't have just gotten worse and worse. To even mention the film \\"Taxi Driver\\" in the same review as this movie is an insult. Don't waste your money or your time with this one. It was awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to funny Robin...","review":"I guess I'm off base, as it seems that others really enjoyed this movie... I HATED it! I purchased it because I was intrigued to see how Williams portrayed a creepy bad guy... \\"not well\\" was the overwhelming answer I got. It is hard to watch this movie and not imagine this crazy stalker shouting \\"Goooood Morning Vietnam,\\" doing funny impressions, or dressing up as an old lady. Instead, you see Williams wielding a knife, and stalking your typical American-dream suburban family (or so it seems). To me, it was the equivilant of watching Big Bird do porn or Jim Carrey doing a horror flick. I know that it's not fair to type-cast such a brilliant actor, but \\"bad guy\\" and Robin Williams just truly do NOT go together. Stay away from this one.. it's a waste of time and money, and will tarnish your image of one of the best modern actors in America."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Always the Quiet Guys","review":"\\"One Hour Photo\\" is one of those rare gems of a thriller that is driven mostly by character development instead of plot. Robin Williams gives one of his finest performances as a lonely photo finisher whose obsession with a family eventually drives him over the edge.Some reviewers compare this film with \\"Taxi Driver,\\" but I don't think it's much like it at all. While Taxi Driver's third act turns into an over-the-top gore fest of violence and insanity, One Hour Photo lets its protagonist gradually slip into a mental state of rage, and without a tacked-on happy ending like we saw in Taxi Driver.One Hour Photo is kind of slow in spots, but it's also a very compelling, dark, and harrowing chiller. And Robin Williams's character is more frightening to watch than any violent blood-and-guts slasher flick because we don't know when this lonely, quiet guy is going to snap."},{"rating":"2","title":"PHOTOPSYCHOTIC","review":"\\"One Hour Photo\\" isn't as creepy and sordid as I expected. Robin Williams as a sex criminal didn't sound like my idea of a good time, but the film is really just a good suspense thriller despite it's lurid, pathetic lead character, a photograph developer who psychotically fantasizes about a young family whose pictures he develops. Cinematography is often as vulnerable and crisp as a color photo and the direction is taut, with the exception of the blindfold over the viewer's eyes concerning the outcome of the climactic scene. \\"One Hour Photo\\" is not the nightmare I was expecting but is a very good suspense thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fades into Oblivion","review":"It was as if the writer was halfway through the script, then said, \\"Well I dont know what to do, lets end it real quick, have the bad guy snap, do some stuff, then roll the credits.\\" The first hour spends so much time trying to develop a thick, emotional plot; and it works really well. Then it just . . .ends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you wonder about who is developing your pics","review":"One Hour Photo is an interesting film starring Robin Williams (Good Will Hunting), Michael Vartan (ABC's Alias), and Eriq la Salle (NBC's ER). It features Williams as Sy \\"the photo guy\\" at Sav-Mart and Sy's obsession with the Yorkin family. It's rather creepy to see Robin Williams playing such a creepy character, but surprisingly, he does an excellent job with the wackiness.I thought the coloring of each scene was interesting. The majority of the movie is done is white and \\"cold\\" colors. They definitely invoke a sociopathic feeling. Of course, at the Yorkin house (the one place that Sy really wants to be) there is a warm yellow-ish tone. It definitely sets the mood.The movie is not as suspenseful as it is promoted to be. It's got a good premise, but the writing is lacking. I think that it would've been better with a little more development of certain parts.Luckily, the talented cast makes up for what is lacking, and that's why I give it 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking.","review":"This movie had me absolutely mezmerized from start to finish. The film really gets you thinking about that percentage of people out there who have experianced some serious trauma in there life, and could go off the deep end at any time. It might be your friend, it might be a neighbor and sure, why not the one hour photo guy.Robin Williams shocked me with his superb preformance as a friendly mild mannered man who is harboring something dark and horriable inside. You watch Williams as his sanity gradually goes south and he can't keep his past from influencing his actions. The cinematography in the film is very artfully done, remanicent of Stanely Kubrick's style. One Hour Photo gives Scorsese's Taxi Driver a run for it's money. I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intermittently creepy, but mostly a snoozer","review":"I'm tired of people telling me my standards are too high. But I'm sure I'll get another round of it for poo-pooing this latest attempt by Mr. Robin Williams to act \\"creepy\\". What's with the bleached-blonde hair? Will the real Slim Shady please sit down- and stay down! There was a real interesting premise, the photo developer who is privy to an awful lot of personal information. But the main family portrayed in the movie is a bit thick to not realize that Sy is not playing with a full deck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even consider buying this.","review":"In all honesty, I haven't felt this cheated since I saw that movie ED (Matt LeBlanc and that Monkey) in the sixth grade. This movie was far too predictable and just runs off of a series of awkward moments. Its one of those movies that tries to seem as though it has a deeper meaning, when in reality its just cliche."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining but lacking","review":"I was disappointed in this film as a whole. There were elements of it that impressed me, such as Robin Williams' performance as a psychopath. The cinematography and the lighting were good as well. The events lacked. This film didn't have much purpose. It was only an hour and a half, and it didn't live up to its potential. This could have been a great film if it had given the viewer more to think or talk about. It was just weak. This is not something that most kids would enjoy. They would be bored while waiting for Robin Williams to crack a joke, and its R rating reflects sexual content, including some nudity, and profanity. One Hour Photo was okay. It just was not a thriller that stands out among thrillers. It was weak. For a good psychopath movie, watch The Silence of the Lambs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Film of the Year 2002 - One Hour Photo","review":"One Hour Photo...a masterpiece film.

This movie may not be the best movie to show to younger kids, because they may get afraid of the concpet of someone knowing their whole life and trying to kill people.Robin Williams did a good job, and all the characters in this movie were very well played! There was not much of a plot, but what they did have was pretty well planed.There was no \\"Thrilling\\" special/visual effects and no \\"Stand-Out\\" music, but that's ok because this type of movie does not require eaither.This might be a movie to rent though, as it is one of those that you can see twice and be done with.~Hope this helps"},{"rating":"1","title":"Super Glossy","review":"This movie wasn't all that.

Good spooky dream scene where Robin Williams' face does something very interesting, but the psychological impact of the movie is thin as we really know scant little about the main character, so we have no idea why he's got a wallful of pictures, complete with lights, of a family he is obsessed with. Because he's a lonely picture developing guy? Uh, whatever. Normal lonely people don't do these things-sick, medication starved, chemical deficient folks do. I just don't get the point. Sexy Connie Nielsen doesn't even bother to take her clothes off. Why does the movie exist, then? Shock? Criticism? I'm open to ideas, but as for now, this movie isn't worth buying just to see Robin Williams take a malevolent turn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, but slow","review":"The photography is beautiful.The acting is wonderful.But I think it is a one-hour story told over two hours.

Apart of course from when his obsession takes over."},{"rating":"1","title":"well-made but pointless.","review":"This is an exceptionally well-made film, everything but the screenplay. It's too predictable, we know everything already from the previews and the beginning. And as a story it's just not interesting. We don't really care about anyone in the film, we're just creeped out. And while it seems like this would be a good film to address many issues, it never really does (aside from the facade of happy suburban life, an issue which has made many better movies).Robin Williams plays Sy brilliantly and makes him believable. The climax scene is almost operatic with the music fitting it perfectly. It's too bad these things were wasted in such a bad movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho hum","review":"Just another 'one-man-show'.If you like seeing 100 different close-ups of Robin William's dead-pan mug...then enjoy.

Who is a very lonely, sad guy that doesn't have anything waiting for him in life except pictures and of course this particular family that he stalks. This movie is great... some might like it some might not, but I must say this is one of the best works that he has ever done.

It does make you think about the people developing your pictures and what they are doing with them. Williams plays Sy the photo guy at the local SaveMart. Sy is a bit unusual but you never realize how dangerous, even as the movie progresses. Sy is one third harmless, one third stalker, and one third physco. The movie starts out average and escalates a bit slow but it does move along. But it never seems to peak, it just kind of levels off. And that is unfortunate. There were many avenues that this movie could have walked down but it never did,l it stayed on the main road of an average movie. And I personally was not very fond of the ending but that is an individual choice.If you are a fan of Robin Williams you will probably enjoy this movie a lot.

It was abundantly clear that \\"Sy\\" was Psycho from the beginning, but there was never the ratcheting up of threat that makes the viewer nervous. The film is full of Hollywood inconsistencies -- the family never really catches on to this guy's wierdness, the muscled husband is intimidated by weakling Williams with a knife, the affair is open knowledge at the husband's company. . . . come on.SPOILIER --- the worst part is that the film-makers didn't even have the guts to give the psycho teeth -- he doesn't hurt anybody, and in the end we are left with a psychobable explaination for what messed him up. Boo hoo.Skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting movie, showing a different side of Williams.","review":"Robin Williams is a great actor, but it's not often you see him doing something other than comedy.Williams plays Sy Parrish, the local photo lab guy. To his customers he's happy and jovial, but underneath he is serious need of help.The movie takes you through Sy's mental unraveling and is good pyschological thriller.The ending was a bit strange, and made you sit back and wonder what all happened.But overall it was an enjoyable movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I watched this after reading several reviews, and man was I let down. The film follows every cliche imaginable-- cookie cutter suspense... Robin Williams is nothing more than the stereotypical creepy guy destined to be a psycho.How much more interesting the film would have been if the stalker would have been someone much more \\"normal\\" who is going nuts under the surface... so much more could have been done on that level symbolically, with photos never revealing the true nature of things.Anyway... it was ultimately lousy & predictable. If you want to see Robin Williams in a good creepy role, get Insomnia instead-- a much stronger & well made film all around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Williams gives an oscar worthy performance","review":"\\"One Hour Photo\\" is a very strange kind of film. While casting this film, director Mark Romanek wanted to give the role to Jack Nicholson but he turned it down. With all respect to Jack Nicholson, this was the best news the project could have heard. I say this because Robin Williams is the only actor that could really do a great job playing the character of Sy Parish.\\"One Hour Photo\\" is about photo technician Sy Parish (Williams). Sy is very passionate at his job. He puts his full effort into every photo he develops. He has developed photos for the Yorkin family ever since there son was born. He becomes obsessed with their family and imagines himself as \\"Uncle Sy\\". Once Sy finds out that Mr. Yorkin is into some shady things, he goes to great lengths to make things right.Robin Williams did a wonderful job in this film!!If you are a fan of thriller/suspense films you should enjoy \\"One Hour Photo\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Showed promise, never delivered","review":"An entertaining movie, but never fully reached the protential that it possessed."},{"rating":"1","title":"creepy but....","review":"This movie is probably going to manage to 'tick' enough people off: It is very eerie, and I loved the dark atmosphere. wow what a concept! BUT! you keep waiting and waiting (like a suspense movie, maybe like silence of the lambs) for something dramatic or really sick to happen, because the character robin is playing is so unstable and mentally not there, you wait, and wait....and wait...and....NOTHING!! NOTHING EVER HAPPENS, a movie that manages to grab you from beginning to end, just to deliver NOTHING! without giving away too much, what would have made or breaked this movie would have been that final scene.

As evidenced on Foxlight pictures website's forum many members including myself who have seen the edited screen play Cannes' Film Festival version, it's a completyely different movie. I wonder if the viewing public had a choice, if they would prefer a movie that had the \\"dumbed down for the masses\\" approach by Romanek. First off the screen play version doesn't start off letting you know Sy was apprehended for some crime. It starts with a brooding monologue to capture you in. Romanek did a hack job cutting most of the meaningful William's Dialogues out of the Theatrical and DVD versions.All in all it is still good to see Williams' performance as it is 5 Stars!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Messes with your head","review":"This movie, I guarantee you, will be one of the best psychological thrillers you'll see. It really messes with your mind and makes you think. The movie's creepy because you get so involved into the story and get sucked into the twisted fantasies of the main character. Simply put... any movie that makes you have to see it a couple of times is a good movie. Though I don't see why it was rated R. A strong PG-13 maybe.Sy Parrish is well developed, and even though he's a psycho you can't help but feel sorry for him. He's comical...yet insane...yet depressing. He keeps things interesting and is played very well by Robin Williams.This movie shows us that Robin Williams is an excellent actor and that he can do more than just Mickey Mouse movies. Because of my strange sense of humor I thought the movie was funny at times, but I would still suggest watching a happy movie after viewing this. It WILL freak you out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy and Moving","review":"I was very surpised by this film. Actually, I had heard various things - pro and con- and was somewhat led astray by the trailers. This is a thriller and a very creepy one at that, but it never devolves into a violent gore-fest or a typical action thriller - that is a good thing. Instead Robin Williams (in an amazing performance) leads us through the creepy and moving downfall of a lonely and disturbed man. It is very effectively directed and scored. This is the kind of film that will send the shivers down your spine while also filling you up with a good dose of empathy. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Hour Fright","review":"One Hour Photo shot me as a surprise. I was not thinking at all that it would get to me the way that it did. I am rarely scared by any films that come out, but this one truly did. The anticipation of what happens to Will is so great that I has so impatient to know what really happened to adulterer father. Robin Williams does a very creepy acting job as the frightening Cy which should earn him an actin award of some sort. This is truly his second best acting job after Good Will Hunting. This is one of the most suprising movies that I have seen all year. You wil never expect so much evil from an every day Joe like Cy.

Police procedure was made up out of thin air to suit the next plot twist. The acting was dreadful.

He fantasizes himself to be a part of their family and more. He has a wall full of their pictures - an unhealthy obsession even were he one of them.When he discovers that the man of the family cheats on his wife, the clerk goes berserk.The acting and script are unrealistic and phony. Why would the kid, who hardly ever talks to the clerk, be sad imagining the clerk friendless? Or why would the woman that the clerk has a particular obsession with, think of him as \\"not deep?\\" The characters are very poorly developed and their inter-relationships are left as a matter of conjectures to be inferred based on some stereotypes - not a good thing in a movie trying to scare you with some freakish story.I found my mind wandering as I watched this movie. I'd advice you to stay away too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely boring!","review":"This was not a thriller, nor was it creepy at all. The actual \\"creep\\" in the movie was the husband.

Yes, everyone is out to get us.. or at least that's what Hollywood would have us believe.I am getting sick of films like this that constantly contort normal healthy human interaction and community relations into perverse horrors that are far from reality. No wonder we live in a culture of such exagerrated suspicion, mistrust, fear (and the resulting isolation) when we have films like this constantly stoking these fears of people around us.Yes, films like these have their place.

The author has kept up AB series' tradition of thoroughness in dealing with the biblical text. On the top of a detailed commentary the author has offered some useful appendices: \\"von Bulmerincq's Categories for dating Malachi\\", \\"Typological Analysis of the Postexilic Prophets\\"; \\"Intertextuality in the Book of Malachi\\", \\"Vocabulary Richness in the Book of Malachi.\\" An extensive bibliography (36 pages!) is certainly a boon to students of the book of Malachi.

We looked at cages in some pet stores that cost almost 1k and they weren't much better than this.Not sure about shipping issues, as we bought ours as a \\"floor model\\" in a store. However, we threw that cage in the back of our truck bed. My husband tossed it in pretty hard and pieces started flying around. I was sure it would break, but it didn't break.

This is very intimate yet comfortable playing in that music and pianist are one. One can't argue as they do with Bach that it is being played too fast or too slow it is simply an entity unto its self marching into the museum along with the Dali, the Miro, the Picasso, the Bellini, the Mona Lisa, the Klee and perhaps a dinosaur or two.

It is not a perfect movie - I thought the sound quality on the DVD was a little muted, the dialogue sometimes juvenile & the actress who plays Kracklight's wife annoying at the very least. With that said, I recommend the movie as of feast for the eyes & ears (Mertens score is perfect!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"mutton dressed as lamb","review":"It occurred to me this film would fall flat on its face without the stunning shots of italian architecture and when i realised the ruse, it did of its own accord. Before that i had found the movie skimpy and whilst holding out for the film to maybe get going- I was kept on hold with shots of lovely old italian architecture.The stream of architectural photography throughout the film seems oddly like a deliberate distraction that dwarfs the story. In fact this is its pretentiousness taking centre stage.The architect is being poisoned we know that- but does the rest of the cast or screen-play? Poison is an intriguing theme always but meanwhile the drama potters about. The staging is magnificent but the actors vapid and tepid.God what a crashing bore."},{"rating":"2","title":"A terrific, incredible feast!","review":"Greenaway's film is a feast for the eyes, and Brian Dennehy's portrayal of Stourley Kracklite, an American architect struggling in Rome, is the best of his career. Chloe Webb, most notable for playing Nancy in Sid and Nancy, is great as Louisa, his adulterous wife. However, the best part of the film is Rome itself -- Greenaway portrays the city in postcard settings, with typical static shots of mesmerizing brilliance. The buildings, such as the Victor Emmanuelle Building (The Wedding Cake), jump off the screen, begging you to visit. The music, by genius Wim Mertens replacing Greenaway-staple Michael Nyman, is haunting yet drills into your subconcious. Quite simply, everything about this film is brilliant, even the subtle irony at the end! My only complaint: it isn't available (yet!) on DVD!addendum, 1/3/05: They finally did release this on DVD, and it is even more brilliant; the colors of Rome come alive quite nicely on the digital format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give Us a Break","review":"Stourley Kracklite?

Such was the case with Dave Van Ronk's contribution to the great 1964 Elektra compendium of folk and blues, The Blues Project. Mr. Van Ronk performed \\"Bad Dream Blues,\\" and my life was altered forever. This song is the yardstick of excellence by which I measure so much other American music from Dylan to Chapin to Springsteen.Had he been with a powerhouse label like Columbia, Mr. Van Ronk would have become a household name.This book focuses on the source of the genius. The particular blend of time, location, and current events combined to produce a fertile opportunity for singer-songwriters.

The majority of the book is about the most profound aspects of life, the deep, palpable sense of passion, or the views of life after death, or the fear of mortal men.

Sure he'll give you a good look at the many men full of character who have risked life and limb for a chance the climb the high one (as they call Denali). Also some of the stories take place when Jon was younger and you can see how he has matured. He doesn't make any attempt to hide the brashness of his youth.

His playing is consistently \\"inside-the-box\\", reflecting little technical virtuosity or any real musical depth. I do not believe this is an example of a master musician and star trumpet player. Enjoy this album for what it is, but do not try to make more of it--there are better ones out there--just look a little deeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's with the cover?","review":"I was browsing the new releases and saw an extremely odd cover to Chris Botti's new CD and I have to ask, what the *&%k??? I am more intrigued by the cover than by the music. It should really be hung and studied at the Metropolitan Musuem of Art. Is it homoerotic? Is she a vampire? Or is he blowing \\"Blow it out your Ass\\"? Curious to find out...who is his agent?"},{"rating":"2","title":"My, my, my.","review":"Mr. Botti has over the years continously up graded his sound. Less and less of the drab \\"Smooth Jazz\\" non-sense, to more of a definitive definition of what is Jazz, and what is \\"Junk\\". This Jazz CD, is likely his best work thus far in his musical career.Mr. Botti has gone back and taken some Jazz standards, and introduced these standards to hopefully today's Jazz fans. I do hope this Jazz effort by Mr. Botti is given a fair hearing, by all Jazz fans, and not dismissed as \\"Old Style\\".Real musical instruments accompany Mr. Botti here and less of the special effects. Even the vocal arrangement, is a joy to a Jazz lovers ears. Ms. Paula Cole puts out a very, very good performance on \\"How Love Should Be\\", wonderful is a tag I would put on this CD, oh and do not forget Mr. Botti's rendition of \\"When I Fall In Love\\".All in all a well rounded CD, a Jazz lover's delight.Mr. Botti, keep up the good work."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"Really enjoy Chris Botti's music.

The big shocker here...who knew Paula Cole could unleash a reading like the one she does here of What'll I Do?

I went to Amazon to purchase the DVD and started listening to samples of his other albums. \\"When I Fall in Love\\" was and still is the best one yet. I went ahead and ordered it. And to make the entire experience even better, it took less than 3 days for my order to arrive in better than \\"like new\\" condition. The CD is great. The ordering process is great.

Listening to it on the way home was the last time I took a listen. Needless to say, I was disappointed. Putting his spin on other songs was not the best career move in my opinion but judging from other reviews, it appears that I am in the minority thus my reason for writing this review. I have all of Botti's material sans his Xmas CD and his mix of funky pop trumpet and his muted horn sound a la Miles Davis is his trademark. Since I have jumped back and forth between smooth jazz's forerunner, fusion, smooth jazz and tradition hardcore jazz since age 17 (I am 41 now), listening to this was BORING. I hope that next time Botti comes out with something more original and a better mix of uptempo and love songs. In reading another comment on this CD, they (forgot the name) were right in that the better Botti was his previous 2 albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't go there Chris","review":"Chris botti simply doesn't have the chops to be making albums like this. \\"A thousand kisses deep\\" and \\"Night Sessions\\" are very strong records and they play to Botti's strengths. \\"When I fall in love\\" is a bore and Botti sounds like a fish out of water - floppy around embarrasingly. Someone please tell him to stick with a 5/6 piece band...For some real trumpet - try Art Blakey's \\"A night at Birdland\\" Vol. 1 featuring the amazing Clifford Brown. After that - this recording may sound like fingers on a chalk board..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have known better...","review":"I love, and know great jazz, but this over lushly orchestrated effort is just his marketing people trying to turn Chris Botti into the next good looking Diana Krall or Harry Connick Jr., and capitalize on the Rod Stewart standards trend. The trouble is, where Krall and Connick both have a fair amount of underlying substance, Botti's substance is just not there, at least not yet. He's a good trumpet player, but this is schmaltzy, syrupy, BORING stuff!

It was good then. So I bought this album and when I heard the first track and from then on, it was like this guy has a way with the trumpet. When I listen to other trumpet players, it gets me thinking, \\"Yea, they play well. They play good.\\" But with Chris Botti, there's just one thing I will say about his playing. It's almost like he is caressing the trumpet. The trumpet is no longer an instrument, it became a part of his being. Listen to this album when you've got a fireplace going, with a nice rug, on a winter's evening and just while your thoughts away."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Point Is......","review":"One reviewer who alleged himself also a trumpet player in his article refer to Botti's music as \\"consistently \\"inside-the-box\\", reflecting little technical virtuosity or any real musical depth.\\", I think he might miss the scenario of Botti's music.What's so fascinating about Chris Botti? His performing technique may not be so satisfying to some critics and counterparts, his taste to music as well ability to give old tunes a fresh soul with his handsome and sexy look coupling with boyish charm (It's hard to believe he is already 42) , however, is noteworthy. And the combination of these makes him a distinguishing and outstanding musician, and his music more than just jazzy-pop.Other trumpet players may get better techniques, but listening to Chris Botti's music simply gives me comfort and visions:How many elegantly good-looking and friendly trumpet player out there you can find to play music like this?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"In his later years, having long eschewed his cool-jazz past, Miles Davis was asked why he never played ballads anymore. He was reported to have answered that if he did, he was afraid he'd never stop. Miles' ballad style--a style and sound that made him famous--surprisingly had few disciples among his successors. Good for us, then, that Chris Botti finally and ably ressurects the Davis sound with this fine, mood-rich album. While one can argue with the occasional indulgence of the string accompaniment, Botti beautifully weds the phrasing of Kind of Blue with the lushness and romanticism of Clifford Brown with Strings. The album is top heavy with ballads, which is a good thing; Botti's up-tempo work needs a firm nudge toward the straight ahead. But all in all, this is a very listenable and compelling album. The title song is signature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"I think that Chris has pulled off another great album. His sound is so clear and has good tone. Being a trumpet player myself, i think it is an overall well done job. Sometimes when the day has been rough, i just pop in this or night sessions and just relax."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Going Smooth Jazz","review":"Maybe one of the few horn players who knows the craft. The title track may be one of the best numbers he has performed. This album is so laid back and consistent. What'll I Do fits in so nicely. Chris Botti knows the value of moving subtly in and out of a group of talented musicians never hogging the spotlight but being very present when either supporting the feature instrument allowing the song to become the focus. No Ordinary Love is an example of this where the Bass and Piano move effortlessly in and out of the forefront. Worth the investment. Pretty much every track has its place on the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful CD","review":"Chris Botti on trumpet with Paula Cole on vocals; it doesn't get any better than this.

Her world suddenly is filled with the horrors of war, ethnic and racial prejudices, and the fears and uncertainties of wartime. She learns that people and things aren't always what they seem to be. It is a time for wars to be fought and heroes to come forward.Patsy lives in a rural Pennsylvania town. Her father is Pine Glen's postmaster, her mother is a homemaker, and her 17-year old brother has major league baseball potential, before the War puts an end to that. The story weaves the coming of age of Patsy with the beginning and progression of the War. Heroes are not only found on the warfront, but also in everyday life. And Patsy is a hero.Kathleen O'Toole crafts a powerful tale that the reader will find difficult to put down.

You can either leave the rear door open or just the glass window. There is a small opening below the bumper where insects can come in. Just improvise by covering it with a big towel or trash bag. The base of the tent is a little bit thin and you can feel the small rocks on the ground. Get at least 2 tarps (10x10) to cover the bottom ground and inside base of the tent. The tent is big enough to hold 2 queen air beds and good for 5 persons (attached to suv or detached).

Nice sized tent. The poles are a little unmanageable for just one person, it can be done, just with a little difficulty. Check your vehicle with this tent to ensure it will work properly. I have a Durango and the SUV sleeve is almost too low and tight for the open gate of a Durango.

It was a little too big for the Jeep but worked well anyway. Make sure that you seal the tent and you should not have any problems with leaks. This tent is extremely easy to set up, it took me only 5 minutes to erect the entire tent on my lanai. The only problem we had with this tent was that when we took it down a piece of the main pole broke off and we did not realize this until we were going to set up the tent at the campground.

Also, the stitching around the windows and front door is pretty lousy.Second time out, one of the poles split and the metal ferrule split under the weight of the tent and this with 2 people setting it up.

My biggest problem was the poor quality of the stakes that thread through the loops and hold up the tent. In two nights I had two breaks at the top of the tent, which caused it to collapse each time. Unless you travel with a small saw to cut off the ragged edge so you can re-insert the segment into the next, this cannot be fixed.

The images where blurred so badly we had no idea what piece was what. If it wasn't for a nearby camper we would have thrown the tent back in the box.

Only as person as interesting as TR could be the subject of a 780 page book, that ends right before he becomes President of the United States. the fact of the matter is that TR is so interesting that the pages fly by. TR is a person of such diverse interests that the reader is taken on an adventure of such excitement that it seems to be a fictional hero. But TRT of course is very real.This book sets the standard for biographys. Edmound Morris is the offer of a true masterpiece.

Then I would get more interested in his early political activities and about 1/3 of the way through the book I realized, it's the author dummy! Edmund Morris does an excellent job of telling Roosevelt's story in such a way that one minute I totally despised what he stood for and what he felt and then I would cheer as he takes on the New York status quo. I finished with a better understanding of and a little grudging respect for T.R. I even downloaded a few of his writings to my Kindle. Some of them are available for free. I am anxious to continue with Theodore Rex."},{"rating":"2","title":"Colossally cool!!!","review":"Although I normally confine myself to much lighter reading, this book caught my attention and held my interest throughout. I especially liked the tales of young Roosevelt and his dramatic impact on the New York legislature. The book was highly informative, a page turner. The story of Roosevelt's escapades with General Wheeler in Cuba was a coincidence for me in that I recently read two other generations of Wheelers in other books, and I also recently visited Alabama on business where stands a memorial to Gen'l Wheeler. Any way Roosevelt is great!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"superb","review":"i now know why critics' expectations of Dutch were so high--this book paints a very clear stunning and clear portrait of TR's life. maybe dutch just didn't have enough material to work with."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read about a remarkable man","review":"All three of Morris' books on Roosevelt were excellent reads. An exhaustive record of one of the most remarkable men in our nation's history. This is not light reading; it's clearly more of a scholarly work and quite thorough and well referenced. However, the author paints a clear picture of a man our country was fortunate to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Manly Virtue at Its Best","review":"Before Reading this I had little knowledge of Teddy Roosevelt other than the scant amounts I learned in grade school. This is truly an interesting and well-written history of one of America's greatest personalities. From his asthmatic childhood days of reading and taxidermy to the day he became president, Roosevelt's life was a fascinating epic, and Edmund Morris has told the story well. I also recently read \\"Dutch,\\" another fascinating biography by Morris, but enjoyed \\"The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt\\" more.

I ended reading this looking forward to the next two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"One of the best biographies that I have ever read.

It was in good condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring book, but once in a while a little interesting","review":"Edmund Morrus tries to make The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt a great book, as he provides just about a whole written out recap of Theodore's (Teedie's) life. Theodore Roosevelt won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1906, and there is only one sentence reguarding this fact, which kind of dissapoints me, as I was counting on reading a lot about him signing the many peace treaties. I gave this two stars, and choosing from Excellent, Good, Mediocre, Bad, Horrible; my answer would be in the middle of bad and mediocre."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just couldn't get into In Trance","review":"I'm a HUGE fan of the Scorpions with Matthais Jabbs. I worked my way backward in the band's catalog starting with Love At First Sting. Blackout and Lovedrive are great albums, and I love World Wide Live. I couldn't get into In Trance, and I really tried to. It's lacking the energy and shredder guitar solos and melodies of the late 70s and 80s material."},{"rating":"2","title":"First MasterPiece","review":"This fantastic album, released in 1975, was the Scorpions' 3rd album and definately one of the best they've come up with. With outstanding solos done by the great Ulrich Roth, brilliant and original rhythms and perhaps the best percussion ever on a Scorpions album, too bad that Rudy Lenners (drummer at the time) developed heart problems; and ,of course, Klaus sounds fantastic. Of the tracklist the songs that shine the most are the title track ballad, Top of the Bill (song about selling out), Dark Lady (sang by Ulrich),Robot Man (amazing rhytms in this one) and my personal favorite \\"Longing For Fire\\" (bass driven song).If you like TRUE Scorpions this a MUST, I wonder if this lineup would have stayed through the 80's ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uli Jon Roth - Guitar God!","review":"Although \\"Living and Dying\\" and \\"Robot Man\\" are absolutely horrible, In Trance is a must have for guitar players who appreciate solos. Uli Roth was probably one of the coolest guitarists who came out of the '70s. He's like, 50% Hendrix-ish and 50% neo-classical. (I prefer his neo-classical style). After listening to the title track, you'll agree that Uli is the father of neo-classical guitar and NOT Ritchie Blackmore! Uli's playing just \\"screams\\" emotion. Heck, just buy it for the instrumental, \\"Night Lights\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep looking!

The top band is too tight around the top of your calf, and the whole area of your foot, including the ankle, is way too loose. No pressure in the ankle area, which is kind of important in these kinds of socks. None of those problems with the Futuro's, which I wear with khaki's to work every day now.I've purchased 5 pair of theFuturo Dress Socks for Men, Brown, Large. My shoe size is 11.5 medium to wide depending on the shoe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is ok on pressure, but rolls down your leg too often","review":"The pressure seems to be fine from these particular compression socks, however, during the day, it has a tendency to roll down your leg causing uncomfortable pressure points mid to high calf. I only have problems with one leg, so I only need to wear these one at a time, which I don't think makes a difference in how the top rolls down.Otherwise, they seem very sturdy and have a decent amount of foot room. I have a large foot (15) and wide too (2E) and it fits in the foot and the ankle quite well. It's just during the day that these really don't live up to my standards, they don't last all day long without adjusting them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrific!","review":"The \\"music\\" on this album is awful.

I read the Rihannsu series because I thought it would be a fun exploration of Romulan culture and history. However, I barely recognized the Romulans in Rihannsu. The book degrades them and seems to radically alter their characters. The main character, Ael, seems too perfect, while the rest of the Romulans seem like a bunch of buffoons. Furthermore, the book radically changes Romulan history that just doesn't seem realistic. It's too bad - the Romulans as presented in the Original Series were fascinating characters who had both honor and deviousness. The Romulans in Rihannsu have little of either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Star Trek","review":"I really hate it when authors make substantial changes to the Star Trek universe and call it Star Trek. The timeline in this book doesn't match the established timeline from the series and movies, too much emphasis is placed on new and unlikely characters, way too much of the story takes place in the recreation room (so as to give time to a new character), and too much emphasis is placed on using Romulan - excuse me, Rihannsu - terms to the point that our historical heroes don't even call the home planet Romulus (yet they start doing it again in the Next Generation?). Also, the story moves so slowly that you need the 4-book anthology for anything to ever really happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"DARN THING WON'T WORK","review":"I bought this at a thrift store today.Seeing how it's like $60 on this site,I was thrilled to buy it for only $2.96.When I got homeI looked up instructions,and found, \\"Just plug into your tv and play!\\" I did.Wouldn't work.Showed the \\"No Signal\\" screen.I tried 5 times.I put in new batteries.STILL wouldn't work.So I don't know how to rate it....."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first one was too big; the second one was too small...","review":"But this one is just right! This is the perfect book to use as a companion to your VK - *not* as a substitute or as a teaching manual. VKQR is not a beginner book; it's more of a refresher for those who already have a thorough reference (i.e. VK). You need a left slanting double decrease but don't know which one to use? Can't quite remember how to do the kitchener stitch? Can't remember how to do SSK? This book shows them to you without all the bulk of the original. It does not have everything (that would defeat the point), but it has the essentials in a user friendly format. This is the book I take on trips and often use at home when I don't want to lug out my VK. It lives in or near my knitting bag. It's thin and lightweight and I LOVE the spiral binding. The flap cover helps keep it closed when it's not needed, though being a paperback I do still have to be careful when its in the bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"good LITTLE refernce book","review":"It is what it claims, a good little quick reference book to fit in your knitting bag. However, if you need more, the exact same content down to the grafics, photos and text can be found in the older version of \\"Vogue Knitting the ultimate kitting book\\" isbn 0-394-57186-X (blue hardcover) which has a lot more information and it is easier to read, because the pictures and text are larger. It is also priced well and available used.I wish I would have found that one first and I could have saved the money for the little book, since I do not really need a little book to fit in my knitting bag and have trouble reading the small print. The big book also has a few patterns in the back and a lot more helpful information like knitting on the round and designing a pattern."},{"rating":"2","title":"Portable is right","review":"I bought this book to be a major reference book for my knitting library. The book's advantages are the sprial-binding, which allows it to stay open and easily accessed even while your hands are full with your knitting, and the book is thin and light, which is perfect for adding it to your knitting bag. A con is a lot of the more advanced techniques are taken out (compared to the complete Vogue Knitting Reference book). Since I plan on using this book mostly at home, I'm now kicking myself for not buying the more complete knitting reference book. I would suggest buying the other one if you plan on keeping this book at home and not carry it around in your knitting bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant artists","review":"I just find it amazing how talented these guys are. This mostly spanish album is an answer to their loyal fans all over. During recent summer concerts in Riverside and Pico Rivera, California, they had the entire place dancing whenever a cumbia or nortena was played.

I think this album answers the same need. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Ankle Brace","review":"The Malleo-Loc has worked very well for my unstable ankle.

Chastain has proven over the past 15+ years that he is one of the greatest guitar players of all time. His sound is truely distinctive and very original. On this cd, not only do we get the strong vocals of Russel Jinkens but, we also get the vocals of bassist Mike Skimmerhorn as lead singer on several songs. If your a fan of any of Chastain's project (Chastain -w/Leather Leone on vocals, David T.Chastain -instrumental or CJSS)or if you're just a fan of metal I highly recommend this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"1.5 Stars","review":"If ever a band found itself trudging through the dense morass of intellectually stunted 80s metal, David Chastain must have founded that band.

I read somewhere online that David Chastain was on the same level as Joe Satriani and Steve Vai, trust me, HE'S NOT! There is nothing on this cd that can even come remotely close to Satch or Vai.

He recalled back in the War when he was wounded, and it brought up huge emotions... And that'll go on and on before Sera says,\\"Hello, Tom.\\" (or whatever his name was.) Then SHE has to internally analyze: She could tell he'd been sweating, and smelled like fireplace smoke but not of the hardwood that he used in his estate--no, she could tell it was a hardwood only found on the coast near Brighton, which of course meant he had a mistress...And on and on.

I spent probably a good couple hundred hours staring in agony at this book for my Waves & Optics course, hoping that it could fill in the gaps where my even less competent professor had said little. Unlike every textbook that I've used previously in my career as a student since elementary school, you *cannot* learn the concepts from this book if you just bring a certain amount of intelligence and enough time to it. There's simply not enough explanation in this book to do it. I spent hours on the problems and yet learned nothing from them, because they were a test of my mathematical derivation skills and not of any concepts explained and taught in the book. If you already are familiar with the subject matter of this book, it may appear to be adequate, but it's terribly insufficient, making huge leaps and jumps and omissions that leave the reader seeking alternate sources of explanation.

I occasionally dye my hair and it cannot take much stress at all. This shampoo did give decent volume, however it has sulfates in it, which apparently causes issues and damage to my hair. This shampoo made my hair frizzy and increased my fly-aways. Whenever I would use it, I could never give the fly-aways to tame down, even after using Redken Anti-Snap leave-in treatment. I think it would be fine if you have naturally thicker hair with a stronger hair follicle, but my hair just can't take it. I would recommend that if you have fine hair with a tendency toward breakage, try the Abba or Kenra product lines. For flyaways, I would recommend Redken Extreme Anti-Snap. They do not have sulfates, which can lead to breakage and are in most shampoos on the market today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I love many products of this line, but have not cared for the shampoo. It leaves my hair feeling dry and dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was actually in the bottle?","review":"Purchased this from Amazon. I love the Big Sexy Hair products that I purchase from salons, but whatever was in this bottle, it wasn't Big Sexy Hair shampoo! I used it for four months while thinking something wasn't right with this product, but wanting to get my money's worth and reasoning that my hair could just be changing texture. I have moderately thick hair that normally keeps curl and body for two days after showering, but my hair was so limp, lifeless, and sticky-feeling after shampooing with this! It would go limp immediately after styling and felt dirty constantly; it felt and looked like I needed to wash it just a few hours after showering. Last week I finally purchased this product from my usual salon, and VOILA, my hair is back to being full, feeling clean, and having body! Good to know it's not just my hair. And ick, never purchasing a beauty product from Amazon again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY","review":"I have been using Big Sexy Hair products for 4+ years. This is NOT Big Sexy Hair Shampoo! Big Sexy hair shampoo is not clear, it is a pink pearly color, and it is not scented like this. I use this shampoo because it is the only kind that does not make my hair greasy. After going through KMS, Biolage, Redken, Paul Mitchell, Bumble Bumble and just about every other quality shampoo out there, I know what works and does not work with my hair type. THIS DOES WORK BECAUSE IT IS NOT REALLY BIG SEXY HAIR SHAMPOO. I know what Big Sexy Hair Shampoo, Conditioner, and every other BSH product looks and works like. I am simply disgusted to receive different cheap shampoo in a Big Sexy Hair bottle. If I could put 0 stars I would. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extra flat shampoo","review":"Do not buy this if you want volume. I chose this over the regular Big Volume shampoo thinking it might be a little better. This shampoo left my hair very soft, but very flat. It is also harder to brush your hair out after using this. The product is also clear and smells a lot different which didn't matter to me as long as the results were good, but they weren't so I'm returning the extra bottle that I bought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Big Sexy Hair!","review":"I almost always read the Amazon reviews but for this product I did not. I have been using it for several years and knew I liked it. So when I saw the great price on the big bottle I ordered it.I was surprised when I got it to see it was crystal clear (Big Sexy Hair Shampoo is creamy) and had a fragrance to it. In addition, the label had some of the lettering coming off. I got online, read the other reviews and printed out my return label. This is not the genuine product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid NewVoBeauty","review":"My order was fulfilled by NewVoBeauty. Do not order from them.

The Hawaiian scenery and surfing scenes are the best, especially if you are from up north like me, it makes you want to go to the beach, or learn how to surf. Kate Bosworth and Michelle Rodriguez are really good in it. It's a fun movie with a great story, love the ending. Plus the guy in it is really cute!! The only downfall is that you can tell there is a lot of pro surfers in it, because they can't really act that well. But all their surfing scenes make up for it! I would recommend at least renting this feel good, fun movie for anyone, especially with summer coming up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WICKED!","review":"I just watched this movie a few hours ago & I gotta say, it was better than I had expected!

Anyway i love Blue Crush. I watch it all the time. The plot is awesome! This summer i am going to learn how to surf because the movie made it look like so much fun! I also am in love with the Eden boards and some of there clothing that isn't just in ordinary surf shops. This is one of my favorite movies, but i have seen some of your others and i like those too. Keep up the good work... i can't wait to see your next movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Point break was never this sexy.","review":"What I expected to be a cheesy movie about chicks wanting to be with surfer boys, turned out to be a fantastically done movie about a girl who wants to be a surfing champion. Kate Bosworth plays AnneMarie, A super hot surfer chick in Hawaii who has been invited to compete in the Pipe Masters, the hardest competition around. She also has to take on the responibility of raising her kid sister who is anything but easy to get along with. Along the way to stardom, she meets football hunk, Matt (Matthew Davis) who wants srufing lessons and more. She lets the budding relationship get in the way of her training for the most important day of her life, mush to the chagrin of Eden. Eden (Michelle Rodriguez) is her best friend and the one person who can push her over the edge. AnneMarie must decide what is more important, something she has worked her whole life for or the man she has just started dreaming of. A fantastic film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here's what to tell your girlfriend","review":"The metaphors in the movie are actually reversed, creating a multi-leveled exposition of a strong young female in a competitive microcosm. The monolithic waves she's pushing to conquer for corporate sponsorship represent her conflicts within a male-dominated society that she wants not only to be a part of, but to master. The affair with the pro-baller represents her obsession with ego, career, and her problems managing both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best surfing movie ever","review":"Blue Crush is the best surfing movie ever and that ever will be. It combines a good storyline with unbelievable surfing action. Kate Bosworth shows that she is a rising star that your going to see more of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue Crush is not all wipeout....","review":"\\"Blue Crush\\" was not thee best movie depicting surfing but it was nice to see a film that shows life in Hawaii. Aside the awesome cinematography though im nooo expert surfer myself, the editing people did a good job. \\"Blue Crush\\" gets bonus points for positive potrayal of Hawaiian People and a few actual celebrities I recognized. I myself a local boy from hawaii was glad to see that on screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great father / daughter flick!","review":"This rocks. I saw it first while in a S. CA surf shop (Hobie) where a bunch of teenage girls were watching it. I bought it for my 7 yr old surfer gal daughter. OK my 9yr old son likes it too. I love the positive and strong young female roles. Too many movies (all?) have young girls as secondary figures that are not strong or able to operate on their own - NOT this one!. My daugher and I enjoy watching it for the cool waves, the \\"easy\\" story and the true fun! Even though she is 7 she totally relates to the decisions the good girls and not so good girls are faced with and it is a great chance to cuddle, have fun and even open the topic of how to make the right choices while being a strong free minded young lady with looks, brains, determination, power and options!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue Crush","review":"Wow, I just watched this movie yesterday and it was AWESOME. It's not your average chick flick, this movie pulls you in and as it progresses, you fall even more in love with it. The surfing scenes are great and the beaches of Hawaii are beautiful. The girls in the movie are gorgeous and talk about Matt (played by Matthew Davis) what a HOTTIE! THe movie shows real trials people go through everyday, love, friendship, siblings etc. Everyone can relate. Just a wonderful movie that everyone should watch. Absolutely the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to watch.","review":"I don't know anything about surfing but I enjoyed this movie anyway. The main characters are young, female surfers. I highly recommend this movie to young women. Kate Bosworth was superb in the leading role. The drama was a little light but then again, this movie is not really about that. I laughed my a$$ off at the \\"surfing lesson\\" scene. I watched it on DVD. I wished I had seen it in theatre during the summer. This would have been a perfect summer date movie. I highly recommend this to movie to teenage girls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surfs up for this summer's big winner","review":"when I saw a preveiw for this amazing movie this summer, origiganly it did not look too apealing. I saw it anyways and i LOVED it. Even though i am not a great surfer it is still one of the best movies i have ever seen. I definatly recomend to people of all ages. thumbs up for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks!","review":"This movie is, too put it nicely, terrible! I had watched some previews and it looked really good, of course previews can make any movie look good, even this one. The whole story is basically about a girl who adores surfing, works as a maid, and is pretty much broke after she gets fired for complaining about the condition of a room that she was ordered to clean. In need of money, she gives surfing lessons to a random football player, and of course she totally falls in \\"love\\" with him. But she has a surfing competition coming up and needs to practice, or she'll lose. In addition to needing practice, she's afraid because of an accident she had three years ago while surfing. Then comes the completion, which is painful to look at. I won't go into details, but it's a classic fairy tale ending and everything is perfect. So, if you enjoy that sort of thing, go right ahead and enjoy, but me, let's just say I was strongly disappointed. Shame, shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"blue crush","review":"just finished blue crush part 2 and wanted to see part one of this surfing movie. excellent to watch with great scenes, and again at a great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue Crush- A great chick flick","review":"I must say that this was an awesome film. My friend Mathew, a 14 year-old kid, loved it from DK. I loved Blue Crush, and it was great. My God, Kate Bosworth is gorgeous and so is Michelle Rodriguez. The great surfing scenes truly helped out the movie, and I must say John Stockwell does a great job of directing this film featuring spectacular surfing stunts. The film is beautiful, and just simply amazing. Blue Crush, was the best!I love Kate Bosworth, and I love the movie. She is so pretty! I would definetly see Blue Crush, in theatres August 16th! My friend Mathew loved this movie, he would recommend this movie as well. I must say you should see this film! Blue Crush is rated PG-13 for Sexual Content, Teen Partying, Language and A Fight.

Yes, they were lightweight and comfortable, and the cork did breathe really well. For short stretches around the house, they were very comfortable. I discovered on a recent 4 day trip to the Outer Banks, however, that when I wore them for several hours a day or several days in a row, my feet became so sore that I resorted to walking around barefoot unless I absolutely had to have shoes on to enter a business or walk on the asphalt.

Also, she indicates key pieces a woman should have in her warddrobe to look stylish and elegant at all times with relative ease. Oh how I wish I had bought this book 5 years ago. Then I would not have wasted my money on all those cheapies, purchases from clearance sales and of-the-moment purchases which I never wore for long or did not work with anything I owned already.

I think that this book is a great one to have in my library for a reference and reminder for my wardrobe. I'd give it 5 stars, but there's a section where the author suggests that when a woman can afford it, she should upgrade her engagement diamond. I know women still do this today, but I think an elegant woman holds on to the diamond her husband first gave her.Yes - this book was written during a different time of fashion and when women held a different place in the world, yet the overall concepts are still true. If you get hung up on the references to the 60's then this won't work for you, but if you can look past that, you'll see that it still applies today. I recommend it to anyone interested in fashion and elegance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time Warp","review":"I purchased this book because occasionally I am required to present myself in an elegant manner. This book was not helpful. Instead of timeless style, the style this book promotes is arcane.

Genevieve Antoine Dariaux's mentions such elegant icons as Jacqueline Kennedy and Audrey Hepburn, and then admonishes us to never wear costume jewelry, which both these ladies wore with great aplomb and absolute elegance. The best I can say for this book is that if you follow Ms. Dariaux's advice, you will probably be elegant.

I have a very small, selective wardrobe, tend to dress simply, wear neutrals, good materials, and what fine jewelry I own, and believe that it's necessary to dress appropriately to an occasion. However, this is advice that you'll find in virtually EVERY style book in existence (except perhaps the Lucky Style Manual, which I'd steer clear of.)That being said, any of the actual practical advice offered in this book is dated at best and offensive at worst.

I would have loved to read this book when I was 15.. but it is just as applicable no matter the age .. a nice present for someone who needs an excuse to redo her wardrobe.since reading I have emptied the closet a bit more .. donated various piles of clothing I truly never wear .. ( and maybe some I never did wear... who knows maybe it will encourage you to shop less impulsively. After all how many black dresses do we really need !!!! last I counted I had about 30 !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good tips if you can afford to take them.","review":"The author is extremely knowledgeable and has a grasp on elegance that is almost extinct nowadays. She actually knows chic. It is near impossible to follow her advice though. The book is really not adapted for modern women, let alone women with a limited budget.She lists items in the perfect wardrobe, and they seem pretty easy to attain. But then, for every occasion she describes throughout the book, she mentions another must-have. Usually what she describes are either impossible to find at one's convenient mall, or extremely expensive.She is very old-fashioned. I think if I followed all her advice I would resemble a snooty 60-year-old from France. I guess that's who she is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing we don't already know !","review":"Treat it as fun because it doesn't tell you anything that you don't already know about common sense and the sense of proportion.

The stories also provide other kinds of insights: e.g., the idea of predestined salvation or damnation was \\"in the air\\" intellectually before John Calvin's \\"Institutes.\\" So it was formulated most effectively, but not originated, by Calvin. This fits a pattern of Western history: attributing developments to individuals, sort of a Most Valuable Player, individualistic version of history. For example, Gutenberg is said to have single-handedly \\"invented\\" moveable type, and Darwin to have discovered evolution, when these developments were hardly unique to them. As for Marguerite - or the storytellers for whom she is given credit of authorship - the stories are mainly fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great album, but why is the re-mastering so poor?","review":"Nothing to add on the quality of the songs, they are great, 5-Star.

After she gets her neighbor involved, James Legros, they embark on series of strange, and mysterious events.

Under The Frog effectively shows how laughter can rise out of tradegy, and tradegy out of absurbity. Under the frog for me remains one the bitterst denouciations of a totalitarian regime and the evils that it can generate. All that the hero wishes for is freedom.

The readers of audio books make all the difference in the world as to how a listener responds, and this reader definitely could use some more lessons on reading audio books. I found her reading to be boring and tedious, with too little expression or variation in voice or tone. I have trudged through 4 of the tapes and will not finish the audio book."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING","review":"As this had been one of the early a.m. tv show's book pick I was read to spend the weekend with a good book. However, I was truly disappointed. The characters are one-dimensional and could not evoke any empathy from me whatsoever. I felt as if they were bad caricatures from what is protrayed in the movies as Southern women. The quotes from historical documents that begin each chapter are unrelated to the events in the chapter and serve no purpose unless it is to document Jiles' research. The time frame skipped around, especially if you tried to connect the historical quotes and the chapter itself. In addition, the uncoventional punctuation made this already difficult read virtually impossible. I gave up after 100 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"What did I miss? The stellar reviews surprised me as I found the book to be tedious and without a spark of realism, (except for the historical abstracts which were the best part of the book and for which I gave the book 2 stars instead of the 1 star the fictional part deserved). Too many coincidences, two dimensional characters, disagreeable Adair, delusional major (what does he see in the mercurial Adair?) and dull dialogue disappointed me. It all adds up to a big D if I were grading it in school. The subject,Southern women's fate in the war zone during the Civil War, is a good one. Too bad the execution does not live up to its promise. The author does merit my thanks for including the historical notes which I shall re-read instead of finishing the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Early details spoilt the novel","review":"On the night that Adair Colley receives Whiskey (a horse) from her father, the novel states that Savannah is nearly 15 years of age. This is supposed to be the year before the Civil War begins, the winter of 1860-61. This should make Savannah about 19 four years later when the action of Enemy Women takes place, and about 1 year older than Adair. I was irritated that this inconsistency was not picked up; Adair is constantly seen to be protecting her 'little sisters' when they are not really little at all. The style of the book was also confusing, with no speech marks and chapter prefaces that did not relate to the chapters concerned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good novel about a brutal war","review":"This is one of the better Civil War novels I've read. The brutality that existed in Kansas and Missouri during the war always makes me wonder how the people there ever got over their bitterness and learned to get along. The story starts out with an attack on a man and his family by a group of Union soldiers, then follows the oldest daughter as she tries to find her captured father and ends up in prison herself. It's a well-written book and I really got a kick out of Adair. I enjoyed the story of her adventure."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't even finish it!","review":"I really didn't like this book. I read the first 100 pages, and stopped. I found it very hard to understand what was going on a certain points (and I am an avid reader), however, that may have been due to the fact that I had a hard time concentrating! It was a very boring, dry read, and my mind did keep wandering on to other things...The story was told in a strange sort of way...I can't quite describe what it was with the book, but I had to stop reading.I guess my recommendation would be that if you are looking for a fast paced, exciting book, with character development, this is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good story with a big style flaw","review":"This was an interesting novel because it illustrated how gritty and personal the American Civil War was in Missouri. The story was good enough to keep me engaged and I cared about the characters.Good is not up to the level of \`Great', however. I have to give my rating a one star penalty because, for whatever reason, the author does not use quotes to distinguish dialog from other prose. This was a pretentious distraction that really chopped up the flow of my reading of the novel. It was useless and damaging. I'm surprised the novel's editors let it go."},{"rating":"1","title":"PAINFULL!!!!!!!","review":"This book was so slow and DULL! I got about three chapters into it before putting it down for good. The lack of quotation when someone is speaking is very distracting and hard to follow.

I am mystified how this could be given five stars by anyone.

I should have bought two. This CD is well on its way to being worn out. Lisdoonvarna alone is worth the price of airfare to hear this wonderful singer deliver it live--and this is the best version I've ever heard. It is especially good really loud and off the couch. The other songs hold up well too and are as good in their quality as in their variety. But all are sung by a man who obviously loves to sing and delivers what he brought with each one. You may like some songs more than others--but there isn't a bad one in the bunch.Besides the stand alone great Lisdoonvarna, I really enjoyed discovering \\"Biko Drum\\" and \\"Johnny Don't Go.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A further description of the Deming Management Method","review":"Dr. Deming called Dobyns and Crawford-Mason \\"the broadcasters and clarifiers of [his] message for a larger audience.\\" Their book and PBS series Quality or Else introduced the general public to the Deming Management Method."},{"rating":"2","title":"Examples of successes across a wide range of organizations.","review":"Drawing on their extensive work to produce the documentary \\"If Japan Can, Why Can't We?,\\" the authors provide excellent examples of successes from quality focused organizations across the spectrum, including education and government.

Unfortuantley, the entire CD was the same. It gave me a headache, and to tell you the truth, it was not worth 15. Jane's Addiction is excellent, so if you like them, don't expect the same from this album. It's okay for a solo record, but it's not the best i've heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music","review":"I have followed Dave Navarro's work since the beginning and I find him to be fascinating. I ran to get the CD last night and I absolutely loved it. I think he is so talented, and the music actually has some thought behind it. Most bands don't have either of those things anymore. All in all I think it was a great purchase worth every cent. I would highly reccommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't be dissapointed?","review":"I picked up this CD with the same thoughts as alot of people, \\"Hey Dave Navarro, I'll pick this one up and maybe it'll be cool. Why not.\\" I must say, if you want nothing but the music... it's worth the buy. Dave is an amazing musician and has his ups and downs in this album. Lyricly, I was let down. \\"I want to taste your saliva/ I wish you were my daughter/ I wish I was your father/ We could keep secrets\\"? I'm sorry Dave, you just didn't hook me with this line or any lines for that matter. Summary? Good music, but Dave's no phenominal lyricist. Expect to be let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing to say the least","review":"To keep all memories of Dave Navarro pure, I would suggest not buying this CD. This disc is incredibly monotonous...there is not a single song that stands out as even tolerable. If this disc didn't have Dave Navarro's name on it (along with that cheesy photo that I'm sure he's very proud of)it never would have made it to the shelves, let alone gained any of the feigned publicity that this reject album got."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster","review":"The only real reason I even bought this album instead of downloading is because it was, suprisingly, in the bargin bin at K-Mart. I figured \\"Heck, Dave's work was truely amazing with Jane's and The Red Hot's, so for 9.99 I'll give anyone with such creditals a spin.\\" Plus, the single \\"Rexall\\" is getting major airplay as well as being very good.Unfortunately, \\"Rexall\\" highlights the CD in it's entirity (Which is only a very modest ten tracks long). While no songs were particularly bad (with the exception of the horrifying \\"Everything\\"), i was dismayed it took Dave so long to write ten lackluster songs.Unless your an absolute Dave Fan, i recommend just getting the Rexall single"},{"rating":"1","title":"The rats fled this sinking ship a LONG time ago!","review":"Bought this CD forever and a day ago (at an Ames closeout, for $1, nonetheless). It was a while before I finally put it into my CD player. When I did, I was stunned. And not in a good way, either. Around Not for Nothing, I turned it off.The only true saving graces on this CD are the two singles, Rexall and Hungry. Both are truly great songs, with really cool videos (and who, among all us girls, could resist a shirtless Navarro? He's as yummy as they come!). Unfortunately, the coolness of the first two songs doesn't lend to the rest of the CD.It also doesn't help that, prior to the reunion of the year, Navarro was doing guest guitar with Christina Aguilera (I can forgive the P. Diddy thing, because I actually liked that). We can only hope for good things out of the Jane's Addiction reunion :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A great listen if your impacted by western civilization","review":"When I popped this in the CD player, first thought that came to my mind was \\"crockpot\\" ripoff. After further listens, I began to see the influence of Dave's to be wife (Carmen Electra). Her stamp is all over this album. She is credited for vocals and bass on tracks 2,6,& 7. Navarro reminds me a lot of \\"flux capacitor\\" and post era Dave Grohl. Sequencing on track 8 is rough. All in all if you like \\"chief wiggum\\", go buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheeseball","review":"Dumb album cover, dumb songs, dumb lyrics, alterna-spank power monkey. All songs sound the same. What happened? De-pierceify the nipple-ization, Dave, por favor. I guess, that, uh, yeah...this album was produced very well, and showcases some modern stuff. Very modern. Kind of like a nice glass of warm milk, or hitting yourself in the head with a hammer, or both. Buy this album if you like wheat toast without butter, or those button up shirts without collars. Nehru collars, that's it. Some call them band collars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not much to say","review":"I don't have too much to say about this album, because I really think that everyone should experience one of the finest collection of songs to come along in a long, long time. This album is truly magnificent, and a pleasure to anyone's ears. I honestly think that Navarro should have ventured out on his own a long time ago, because \\"Trust No One\\" really shows his true talents, whereas a lot of his other projects did not do him justice as an artist. Just trust me...buy this album. It's a must-have for anyone who enjoys music."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected more.","review":"This album is probably what the non-fanatic would expect. Better than \\"Carmen Electras\\" cd, but not as good as say \\"Jerry Cantrells\\" or \\"Chris Cornells\\" solo work. Funny enough to me, it sounds something more like \\"Saliva\\" or nu-metal, than it does \\"Janes Addiction\\" or \\"Chili Peppers\\". The first song is definitely the best one. But regardless of what this does and doesn't sound like, the songs become pretty monotonous, and some of the lyrics are high school-ish. Not that \\"Trust no One\\" is bad, but Dave seems more at home in a band, than on his own. I guess he's back with \\"Janes\\" now anyway. Get this used, if at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected something different","review":"What happened to Spread? I would rather hear something more 'instrumental' coming from one of my favorite all-time guitarists. Yes, there is great guitar work here, but not enough! I heard more creative and inspired music on the Deconstruction album. I can do without the lyrics and vocals -it's just not what I know Dave Navarro for. I guess it's more of a vocal album? Maybe that's what he wanted? It's better than I can do (at the moment), but it's just kinda mainstream and not what I would ever expect, or what I'm into."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"It's possible to get lost again in my favorite 80's tunes.

The equipment shown is even no longer sold as used equipment on ebay or similar venues or talked about in suppiers litterature. It is a waste of my money.

So tasty.","review":"Ah, the cheese flows and flows in this horror film from Stuart Gordon. If you liked ReAnimator, you would enjoy this as well. Jeffrey Combs, as Crawford Tillingast, is deliberately over the top with his expressions and delivery, while the lovely Barbara Crampton is a scientific researcher who becomes corrupted by the resonator and its effects on her pineal gland. The amoral Dr. Praetorius evolves (?) into a grotesque blob of monstrous proportions, apparently symbolizing his rotten core.The effects are actually pretty good for what must have been a relatively low budget, and the most is made of some limited sets. You will remember some of the dialogue, some of which is very funny, though it wasn't delivered in a humorous context."},{"rating":"1","title":"B-Movie B-Ware","review":"The reviews here are skewed wayy positive by many viewers who are age-old fans rejoicing over a long delayed DVD release. Yes the uncut version must be a whole lot better than what has gone before and the video quality throughout is great. I can only imagine the travesty of a cut version, the restored bits all fit in quite well.But keep in mind, this is B-Movie material and although I really really like B-Movies, this one did not make it to my \\"keeper\\" pile and I'm pretty lax about that, most movies I get are keepers. So if you're a fan, buy the DVD, but if you're new to this director or looking to expand your horror collection I recommend to skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for the 80's - but not really kitchy . . .","review":"I would have probably really enjoyed this in the 80's - but now. . . not so much. It's a little outdated - and the effects and acting are somewhat poor. I can't believe people have rated it so high - maybe it's nostalgia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"After years of wondering why this great horror classic was not available until now is revealed! We nowdays take for granted that every movie will be available on DVD and unrated. So why did it take so long for this film to be released? The studio misplaced the cut scenes! In fact director Stuart Gordon was originally told that they were thrown away. Luckily for us in 2005 someone found them! Now we all get to see one of the most original horror films of all time the way it was supposed to be seen.If you have not seen this film, there is no real way of describing it properly. You just have to see it. It's thrilling, well acted, and gory as hell. You'll be talking about it for days with your friends. Plus at a good price, you just have no excuse owning it. A great addition for your horror collection if you already love Gordon's Re-Animator films and his take on Lovecraft stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love Horror","review":"I loved this movie as a rental growing up, and now I own it along with every Lovecraft adaption ever made. I also have a poster of this in my bedroom (Humans are Such Easy Prey...ha). A scientist invents a machine that holds hideous monsters that try and possess this guy.

This record is an essential for any fan. With \\"Tales...\\", the band reached the highest point of their career. Building on the strengths exemplified in Amorphis' debut, \\"The Karelian Isthmus\\", \\"Tales From The Thousand Lakes\\" perfectly combines elements of heavy metal, doom, death metal and '70s progressive rock into a talented and extremely tasteful historical/folklore tribute based on Finland's national book \\"The Kalevala\\" (see the \\"Band\\" section).

The music is moody and entrancing--though I am not generally a fan of digital keyboards they work well here in carrying the atmosphere and harmonizing with the guitar leads.No less than three of the best metal riffs of all time, in this writer's opinion, can be found on this CD, in the songs \\"The Castaway,\\" \\"Black Winter Day,\\" and \\"Forgotten Sunrise.\\"In sum, this album is a must for all metal fans, except those who are truly repelled by gruff vocals, and it will earn a special place in the hearts of those who have a space reserved for quality melancholic doom metal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seven Steps to Stop a Heart Attack","review":"I have studied heart disease since having a heart attack two years ago.

Great stuff!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hair Devine","review":"This works great on short, thin hair. Have used this for about 3 years. I would recommend to anyone that wants a spikey look on short hair. I have used other water based gels and this beats them hands down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best gel on the market!","review":"The Hard Up gel is amazing. It's the only gel I will use. I've been wearing my hair kind of spiky and with this gel, I could be in a hurricane and my hair wouldn't move. Another big plus is it smells good enough to eat! :) I have had people think I'm am wearing perfume. You can't go wrong with the Hard Up gel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Been Using This For Years - FANTASTIC!","review":"I wear my hair short and spikey and have been using Short Sexy Hair Hard Up Gel for several years now. I tried numerous other products, all of which I did not like for one reason or another but mainly because the majority of them made my hair feel dirty and/or greasy. Then I found Short Sexy Hair Hard Up Gel and have used it ever since! You can use it on wet or dry hair and it works great for short spikey hair! Just a little goes a long way. It puts a bit of shine to your hair, keeps it in place and is not hard and stiff like some other products. The best part is that it rinses right out and leaves no residue! I LOVE THIS STUFF!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price on Amazon","review":"My boyfriend loves this hair gel, but the salon he bought it from cost around $15 for the smaller version of this. So I look it up on Amazon and found it with better price and bigger product. The down side is that when the gel reaches the bottom, the pump is too short to dispense the it...what my bf did was just leave it upside down. All in all, this is a great gel, it smells good, and it holds his hair no problem for 8+ hrs. Will repurchase for sure :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great hair gel","review":"Okay, kind of weird to review hair gel, but it is the best stuff I've used. A hairdresser put it in my hair probably 6 or 7 years ago and I've been buying it ever since. Expensive as hell, but at least twice I've tried switching to regular store-bought gel to save money, and I always came back. The off-the-shelf brands made my hair greasy without giving much stiffness. This stuff gives you the stiffness you need without too much of the greasy look (make sure your hair is not too wet or it will) and without making your hair clump together. I like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK!","review":"I have used this product in the past, after purchasing it at a salons and the pump feature always works great. This Gel product I have now purchased seemed to have a defect of some kind. The pump does not allow me to pump very high for the Gel to come out. And its a pain to keep using my fingers to try and lift the pump higher for the Gel to come out.Other than that the Gel is the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only gel that works for me.","review":"I have been using this product ever since I changed my hair to a spiky style several years ago.

Product works great, lasts all day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glue","review":"I used this on my hair and it's too much like glue to me. It does hold the hair in place, I love how it works on my sideburns. However, once you put this on you cannot comb through it or else there will be breakage. I need a good hold, but still some bendability. I'll have to pass on glue holds where you can't even run your fingers thru."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's like glue, and takes excessive shampoo and water to wash out","review":"I don't like the smell, but worse, I can't believe how difficult it was to wash it out of my hair. Thank goodness I only used it to hold my bangs slicked back. I can't imagine how horrible the experience would have been had I used it throughout my hair. I had to shampoo twice, and use inordinate amounts of shampoo just to get it all out.I want to grow my bangs out. With this glue in my hair, I can't run my fingers through it. If you want to convert your hair into a helmet, this is the goop"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gel!","review":"This doesn't Flake nor give you that itchy feeling. Holds up really well after hours.I have thick, curly hair, and usually 9/10 gel products never last or eventually flake (making it look like I have dandruff).I love this brand & it smells great!Expensive to some extent, but definitely you get your money's worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"This stuff is the schizel","review":"If you have short hair and don't want 1 strand to move this is the stuff. Excellent product that is easy to wash out and works like concrete.

I can wear my motorcycle helmet n it stays fixed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I thought it would be","review":"Seeing how there are almost 100 reviews with a 4.5/5 rating, I thought I'd give this product a try despite the price. Unfortunately, it didn't work too well for me. My hair is a little under than an inch long and while it did hold my hair style in place, it failed to clump all the hair strands into bigger pieces of spikes. I guess you really must have hair shorter than 0.5\\" to use this product. I've used this product with and without watered hair. It doesn't make your hair shine either.If any of you guys are looking to seriously spike your hair (regardless of hair length), stick with Got2B Ultra Glued. Has more shine and actually holds your hair in place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't be easier!","review":"Received by date promised and free shipping was a very cool bonus!No problem at all.

It also dries out my hair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was looking for a more traditional gel","review":"After reading all the great reviews about this product, I decided to get it. When I received it and pumped some out of the bottle, I wasn't expecting what I got. Its very gluey and sticky, did not feel like a normal gel that moves around freely in your hand. This literally felt like a hard glue in my hands. I went ahead anyway and put it in my hair, I have longer hair than just spikes on top, probably 2-3 inches around, and this gel was just too sticky to do what I wanted with my longer hair. I also have a lot of hair, as soon as the gel got into my hair it was just impossible to move it around. I quickly washed out my hair and am using L.A. Looks, a more traditional gel. In conclusion this \\"gel\\" didn't work for me. I gave it 2 stars because some people are looking for a very hard glue type gel and if you have very short hair to spike it probably does work, but if you like more of a water based gel and have longer hair, this is not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT ORIGINAL PRODUCT","review":"HELLOAMAZON, i'm using this product from last 3 year's but the product i got last time its not original ,it does't smell like original one and really bad for hairs i also checked with couple salon shops they said the same thing.

Not very happy about the situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superglue for Hair","review":"Good grief, I can't believe how much I paid for this! It's totally useless for me. Don't use it on hair longer than 1/2 inch. My hair is about 4 inches long, which I consider short, and when I put it on my hair, it was a nightmare. It hardened like concrete and I couldn't get a comb or brush through it without extreme pain. I brought the nightmare to an end by washing it out of my hair.

The reason why it only received 2 stars is because of the pump dispenser that the product is in. The pump does not work well AT ALL. The pump get stucks constantly and only dispenses a small amount. I constantly need to \\"mess with it\\" for it to actually dispense the gel. The gel = phenomenal, the pump = HORRIBLE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great hair gel for men","review":"I discovered this when I was getting my hair cut and the hair stylist used it on my hair after she was done cutting it and I loved i since then!

For those who don't know this product is great for short hair and takes VERY little and has an unbelievable hold .The tubes or pump bottle last longer than you think making the price well worth it.Oh and also ,if somehow your hair does manage to mess up you dont get that residue or ashy hair like other gels leave plenty of.Again, I know to some this may seem a bit costly ,but I have had the 16.9oz for 7 months now and ,though I use it on a daily basis ,still have more than half left."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"It holds your hair in place all day. It is well worth the money and the product is excellent for flat-tops or other styles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zipper sticks","review":"This case is very stiff and it feels more like vinyl or plastic than nylon. As minimal protection it should keep your drum dry and dust free and it may prevent minor dings, but there is no padding and the plastic zipper tends to stick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bodhran economy case, 16\\" x 4/34","review":"This is a great case for smaller Bodhrans which you don't intend to trek all over - maybe to a party or pub and back.

That said my poor son loved it, but I finally got so angry and frustrated that I threw the thing out. My son is so upset; he's in his room crying over it right now.

Yes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over Rated...","review":"The problem I have with silverchair's debut album is that even though the production is tight (in an early 90's grunge kind of way) and silverchair are aussie rock's biggest poster boy's since AC/DC; Frogstomp still sounds like a collection of polished demos by three 15 year olds instead of the classic aussie rock album that it's been hyped up as. The songwriting comes off as teenage wining instead of angst and the music doesn't have the power that's needed to drive any of the songs home convincingly.

Despite the fact that, at times, it is clear they are just a bunch of kids screwing around, I have found that when playing this while driving, I can arrive at my destination a lot more rapidly, as the fast paced nature of most of the songs encourages throttle depression!

It's so poorly designed that it's hard not to push the power button or side record button when putting it in or getting it out.

This band is only the remnants of Skynyrd.You don't see the three surviving Beatles trying to tour under their name and claiming to be as good as the original.

This book has a section on history, manufacturers and reproductions as well as listings with drawings of glassware in this category. Like the previous reviewer, I felt photos would have been better than drawings because the drawings are too small to pick out details to help identify specific patterns easily. Maybe a combination of drawings with photos would be nice, however, I am sure finding examples of all the glassware could be rather difficult! Many of us see older glassware and think \\"Grandma had that\\", never realizing that Grandma's grandmother actually had it first!

Armed with ancient fighting techniques and high tech hardware, Lulu is a beautiful masked millionaire battling to defeat a greedy entrepreneur intent on enslaving the world. Based on a comic book, Silver Hawek, is an edge-of-your-seat thrill ride, packed with cars, gravity-defying martial arts fights, and, at the center of it all, one sexy heroine. Two final comments: (1). Michelle's major photograph at the back of the DVD shows what a sexy and voluptuous Michelle is. In fact I feel aroused for a long time after seeing this photograph; (2). There are too many laughs toward the end of the DVD which degrade Silver Hawk's overall value. I prefer Michelle from the Bond's movie or from Supercop movie. Maybe this is the reason why Silver Hawk is a fiasco in the USA and Europe. That's why I gave this movie 4 instead of 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"The pain!","review":"As a fan of Michelle Yeoh, I was embarassed to see her in this film. The acting was abysmal. The special effects were probably the best part of the film. Fight scenes were mediocre and boring. This ranks up there with the recently released House of Fury.

There is so much else going on rather than focusing on the relationship I feel like I've been diverted into the spy/mystery/murder world.

Besides that, this just isn't that brutal. It doesn't even come close to bands like Morbid Angel or Cryptopsy. Those bands have way better musicianship, and are way more brutal.

Mortician have a reached a new low in the already unrespectable genre of grind, as it seems the band has just down-tuned their guitars to a horror movie backdrop (which gets VERY old after 5 tracks) just for the sake of sickening people and creating an excuse for music. Sure, Cannibal Corpse does the same thing, but at least they sound good while doing it. Mortician just doesn't make the grade here, as not a speck of decent musicianship or songwriting is evident anywhere on this entire \\"album.\\" Spend your valued cash elsewhere, metalheads. You have been warned..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GOOD SECOND RELEASE.","review":"The sound production on this album is much better than their first,but I still prefer the first cd.The songs are insanely fast and heavy.This cd has the classic trademark sound of mortician and I would recommend this cd to any fan of the band.Over all,a solid and good release of this extreme band."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mystery...","review":"I'm not sure why this type of \\"music\\" exists, or who listens to it, or what record company would record it and try to sell it. Sure, listening to a cacophony of drumming while some guy belches is funny for a little while, but it gets tiresome. Deicide, Morbid Angel, etc. are bad enough, but Mortician have triumphantly ascended to a new plateau of lameness in the dull, stupid world of death metal. I guess I'll never understand...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome device to build children's attention spans","review":"As a mother, I am troubled by the way that the media bombards children with images, lasting only a few seconds, thereby discouraging them from ever developing habits of sustained thought or long attention spans. These longer books on tape published by DK are an excellent device for combatting this kind of dumbing down of the American educational system. Our 4 year old is able to read this from start to finish on her own as she goes to bed at night or as I'm making dinner. It lasts almost 45 mintues! I would recommend any of the books in this series as a means to introducing classical stories in children with timeless morals (in the case of Pinocchio, there is a strong message about the importance of obeying parents and going to school) in an abridged form. Parents who are into classical schooling should definitely add this series to their home library! It includes a cassette and a fully illustrated book.

There are sections on this CD that are so bad I found myself laughing. The band changed their line-up and dropped the keyboard player from \\"tales\\" who I think made the album. You can here that the band is moving into different territory but still wants to hold onto the death metal thing. It is an extremeley awkward and not a very well thought out release from a band that was going through a major transition."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST BUY!","review":"Elegy is the best metal album out there! It has everything. Heavy, melodic riffs, perfect death growls, beautiful clean vocals, and just an awesome all around sound that will consume you from start to finish. It's fast and heavy in parts to get you moving, and it's slower and beautifully melodic in others, to entrance your soul. This album is so complete and wonderfully orchestrated, it will leave you craving more. I never get tired of listening to this masterpiece.

Kathe Koja's stories are so wonderful that I often scanned the shelves of bookstores for anthologies with Koja stories, then I'd sit and read her story in its entirety.Now, at last, we have all of her stories in one volume. Buy this book, then seek out her novels, even the ones out of print. Koja is by far the best novelist alive and by signing with Four Walls Eight Windows and getting away from the horror publishing houses, she may finally get the attentions she deserves.Favorites from this collection include \\"Angels in Love,\\" \\"Bird Superior\\" and \\"The Neglected Garden.\\" Buy this book now so you can start catching up on years of great reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Brain-tingling collection","review":"It's a ahame that so many of Kathe Koja's books appear to be out-of-print.

I consider this collection to rank right up there with my favorite author, Clive Barker.

This collection falls into the latter category. If you stripped each tale down to its basic story elements, you'd be left with almost nothing. Reading these stories was, for me, like doing hard, sweaty labor for minimum wage--it just ain't worth it! I honestly have to wonder how many people read this stuff for enjoyment and how many read it to be part of some \\"scene\\". I read all categories of fiction, not just horror, but I can always count on the horror field to produce some of the best examples of awful, overwritten prose.

By contrast, \\"Do You Believe in Magic,\\" a sparkling pop tune, captures youthful romanticism, the wholesome rock 'n roll spirit. The other gem is \\"You Didn't Have to Be So Nice,\\" with its lovely lyrics and great vocal harmonies. \\"Daydream\\" displays John Sebastian's abilities in a mellower, pensive atmosphere, and \\"Nashville Cats\\" is jaunty and fun. Indeed, like The Byrds, the Spoonful had that great mid-60s rhythmic and harmonic sound, usually structured, but they were less intense in their message, more cheerfully optimistic, and we need that sometimes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another major disapointment of Lovin Spoonful greatest hits!","review":"No comment about this CD album it's the worst.

I had it serviced twice, including having the thermostat replaced, but it still gets way too cold for storing red or white wine - even at the minimum setting, the top of the fridge is in the low 50's, and the bottom is as cold as a refridgerator. Danby was particularly unhelpful in getting it fixed (probably because it was never made to work to begin with)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"The thermostat on this model is very imprecise.

I store mostly reds and I cannot get the temperature above 45 degrees even when I put my thermometer on the top shelf. I have it on the lowest setting possible and it still freezes out my reds.

It does make for interesting reading, and I would recommend it, as would my husband."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stunningly Clueless","review":"This book is a mind-numbing set of specious one-sided arguments slamming American history and values. The author seems to inhabit his own little world, where every historical \\"empire\\" no matter how complex, illustrates a few simple notions of the evil of getting involved with the larger world. The talking points are discussed and concluded with the glib tone of a high-school debating club. The author's view of history is extravagantly revisionist, and often self-contradictory. He seems hopelessly confused by world politics, and just wishes we could withdraw behind a wall, secure in our smug superiority. He has nothing at all intelligent to say about Islamic terrorism, rogue nuclear states, or the impending bankruptcy of the western social democracies, caused by an inward-looking worldview that agrees with his own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"The author has certainly convinced himself that in the 21st century the U.S. should think of itself as a plaintive island. I think that always in politics and governance the truth lies somewhere in the middle.

It will also give you a glimpse of what life was like during that period of time. It will increase your knowledge of a former day, and give you an appreciation of what those people went through so that things can be where they are today.

Stone, of free speech in wartime, that is oddly both often a little frightening and quite hopeful. The six periods on which the author focuses are the sedition act of 1798, the Civil War, the two World Wars, the Cold War, and the Vietnam War. Three of these periods show a carlessness with the First Amendment (1798, World War I, and the Cold War) on the part of national leaders that is balanced with a less hysterical reaction in the other three wartime periods. The author is brilliant in analyzing why this is so and he tells a fascinating story of a progressive, though never inevitable or strictly linear, development of the importance of a free press and a free discourse of ideas, even (perhaps particularly) during times of national crisis. A brilliant, important, truly fascinating tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much espionage for my taste","review":"I enjoyed the mystery of it all, but it was a little too much of a spy/Communist plot for my tastes.

Real estate became the sexy investment of choice, new types of mortgage products became available and owners and renters alike became much more sophisticated. The author talks about buying houses for $36,000!!! Perhaps in the early 1980's, but not anymore--especially not in California which is where most of his real estate dealmaking took place.Save your money and purchase another real estate book on pre-foreclosure prospecting, or the financials of property ownership. It will be money well spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"lots of good technical detail","review":"Of the several foreclosure manuals I've read, this is definitely the best. The author gives several examples of his own purchases making it more believable. This one is not quite as hyped-up as the usual get-rich-easy real-estate book. The 3 phases of foreclosure, along with lots of good technical how-to details are covered. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"This author seems to have a lot of experience buying real estate. The ideas in the book are old but he makes a lot of good points. It is not possible to do everything just as he says but he will get you to learn to think. There are a lot of things to look out for and he teaches you to learn to look. Of course, you can not use all of his ideas. He bought one house with a negative outlay of 250+ a month and made 30000 because the house went up in value. That would be hard to do that deal today. This is guy is so good that he would still do very well today. I have 20-30 books on real estate but I do like this book a lot. There are a lot of reviewers pointing out all of the flaws in this book. I prefer to look at the good things and just ignore the weakness.

I can't even walk in these shoes! Is it the size then? Are the shoes too narrow for me? I would like to return them but I've since lost the box.

I bought this album on a lark and immediately found it to be the best example of melodic, manic progressive metal (death metal or not). Inventive, structured, intense, absurd, Dan Swano and the boys constructed the most brilliant album ever produced in metal. Time and tempo changes, schizophrenia, all within a tight structure that makes sense. The first time I heard it, my only reaction was, 'this is purely audacious'. People who know their instruments, know the form, dissected it and put it back together with the mastery of a classical composer. When the sax chorus breaks in for a little squiff of a line after the guitar crunch, you know you're in the madhouse of a genius. One of my top ten of all time, if you have an imagination, I cannot recommend it more highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have yet to receive this item","review":"I have been waiting for this item to come in, but it hasn't come in yet.

Thanks~"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent companion to the Novel.","review":"The Cliff Notes guide to the Scarlet Letter served as a useful companion to the story. Rather than lug around a dictionary to look up complicated words, the Cliff Notes made it easy for the reader to look up the challenging vocabulary in the story. In addition, obscure historical references are explained in the context to the story. The chapter summaries were also useful, particularly in deciphering the middle chapters (9-11), which focus on the psychological battle between the two male main characters of the novel. The Scarlet Letter isn't an easy novel to read, and it really helps to have a guide such as this support your understanding of the novel, particularly a story as influential as this one.However, there is one drawback. The glossary and summary for the twenty-four chapters of the book should also be available for the preliminary story, The Customs House."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Book","review":"We orderd the Scarlet Letter CLIFF NOTES, but we were sent the Scarlet Letter BOOK.

If that's what you're looking for, this book isn't for you. Very few recipes in the book cook longer then 4-5 hours.

I read it and most of the recipes are just lighter versions of the old casseroles using too many prepared soups like light cream of mushroon soup and spices like light sodium seasoned salt. There were only a few recipes I even wanted to try..I like to cook and would be wiiling to come back and check ingredients and stir things and so forth during the day but did not want to be tied to the stove and maybe burn things. The ingredients rarely had extra spices and wine and etc. I'm too much of a foodie for this one...leave it for the church suppers in the midwest."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Most-Used Cookbook","review":"This is the cookbook that never stays on the kitchen shelf for long. With so many varieties of each main ingredient, we never get tired of anything. The recipes make great use of my spice collection and give me combinations I would never think of on my own. This is my favorite healthy cookbook because it does not have many fish and seafood recipes (though there are some). I have tried and tried, but just cannot turn myself into a fish eater and most healthy cookbooks I try are filled with fish dishes! It has a great assortment of old favorites, such as chicken and dumplings, as well as newer selections, even a few including meat substitutes.Tip: If you are trying meat substitutes (eg. tofu, TVP) for the first time, or your family is hesitant to try them, then slow-cooking is the way to go because the flavors of vegetables and seasonings will really seep into the protein. Sometimes, kids don't even realize they're eating TVP instead of ground beef!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleh","review":"Well, I really do not like this book. I've made a few recipes from it and only one was somewhat edible. One recipe that I used for overnight oatmeal actually burnt a one-inch thick rim of black nastiness in my crockpot that took one hour to clean. I suppose if you want to learn what not to do, you should get this book. I just wonder if the author actually tested these recipes before putting them into the book. I really can't imagine that she did! Bleh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did they even test these recipes first?","review":"I have a family of five with busy schedules of sports, scouts, church activities, etc., etc. I was excited to get this cookbook so we'd stop eating on the go so much. Sound familiar?I started trying a new recipe week after week. Every recipe was awful! Most of the recipes were bland or mushy. Which reminds me...Beware of any of the recipes that call for rice. It will be overcooked. I guess I should have known that, but yuck! Just in case you're like me and didn't know: Rice turns to mush in a crockpot!I hate to bad mouth this book so bad, but I wasted money buying the book and money buying the food for the recipes that I just ended up throwing out....several times. I tried mostly shrimp or chicken recipes.Maybe I chose the wrong recipes? But after a couple of months, you would think I'd hit a winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few winners, but mostly boring and flavorless","review":"I really wish this book had reviews written IN THE BOOK. Because...some of the recipes are really quite good and flavorful, but most, like 75% or more, are really boring. I enjoy the Mexican Cornbread, the Tastes-like-Chile-Rellenos, the Coq au Vin, the Steak Fajitas; but mostly, I'm adding in the salt and fat that they tried to take out since it would be too boring otherwise. There are just not enough other flavors to make up for the lack of salt and fat.In addition, I think the format of the book is less than helpful; it has pages and pages of beef stews for instance, all with basically the same ingredients with only minor differences between them all. And, there are no comments to guide you in choosing which one would taste best. I have almost stopped trying new recipes from this book since I am usually disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get your hopes up","review":"I was excited to find a crockpot cookbook that didn't have lots of recipes with cream of mushroom soup in them. Some recipes are written more clearly than others. Some have a range for how long you should cook stuff instead of a particular number.I tried 3 recipes. First was a Rosemary Chicken recipe which cooked the chicken too long and dried it out. Then I tried a macaroni and cheese recipe which burnt. Finally I tried a recipe for chicken with soy sauce and honey which once again was dried out. The seasonings were good and some of the recipes were pretty unique, hence the 2 star rating.I followed the directions to the letter and even had the same size crockpot which they mentioned in the recipe!So if you choose to use this book, watch the food VERY CLOSELY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"I gave this cookbook lots of tries.

Lastly the inside of the frame is larger than 5 x 7 and lacks any kind of inner guides for placing the photo, so you just have to eyeball it and hope it doesn't shift while you slide all the pieces and backing into place. I was wearing cotton gloves to protect the very expensive photo prints that I was putting into these frames, so I'm confident that the frames shipped with all those scratches and smudges.

The man cant even talk properly plus his mouth is a disaster. Why do people think Mike Jones is hot? I dont understand what Mikes Jones is putting out that grabs people attention. He is not creative and his lyrics are about as basic as Hooked On Phonics which is something he really need to take advantage of.

In any event, Mike Jones does have flashes of a decent rapper (well, at least in this watered-down era of garbage that we dare call rap) but sadly this album just ends up being a mixture of decent beats, repetitive and mostly meaningless lyrics and just overall blandness. The only reason why I decided to give this 2 stars is because Still Tippin' and Flossin' (Listen to Big Moe \\"sing\\" and tell me you don't laugh!).

Unfortunately, the content of this album is similar to 80% of those shows - mostly hype.After te first run-throw of the cd I was less in awe of his lyrical ability than I was with his ability to say his name so many times in one song. At last count he'd reached 9-times on one song. I suppose that takes skill.Mostly I was left disappointed. If you have to talk about yourself that much, then you definately don't have anything to talk about. I will give him credit for catchy hooks, good production and simple grimy lyrics.

What makes it even worse are those emo/scene kids who want to be obscure and funny/cool by listening to rap, so they go out and buy mike jones shirts and wear them to local shows and pretend they like it.

Similar problems are seen with Judaism and Isalem.

(...)Randy Bachman and a couple other originals are no longer with the band, they fumble through some lame post-bachman tunes, and the couple of classic tunes they do play are butchered by the slapped-together band.

The group put out fairly successful singles and albums, so imagine how great it was to get a good live album from this band! Burton Cummings had a lot of attitude back then, and in an era when most bands were lip synching with backing bands made up of musicians you would not recognize, this group could play. Back then, this album ranked up with Ya-Ya's from The Rolling Stones and Live at Leeds from The Who as one of my favorite live albums. \\"Pain Train\\" allows Burton Cummings to get up to speed, and \\"Runnin' Back to Saskatoon\\" really rocks, along with Cumming's clever lyrics.

It's made for kids and it works for kids - especially little girls who can't get enough of Belle.A few other reviewers have commented that the Beast was too scary in the last cartoon, where he keeps a little bird in a cage. Personally, we didn't think the Beast was scary. In fact, he acted a lot like a little kid having a temper tantrum, and our daughter thought he was funny. But, a word of caution: after the Beast finally set the bird free, our two-year-old decided to emancipate our pet bird, and became upset when she couldn't. So pet-owning parents should be prepared to have a long talk after viewing.On the whole, our daughter finds \\"Belle's Magical World\\" entertaining and, while it's not our favorite thing to watch, it was worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"I was amazed!

But 'pulse demon' is useful only as a foil, so your other cd's sound better afterwards. I'll say the same about other popular merzbow releases that are lauded mainly for their 'brutal harshness', and anyone who finds anything 'psychedelic' in this mess, is merely experiencing the predictable effects of pure loud noise; for added 'psychedelic' effect, stay up all night and then eat junk food for breakfast!"},{"rating":"1","title":"zero stars","review":"I'm a big fan of noisy stuff like John Zorn's Naked City, Fantomas, and the Melvins, but this is just plain bad.

I bought this to touch up high traffic areas. It can't do what a professional can, but for the price it does really great. The small (1 gal) fresh water/dirty water tanks require frequent fills and dumps, but that's better for me than working with a unit that becomes very heavy due to more water on board. My arthritis usually kicks in after I have done a good deal of physical labor, and I expected to be sore after cleaning several rooms, but that didn't happen.I like that you can see the water extraction through the top of the unit. You can easily see if you have pulled up what you have sprayed. The rotary brushes work better than I anticipated. You may have to pretreat and hand scrub tough spots, but at this price from Unbeatable Sales, you still come out cheaper than a professional clean. Over all, great for the price and I would highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carpet Cleaning Crap","review":"Bought this brand new, and used it twice. Why twice?

One is lucky to win weekly, playing all day.You folks have lost the concept! The idea isn't to win. THE IDEA IS TO COMPETE FOR HIGH SCORE!!! The 2320 would let you win without deducting the 20 points for going more than 3 rounds. In other words, you could win (and compete) before it went past 3 rounds. NOT WITH THE 2000!!!! It is virtually impossible to win on the 2000 before it deducts the 20 points.I can't tell you how disappointed my wife and I are with your poorly programmed 2000...But, we're sure you'll delete this review...Don and Sandra Chute"},{"rating":"2","title":"hand held solitaire player","review":"Have been using it constantly since it.s arrival and I love it.

It was poorly written, boring and difficult to follow. I finally was able to get through this book unlike the last one, but I am beginning to wonder if Walker has ever been to Houston. At least he got the weather more correct this time, but I work downtown and have been looking for buildings one could jump from one to the other. Most buildings here take up a city block and jumping across five or six lanes of roadway is just too unbelievable. But poetic license aside, I wonder if Walker's students are writing this series because they don't seem to be written by the same person who is writing the \\"Instinct\\" series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold Edge","review":"This is the worst book I have read in a very long time. The book jacket claims that the author teaches writing in Florida. I find this somewhat surprising given that the storyline in 'Cold Edge' is disjointed, jumping from event to event without clearly delineating a change in time or scenery. Apparently the reader is supposed to just know when Walker has moved on to the next setting. The character development is non-existent, except for the main character Lucas Stonecoat, a Native American detective. Stonecoat is portrayed in a shallow, stereotypical caricature of what Walker obviously believes is an accurate example of a Native American. Finally, the dialogue is difficult to follow; at times, Walker has characters reply to themselves, or doesn't clearly define whom is speaking, making the dialogue very difficult to follow as well as distracting the reader from the story. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a gift!","review":"Anything by Isaac Bashevis Singer is a gift!

Garfield replies one. God says very well you may have your nine lives back. Then God askes them if Odie was a dog. Garfield says yes he is. So God gives them there lives back. The point being God knows when you lie to him. He is not dumb. So I really looked down on tis film ever scence. The other part i didn't like was that in the begining God created the world. God also created cats. So why is the cat crawling out of the sea. I considered that evolution. God created the world not some animal. We did not revolve.

I had grown to like Katy and Zeb and the author took both of them out along with the baby. Way did she make Zeb leave when Deborah and Manda needed him? It just depresses me. Then she thinks she can replace Zeb and Katy with Zeb's sister and the pastor. The only thing that could keep me reading the series is if Zeb comes back.

The glimpse inside this close-knit and loving family is as almost as appealing as Sandy's relationship with Flipper. Not given to mushy sentimentality, I nevertheless was very moved by the show that Flipper and Sandy put on for Sandy's friends for the price of one fish per person.

Everything else works and it records sound. The lens even moves, but no video shows at all. Sony is no help and will not help pay for any repairs. They deny that this is a manufacturing flaw....obviously it is with all the other complaints noted. SONY SUCKS !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Dependability","review":"Just like another reviewer, my DCR-TRV19 I purchased almost exactly 18 months ago stopped \\"seeing\\". Like another reviewers state, all other functions are retained. When recording it will record the audio w/o video. I have owned several Sony camcorders and I guess quality at Sony is going down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sony Door weight. Very dissapointing","review":"I have had this camera for just over a year. 8/14/03 is the purchase date. I used it a total of 12 times for maybe 20 minutes max, kept it locked up when not in use, and now it doesn't work. I paid extra for Sony \\"quality\\". There were other cameras I would have rather had (cheaper, more compact with more features) but bought the sony because of Consumer Reports listing Sony's as having low occurances of repairs. One thing I did like better when this camera was working was the nightshot feature. It was much better than the night shot feature on the Panasonic GS-15 I just bought to replace the Sony.I called Sony and they offered my a flat fee of 269.00. Not willing to throw good money after bad because I have already spent over 600.00 dollars on a camera that only lasted a year with only a few uses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good ultra compact Camcorder","review":"Simplicity and comfort is the key for this model. Except for a few essential fuctions like zoom, nightshot every other control has to be operated by the touch screen capability. Few Other features I liked is battery info which gives you an idea when to recharge and night shot.Unlike TRV22 there is no memory stick but you can take pictures on the tape.Other extra features on trv22 are color view finder and MPEG recording . I didn't wanted to spend extra 100 bucks on those feautures which I rarely use.Overall this is wonderful camcorder for day to day use and it is so tiny that you can take it almost everywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good camcorder","review":"I have had the EXACT same problem with this camcorder that others described. Timed perfectly with the warranty running out, the screen is now black, and it won't record any images, just sound. The repair cost is more than the cost of the camera. I will never buy Sony again."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you buy this product, buy the warranty!","review":"When I record with my DCR-TRV19 I have sound and a black picture. I bought the camera 04/30/2004 and this problem started in February 2005, less than a year from purchase. Sony will only replace parts after a year (not labor which lasts 90 days). I will have to ship it carefully to Connecticut with a cover letter to have it repaired for the flat rate of $269.00. The rep could not break down the repair rate for labor and parts. I mentioned to the Sony customer repair that I have read other consumer reviews with the same problem, and he told me he will make a note of my problem.I feel foolish for purchasing this product since my last Sony Handcam which I bought in 1995 also stopped working mysteriously (atleast that one lasted a few years)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I will never buy Sony again","review":"This camera starts recording but the screen is blank. It zooms and everything but wont start \\"seeing\\". So far the screen has come back up after a minute or so, but from everyone elses comments, it looks like it will be useless, and sony will not fix it. What is more upsetting is that I just bought a brand new laptop from sony."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE!!! Works wonderful until video recording capability disappears!","review":"Like numerous other reviewers, I too loved my camera for the first year that I had it. I bought it after our first baby was born, and used it about 10 times over the course of 18 months. When I went to record her 2 year birthday party, the LCD panel was black, and I couldn't record anything but audio. I now see that this is a VERY common defect in this product. Unfortunately, Sony good name no longer equates good product. Very disappointed in Sony for not recalling these. Obviously a design flaw somewhere based on how common this problem seems to be with this camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!!!","review":"This camera is a waste of money!!! Do not buy it! We bought it new and we've only used it for a month and the tape got stuck!!! Warranty pays for parts only and not labor and Sony is charging us about $220 plus shipping and handling! This is awful! Save yourself grief!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but not great","review":"I managed to record all of 2 hours worth of video. Now, it will not load a cassette anymore. It comes up with a C:31:40 error and grinds to a halt. Sony's web site and support are horrible when it comes to fixing this.I used to be a Sony fan. I bought this thing because of the Sony label. No more. The Sony brand has lost it.I returned the camera for service, costing $250. I got it back and tested immediately. Same problem occurred after 1 hour of recording.I returned it again, Sony willingly paid shipping. Camera eventually came back and has been reliable. Fine as an indoor and fair weather camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent image quality for the price","review":"I was looking for a MiniDV camcorder that was small, easy to hold, with the best image and sound quality I could afford. I didn't want still picture recording, MPEG recording, a memory stick, or any of that other stuff that a digital still camera does better, and which just jacks up the camcorder's price.After trying low-end JVC, Panasonic, Sharp, and Sony models, I settled on the Sony TRV19: it has the best image quality by far of all the low-end MiniDV cameras, and meets my other criteria as well. Only thing that's less than stellar is the sound: the stereo separation is good, but I hear camera motor noise occasionally on playback. This is endemic to low-end cameras, and no worse in the Sony than others I've tried, so I'm OK with it. This model has a hotshoe for an external mic, so I have an out if I need it.I've shot about 6 hours so far, all handheld, and I'm very happy with this model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool cam w/nice touchscreen display!","review":"Pros: Excellent value, very good picture and sound, features, connections, touch-panel screenCons: No memory card, average still picture quality, no analog inputsThis is my first mini dv camcorder and I am satisfied with it. Many reviews talked about the graininess of low light, but I can say it's really good. The nightshot is abit awkward coz the color goes unnatural, but generally the video quality is good. It's not really a good advice to take those internet footage as means to judge the camcorder because the quality deterioates when it gets to computer. But it'd be fine on tv. Overall, it's value for a camcorder under a grand. Touhscreen display completely ends this one to the head of the class! Just a solid little digital cam with dedicated features in a noce package. Clearly the best of the bunch. A must try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teflon wiper blade","review":"The Trico Teflon wiper blades have worked flawlessly and have kept my windshield clean and clear in all types of weather."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Quality","review":"I was not impressed with these wipers at all!!!

If she would have only recieved this one, I think it would be used more. One of her ponies sings while she rides it so of course that's her favorite. The only bad thing about this one is she learned almost right away that she can stand on the seat and rock it. It's really low to the ground. I can't leave it in her room unless I'm in there because I don't want her to climb on it and knock a tooth out! But, she does like it. When I bring it out, she keeps saying \\"puppy, puppy!\\" and climbs on by herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"Yes, this toy is very affordable BUT you might break a finger trying to hammer the pieces on.

It is very beautifully done.This is actually the second time I have purchased this - I bought the VHS years ago for my kids and now my grandkids have watched it so much it was just worn out!!

Or b) be played a little quieter where it chills me right out, seems to suck all the stress out. I adore falling asleep to it, I look forward to it. This is my first and only noise cd, and it won't be my last. I have been introduced to many styles and noise has to be one of my favourites. I personally do not think Merzbow as 'music' but of just sounds, but brilliantly presented.

After about 6 minutes of grating noise I switched tracks thinking that the next track would be better, man was I dead wrong. The WHOLE album was just ... annoying noise, with no trace of musicality whatsoever. I listen to A.C., Regurgitate, Libido Airbag and all that nice grindcore that makes your head hurt but this was just sad. Grindcore and noise are two different things but I mean c'mon.

I took four of the six tests in the book and scored in the 50-60th percentile each time. This surprised me since I have quite a good background in English lit. So I set to work cramming all kinds of obscure authors and literary terms. Then I got the official practice book from the ETS, and surprise! It contained a very different practice test, with much more contemporary questions on literary theory, non-canonical writers, etc. I sat down and took that practice test and scored in the 99th percentile!

Instead, the reader gets six exams that inaccurately reflect the questions most likely to appear on the test. Read the McMullen book or the ETS book for a better reflection of what the actual test will look like. The reading list, for all its prodigious length (seven pages) actually seems inadequate for reviewing for the test.I did, however, find the explanations for each question in the book useful and if nothing else, the book provides a wealth of questions and answers on English, American, and World Literature to supplement your study elsewhere.

While EMI may have done a little bit of digital remastering I doubt they used the original master tapes because this reissue only sounds slightly better than the old RCA version. The sound level is still very low, the highs are harsh and the bass is very weak.Even the CD itself still has a date on it of 1984, and the CD is still made the way they were in the early days - no silkscreen top coat, just plain laquer (CD's are more susceptable to scratching this way).The song Swept Away is one of my favorites by Ross and of that style of dance music from the early 80's.

All of You with Julio Iglesias was a beautiful ballard that fell short of the success of Endless Love. Swept Away was a powerful track that demonstrated that Ross could keep up with the other divas of the era like Chaka Khan, Evelyn King and Donna Summers. Diana's vocal performance was both passive and powerful and showed sex appeal and strength. Missing You was Ross' last hit and number 1 R&B ballad yet it struggled to maintain the number ten spot on the pop charts a sign that this was the beginning of the end.

Not to say that Beat THe bastards is a terrible record(there are some good songs on it) but it doesn't measure up to the old stuff.

You may not like the \\"bean-bag\\" mount that it uses, but it's currently the best option available, unless Garmin makes a similar mount designed to clip to a vent or somewhere else more permanent.

I ended up reading the whole thing hoping I would find some helpful things in it that would really stand out, but it was just kind of one of those reviews of things you kind of already know. Like, sleep is important and good-type stuff. The main disappointment I had was that, although common ailments for certain decades of life are presented, there wasn't much preventative health information and the author seems pretty supportive of modern medicine.

That being said, these are the first noise cancelling headphones I've ever really experimented with, and they're pretty good at that, with the amp turned on.

First and Foremost, he summarizes the history of the Iranian monarchy (2,500 years) and the Pahlavi dynasty (50 of those years). The Shah for all his good and bad are detailed here. The assessment of the Shah is fair. He made mistakes and deposited a fortune in his bank account. He also modernized Iran. Of note here, Ayatollah Khomeini rose in revolt when the Shah took over the hugh church estates and gave women the vote in 1963. Forbis takes a look at all aspects of society (religion, women, education, military, agriculture, industrialization) and tells us why the Shah fell. The aftermath is a society that is regressive and still suffers dictatorial rule (by mullahs rather than a Shah).This is an older book, so for current information you need to go elsewhere. However, this is good book to read to discover Iranian society at the time of the Shah."},{"rating":"2","title":"I learned a lot!","review":"For my birthday my mom got me this video and I watch it every week because it does an awesome job teaching a new player like myself the right way to do stuff.

I use it with a moisturizer, light concealer cream, sponge on the spray base, and then a mineral powder dusted on top. My skin looks so smooth and the product wears for a long time before needing reapplication. My skin tends to be on the sensitive side so I tend to buy products and throw them out in frustration.

Even if you can understand what the vocalist is saying, you will find that the lyrics are pointless and unredeeming. The message is the same as every other typical death metal/black metal/ grindcore band. MorticiaN pretty much doesn't know about anything beyond zombies and fun things to do with rotting corpes. The vocals are nothing more than growls. The vocalist could be reading (assuming he can read) today's t.v. schedule and you wouldn't know the difference. The only way you can tell he is attempting to mutter words is that there are pauses in the growling. The music itself is very simple and unadorned. It is difficult to pick apart the different instruments, and if you can do that, it is difficult to make sense of what each instrument is doing. On a positive note...wait, nevermind. If you are excited by gore, blood, carnarge, and slaughter, this album is definitely for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brutal F'n album!","review":"This is definitely Mortician's best album. Mortician is incredibly brutal and they are very creative in that they use drum machines and horror movie samples. The best song on this is of course \\"House by the Cemetary\\" which is also the best Mortician song ever. Mortician is my 2nd favorite death metal band behind Obituary. The bottom line is if you consider yourself a metalhead, of any kinds, you have to buy this or you might as well start considering yourself a poseur."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sticks and re-sticks","review":"How much can really be said about them.

Doesn't fall off. Doesn't leave marks.","review":"Like all of the Avery products that I have used for my business, I am very satisfied with these removable name tags. The paper is good quality and holds ink jet printer ink well (no smearing or rub off). The stickiness of the name tags is strong enough to hold them securely to a shirt all day long. I have tested these name tags for a 2-day weekend period (removing the name tag at the end of the 1st day) and they hold up great. I recommend these name tags and am confident in all Avery products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy To Use Name Badges","review":"I used the Avery White Adhesive Name Badges for our last meeting. The names were printed on an Ink Jet printer and the printing worked well. I tried both the WORD and Print Shop 23 software for printing and they both worked equally well.The outside of the package indicates these labels can be printed on either an ink jet printer or laser. The quality of the paper is excellant. The labels can be removed form the backing very easily. I took precautions on the kind of garments the label should not be adhered to. These are listed on the reverse side of the packageing. This is another quality Avery product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice upgrade from the usual name stickers","review":"First things first: my only complaint about these badges/stickers is that they are *huge*. I understand this is so that a company or a person could print them out with more than just a name (such as the company logo above the name) but as I used them for a social get together they were just...too big.I also wrote on them with a Sharpie rather than printing. The ink dried quickly; there was no bleeding/smudging.The material is definitely more flexible than the old-school name stickers that were more of a paper substance rather than the sort of rubber/plastic/paper combo that these badges are made of.It's also nice that you can either peel the sticker directly off the sheet or punch it out with the back still attached. Great for when people want to write up their own name badge on the spot."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Package A Lemon?","review":"I bought these before and they were great! This time they were awful as the badges did not separate. I had to cut everyone with a scissor to get them apart. I don't know if they changed the product or if I just got a lemon of a package."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ingenious, very good design. Not recyclable though.","review":"These badges have two innovative benefits: (1) they are a flexible rubbery/plastic material rather than paper, which makes them less likely to fall off clothes; (2) they have a really clever design which lets you more easily separate the badges (for handing out or leaving at a registration desk) without removing them from their peel-off paper backing.However, the material does not appear to be recyclable, so it will make a poor impression on your more eco-conscious guests, even though in reality it's probably just 1 gram of plastic.Full disclosure: I was given the product for free in exchange for agreeing to review it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome.","review":"The ability to peel these off and hand them out is very professional.

But I don't understand how the heroine starts the book off saying that shes just been landed with the best luck ever compared to her peers--she gets to have guilt-free liasons and open a business of her own and basically make a new life for herself unlike other gentile women who must play the marriage game. Then the rest of the book she can't think, whine, sob or get over the fact that her employer/lover Arthur won't be marrying her! I get that she doesn't want to be parted from him, but does marriage have to be the end all be all?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspiring tripe","review":"This is my second attempt to endure Amanda Quick/Jayne Ann Krentz (see my other review about Wildest Hearts). To be truthful, I purchased this title during a layover in a New England airport, an act of unfettered desperation on my part. I've owned this pile of you-can-figure-it-out for three weeks and I haven't finished reading it. I can't--it's that much of a lullaby. I'm guessing Amanda Quick was equally bored when she penned it, and frankly, for it to have made it to the shelves at the bookstore, someone at her publisher's was asleep at the wheel--no doubt the result of having read this book as well. Do yourself a favor if you need something compelling to read--DON'T patronize any other book with the names Amanda Quick or Jayne Ann Krentz on the cover.

I was instantly connected to Elenora; \\"Miss Lodge\\", and really did like the Earl of St. Merryn. They were both tough and attractive in their own right and the chemistry was off the charts... then Lord St. Merryn opened his mouth. I am still clueless on what the author was thinking as she brainstormed this character and his storyline. Not once in all the years I've been seriously reading historical romances have I came across a \\"Lord\\" so...dumb? He was supposed to be brilliant, but as his secret mystery plays out it's Elenora who actually solves everything. I don't know, like I said the novel started out at a 5 Star and all of a sudden it changed, and I was fairly disappointed. Amanda Quick didn't give Elenora the knight and shining armor she deserved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Read","review":"The mystery part of this novel was rather interesting, though the science seemed a little incongruous with the era. The lost river concept was quite intriguing, though I think it could have been put to better use than as a site for the \\"death ray\\" machine, which struck me as improbable for Regency England.That said, the book is well written and the characters are well drawn. A little more dramatic tension would have been nice, but this is still an enjoyable book.

You get to go to fancy parties, get beautiful dresses and jewelry, have the chance to fall in love and have a few romantic moments, and can join him in a mystery that can prove deadly. That is exactly what Elenora Lodge gets when she is asked to be the Earl's companion. He feels safe as she appears so ordinary. But put the lady into fancy clothes and get her hair done up right can make even the strongest of men weak. Now, the relationship is not so safe anymore.This is a great read that I couldn't put it down.

This has a basic, reliable design with a lip all around to keep things from sliding off or dripping off the edges. Most of all, though, it is sturdy. I have a Chicago Metallic cookie sheet that I thought was sturdy, but has warped from high oven temperature. It now has a little dip in the middle.

I had heard that their early stuff was as good or even better than the material released on the Mercury Label, i'm not sure that i'd agree with that comment, but this album does feature many solid songs including 3 live ones. Also, they seemed to have a bit more energy & faster riffs, largely due to Uli Roth, who is wicked at guitar! I would definately recommend this album, not just to the die-hard Scorps fan, but to any rock fan!I don't think it's necessary to buy all of their RCA albums, as long as you buy this and their first Best Of album. Some of the better songs on this Best of Vol. 2 are: \\"Speedy's Coming\\" (Live), \\"They Need A Million\\", \\"Longing For Fire\\", \\"Top Of The Bill\\", \\"Catch Your Train\\", \\"Sun In My Hand\\", \\"Crying Days\\", & \\"We'll Burn The Sky\\" (Live)"},{"rating":"2","title":"SCORPIONS DO IT AGAIN","review":"THIS ONE GAVE FIRST TIME AMERICAN FANS A CHANCE TO HEAR WHAT EARLY SCORPIONS WERE ALL ABOUT.

Dave Fleisher, who also did a series of renowned Superman cartoons, does a great job with the background art, and the animation here is smooth as with the Superman cartoons, giving the competition a run for their money. The story is about a group of insects in the big city who must find a new home due to the progress of people. Some of the cartoon insect characters are cute, and some parts very funny, but what stands out the most is the art and animation, making this a must for students of animation or film art. It's not much different from the modern animated features like A Bug's Life, Antz, etc., but they did this one all by hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glorious Family Entertainment!","review":"As delightful and charming an adventure for kids and adults alike as you will find!

I wanted the Superman one but after reading the reviews of it decided on this because it will read individual words and is more on his level (just 6 and starting 1st grade in the fall).

However, I just felt that Judith and Renie weren't their usual selves. Renie was not nearly as fiesty as usual and her slobbering over Rover at one point is unbelievable if you remember in September Morn that she \\"hates\\" dogs!! As for Judith, this was the only time I found her to be insensitive, pushy, and irritating.

The count's reaction to non virgin blood (in repeat scenes) has to be among the grossest scenes in film, next to the end of Pink Flamingos. Other than that, the movie wanders, the dialogue is dull, the political conflicts unnecesary (remember this was the 70's) and parts of it are closer to soft core porn or badly acted costume drama than horror.

The most memorable scene was when the count's assistant was socializing with the locals in a tavern over a friendly game of \\"do exactly what I do\\" ? Ok then.

It does make ice and I like the shape and sizes but the ice is soft and doesn't hold up very well in a less than very cold drink. My main complaint is that the ice begins to melt as soon as it drops from the freezing posts and makes for rather wet ice.

That said, this book is among the best that can help get you started because the prompts and guides often mimic what goes through the heads of writers while they write. But if you don't have some magical thinking apparatus that is telling you you're going to be a great writer from studying books on writing, you can get quite a bit from this book in learning how to think like many writers and a guide on how to practice writing.

I was impressed with the fact that a rock band was combining political and spiritual lyrics, at a time when the J. Geils Band and Billy Joel seemed to be the rule. Spiritual? Yes, despite Paul Kantner's continuing hostility, Jeanette and Pete Sears were actually using Christian undertones (overtones, too), in their songs, such as in \\"Save Your Love\\", on Modern Times, where Jesus is almost directly quoted. I've heard Mr. Sears deny these were Christian songs, but they clearly had spiritual or religious content. And, the band's longtime political activism continued. Freedom at Point Zero contains some of both. It's a good album, despite what the critics said, and it holds up well today. For those Kantner fans, his presence is fairly heavy here.

After a while, our position was re-established and the turn by turn instructions were very accurate.We found that whenever we deliberately took another route, the NAVMAN could quickly re-establish our position and guide us to the chosen destination.The touch screen is easy to work with and most of the menus are intuitive.

Entered our home address 3 times and each time after powering off and back on the Navman changed our address number and added E before our street. There is no E for our loop. It didn't seem to be as accurate as the Garmin, the Navman said we arrived at our destination 3 houses before our home. A bigger concern was that the Navman told us to turn left from a main highway to a street that leads to our house which is not allowed.

After a couple discussions with Navman support I was informed they will not be releasing a connectivity kit in the US. I am returning the unit immediately.

I told them that the sticker is going to peel off and and stuck inside the unit thus making the SD slot usless and they said too bad since it is curently working.

A black ink cartoon with spare use of watercolor and crayon to highlight the main characters and events, this easy to read book guides the reader through a semi-textured adventure through the forest. This book includes a more complex and larger controlled vocabulary than that found in Dr. Seuss books. In Dr. Seuss' Shape of Me and Other Stuff, he uses black ink to draw the reader's attention to the main characters; a few primary colors comprise the background and highlight the poetic verse characteristic of Dr. Seuss.

If one needs to look up information, they cannot be sure which section of the book to read. The flow of concepts is erratic, at best.

In the game you are an CSI intern watched over by one of the CSI cast members for each of the five missions. The cast member is just there for hints, and very, very basic ones at that. There is no interaction with them. You just go to a site, collect clues with the tools (some tools used only once in all the missions) and see where they lead you. When at a site, there are a limited number of clues, so you can either hunt for them, or drag you pointer across the screen until it turns green.

I like the shorter scale and wanted a less expensive guitar to haul around. I thought this was a great deal - an American made Gibson for $500. But the build quality is so poor I'm considering a return. The fret edges are sharp, and the pickups aren't even installed properly. They're wrapped in shoddy electrical tape and just kind of stuck in there. They move around a lot. It sounds OK, but the pickup selector seems very cheap too, and I'm worried it won't last. I don't mind the cosmetics much - stripped down to bare bones. But it looks like it's just thrown together with absolutely no concern for quality. It's the poorest assembly I've seen on any guitar at any price - except maybe those $100 kits you see in music stores. Not recommended. Try an Epiphone maybe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away!!!","review":"This is just a stick of wood with strings on it.

They're thick and meaty. They look delicious. However, the newer, more mass produced guitars are having a lot of issues with necks that don't necessarily warp when considering them from a body to tuning pegs perspective. Where you really have to be careful is the neck running parallel to the frets. The never wood's shape is rarely perfectly uniform. Gibson suffers from this affliction as well. Also, after my purchase of this SG, I replaced the humbuckers with Lindy Fralin high output humbuckers. It went from a basic model Honda, to a top of the line Lexus. While you can't argue with any SG's base sound, the Fralins are the deal. I've already had people comment on how good the guitar sounds in comparison to my other SG."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smokin' Gibson Sound!","review":"Gibson SG's have a fat crunchy sound all of their own, and this vintage styled guitar is no exception.

One of the best gig axes ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good when working.","review":"Purchased this at Home Depot. After the first year of use in my basement, the unit started icing up. After an hour the evaperator will be covered in ice. I then took the unit to the authorized Maytag repair center here in Dartmouth MA. The technician stated that the unit was fine and did not ice up for them. I then brought the unit home, ran it for a day and brought it back, (very heavy with ice), fully iced over. They then ran it the next day and stated that it will not ice up for them. I called Maytag but they were of no help. Repair center does not want it back since they can not figure out the problem and hint that it may be normal. According to my manual, this model will sense icing and disable the compressor and default to high blower speed to clear the ice. I guess thats what does not work on mine and I guess it can not be repaired. So much for the 5 year warranty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy and Beautiful!","review":"Beautiful plate; nice enough to be worth the price tag :p It's incredibly heavy/hefty, but it's nice.

The others look like they may be the size I expected to RECEIVE, after a full season of growth - if I can kill off the moss that is choking them.Maybe I just don't know how mail-order plants usually arrive, but I will never go back to this vendor (Hirts) again.

Not to understate the importance of their ultimate crossover \\"Break Out\\" but this album proved they could remake themselves into contemporary hit makers. Every one of course knows \\"He's So Shy\\", the top five pop hit, but \\"Could I Be Dreaming\\" (which could have just as easily found its way on Michael Jackson's \\"Off The Wall\\" LP), \\"Save This Night For Love\\", \\"The Love To Good To Last\\" and \\"We've Got The Power\\" are all just as solid. I used to play the whole lp all the time when I was a whole lot younger. This is one terrific album and a must for any Pointer Sisters fan or anyone who enjoys really good 80s R&B."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally on CD, but bonus track is a \\"rip\\" off","review":"I am so glad that Special Things has finally been released on CD, the original album cuts sound great, and I am glad to have the songs that have never been released on CD.The one downfall about this is the fact that \\"Movin' On\\", the bonus track and the B side to He's So Shy\\" was nothing less than taken from vinyl. You can hear some pops and cracks in the song, which to me, if you are going to put a bonus track on a CD, you should at least get it from the original masters. This is by no means, is a \\"bonus\\" to fans, other than it appears on the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like detective stories...","review":"Normally, the main selling point of this movie would be an outstanding cast that includes none other than the likes of Paul Newman and Gene Hackman. However, in the case of this film, that factor is trumped by Reese Witherspoon waltzing around topless.While I have never been a huge fan of detective stories, this one was fairly entertaining. The narration is much like the famous ones from the 1940s / 1950s era.This was the first time I've seen James Garner surface in quite awhile. While he is pretty-much a one dimensional actor, he still possesses a decent screen-presence and keeps up with Newman and Hackman nicely.For those viewers who would be more interested in Witherspoon, this movie is a can't miss. To my knowledge, this is the only nude scene she has ever done. It also happens within the first 5 minutes of the film, so you don't have to wait too long in anticipation."},{"rating":"2","title":"An All-Star Cast, a Good Story","review":"I was in the mood for an old-school style murder/detective flick, and plugged this one in. 60 seconds into the film I get hit with a MAJOR \\"double\\" topless scene starring Reese Witherspoon (10 years younger). Gratuitous? Anyway, after re-gathering and re-trenching from that, I did indeed settle down into a Humphrey Bogartesque murder mystery.Maybe the most significant mark of this film is the very heavy-duty cast . . . Paul Newman (aged like fine wine), Gene Hackman (the BEST), Susan Sarandon (hate her politics but enjoy her work, and again, a gratuitous look at her backside), James Garner (fortunately, no skin shots here), Reese Witherspoon (all of her), Stockard Channing (I don't care for her, personally, but she is a NAME).A good whodunnit tale. Fading starlets, ex-cop private eyes, slithering opportunists, the always pleasant L.A. vista as seen from Mulholland Drive. Enjoy. Adults only please (nudity, language, shooting/beating violence)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Film noir for the everyman and woman","review":"Back in Feb '08 I found out about this movie because I was in a Paul Newman phase of movie watching. It turns out that two of my other favorite movie stars James Garner and Gene Hackman were also in it, so I purchased it. I don't know what the reviewers of the day back in 1998 were thinking but I think that they were not thinking right when they dissed this movie. This movie deserves to be watched and is a \\"fun\\" movie as well as an intelligent one. Susan Sarandon shines in this movie and Reese Witherspoon is a hottie in her first adult role and Stockard Channing is delightful in a small role. It all has an excellent cast of character actors and actresses and should be viewed by the readers here at Amazon. RIP MR.Newman"},{"rating":"2","title":"So old it's new","review":"This is by no way a great, exiting movie. What it is , is a slow, effective, moody, character study that is so old fashioned that its refreshing. If the general public is not interested in this film, then those interested in the noir genre will be. But most of all it is a pleasure to see Newman at the top of his form."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good movie","review":"Twilight is a very good who done it.

I was excited to see Reese Witherspoon, I thought she might make a tasty vampire treat, but after walking around naked she pretty much vanished. Next time, fewer old people and more vampires and werewolves please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Literate and intelligent","review":"Twilight is basically a tribute to Ross MacDonald, with Newman playing an older version of the world weary private eye he portrayed in The Drowning Pool. But the script is literate and intelligent, the direction is laudably straightforward, and the cast -- Newman, Gene Hackman, Susan Sarandon, James Garner, Stockard Channing, Liev Schrieber -- is to die for.Despite the star power on display, Garner steals the movie with a wonderfully understated performance. His last scene with Newman is heart-breaking, and Garner brings to it a dignity that matches Newman's own.Not the most action-packed thriller of the last few years, but one of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"\\"Come Morning\\" is the first book that I have read by Pat Warren and I can't wait to read another.

This is the first and only book that offers a complete how-to guide for the ancient practice of divination and magic. It's not a New Age smo0ke and mirrors book..... the spells and divination information is taken directly from ancient scriptures. The text is footnoted. The author did her research and condensed the information in an easy-to-read how-to guide.

For instance when you turn the page from pp247 in the book of Deuteronomy the back side (what should be pp248) is blank, and then the next page is labeled page 247 and it is a page out of the book of Philippians chapter one. Then you turn the page and on the back of the Philippians page it goes back to Deuteronomy. this also happens in the book of Joshua where a page from James is inserted. This is just what Ive seen so far, but its hard to take a translation seriously when they can't even bother printing and binding it correctly. That being said, a restored name bible is of great benefit, perhaps this isnt the one to get though if correct page orders are important to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Notebook RAM","review":"Upgraded from factory 256 mb to two sticks of this 256 mb ram.

She also told me that it was an allagory (or however you spell that), and so I figured it would begin to bore me after the first few chapters. It was opposite everything I expected it to be. Arena is a fabulous read, with tantalizing twists and turns in the plots, keeping you glued to its pages. I can't wait to read the other books by Mrs. Hancock.

Now I know that's asking for trouble because only the author can tell you what he/she is trying to convey...but things were just confusing.

Karen Hancock was willing to do something very different from mainstream Christian fiction and I for one appreciate that. I would recommend this book to fans of allegorical science fiction in general, whether or not they were practicing Christians. It's also a great book for female lovers of sci-fi, since there is a female protagonist that has to go through a lot of personal growth through her testing in the Arena."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreck!","review":"Why this atrocious album is still in print escapes all logic!

I tried it on our front door which is bigger but not huge. Even though it was far from being toward it's max size it just wouldn't stay up. I like that it is short enough for 7 year old to step over.

With a smaller dog, maybe it could work but even when placed in the door frame, I was expecting a gust of wind to blow it down. Taking it out of the package, I just knew it was not going to work as I wanted it too as the gate felt so cheap, so wobbly.

This gate has very limited ability to adjust at the pressure points and I was unable to get it to fit in the space that I needed. I then tried the gate in our kitchen doorway thinking I would keep it if it fit there. Again this gate would not fit in any of the positions available for what I consider to be a pretty standard doorway size. On top of the inability to get this gate to fit it's kind of cheap looking and the wood frame doesn't seem very sturdy.

The author goes so far as to try to explain in detail how all these things work. For example, the soul is explained to be residing in a cavity near the heart. It explains that the soul passes messages back and forth from the brain via the central nervous system.

The viewfinder is basically useless, so just aim the camera as best you can and experiment. Every time you have prints made, it's a surprise. Even the most mundane objects can look really artsy with the Pop 9's format.Can you take 9 shots with a regular camera or layout a nine-frame, repeating image in Photoshop? Sure.

The jacket had NOTHing whatsoever to do with the plot and as one of the other reviewers mentioned, there was no tension between the characters. Furthermore, the \\"issue\\" was completely fabricated in the heroine's mind, which granted it always is, but in this case not even I could rationalise it. The hero sounded like he might be dashing, but wasn't drawn as such--there were past indescretions hinted at, but nothing shown to make him swoon-worthy.

I can't get enough of Pratt's writing. The previous critics are definitely correct, the jacket discription has nothing to do with the story.

The word pictures Ms Pratt creates are beautiful in their simplicity. \\"Kenton didn't imagine he'd ever seen her before. Yet some memory nagged at the back of his mind.

All the lights work, it tells the time and the radio works. You can set a wake-up time, but the alarm will not trigger in radio mode or buzzer mode. I believe the lower slider switch is bad. The switch became difficult to use a couple of months back and was always kind of a pain to use even when new. I liked the large display on this clock, but the alarm reset button was not easy to find. I thought of gluing something to the reset button to make it easier to find, but I never did. I have just ordered a new Seiko clock that is a much simpler design. The new one is cordless, no radio, no volume, and a simple switch to turn on the alarm. I was always accidentally changing the volume on this Sony, or tuning to a frequency that had no signal, or changing the dimmer. Anything can happen when you are trying to find that reset button! Those issues will not happen with the Seiko."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Clock Radio","review":"Good sound from radio. Gets most of the stations our higher priced stereo gets.

The alarm buzz could wake the dead, and if you hit the radio button, it is just loud static. THIS IS THE BEST ALARM CLOCK EVER. I have a hard time getting up some times, this does the trick. If you are the same way in the morning, this'll get you out of bed and on the go!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great brightness control !","review":"Finally I have found a digital clock that has a full range of variable brightness levels. A dial allows you to change continuously from bright to invisible. MUCH better than the typical High/Low switch. But, the level we find comfortable at night makes the clock virtually unreadable during the day, unless you want to fiddle with the control every day. Have not tried other features, but it seems to have all the goodies you would want."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect","review":"I bought this so I could see the large numbers without my glasses on. It is very good for that. There are only two things that ought to be improved upon. First, there is no easy way to see what time the alarm is set for-- you have to slide a switch over one notch- and one notch only- to see this. This movement is hard with the lights on and almost impossible with the lights off. If you push the switch hard enough to move it, it wants to go more than one notch. This function should be done via a push button like on other alarm clocks. The other issue is similar-- you have to slide a different switch one notch only to activate the alarm mode. This would be OK if the switch had only two positions, but it has several, again making the one stop slide difficult. Other than these two small issues, this alarm clock radio if perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad unit","review":"The one we got is junk.

I just wish the clocks worked correctly. If the THIRD round does not work I want my money refunded to my credit card. I had to pay for return shipping once, the third round is on SONY.

Pressing on the clock stops the sound until I release pressure. As far as I can tell, the sound is from the battery cover rattling, but something else internal is causing the vibrations. The rattle is not loud, but it keeps me up at times. Besides this, parts of the display seem to be going out and it doesn't keep good time.I am very disappointed. I can't seem to find a quality alarm clock with the basic features. I don't need/want a radio, or a self setting time (which typically gets time changes incorrect), or a CD player, or laser displays...I just need a simple plug in alarm clock with battery backup that doesn't buzz or die within a couple months...anyone listening?"},{"rating":"1","title":"junk","review":"This would be a good versatile clock radio if it had an accurate clock. Amazon exchanged the first unit they sent me because the clock was 6 min fast in one month. The second unit they sent me was only 4 min fast after one month, but still totally unacceptable. Amazon does not want to exchange this second unit because it is over 30 days after purchase. Sony has a similar policy. The moral of the story: Do not buy a Sony and do not buy from Amazon unless you don't mind being stuck with a clock that you have to reset every couple of weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Clock/Radio for the money!","review":"I don't know what others are complaining about? How much do you really expect for your money? This is a great alarm clock - several different alarms you can set AND my favorite - it has a button for going backwards when you are setting the alarm or time.The numbers are big and easy to read and you can adjust the brightness.If you need something to make your coffee in the morning, souind like a Bose radio and nudge you - this isn't it.

OK, it became part of our routine to set the clock back a few minutes everyday to compensate for it speeding ahead. But then it developed an annoying habit of issuing a short burst of the alarm at odd hours of the night. Both clocks are now in the trash.... what a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Sony","review":"A recently purchased Sony ICF-C492 is an eye-catching, highly visible at extreme light range; invisible at lowest range, clock radio.

Reading a few of these Amazon reviews I see a few people have had the gaining of time problem. Sony told us to unplug the units for 30 minutes and that would \\"reboot\\" them. Didn't work.

I'm one of those people who likes it really dark when I sleep, and the clock I had before this was way too bright for me. This one becomes very dim, but still readable. I also like the large numbers.

Halfway through the show, a friend nudges me and says I feel guilty for only paying $22 to see this.I've seen Marcia Ball at Slim's in San Francisco and at the New Orleans Jazz festival in 2001. In New Orleans she did a stunning version of Louisiana 1927. She performs it here as well and it rivals Aaron Neville's version. She has a great voice and the sax solo is tremendous. This track alone would justify the CD's price.If you don't own any of her albums, this would be a good place to start.

Then that the dust cover has NYT reviews congratulating the book.SPOLIER ALERT:Summarizing the book: The Rangers were bad. They were loud, nasty and liked to drink hard liquor. They did not read the Miranda warning to their enemies. And they even dare to use guns. Oh My God! What were those Texans thinking?The book spends most of the time trying to paint the Texas Rangers in the worst possible light while trying to \\"remain above the fray.\\" It fails miserably.Do yourself a favor and buy instead \\"Taming the Nueces Strip: The Story of McNelly's Rangers.\\" It only encompasses a short time within the Ranger lore, but it has warts and all, not a New York Wine and Cheese attitude about rednecks. The author should resign his Texan birthright and move to Manhattan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Balanced and interesting account of the real Rangers","review":"Robinson captures all the important characters and events in this short, easy-to-read, well balanced book of the Texas Rangers. The book is actually a series of short stories about the most notorious and memorable men who made the Texas Rangers legendary not only for their fortitude and bravery, but also for their ruthlessness and sometimes lawlessness. The book is very objective and does not attempt to portray the Rangers as gods. Nevertheless, the Rangers were a unique band of men who often sacrificed their lives to protect the ordinary citizen living in remote areas of Texas. The real Texas Rangers and their actual accomplishments are far more amazing than the myth that continues to surround these extraordinary men to this day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative, Gripping, Graphic, True","review":"Fastidiously researched, well-documented, and equally well-written, this book is probably the final word, not only on the Texas Rangers, but on certain epochs of Texas history. This is the book that we\`ve been waiting for - the kind that evokes the human side of the Rangers without destroying their larger-than-life reputation, and one that makes them live up to their sins without minimizing their heroism. This combines equal parts fact and testosterone to make for a satisfying read that, although it does drag occasionally, quite makes up for it with a steady stream of colorful events and individuals on every page.- Benjamin Gene Gardner"},{"rating":"2","title":"A new Texas history","review":"The Texas Rangers are one of the most controversial forces in United States history. Charles Robinson does an excellent job of recounting their history. The rangers were founded after independence with an idea to police the state and provide border security. Their role would change throughout time and come to a peak during the Mexican Revolution. They would fight in the Mexican American war where they would particularly abuse the Mexican populations earning them a bad reputation with US forces. Despite their brutality they were among the best soldiers trained in scouting and commando tactics that US forces lacked. They were an early special forces that earned their reputation during the war. Their story of development is expertly recounted here. For those looking for an intro to Texas history this is a great place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun to read.","review":"I agree with all of the other positives that have been written about this book. Not only does the book provide a complete history of the Rangers, it does so with spurs jingling and guns loose in the holster.

This book goes beyond the typical etymology by providing the Story behind each of the selected words. Though the scholarship on the etymology of the word is not thorough (no roots, little in the way of derivation, no Indo-European development) the writing is clear, witty and conversational.

I got my evo in today, and the thing is dark rough brown paint. not the pretty natural that was in the picture at the time. the guitar had been shipped in one box with no padding, just the dean box. there was a pretty good dent at the base of the body where some paint had come off. my fingernail took off more chips. My pick took off a big swipe. I'm pretty sure i could strip all of the crappy paint job off the guitar with my guitar pick in about 10-15 minutes, and re finish it with something else. The sound from the guitar is way muddier than all my other guitars. The neck isn't thin, it's fat. The neck is also warped. There's a big dip on the EAD side, while it's flat on the GBE side. I can't get the strings very low. If I had spent $100 on this, it would go back right away, but as it is, I'll just sort of feel ripped off at about $60."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price,good quality,nice sound.","review":"I bought this guitar for $60 or so....I am by far not a guitar player, but I do have an Epiphone,a Gibson, an Ibanez, a Hofner, and a B.C.Rich.

It may have been great sounding but we couldn't get past the very ugly finish and we sent it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has a lot of problems","review":"This guitar has a lot of problems. First it wouldn't stay in tune then we found that the tuning knobs had tightening screws. This helped some but then when I played different chords one or two strings would be out of tune but the open string sounded fine. The adjustments on the bridge were not adjusted properly. I am very unhappy with this guitar and would like another one but I don't want to go without a guitar as I need one to play for this band that I am a member of. I know it is more than 30 days since I got this guitar but the guys I play with have been trying to get it adjusted and basically I have a $100 piece of crap guitar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Purely for beginners only","review":"On the plus side, this guitar is inexpensive. On the minus side, the pickups are very noisy, the tuners are loose and don't hold tuning, and the body construction is such that if you put any weight on the body while holding the neck, the tuning goes sharp.If you're short/small and always play sitting down, this might be an OK value. For anyone else, avoid it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guy giving it 1 is plain wrong","review":"One of THE classic metal albums of the late 90s(there were a lot of good ones but but not many classics) and destined to be forgotten due to the time it came out (when metal was even more uncool than usual).I'm not usually so passionate that I can call another person's opinion straight out incorrect but the clown who gave this one star is so far wrong I just had to comment.The concept is puerile unless you have ever got into the whole zombie flick thing but the music is immense. There are not many albums this long (67 minutes) that can engage the listener a)initially or b)over 10 years which is how long I've had it - not in any genre- just look in your local second hand shop to see my point.Giving this album 1 star is like saying Iron Maiden never added anything to the metal genre.

Sometimes humorous, sometimes starkly sobering, but always approachable, Riverbend's \\"Baghdad Burning\\" is destined to take its rightful place among the beloved classics of English literature and journalism. This chronicle of what really happened and continues to happen with America's well intended invasion of Iraq will be a case study for generations. Truthful reporting always brings detractors with vested interests, some of them venomous.

If Riverbend isn't legit, I will eat my metaphorical hat. Of course, given that she's hinted that she lives in the University district of baghdad, it's almost certain that one or both of her parents were high ranking government officials, so her perceptions have obviously been influenced by the loss of her family's position of power.

Like many of the Iraqi bloggers the best part is the honesty that comes across in her writing. Her descriptions of the killings, bombings and other hardships endured by the previously privileged residents of Baghdad were griping.Unfortunately as time passes Riverbend becomes overly cynical and starts sounding like a western journalist covering the story. When she decided, along with most Sunni, not to vote in January 30th, 2005 election, it becomes clear political ranting is all that's left of the once semi-objective \\"Girl Blog from Iraq.\\"For a balanced view of the situation in Iraq, including blogs like IraqTheModel and HealingIraq is a must."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clearly written by an American, NOT Iraqi","review":"I have been to Iraq (recently)and e-mail daily with many Iraqis. This blog was NOT written by a genuine Iraqi girl. My suspicion is that it was written by someone from the US who is/was over there. There is a cadence in the writing of Arabs writing English that this blog totally lacks. Her opinion are those of what an American (probably living in the Green Zone) thinks Iraqi girls should write. I have never heard any young Iraqi woman (and I know several) who know so little about Iraqi history, Arab culture, Islam etc. Her vocabulary choices are completely wrong for a non-native speaker. I do humanitarian work in Iraq and I agree with many of her sentiments (I hate Bush, the war etc), but I still think this is not what it claims to be.

It totally lacked the \\"ring of truth\\" to it. The writing was very American and seemed out of touch with Iraqi or Islamic culture and way of thinking. I have had Iraqi friends since college, and their viewpoint and way of expressing themselves is distinctive, unique to their culture and gepgraphy. But Baghdad Burning seemed totally North American in comparison to the Iraqi way I have come to know and love. It also doesn't seem like a very convincing female viewpoint.

The book never had a chance to get boring because the stories were constantly changing. There were many things I found out about in this book that I never knew about at all.

This book mostly covers naval history, and in this being an underreported part of the war make for good and different reading. You should be warned however, as most of the information included in this book is from first hand accounts, the accuracy is sometimes sketchy.

This book joins my collection of other works by Froud; Faeries, Lady Cottington's Pressed Fairy Book. One question that I have to ask is, why hasn't Alan Lee done some more recent works in the faery range? I simply love this book, as the faeries are depicted with no superficiality, or rosy-cheeked innocence, and the information is invaluable. Good Faeries/Bad Faeries, gives us a priceless insight to the world of faery, which is nearer than we thought. It has helped me acknowledge the faery presence in our everyday lives, and although unhappily as yet they remain invisible to me, I can see them in my minds eye; beautiful, grotesque, good, evil, large and small, and in this book. This is one of the many books I will treasure forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite what I expected","review":"I was looking for informative and folkloric style but this description fit only a small few first pages of the book. A big part of the book is dedicated for the \\"open your heart and see the magical world around you\\" kind of faeries. Example would be the fairy of pure joy or the slippery fairy that make it \\"slippery\\". The bad fairy section of the book is heavily centered around this theme. Rather than dedicated to trolls, ogres, and goblins, it is full of personifications of negative things possibly invented by the author himself and I don't like that.Overall, it's a bad book if you are like me, seeking for information and nothing else and it would be a good book if you are the kind of person who is romantic or like to tune with nature and see things within."},{"rating":"2","title":"adorable..","review":"I met Froud's faeries 3 years ago, and since I met them, they are my new realty..

Battlefield 2142 and Neverwinter Nights 2 look awesome on this screen. Family photos look fantastic with incredible detail.Having owned an Acer CRT many years ago I wasn't afraid to go with Acer and I am happy I did. This was a great buy at just over $300 with shipping and handling.The only drawback was that I had one dead pixel on arrival.

I read alot about monitors of this Native Resolution not being supported by Microsoft. Well reading those forums AFTER I ordered I was a little nervous that I had made a mistake, but after messing with the monitor I found that instead of having to settle on a lower resolution than say 720p I was able to set my Xbox 360 on the resolution for 720p and just hit the Auto button twice and it adjusted the monitor perfectly, even for the HD DVD player. The colors are not washed out like other people complained when using the VGA.

Not every girl wants to be a fairy! I will add in case you're not aware, the people are very traditional and have kind of 19th-century dowdy clothes. But you could always buy a different more modern family. Classic, and shipped quickly. Very easy assembly.

The story centers around the hero fighting off resurrected Greek gods and Demi-gods with non-magical automatic weapons and rocket launchers and a few exotic weapons. You do get magical powerups: immortality, super slow-motion and invulnerability.You will need a fairly powerful PC with a good graphics card to fully enjoy Will Rock. Also, I found this game to be very hard due to the sheer number of enemies that come at you, always when you are trying to cross a narrow bridge over a lava pit. Bosses are always accompanied by their aggressive underlings; an advanced degree in fragology is needed to get past the last boss: Zeus.All in all, this is a great game for the price, and it has no game-stopping bugs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Run and Gun","review":"This a typical \\"run and gun\\" type game. No bullcrap puzzles and no \\"which way do I have to go?\\" situation. It's a straight forward gunner. I never got tired of the waves of different enemies popping up from the ground, around a corner or even in the air.This game also makes you think just enough to satisfy you but not leave you wondering, \\"how the heck do I get out of here\\". The puzzles are more along the line of figuring out how to launch yourself with a catapult. Will doesn't take damage when he lands which is a big plus. Or flipping a large (obviously visual) switch in this room, opens a door close by.Also it has some pretty (I hate to say it) cheesy tag lines which are adult oriented but it's still funny.I almost never ran out of ammo and health. It's everywhere you look. And treasure is almost everywhere too.Enjoy the carnage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sam will kill Will","review":"People here have compared Will Rock with the Serious Sam games.

Every opponent in the game moves 2-3 times faster than your character so it is IMPOSSIBLE to employ any strategy or worse, escape anything. Additionally, most of the rooms with encounters had the monsters continually respawning. My impression was this game was developed by an 15 year old who loves to button mash.

The light alarm is a bit annoying, as it flashes on and off, rather than coming on steadily. By itself, the light is too dim to use to read.Amazon will not take defective product returns after 30 days, so if you purchase a clock radio that breaks after a month, you will have to ship it at your own expense to Sony, and they'll replace it with the same lousy clock radio (\\"refurbished\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great clock radio with alarm!","review":"I needed an alarm clock with a radio, but hate the old black ones with the red digital display.

This is well written and entertaining. Discusses many interesting examples.For me the cases of China and Russia were the most interesting:1. Markets can work even if the economy is working in a pretty unorthodox ad hoc way. China did not have property laws or private companies but the market reform started in the villages bottom-up. Top-down reforms came later.2. Markets do not automatically lead to good efficiency. Russia trying the top-down orthodox way proposed by the foreign experts totally unsucceeded.Markets must develope bottom-up in an evolutionary way like Hayek proposed - but also top-down using market design. The role of the first one is probably more important at least in the beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"no hyperlinks for footnotes.","review":"So far, the content of this book is great.

The author has footnoted the text heavily and (I guess) appropriately, but I can't get to them easily since this electronic version has no hyperlinks on them. Too bad. If I had known that beforehand, I would have bought a hard copy instead.

I honestly felt like I was holding my breathe from the beginning of the production and then freely exhaled once Madea walked in. In other words, the acting was really bad until Madea walked in.The storyline is also a bit awkward, especially with the surprise (divorce) ending.I do have to give him props, though because during this movie, he was able to convey the true meaning of Christmas and what it means to hide the Word in your heart.

Also, there were some pretty slow spots that seemed like a good time to get up and check my e-mail, being pretty sure I wasn't missing anything.On the upside, there were some very funny scenes, and the singing was excellent.

What I saw of the play I enjoyed it, especially the singing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too funny.","review":"I usually enjoy anything with madea but this left me disappointed. It seemed drawn out and didn't have alot of humor in it. Loved the other Madea movies but could do without this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"usually love all...","review":"I usually love all of Tyler Perrys movies, but this one had a lot of sassy talking smark comments of some new character.

Only one part actually made me laugh in this play and that was when Madea knocked over things before she left."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tyler Perry's A Madea's Christmas The Play","review":"REALLY COULD NOT ENJOY THE MOVIE BECAUSE IT KEPT ON MESSING UP.

I am still using the first vest I purchased when my dog was less than a year-old. I have used it about daily training (including some high-grass cover) over the last year. The vest is held on the dog by velcro - the vest looping around the collar, and an elastic strap around the mid-section. This makes the vest pretty easy to put on the dog. Wear-points are as expected. The velcro around the collar wore-out first, followed by the stitching on the velcro at the mid-section. I am now about in need of a replacement, but I expect I will buy another Remington vest. Video is dog hunting with vest in corn/sourgum field."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I bought (2) vests, one for my 65lb Chocolate lab and my 75lb Viszla mix. The vests fit great. Make sure to expose them to light so the reflective strip works. Even if it hasn't been exposed to light the bright orange gives them high visibility. They wear these when we run at night. Now that the sun sets at 4:30pm most of our run is in the dark. The vest secures around their stomache and around their collar. It works both with a standard collar, and a prong collar. I run one dog with a standard and one with a prong collar. Definately recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"dog vest","review":"Great service from seller, but item is not what I hoped for. Difficult to get leash attached through small neck hole, and if you skip that step the vest slides side to side on dog-not comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dog tore it off in 6 seconds","review":"The quality of the product as it is seems good, but this vest is held on with Velcro that is too easy to pull off. My dog pulled this off in 6 seconds. I can't make this stay on him. There is only the one belly band and another flap that wraps around the collar also held on with velcro. I bought another brand for my larger dog which cost just a few more dollars which had several straps with disconnects that had not only a belly band but leg straps front and back besides the belly band. For my dog at least, i'll have to find something like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Stooges","review":"I got this after reading it was a \\"return to the Stooges\\". It's better than Avenue B, but that's not saying much. This definitely isn't a return to the Stooges and I'm deeply disappointed.

I'll stick to my old Stooges and Iggy Pop releases and bootlegs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of touch","review":"Iggy seems to have Popped. This album is droll and boring.

This is the best Iggy has ever sounded since Raw Power. This is the true follow up to Raw Power. The sound is part punk, part hardcore, part rock, but all IGGY. Not only did Iggy inspire and influence bands such as the Sex Pistols, Nirvana, Black Flag, Green Day, and Marilyn Manson but on Beat Em Up he outshines all of his proteges in a big way. Beat Em Up is loud, nasty, vulgar, and it has strong melodies, catchy hooks and buzz saw guitar riffs that make it a classic for a new era of young punks and dirtbags. I played this CD at my wedding. I want it played at my funeral. And if I could have, I would have wanted it blasted during my birth. Best cuts: Death is Certain, Ugliness, Drink New Blood, LOST, Jerk, and Talking Snake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got an ugly plastic dish NOT silver plated","review":"I ordered this through Amazon, paying extra for fast delivery because I needed it for a party.

This caused a frantic search for a pyrex bowl that would fit as the occasion was the next day. Could not find one that was ovenproof but did use a make-shift version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Vangelis","review":"Before Vangelis became known in the Western music world-- helped along by the motion picture soundtracks for Chariots of Fire and Bladerunner--he helped create the genre of electronic music. He was a pioneer in the true sense of the word.First Released in 1975, Heaven and Hell is a masterpiece. It is at times operatic--with the appearance of the English Chamber Choir--and at times lyrically soothing--encompassing the angelic voices of Jon Anderson and Vana Veroutis. Instrumentally, Heaven and Hell delves into the the psyche of the human spirit and hearkens to our very beginings. Appropriately, sections of this release were used for Carl Sagan's 1970s television series \\"Cosmos.\\"I first discovered this album in 1982 and recently replaced the vinyl with the CD and am now rediscovering it. Any true fan of Vangelis--or electronic music--must include this in his collection. It is perhaps Vangelis' true begining in popular electronic music, and is a journey unto itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"Heaven and Hell has some fantastic passages in a very experimental album. The end of track 1 (Heaven) about 12.45 minutes in, was used in the TV series Cosmos. It must be one of the most beautiful pieces of music ever written! Worth buying just for that track! The rest of the album can be an assult on the untrained ear, but there are fantastic pieces throughout that these samples cannot do justice to!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected..","review":"Having heard segments of Heaven & Hell on the acclaimed \\"Cosmos\\" by Carl Sagan.. thought I would love the whole CD...Truthfully I was not impressed, most of this Vangelis composition consists of harsh, discordant janglinging sounds, the vocals at the beginning DO sound Hell-like and slightly offkey!Yes, there are quite hauntingly beautiful portions, but too few... I cannot speak for everyone, but I expected more... this music just too \\"noise\\" sounding ."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not...","review":"It's not Spiral, Albedo 0.39, or China. It's okay but nothing exciting. If you like his mushy bland stuff, buy it, but if you like Dervish D, Pulstar, and the sound of keyboards being pushed to their limit of expression, don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps the worst Vangelis work","review":"I am from India and a great, great fan of Vangelis' music. See my reviews for Oceanic and El Greco. Of the 15 or so albums I know, I think this is the worst. No more comments."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book, but i wouldve liked a hardcover.","review":"this book is a great reincarnation of the \\"x-men\\". i didnt buy this from amazon, i actually got it b&n. mark miller was doing great on the \\"ultimate series\\", and this was better than i thought it was going to be. it seems alot like the movies(x-men, and x2)with these two arcs. the first arc is an intro to the x-men as they get involved with the sentinels! also they somehow find a great way to get magneto involved with the sentinels without it just being magnetos being chased by the sentinels! the second arc involves the weapon x program,and shows some of the problems with \\"protecting the humans and help them understand the mutants\\". also this has beast becoming blue and hairy! oh, and has freaking nick fury before he was in the \\"ultimates\\"! overall great book! worth the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some of Millar's worst work","review":"Every month I'm a bigger Millar fan.

It's not terrible, just not as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERPRICED","review":"This first volume of ultimate x-men is diffenetly an average comic. The storyline is not bad, its ok and the art work is good. The major downside is that it is overpriced. So with the story line, the art, and the price it averages to about 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Starting Point for X-Men Fans","review":"This book is the starting point for the X-Men in the 'Ultimate' Marvel universe. The 'Ultimate' universe was a move by marvel to have a line of comics that showed their characters in a modern, and more 'realistic' setting. In later volumes, it becomes more confusing, but the series was generally great. There are also 'Ultimate' Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, and 'the Ultimates' which are all set in the same universe. Thoroughly enjoyable"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book, poorly made","review":"I bought this for my sons who love the X-Men. It's a really great collection, but the book is so poorly made that the pages started coming loose (like totally out of the book) within two weeks. I cannot tell you how disappointed I am in this. And the way the book is made, it's not something I can easily fix--taping is next to impossible unless I don't mind pages being askew and the book not closing properly. I do mind. It was an unfortunate waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultimate X-Men: Ultimate Collection, Vol. 1 Review","review":"Mark Millar is a genious!Let me refrase that... Whom ever had the idea for the Ultimate Line is a genious!I mean, Mark Millar is an awesome writer, and certainly the story of this book is awesome, but the idea of bringing an entire universe that have no attach to present continuity, and hence not been slave of 50 or 60 years worth in continuity, is genious!!!!Ultimate X-Men bring the most known team of mutants back to teenage. This is no bad thing. Is actually refreshing. But don't worry, there's still enough stiff Scott Summers and funny Iceman for fans.

I received it and tested it out at home and could not stand it. No pun intended. It kept tipping over. I could lay it down when checking in and when waiting in line at security, but I know I will be annoyed by it. Also, It does not have enough compartments for storage. It only had the one big one and the two on the sides. I prefer a bag with more organized pockets. Overall, the bag seemed spacious and fit my clothes for a week business trip.

And why not step into Nora's. Living in downtown Manhattan, successful glamourous Nora and her sexy successful husband Jeff have it all. She is advancing in her career as Jeff is breaking barriers as his hip-hop recording company grows. Manhattan at its best, and summers at the Hamptons. But with the success comes some challanges, and a past mistake coupled with pride threatens to break apart the couple that are so great together.You'll love both Nora and Jeff including their flaws, and won't want the story to end. I've only been to NYC as a tourist, the book opened new places to me and gave a feeling of being in new Harlem and other places I didn't know. The author brings the people and places alive. Absolutely a book worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome read!","review":"The author writes so descriptively, so powerfully! She entertained all my senses to the flavor of New York. Her characters were so multi-faceted and interesting. This is so NOT the typical formula you see in popular African American fiction. I will definitely read her next work. She is a name I'll follow!"},{"rating":"2","title":"can't wait","review":"I have all the jazzmaster cd's and can't wait for the next one to come out.

Compelling and vibrant! Great seductive CD / Album cover sets the mood and tone to entice the listener!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hardcastle up to par","review":"Only one cut was not fantastic, it was only great. If you like smooth jazz to help erase the noise of the day, you'll love this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Summing Up","review":"This 2 CD set is a great (if somewhat suspect) collection of most of what you need from YMO. Dock them half a star for skipping the entire (very good) NAUGHTY BOYS album, though. Don't believe the hype, though - when it claims that \\"Behind the Mask\\" is from \\"Italy Seven Inch\\", or that \\"Cue\\" is \\"from US Promotional Twelve Inch\\", you may notice they sound exactly like the album versions. However, there are some rare goodies here, like the 12\\" version of \\"Tighten Up\\" (\\"David Bowie's doin' it, even Elvis Presley used to do it!\\"), and the \\"Germeny Seven Inch\\" version of \\"Madmen Everytime Look Aroun (I Hear the Madmen Call)\\" (enjoy your Nice Chinese Food with chopstick), which is great.

I've found it to very poorly written and bloated with useless information. Even as a reference book it's pretty bad (it's definitely not for learning swing); the layout is horrible (both visually and logically) which makes it hard to skim through to find the relevant sections (if they are in there at all). Half the book is lists of methods from the api with almost no explanation. i can get these from the ide without having to look in up in a 1600 page book.Although this is the only swing book I have, I never use it even though I mostly program in java/swing. Instead i use the swing tutorials on the sun website and other sites. It's much more concise and easy to read/understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good reference","review":"This book saved tons of time with great and detailed examples on almost every situation a developer might face while developing a Swing application. This book never failed me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry - I'm going to have to disagree","review":"I own 3 books on Swing...and I never reference this one. This book's content is badly organized, and the information is badly presented. If your skeptical, grab a really good Swing book like \\"John Zukowski's Definitive Guide to Swing for Java 2\\", and pace yourself on the speed you grasp the subject matter, and hands down you'll learn faster with Zukowski's book. It's not enough to have all the info in a book, it's how it's presented and explained. I'm a fan of the Core Java books, so I was excited about this one, but ended up disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, a must for all Java UI developers.","review":"If you use Swing to develop your Java UI's, and who doesn't, unless maybe you're developing an applet, you must get this book. I have several books dedicated to using JFC and none compare to this one. When you need detailed answers as to how or why Swing controls behave as they do you can rely on getting the correct answer from this book. You may read the first couple of chapters then I recommend using the book as a reference. Read what you need as you need it. This is a huge book, 1600+ pages, dense with information and code samples. I refer to this book often. I give this one a strongly recommended. I hope this helps :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"It is definitly overrated.","review":"I have many years programming experience including Java.After reading so many positive reviews, I bought this book. But I really don't like it much! I read it just like reading JavaDoc from sun's java API documents. When the author try to explain something, he did not explain it clearly. I have to read the code and read Java API to understand the programs. Some codes, such as those using Internal Frame and Desktop Pane don't work as they should. Read some pages this book before you order. I don't recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice examples, Not suitable as a reference manual","review":"Nice book if you do not know much about the JFC. Some good examples. The format of the book does not invite for a close survey. This book is not suitable as a reference. If you want to know about classes, its methods and the way they work it is better to look for something else.To learn, examplewise, it is a rather good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, although too much repetition and unused paper","review":"This is really a fantastic book on Swing and is definitely worth the buy. My only gripe is that in the tons of examples that are presented, most code is listed twice. Once to explain each part, and then all put together at the end. I think it would be more effective to show all the code and then explain it. This would have saved tons of pages and made the book easier to carry around and work with. For example, on pages 1060 and 1061 we see the same code on each page. As with most programming books these days there just seems to be too much unused paper and big gaps to spread the book out and make it as long as possible. Considering these are the only legitimate complaints I can make after going through several chapters here and tehre, I have to say this book is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing for the scope","review":"For a book that is dedicated to Swing, I found the book uninsightful. The organization of the book is confusing and thus difficult to use. The table of contents are a somewhat helpful in this area, but since there is no index, it is not very useful as a reference text. Unfortunately it not particularly good as an introduction to the Swing interface either, so I am not quite sure who is the best audience. But there is a lot of raw data, so some should find some value from it, particularly if this is the only information available on Swing."},{"rating":"2","title":"One and Only","review":"I wish I had bought this book first...I found this book to be a great read; fun, entertaining, and structered in a way that answered my questions before I could ask them.

I ordered these a half size larger, so that my foot would not hang off the back. ( some of the reviews noted that they run small) Well, my foot STILL hangs off the back, AND they are the oddest fit. Narrow towards the front and wide in the middle. So my foot doesnt stay in the shoe, they feel like they are going to go flying forward with every step. I never had a pair of shoes like this before, they are just horrible. (My guess is they werent made in this country) I agree with the reviewer who noted that she spent the entire time trying to keep them on her feet. I bought these to wear to work (pre-school)since we are not permitted to wear sandals in the summer. The sandals would be safer and more comfortable than these. A horrible little waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My feet slip out!","review":"What a bummer.... I bought these after trying on many pairs of skechers and I *thought* I had picked the best pair. WRONG! They fit perfectly (which is so depressing) because they are near impossible to walk in. It's like the insoles are made of teflon! My feet slip out of them on every step. I spend my whole time walking thinking about keeping my feet in the shoes. I think I nearly sprained my foot trying to keep them on as I walked. I wish now I had gotten another pair. I can't return them because I've worn them. Money down the toilet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Order a size up","review":"Like others who have reviewed this product, you will need to order a 1/2 size up at least. Shoe looks very nice, I still have to try them out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great run-a-round shoe","review":"This is my second pair of these shoes. They are so comfortable. They slip on real easy. You can wear them with socks or without. I can't bend over as easily as I used to, so having not to ty them is the biggest plus. They wash well in the machine. Very easy maintenance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and funny movie!","review":"I found this movie on TV and I liked it enough to order it. It's funny and cute. All around a good movie to purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!","review":"My whole family loves this movie! I randomly borrowed it from the library last year and was very surprised at how funny it is. We have watched it several times since then and decided we wanted to own it. Danny Devito and Kathy Bates are hysterical together. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"No wonder this film didn't make the movie theaters. This is an insult to the 15-year-old boys who dominate the audiences. There is not a single laugh, unless you think that accidentally putting Preparation H on your toothbrush is amusing. This is especially dreadful because of the waste of Kathy Bates, a truly gifted actress who should have turned down the \\"awful mother\\" stereotype. Not even Marjorie Main could have put life into that limp script. In short, the movie is a dead loss. Even fans of \\"Jackass\\" films will be bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat Embarrassing","review":"I had great hopes for this movie when I purchased it some time ago. When I got around to watching it I was with family members and the movie is so bad we all agreed to turn it off. None of us have any desire to ever watch it again. The comedy is predictible and often embarrassing at times, as is some of the acting. A great disappointment considering the actors involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie Ever","review":"This movie is TERRIBLE!! Do not waste your money or time. These reviews must be fake, there is NO WAY anyone would say this movie was good if they actually saw it. I can't believe so many decent actors were a part of this awful mess of a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality","review":"Quality of this DVD was not good color was orange color, plots in the movie were missing.Disappointed, not in Amazon service, never had to return an item before, but in quality of this DVD, it must be a poor quality copy of something like it.But then how do you explain parts in the movie missing?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected Hilarity Unexcelled","review":"The comedy shown greatly exceeded prior anticipation or speculation. Oscar-worthy and should become afuture recurring classic. The DeVito-Bates duo is irreplaceable and, as I am a Neve-Campbell fan, any commentof mine involving her could only be considered biassed. All the other parts were OK albeit replaceable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Want to experience coastal sailing and boat ownership?","review":"Then read this book, a practical, thoughtful, honest, and gently humorous guide to the real pleasures and challenges of finding, sailing, and caring for your boat, as well as the delicate balance of man, nature, work, dreams, boat maintenance, friendship, marriage and family.It's not just a how to book, but a well-written and wonderful reflection by an active and skilled sailor that explores restoration details, costs, safety, mishaps and joys on the water, with a fine, candid, and thoughtful eye."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sailor who's also a writer","review":"I enjoyed this book very much because it comes from a person who is clearly both a sailor and a writer. Much like Anthony Baily, author of \\"The Coast of Summer\\", Baumgartner writes in a way that lets me know that he is comfortable and knowledgable about being on the water, with a tiller in his hand and his eye on the luff of the main. This is also a good reference, because Baumgartner describes how he solved problems I either have encountered -- or am likely to. I'll dig this out often, to solve a problem or to let Baumgartner take me to sea again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highlight of Grindcore!","review":"This is the 'Raw Power' of grindcore, without any doubt. Like the Stooges record, some love it, because of the raw and animalistic approach of the music, some hate it, usualy because of the production. And like 'Raw Power' this is a cult record (even if only in the brutal world). Once, after several listenings, you're into it, you can't leave it anymore. Brutal Truth is still for me the highlight of Grindcore, with three awesome studio records, two EPs and a live testament. Essential!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grindcore gods","review":"The name sums up this band so well. With the opening line of \\"Still not loud, still not fast enough\\", the rest of the album commences to crush your skull. Tight and extreme blast beats from drummer Rich Hoak are definetly one of the best assests of this band, however animalistic vocals, at times odd guitaring and thundering bass all add to the Brutal Truth experience.

Gurn has a very interesting approach to the guitar, while Kevin Sharp's vocals are just plain brutal. For any one who likes tight, fast, and intricate grindcore with a mix of black metal, death metal, and hardcore/punk, pick this one up. My personal favorite brutal truth album is kill trend suicide, but some may prefer the production of this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Salad tongs","review":"Pretty grape pattern.

Andrew Peterson is in a league of his own with his blend of lyrics and music. He is in a class with Rich Mullins. Clear to Venus is impressive to say the least. There isn't a bad track and the hidden track is worth the price of the CD. Mary Picked the Roses was an unreleased Rich Mullins song put to a new melody. Isn't it Love is upbeat. Loose Change is profound if from a penny's point of view. Venus is touching. Great cover of Why Walk When you can Fly?Rare is the day when you can actually like every song on a CD and Andrew Peterson hasn't had a bad album. GET THEM ALL---you will not be disappointed. His new Christmas CD is definitely worth getting too. It is not your traditional songs, but an incredible journey through Scripture leading up to Christ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Acoustic Music","review":"While a number of people are familiar with Andrew Peterson's first album, Carried Along, his sophomore effort may actually be a better album. Continued from the first album are the heartfelt and insightful lyrics and rich acoustic music that helps Peterson's music rise up from the muck that is much of secular and Christian mainstream pop.What lifts this album to a higher level in my mind is Peterson's willingness to speak more clearly to the issues in his personal life. What you get is sense of a real person working out his faith through his art and in his life. Song range from the hopeful \\"No More Faith\\" to the whimsical tune taken from a Jesus told called \\"Loose Change\\". My favorites are \\"Isn't it Love\\", \\"Venus\\" and the two song track called \\"Why Walk When You Can Fly\\".For those who liked Peterson's first album, get this work. You won't be disappointed at all. There is no second album letdown here and you get drawn more deeply into the artist's faith though the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimate Edge 10c sharpening steel","review":"Ordered this as I already own the original first medium sharpening steel first introduced from the same maker. I love the finer one that I had previously and thought this coarse diamond steel would help with the more difficult dull problem knives. I was disappointed. I don't think it does a very good job. It is inexpensive, relatively, so it seemed a good deal. You get what you pay for. It was hard to use compared to the finer model, which I love, and have had no problems with . I have been sharpening my own kitchen knives for forty years and I think I know what I'm doing, but I could not get a really good edge with this even in combination with the finer model. I'll stick with my traditional old fashioned steel and the finer diamond model for the finishing.

It's only a bit heavier than expected, but overall I recommend it to anyone whose child is turning into a toddler and need a bigger stroller.

I wanted one that was sturdy enough for a big diaper bag and growing baby but lightweight and compact. It met all of these requirements. Two features i would love to have are a adjustable canopy and handles. When we are walking in direct sun you can't pull the canopy down over him because it is attached at the back. We are also taller and the handles don't adjust so we have to lean down a little bit. I know our 6 month old find it very comfy though with lots of room to grow. The basket is big enough but only accessible from the front. I like that is stands up on its own when collapsed. It doesn't tip over with a diaper bag hanging from the handle and no baby sitting in it. It is a very smooth ride compared to the graco stroller i have.

I was very impressed by this movie, although it certainly doesn't romanticize submarine warfare.This movie is about a U-boat crew setting out from France during World War II in an effort to sink Allied shipping. Although U-boats had been the terror of the sea at the beginning of the war when the voyage in the film takes place the Germans have lost their edge... the Happy Time is over. U-boats are just as often hunted as the hunter.The film portrays life on a German submarine, not the most pleasant existence, with food going bad and close quarters and the damp. And it gets considerably worse when the U-boat comes under attack.Das Boot does not pull punches. Be warned. And it is a long movie. But if you want to get a good feel for what war was like for German submariners, three quarters of whom never made it home, then you should see this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"an uplifting demonstration of human courage","review":"This is a film American audiences need to be more familiar with, because it had a tremendous influence on later films such as U-571. For those not familiar with foriegn films, this piece is not only long but also develops in a non-american fashion. The events move almost like the waves of the ocean themselves. While it is a movie about that battle of the atlantic, it is apolitical; your enlightened girlfriend probably wouldn't mind it. And thank God for one of the few movies not to demonize the German military! We all know the Nazis were an evil empire, but for that matter so were the Soviets and Japanese! Anyway, this work will take you through a long yet rewarding journey; and personally, it was the ending itself that earns this movie an additional star for me. Not that I like unhappy endings per se, but it was such a refreshing (and realistic) relief from the Hollywood formula. Try it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly the greatest WWII movie of all time!","review":"This is by far the most intense and breathtaking WWII movie ever made. Wolfgang Peterson makes you feel like you are in an actual U-boat with the realism and the awesome digitally enhanced sound. If you have an awesome digital surround sound system, this movie will bring your system to the limit! Hint to reader: tune down your sub, because when you feel the first depth charge, you might have to buy a new one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable masterpiece of film-making!!!","review":"I'm 22-year old girl and i've never ever seen a more fascinating movie! At the end i cried and so did my dad. \\"das Boot\\" shows war from the side of the loosers and so it does't need all this boring patriotic heroism, which has nothing to do with the reality of war! The story is so credible and the actors are excellent. Juergen Prochnow is simply a dream! (*g*)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film, bad transfer...","review":"The only reason that I do not rate this version of Das Boot with a 5 is the bad quality of the extra 100 minutes. While the rest of the movie is crisp, clear and clean, the added parts (which are mostly external shots) have not been restored, and you get scratches, grain and a thin blue line from the top of the screen to its bottom.I seriously contemplated giving this version a 3, but the story is excellent, Petersen is in top form, the performances are stellar and the added bits enhance what was already a superb war movie (even with the problems).Do yourself a favour, even if you already own a version of it, buy this - simply the best submarine movie ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"MISSED THE BOAT","review":"I like war movies with alot of action in them. This movies focuses on a German U boat crew at sea being BORED to death waiting to see some action. WAITING-WAITING-WAITING AND MORE WAITING! That is the plot here, you WATCH AND WAIT- for like 3 hours to see a few minutes of action. It really gets the point across of how boring life in a submarine can be. I was so Bored I never finished it. Can't understand so many 5 stars. This movie gets the DAS BOOT from my dvd colletion!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Das Boot","review":"I purchased this movie for my husband. He was so disappointed in the quality of the film, he could only watch it for 15 minutes.Needless to say it was not a good choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and very slow movie","review":"This is a very boring and slow movie. I do not understand almost the 100% 5 star ratings for this movie. All we get to see for most of the movie is the crew eating food and talking vaguely about things that are of no consequence to us or the movie. And the rest of movie is how they were hit by other ships.In a word, this movie is very boring. I would give 0 stars if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I did not like this movie. I tried and I tried, but it just never payed off for me... You keep waiting for the real action to start, and it never does. Way too long, it could benefit from cutting an hour or two. Then it might be bearable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A comic book from a epic","review":"Das Boot in this movie was cut to make it an Action Film that if you speak German you have no idea what the hell people are talking about or doing. If you like comics you will like this film in any format. It is actually an 11 hour film, not 6 and shows the plight and character of the crew, their home life, the life under the 8th Air Force and the realization that they made a mistake choosing Hitler but there is no way out. It indicts the NAZIs and the SS and how well they lived up to the very end and just how short the good times were but leaves out how very short the good tiimes and lives were for others. If you want good War movies that are for real I recommend the German/English Version of \\"A Cross of Iron\\" and if you into the Holocaust movies like the German, uncut \\"Jacob the Liar\\" as well as many others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Das Boot - Can't Follow Instructions","review":"I was on a waiting list for the original version of this film, my favorite.

Based on the stanards of the above films it is a conventioal action film , whit hokey dialouge and repitive scenes, peterson is no wirter and no director. dejavu takes over after about twenty minutes when scenes are palyed over and over again( whit remiscancent dialouge as well) Sure this film is on par with any america film becuaes most american films are carp wate of time. No true brillance is shown here , only the conventonal war film with no real philosocial or any over overtones for that matter"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shows Hollywood up beautifully","review":"I think this film sets the benchmark for war films and indeed for drama in general. It shows Saving Private Ryan up for what it is - garish, overdone, Americanocentric, self-obsessed cartoonery - by concentrating on character and dialogue rather than on physical violence.If you are not a German-speaker, remember to see the film with subtitles rather than dubbed. By doing so you will come to appreciate the distinction between Nazi German and military German, one of many such fine distinctions which the film illustrates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie","review":"This is an excellent movie, and one of the best war movies ever filmed. To the poor uneducated lad that rated it a \\"1 star\\" and said that doing laundry would be better than watching this incredile movie....I have plenty of laundry you can do here at my house. Obviously you have no idea what constitutes a great movie or were posting trying to draw attention to yourself. Whatever the reason in your case, if you can't post an honest, responsible review then don't post at all. Believe me, if you are remotedly interested in the Battle In The Atlantic, or a WWII (World War II (2) for our unfortunate, uneducated lad, buff then I HIGHLY recommend this movie. You won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surround sound a MUST!!","review":"Brilliant when watched with widescreen tv and surround sound.Great detail, from German navy personnel singing 'It's a long way to Tipperary' to the problems with LICE, eeek.The sound of the Depth charges with a woofer is sweeeet.Characters in film are great and the views achieved in U-boat is awesome and realistic.Flawless."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only submarine movie you need to see...","review":"I'm sure you've read a ton of reviews about how great this movie is, so I won't bore you with another one. What I will say, in difference to what others have written, is that the English dubbing is fine. No dubbing is ever superior to the original dialogue, but they do a pretty good job here overall. Supposedly the original cast did their own voice work in English as well as German when making this film. (Don't know if that's true. As this was actually a German mini-series made for television.) Anyway, if you don't know sub titles, you can certainly enjoy this great epic of a motion picture with the English dubbing. After you finish it, and realize how amazing a film it is, you'll certainly come back and watch it again, and maybe then you'll see the original translation (Which differs greatly from the spoken one.) and enjoy the movie all over again.One of the best movies ever about WWII. If you like this, be sure to check out Stalingrad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your average war movie","review":"I might be young but I still know a good film when I see it. This is a war movie but it's not. With alot of great war films there has been extreme violence and even though realistic I dont always need to see a head blown off or leg or what ever. can live with out. Das Boot on the other hand has violence yes this is a war film but relies on more suspense and what you hear or maybe even worse what you dont hear. this movie is for people who like suspense films, war films or just a great drama. Dont past this movie up if you get a chance to see it. Also watch the film in german with subtitles it amazing how different the film is dubbed."},{"rating":"2","title":"'The' best submarine movie ever","review":"I think this is easily the best submarine movie ever made and one of the best war themed movies. I already owned the 3 hour version in English, and that was already a superb movie. Now, to have the full 5 hour experience, and in original German audio is just the way it was meant to be seen...Go get it, already!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont make a movie movie glorifying Germans in the US.","review":"They got what they deserved, remember the Germans were fighting so they could kill all the Jews and take over the world, why would we want them to live? WE DONT. Maybe if i was German or they movie was about Americans i could realte, but im sorry they deserved worse then what they got. Its too long, it doesnt have enough action, no drama, the score is bad, the acting is boderline soap opera, and the dialogue is perverted. U571 is better but not much, if your looking for a better Wolfgang film check out Troy (a great great great film) its a million times better, if you want a better war movie check out Saving Private Ryan of course, its the best war movie ever made. 4 out of a 10 for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"real\\" war movie","review":"One of the few films about war that is realistic. The viewer can feel the tension and the fear and enjoy the occasional moments of humor. When the action moves onto the submarine, you can almost smell the sweat, the spoiled food, the diesel fuel. I am not normally a big fan of war movies, but this doesn't feel like a movie it feels like real life. There is no \\"Hollywood\\" here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see.","review":"Your education into the horrors of war is not complete until you see this seminal work on submarine warfare during World War II."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Sub Movie!","review":"What U571 is to Hollywood is what Das Boot is to the real world. If you could ever imagine what life was like aboard a U-boat, this is as close as you can come without having been there. =2 In Search of Private Ryan. Bummer of an ending, but quite appropriate!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Sub movie since Run Silent Run Deep","review":"If you liked Run Silent-Run Deep, and liked The Hunt for Red October - this movie is for you. The special effects and filming are first rate and the story line follows those of the classics and are more true to history. If you want to \\"experience\\" what it was like to be on a U-boat - this is the movie of choice. Much better than U-571. While a long movie, you never fall asleep. My favorite sub movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"DAS BOOT DVD","review":"I bought it because this version had Closed Captions in English. But, the Closed Captions verbiage did not match the actual spoken English in the dvd, so it became a joke to follow the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Das Boot","review":"I don't know what was wrong with the product, but it was faulty. About half way through it it stopped playing with giant pixels on the screen. I was not happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Das Boot","review":"Can you say \\"useless\\"? Das Boot is a German movie. This particular cut was the Director's cut. To see the whole movie, one would have to flip the disc over on its other side. So we did, expecting to have a menu there to choose English subtitles. Side two does not have a menu and therefore does not provide English subtitles for the end of the movie. Surely, Amazon, you know that some of the products you carry and sell to consumers are defective. Why not tell them?"},{"rating":"2","title":"ultimate \\"Das Boot\\"","review":"The blue-ray version of the director's cut was excellent, from picture quality to the soundtrack. When I saw that the original theatrical release version was included, I was especially pleased. This is still probably the best film ever made about submarine warfare during the Battle of the North Atlantic, and stands as a testament to the courage of the sailors of both sides of the conflict, the sufferings and sacrifices and the tragedies that marked that dark era. Peterson should do a film on the Royal Navy's side of the war before he passes from the stage........"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll be brief and to the point","review":"I'll avoid the temptation to give a lengthy, specific detailed review of this movie. Simply stated, this is arguably the greatest submarine war film ever made. It is impossible to overpraise or hype a film of this stature. In truth, one of the greatest war movies ever made and it can be watched over and over and never get boring. A true MASTERPIECE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This 209-Minute Version Is A Good One","review":"This 1985 effort was re-issued with a longer VHS version in 1997 with surround sound and 60 minutes added to the original video, then put on DVD with 5.1 surround sound. All these improvements made a good movie even better.Considering most of this 209 minute film is done inside a U-boat, a submarine, it's very nicely filmed. Jurgen Prochnow, who plays the lead character - the captain of the boat - is a manly, rough-looking-but- compassionate human being who's riveting to watch. Just as interesting as him are the sounds as the noises from the boat echo through all the surround speakers.I would recommend going with the German language track with English subtitles. The dubbed version has English spoken with a German accent and isn't easy to understand, anyway.....so stick with the way it was made and go with the subtitles if you don't understand German.In summary: yes, it's a little long but generally the film moves at a decent pace and features a good ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Movie IS The Bomb","review":"If you are in to U-Boats ( Like I am ) this movie is a must see. Just rember it is a little over 3hrs long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still too short","review":"This is, I guess as close as one can get to the real thing! For every \\"Das Boot\\" lover there is only the original 6 hour version that captures the atmosphere on the U-Boot like nothing else. For those who don't like to dedicate themselves to a six hour movie but still are hungry for more \\"Boot\\" than the movie release gave them, this is the way to go.There is a full version DVD available these days for the purists. Like this DVD, it is German, but has an English track (which is terrible) and subtitles (which cover about half the dialogue in the movie)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Sub Movie Ever","review":"This movie is an excellent buy. It is full of the pressure of being on a submarine. You wil find yourself rooting for the Germans even though you might consider them the enemy. It shows that Americans were not the only heroes who died on subs. This movie will keep you in suspense for every single minute. This movie is a must own for anybody who loves Submarines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Das Boot, a Great Movie!","review":"Das Boot - The Director's Cut is constantly rated by ex-submariners as the greatest submarine movie ever made. I'll go one better: in my opinion, it is one of the very best best and most poignant movies about military life and action thus far produced. Das Boot - The Director's Cut is gripping and absorbing. In short, it is a classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a benchmark for all other DVDs.","review":"I have a collection of several DVDs, and this DVD represents the standard by which I judge all others; it's a white knuckle film which anyone can appreciate. Besides presenting a truly great film, it has plenty of neat extras which add to the package."},{"rating":"2","title":"tremendous; the best WW2 fim ever made","review":"It is difficult to express how I feel about this film. My stepfather was in the RCN, on convoy duty, aboard the HMCS Agassiz. My father-in -law, Giuseppe Tmasini, of Rovereto, Italia, was in the Axis Navy, and was sunk twice in the Mediterranean. Prochnow was outstanding; the most outstanding performance I have ever seen -- laconic, but the essence of leadersship. I am sure I have every line, German an English memorized. I never fail to be moved by hte script \\"Good men ... all of them... you have to have good men., and \\" \\"280 metes, and she is still in one piace ... the merciful God has left a shovelful of sand to keep us up.\\" Not a day goes by, when I am not influenced, in some way, by this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I have been a huge fan of this movie, and after my VHS tape was ruined, I looked for a replacement. My first attempt was with the Directors Cut, I didn't appreciate the change in dialouge and the movie seemed to drag on. I recently purchased the 2- Disc Collector's Set. This set contained the Theratical and Director's Cut Version of the movie. When the Theratical version is played it is in German with English Subtitles. There is an option under the Langauge to change the Audio and Video. I set it to play in English with no subtitles. I Hit the Play button and the subtitle were gone, however the audio was still in German. I tried this several times with the same results each time. I found the same problem with the Director's Cut. I don't know if this was just a problem with the Disc Set I received or if it is a common problem with all of the Disc sets. I plan on purchasing it again from another source to see if this was an isolated incident."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gosh!!!","review":"Dang i just bought the superbit edition...which is 3.5 hours long.. and i thought this version will never be release.oh well, screw it, i might as well buy it again..Das Boot is the BEST WW2 related movie ever. its a Masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Director's cut?","review":"Well, I was thinking of buying this DVD as it is titelled \\"Director's cut\\". However when I saw the length of the move - 207 minutes - I became really disappointed and I still am.I have seen it on both German and Austrian TV as the series \\"Das Boot\\". It lasts almost 6 hours. I know that this is a long time - but I taped it anyway.So I am not very convinced that the DVD will bring you all the series showed. What a pity that they cut it down to 207 minutes and titelled it \\"Director's cut\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound and fury","review":"The many glowing reviews of this movie disregard the fact that, while \\"Das Boot\\" is surely a magnificently crafted depiction of life aboard a German U-boat during World War II, the screenplay is dangerously awash with genre cliches. Excellent photography and powerful acting do not compensate for the feeling that we have seen all of this before. With nothing new to chew on, we are left instead to savor the spectacle. And a staggering spectacle it is. Director Wolfgang Petersen makes a very good action movie, and action is all we have in \\"Das Boot\\". It is no surprise to learn that he went on to direct \\"In the Line of Fire\\" and \\"Air Force One\\". Highly recommended, but \\"Das Boot\\" is not the classic it could have been."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great submarine movie","review":"I'm a big fan of submarine movies and this is a great one. I really appreciate the obsession for technical accuracy.Not much I can add to the other reviews here but I think it's curious and worth noting that the English subtitles are completely different from the English dubbing. Unlike some reviewers I thought the dubbed version was just fine, but it must be a separate translation from the subtitles. In some cases the meaning is subtly or completely different."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"THE\\" German WWII story of the submarine Battle","review":"The title tells the story. The movie is an all encompassing story of thewar under-seas; it is not a nice story of heros - but the tale of peopledying for no explainable reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding--in the original language","review":"Plenty of other reviews here, so I'm going to limit myself to one recommendation--watch this superb movie in German, with the English subtitles. Don't watch it dubbed in English. Thankfully, I watched it in the original language first (and, as always seems to be the case for me when a movie is really good, promptly forgot I was even reading subtitles). Later, I saw it dubbed in English & it was an astonishing experience--it really weakened the movie for me. See the original. The claustrophobia and the sense of the stakes involved are tremendous in this very, very powerful movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with the VHS vesion","review":"The original version of the director's cut of Das Boot on VHS is widely, and I think rightly acknowledged as one of the greatest films ever made about men at war, and about submarine warfare in particular. So it was an enormous disappointment to me when I sat down to watch the DVD version of this classic to find that the movie had not only been re-dubbed with different actors, but the script had been re-translated!After spending many enjoyable hours over several years watching the VHS version, I found the different voices and different words on the DVD very jarring, akin to watching a Bugs Bunny cartoon with Daffy Duck's voice!So, if you have never seen this movie, I would have no hesitation in recommending this DVD - it's still a great film. But if, like me, you know and love the original VHS version of the director's cut of Das Boot, then I suggest you stick with it. (I have no idea whether recently produced VHS copies feature the original or new soundtrack and script.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The English Dubbing Pales","review":"Truly an outstanding film and I agree with all the positive comments. However, I have seen the film 3 times. First in German with English Subtitles, Second Dubbed in English, and again in German with English subtitles.The impact of native German spoken in combat is awesome and cannot be captured in the English dubbed version. The dubbed version just felt so fake. For that reason alone I gave the dubbed version one star. Get the English subtitled version if possible, DVD if you can!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Das Boot","review":"While Photograpy was excellent, I found the poor quality of the sound,in the German quite distracting; and the cast itself seemed to forget there was an audience. I certainly hope the other DVDs' offer an alternative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great submarine movie but be ready for the sub-titles","review":"Bought the DVD after enjoying the video of Das Boot. My only disappointment was I never figured out a way to get the English language to come on. (It looks to me the DVD doesn't have that option) So I end up listening to it in German with the sub-titles running at the bottom of te screen. Having to constantly read the sub-titles makes it a little less enjoyable to watch but this is definitely the classic WW II submarine movie of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Das Boot the Uncut Version","review":"The uncut version is too long. The story is great.If I were to watch it again, I would probably skip the last 2 hours of the first disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"great boot","review":"ALWAYS INTRESTED IN THE U-BOAT OF GERMANY AND THE MANY MISSIONS IN THE ATLANTIC. FIRST RATE FILM WITH REALISM."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rettung! Rettung!","review":"Das Boot is certainly one of the best war movies ever to be released, and it is definitely the most effective anti-war movie. Simply put: It humanizes the Germans that are normally diabolic thugs in most WW2 movies. The 'bad guys' are the protagonists here, and the incredibly detailed sets and their claustrophobic feel make you feel like you're crammed into U-96 with them. The stark images and melancholy feel of Das Boot, combined with the excellent writing make it one of my top ten movies. However, it does have what is perhaps the most depressing ending ever seen in a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Greats!","review":"This is the best submarine movie ever, and in fact is one of my favorite movies of all time. It really gives you the feeling of what it would be like in a submarine and leaves you on the edge of your seat! You feel what the passengers feel - isolation, loneliness, frustration, nervousness. The blu-ray looks great and is worth the upgrade. The sound is terrific. I always watch the original German soundtrack with English subtitles. I've never watched the dubbed English version and never will so I cannot comment on it. I rarely watch special features so I can't comment on those either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie! But dont stop here.......","review":"This was a excellent movie on the life of German submariners during WW2. Makes the submarines of today look like under water cruise ships by comparision.BUT DONT STOP HERE! After you watch this great film, read \\"Iron Coffins\\" by Herbert Werner. Which is a real life account of his career in the U-boat flotilla. What Werner experieces even tops what happened to the characters in this movie, and this guy is STILL alive in his 90's living in Florida! Amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"This is a great CD. I watched it last night and again this morning. As one audio option, there is the director's comments all through the picture. Turn on the sub-titles and enjoy both.This is a long movie, so make sure you have plenty of popcorn. And don't expect it to be one of those war movies. This is a drama about the lives of the men in a U-boat during WWII. Surprisingly, there is not much violence. It deals more with their thoughts, emotions, and frustration with the German high command. There is action, but mostly in trying to survive depth charge attacks and equipment failures. Special effects are somewhat lacking, so don't look too closely, but I found the story line more than interesting enough to allow me to ignore any flaws."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best sub movie ever made","review":"This is the best sub movie ever made. It is accurate and gripping. The sound in the DVD version is incredible. Waves wash all around you from one corner of the room to the other.The movie is best viewed with the English sub-titles because the English dialogue is not entirely accurate--it is close--but could have been better. As others have said, you probably won't be bothered much by reading the sub-titles--the movie is that good--it makes a mockery of the recently released U-571. The DVD also has a decent amount of extras that are worth watching.Don't miss this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Sub movie","review":"This great film, which I originally watched in German, is fantastic. This has to be the best W.W. II Sub film ever made. We follow a German crew on a single mission... Very intense and action filled. The Director's Cut DVD offers vast improvements via re-mastered sound and a crystal clear picture. There are 60 or so minutes of extra footage bringing the length of the movie to well over 3 hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best and authentic U boat movies of all time","review":"Das Boot. If you like war movies with submarines you should like this one. One of the most authentic submarine movies I know of. It presents the U-boat topic from a German perspective. It shows the human element of the German submariners and invites you to ask \\"what would I do If I were in this situation?\\" You'll find yourself between a rock and a hard place as you go against what you know is right and loyalty to your country and a cause you don't necessarily believe in. This movie will make you think. One thing...if you watch it in English it is translated from German so the lips may not sync exactly. If that bothers you watch it in German. Bottom line...I liked it enough to buy it a 2nd time in Blu-ray."},{"rating":"2","title":"very very good movie","review":"Loved this movie. was shipped quickly and in excellant condition, played it the day it arrived."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic German movie","review":"This movie is truly a classic. I had never seen this movie before in the years it's been released until a year or so ago. I bought the VHS version of the director's cut first. The DVD is better. It's great to be able to see a movie about World War II dealing with the German perspective. The sound effects are great, the acting is top notch, and the director's commentary is truly a treat to listen to while viewing the movie. The music also fits the movie all the way. Never have seen the older version before the director's cut and don't plan to. Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best War Movie I've ever seen","review":"This is a great movie!

Ana, then meets tempting spymaster Lucas who provokes passion from her. Ana suspects Lucas' best friend of being responsible for the spy murders, and circumstances lead them to be married to each other which complicates the case and their live. The clever writing and tension in this novel is absorbing and I definitely know that the connection between Ana and Lucas is passionate which make their somewhat contrived story just read so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this!!","review":"These workouts are great!

It wasn't/isn't really what could be called personal best work for Harvey Keitel, Cameron Diaz or any of the supporting players (Okay, okay-- Billy Zane's assured turn as Diaz's conniving ex-lover was an enjoyable hoot), but it was definitely a pleasant way to spend a quiet afternoon, when it debuted on premium cable some years back.I therefore give it four stars for those reasons and two more: Diaz is drop-dead ravishing (pun intended; sorry) as the ditzy, increasingly beleaguered Natalie, and Shawn Colvin's winning, winsome reading of \\"Sail On Sailor,\\" played over the opening credits, perfectly complements the gorgeous scenery and Natalie's loopy dilemmas.I've been searching without success so far for Colvin's recording of \\"Sailor\\", by the way. Anyone here have any ideas where I can find it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste of time","review":"The poor storyline and unbelievable twists in this movie make it unbearable to sit through.

Wrong! The book is about conspiracy in the government and events that take place in Washington. Horrible character development, I'm truly puzzled why publisher decided to go for it. Shame on the author for using Vietnam as a cheap sale tactic and waste of the beautiful trees."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dry Comedy at its Best","review":"I just recently saw The Office on DVD for the first time and was blown away. The first season is a very short pilot season, but it introduces you to the main characters well.

I'm convinced someone from MY office writes this show!!!This series is priceless. Obviously- it's a little exaggerated, but isn't everything? It's ENTERTAINMENT!!!!! You're not laughing at Michael being mean and laughing because someone's hurt.

It's smart, funny and delightfully awkward. The characters are very realistic and the acting is top notch. The only reason I gave this DVD four stars instead of five is because of the length.

Anyone who has been a fan of the British version from the beginning would agree that although the American version has it's moments (few and far inbetween), the British version was absolutely incredible...and simply cannot be duplicated. The magic of Ricky Gervais as David Brent is something truly unique and an intimidating force to reckon with. Steve Carell, not surprisingly, does a very poor job of imitading the outlandish, egotistical, and sad antics of Ricky Gervais...and Carell is probably the best character in the series! As well, they went ahead and copied actual scenes from the original!...how could they be any more creative? I would not recommend this DVD unless you HAVE NOT seen the British version. If you were a fan of the Brit series...stick with the BBC, this American wash-out has nothing on the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissaster","review":"the office was supposed to be an english show using english humour you try to use american humour its just not going to work at all"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Absurd","review":"I saw all the episodes on season 1.

That fact alone does not mean that the show is good. Mabey I made a mistake when I sat and tried to watch the whole thing at one time. It was painfull trying to keep my attention on this show. Don't get me wrong the show is insightfull, reflective and unlike anything else on TV. But it is also dry, very dry. Perhaps the show will be more palatable when I rewatch it one episode at a time with a weeks pause inbetween each painful episode. If you are considering buying this DVD please note that a lack of laugh track, a soundtrack, and the usual compliments of TV sitcoms means that you will be watching an office, and just an office."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it","review":"I didn't like the Office.

Certainly not when toned down for primetime."},{"rating":"1","title":"The British Version Is Just As Bad As This One!","review":"I gave a review on the first season of the BBC edition a little while back and I mentioned how poor and boring it was. Yesterday I viewed the first episode of the American version of this farce and it was no better.

As I love British television, I thought it would be great. But I just don't get this. It is tasteless, crude and offensive, and not even in that funny British way that so many other shows are. I agree that much of the show is realistic, but that's not why a sitcom is funny. There is not a single character that is sympathetic, that the viewer can LIKE. If you really want to watch good British television, watch BBC America for \\"My Hero\\", or any of the other great shows they have on."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Imitation","review":"The BBC version is great. The NBC version is awful. I guess they had to dumb it down for the American audience.Sad...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing funny here","review":"I suspect this show received so many rave reviews for people were afraid of being seen as \\"not getting it.\\"My first warning to this show is when i heard one of my former bosses describe it as 'soooo funny.' Being around her is like being trapped in a room with the characters from this show: dull, dry and humorless.There were a couple moments where i smiled, but building an entire show around awkward silences does not make a lasting comedy. If you have netflix, rent the first disk of season 1 to give it a try, but don't pay anything for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I don't even know where to begin, so I'll just say, it's not funny at all. It is nowhere near the genius of the American version. The British cast was terrible except for Tim who is the only good one. The episodes were too long and I think they should have made the American version 40 minutes and the British version 20 minutes. What kind of name is Wernham Hogg? At first, I thought Dunder Mifflin was weird, but compared to that, HOLY CRAP! I bought this thinking it was going to be as good or better than the American version but was sadly disappointed.In conclusion, I think this is just a terrible waste of time and money and would not recommend it to anyone. The American version is awesome and RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully Unfunny Show All On Its Own","review":"Everybody here seems to be debating whether this is as good as the British version and I really don't care because this show is bad entirely on its own. Saw Steve Carrell in Forty Year Old Virgin and thought I'd give this a try. What a disappointment! So funny in Virgin and so irritating and unfunny in this show. I've worked with people like this boss too and I don't find them funny in real life or on TV. The character is so over-the-top that I can't believe any of the situations and neither do I think they're humorous. Most of them, like the diversity episode, are irritating and when they're not irritating they're boring. Carrell seems to be a real talent, at least when he's being original like in Virgin and I dread seeing his waste his talent on this show and an upcoming remake of Get Smart. This isn't the best sit-com since Seinfeld, it's the worst sit-com since \\"Hello, Larry.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The Office","review":"One of the funniest shows on television.

Not having paid attention closely, I was surprised to find that it was only six episodes. That aside, the six episodes were all extremely entertaining. Steve Carrell is ingenious as Michael Scott, the regional manager with absolutely no class. He really shines in \\"Diversity Day.\\" Also, as someone who started watching The Office during the second season, it was nice to be able to come back and see how everything began. This was definitely a worthwhile purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfunny Lead Performance Dooms This Show","review":"Steve Carrell's acting job in this comedy is just unbelievable. As other reviewers have noted, his character is so outrageous and so out-of-bounds that he's totally unbelievable. That dooms the rest of the show, as everything revolves around Carrell's character. Maybe he was trying to top the BBC version, but I expected so much better from him after seeing his movie roles, that this show was a total letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pining for Slough...","review":"The writing talents of Stephen Merchant & Ricky Gervais, and the acting talents of Mackenzie Crook, Gervais et al are sorely missed in this disappointingly humourless American version of 'The Office'. For anyone who hasn't seen the original, it may be worth a look. For fans of the BBC version, best to avoid. Miscast, and with characters that are not as endearing, this series has struggled to find its feet since episode one. Steve Carell is a charismatic comedy actor, but he overplays his role terribly. When Gervais and Merchant remade their pilot episode, they chose to drop some of the more obvious and hammy gags they originally scripted and filmed, noting that \\"this was the sitcom we promised we'd never make.\\" Unfortunately, someone else now has."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crude and not funny.","review":"This show is as painful as working in an office full of drunk idiots would be.

This however is not the case. This show takes every subtle comedic nuance of the original and has steve carrell beat you over the head with it.

I am very intelligent college grad, executive, however, the dialect, the humor, the jokes are all a real miss. I was not pleased to have invested time in this series. The only real redeeming fact was that it does have a typical \\"office\\" setting with typical \\"office\\" employees without typical \\"office\\" days. Get this from the library if you really want to see it. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is funny?","review":"This has to be the lamest most stupid TV show ever.Good humor is rooted in reality. However, rather than being a dilbert type where there is reality The Office just goes off the deep end of stupid. The boss would have been fired years ago. The supporting characters are weak and apathetic.The characters and dialogue are painful to the eyes and ears. The writers should be embarrassed and hold their heads in shame.This show I do not blame on acting, this one lays at the feet of producers, director, and script writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"good, but not the US type of good","review":"this was entertaining but not as good or funny as our U.S. show. it is a different feel of comedy, but it still made me laugh"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best New Sitcom In Years","review":"If you love political incorrectness the way I do, you will love this show. By far the best new sitcom to come along in years. If you work in an office, the absurdities will make perfect sense to you. The show is a little slow at times, but the best parts more than make up for it. Great extras contained here too. Can't wait for the new season to start!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes the US version look like Romper Room.","review":"I'm a very proud American but I have to say the UK version of The Office series is so much better than the US version on so many levels. The writing is very clever and the characters are fantastic which makes the situations they get into even more enjoyable to watch. I watched the UK version first, which came before and US version. I have to say that when I watched the US Office series I was very disappointed. Ricky Gervais is so good as the boss everyone loves to hate. If you're a big fan of the US series then this version will probably spoil it for you...But see it anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best TV has to offer!","review":"Incredibly funny stuff!!

Or should I say, non-action! For nothing much happens in \\"The Office.\\" Not unlike what goes on in most offices! And therein lies the joke."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific show","review":"This is such a funny show. The humor makes you cringe but laugh out loud at the same time. A thoughtful interpretation of modern office life with unforgettable characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why can't I give it 6 stars?","review":"It's unfortunate that the best ranking I can give this show is the same lowly 5 stars that 8 billion unthinking people probably gave the movie Titanic (admitedly, I haven't confirmed those numbers).This is, hands down, the best and funniest show on television right now.It is also in the running for best and funniest television show ever made.Watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughs","review":"If you love the office, you will love it british style as well. It takes a few minutes to get into it, but once you do it is just as funny as the americanized version.

Hope you all like it as much as I do!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only 6 episodes but worth getting","review":"People will argue which version of The Office is better, some will side with the UK version and some will side with the US version. If you were smart, you'd equally enjoy both of them. The dvd itself may be a bit expensive for only 6 episodes but the deleted scenes equal up to almost an hours worth of footage. Each of these episodes are cut at around 30-34 minutes, but when they air on nbc only 21 minutes can be shown. So these deleted scenes are just basic \\"extra\\" scenes... they're actually as funny as the regular show... so it's a great bonus. You really need to get this dvd, because you'll be playing it over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious TV show!","review":"This DVD has a total of 6 shows. 1 of the shows is the pilot episode.I started watching this show during Season 2. It is a must to go and watch Season 1 to learn how the characters come about.This DVD is hilarious and is a must for any fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Office: Lost In Translation","review":"I had never seen the original British version of \\"The Office,\\" so I decided to check it out after being unimpressed with the American redo. If I were Steve Carell's manager and agent, I would make sure he doesn't follow up his triumph in \\"The 40 Year Old Version\\" by playing Maxwell Smart in a movie. Do something original so you don't suffer by comparison, and boy does the American version of \\"The Office\\" suffer. I can see why it's bombed in the ratings and it will fail again when it returns in the fall. It seems more interested in being clever than funny with hamfisted performances and self satisfied writing that probably makes the cast and crew laugh, but not audiences. While not as bad as the American attempts to do \\"Fawlty Towers,\\" this is still a failure. Once it's cancelled, Steve Carell will go onto, if not bigger, better things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Childish and Stupid \\"Office\\" An Example Of How Far TV Has Fallen","review":"Ten years ago a show this bad never would have made it on air, let alone be renewed for a second season. It tries so hard to be \\"smart\\" and cool but winds up being stilted and irritating. How they got a guy as funny as Steve Carrell to be unfunny I'll never know, but leave it to the network that brought us \\"Joey\\" to do it. Warming over other networks' shows is no way to create comedy classics. Find great people and let them create, as they did with Seinfeld, Cosby and Cheers. If they want something funny and creative, they should let Carrell create his own show and stop sticking him in remakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlikeable Show With Unlikeable Lead","review":"I loved Steve Carrell in Anchorman but his character in The Office is so unlikeable and unbelievable that the show just doesn't work. Instead of being funny, it's uncomfortable to watch Carrell's Michael Scott in action. I've got to think it's a writing problem because Carrell is a pretty talented guy, but he can't quite pull off making the creepy and offensive Michael a believable boss. It's painfully obvious what he's going to do and how he's going to offend everyone, so there's no joy or levity in the awkward moments. Carrell and the cast struggle valiantly, but the show just can't overcome the unlikeable situations and people. It's hard to follow a legendary performace as Carrell tries here (and apparently will try again as Maxwell Smart) and this is another remake that should have remained on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still haven't got it.","review":"I ordered this series a month ago, I received in the mail a completely different movie addressed to someone in connecticut ( I live in Louisiana) I then payed out of my own pocket to mail it to the address on the slip.

But we all had the same reaction, even after the first 3 episodes.Don't get me wrong, on paper, the summaries sound hilarious. I'm just guessing the problem is with the delivery. I don't know if it is the handheld camera, the lack of a laugh track, or the fact that 100% of all acting in a cubed environment. It could even be that much of the humor is physical, buried in gestures and not so much in the dialog.Maybe if you don't work in a cubed environment it might be funny to you (hit too close to home for me), but just a warning that I've yet to find anyone I know who can tollerate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dryer than dry","review":"If you are expecting Steve Carell with an English accent, then don't watch the British version of the Office.

So if this information was what you were looking for, you've found the only review that specifically tells you that all the episodes are pixel edited just as on television, so no, you're not gonna see any boobs, dicks, ass or snatch. If that's what you were wondering, wonder no more. Does this mean in a few years we might see ANOTHER full set of discs unedited? I suppose it's possible that at some point in the future, they'll offer the full, un-pixilated versions, but this fact should NOT stop you from buying this set. It's great if you can live with the pixel editing. It's the same on all Season releases. Check my other cool reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!!!!

And that's a shame. Because as the show progressed, it started finding its groove. The actors started developing a chemistry that was independent of their UK doppelgangers. Yes, some scripts were still derivative, like \\"The New Girl,\\" but as long as it's not cancelled after the first 2 weeks of the second season, if people find it or give it that second chance, I think they'll be thrilled with the results. Obviously, I can't comment on the technical aspects of the disc like some of the plants around here do. All I can say is I already burned most of the episodes on DVD-R, and I'm still buying the collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great show!","review":"I love the office!

I am simply disappointed in the sender, \\"Direct Buy Video\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great 'Office' Reference","review":"I wasn't a loyal Office viewer until Season 2. So, a lot of 'oh, that's what that means' or 'that's what they're talking about' questions were answered on the Season One DVD (ie: how Jim met Katie, why Micheal wears the Drakkar Noir knockoff).I most enjoyed seeing the transformation of Ryan's opinion of Michael. 'Pliot' Ryan clearly thinks Michael is sort of cool, to 'Hot Girl' where Michael is the jerk who made Ryan clean out his car.Comparing the two seasons the second in my opinion is stil far superior. But, this DVD is great for any Office fan's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected","review":"I saw all of The Office's except this one.

Some reviewers don't understand the sometimes subtle, but substantially different, slants of each production. The fact is, American management tends to be unlikable and mean spirited. British management is different.This comes out in the American version. Perhaps it would have been more accurate to have a female manager who's an idiot and not well liked. In this country, women bosses tend to be hated by even female employees. I've only had one male boss in 24 years and I only had one I liked.But Michael Scott fits in well with the corporate male boss who's the most clueless guy in the organization."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Office Season 1","review":"Watching the first season was painful as hell.

It would be a cool stocking stuffer this Christmas!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You will either get or won't","review":"The few one star reviews on here are from the people who DON'T get the show. No slight on them, it's just the nature of Satire. Some people can't see the irony or the humour in this show.Having said that, I found this show hilarious and scary sometimes at the same time. The 2n season ups the ante in cringe-worthy moments. So if you enjoyed this one, get the next one as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best TV Show","review":"One of the best TV comedy shows ever, next to friends. First season is short and not as funny as the later seasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"this would be funny if I wasn't living it!!","review":"Ok, just kidding on that subject! This series is hilarious and one of the things that makes it so is that it's so true to real life, at least for me. If you've ever spent time in the \\"Dilbert Cube\\" or a dead-end job, you should get a kick out of this. The writing is excellent as is the mostly unknown cast.I also recommend the UK version of this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Value?","review":"This season, like all the seasons of The Office is hilarious. The Office is a totally fresh and different comedy. However the first season is only 6 episodes, yet is still close to the same price as the other full season DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant stuff","review":"This brief series is truly brilliant. The humor ranges from outright funny to cringingly uncomfortable and zings you when you least expect it. Ricky Gervais is stellar and plays the part of the pathetic and hopelessly self-deluded David Brent to perfection; add a terrific supporting cast and you have a show that will hold up to repeated viewings and achieve classic status much like \\"Fawlty Towers\\". Why four stars from me? The inclusion of some pretty raunchy dialog which some may enjoy while others need to know about so they can be careful watching around the kiddies. I love the US version of \\"The Office\\" and give much of the credit for it's success to the fact that Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant co-executive produce it, but the UK version stands on it's own as not only the original but the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"The office - review","review":"next to curb your enthusiasm, the best show on television. Can't wait for season two to be released."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only series that makes me laugh","review":"Aside from a few comedy central shows, I haven't had a series on one of the main broadcasting channels (NBC, FOX etc.) keep me interested and laughing as much as The Office did. I heard that the characters are encouraged to improvise while filming which may be why this show has its unpredictability. Would recommend to everyone to at least give it a try on netflix. Plan on buying the blu rays of the first season."},{"rating":"1","title":"Judged On Its Own Merits - It's Awful","review":"I'm not one of those people who dreaded another U.S. remake of a \\"Brit classic,\\" I've never seen the BBC original and now I never will. I was a big fan of Steve Carrell on The Daily Show so I eagerly awaited this series. The first show was horrible and though the following episodes were better, they still were not funny at all. Carrell was annoying, not funny, and the situations were only laughable at how poorly they were executed by the creative staff. Carrell is so funny on his own; I'm sorry to hear that he's continuing doing remakes with Get Smart 2 and Bruce Almighty 2. He deserves better and so does the comedy watching public."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phew, is this bad!","review":"This one is just plain terrible. I rented this after seeing the Forty Year Old Virgin and can't believe it's the same guy in both. I can't believe that they even call this a comedy. Reviewers are comparing this to Seinfeld? Seinfeld was a beautiful exercise in subtlety. The Office is about as subtle as an elephant on roller skates and nowhere near as funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Six Episodes is Six Too Many","review":"I watched the first episode and was appalled that this show made it on the air. At the urging of some friends, I tried another episode and it was just as bad. When the lead character of a show is supposed to be an awful person, it takes an amazing amount of talent to keep that character from being so miserable a human being that they're watchable and even funny. John Cleese could do it in Fawlty Towers and Jennifer Saunders did it in Ab Fab, but Steve Carrell couldn't do it here. His boss is annoying and unbelievable and the rest of the cast isn't much better. Uninspired direction and painful attempts to be witty instead of funny make every minute of this show painful to watch. So funny in Anchorman, I'm now dreading to see what Carrell does as Maxwell Smart, as he seems to need to create his own characters in order to be humorous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good intentions","review":"The Office is a mockumentary surrounding a group of typical office workers, where their workday consists of ego clashes, inappropriate behavior, and tedium. What worked so well in the BBC program fails to translate in the American version. The awkward silences, the confessionals, and the naturalism seem artificial. Unfortunately the majority of the actors seem overly in on the joke and preoccupied with trying to recreate what made the British version flow so well, causing the show to feel unnatural and forced. The subtle blink-and-you-miss-um jokes feel all too unsubtle and sometimes over the top. The only actor who manages to rise above this and slam dunk all of the jokes is Steve Carell, the star of the show. Somehow I feel the American version of \\"The Office\\" is worthy of a laugh-track, and that's never a good thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Americans have completely missed the point","review":"Americans took the genius script of Ricky Gervais, watered it down and completely missed the point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrrrrrrrrrrrrrring!","review":"It's not funny or interesting at all. I can't believe this is even out on DVD with only six terrible episodes when so many great shows aren't on DVD. Who let Steve Carrell pick this bomb for his first starring role? There's nothing redeeming at all about this series for me to even mention, as it's poorly conceived and executed. Avoid it and watch Anchorman if you want to see Carrell in a good role."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressive show","review":"It is the most depressive and unpleasant show I have ever seen in my life. I've caught myself turning my face off the TV.. It is about cocaine-boosted idiot that runs a small office of several fully suppressed individuals. All I feel about these people is sincere sorry - this show calls no smile on my face, not even speaking of laugh or joy. They are trying to pick up on some office stereotypes and insanities but they go so far that it feels more like a clinic... Not recommended at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but a bit misleading.","review":"I enjoyed the episodes that were on the DVD.... but I thought, with the title THE OFFICE SEASON ONE, it would include all the episodes of Season One and not just 3.I was left wanting more....... much more!However, the three episode included in this DVD were funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wasn't impressed","review":"I watched it because a friend had the DVD but I felt it painful to watch. I hate the main guy, I don't think he's realistic at all. The point of the show obviously is to satirize offices, but even in the corporate world, a manager like that would've been fired long ago. The girl/boy relationship is the best thing about it.My friend says the british version is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"annoying","review":"Annoying. That's why I NEVER BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT !!!

My only complain with the DVD release is that we all know Speilberg and Lucas to having to always change things that are unnecessary. Some of the characters are dubbed with new dialog, new sound effects were added from the storm scene, and some missing from the iant mouse of minsk scenes.

If I could, I would return this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Above all expectations!","review":"I purchased this Diamond Sharpening Steel from Amazon and have used it for a couple of days. It really works superb and overall performance is above all expectations. It not only realigns the edge but sharpens it as well. I.e. it removes material (steel) in infinitesimal amount that accumulates on the surface of the tool as extremely fine dust. It takes only a few effortless strokes for simple edge realignment if the knife is sharp or few minutes of work if the knife is dull. But in any case, the result is amazing! Once in a while this Diamond Sharpening Steel should be put under running water for only a few seconds for cleaning and steel dust residue flushes with water. Maintenance is simple and easy.So, whether you have cheap knives or expensive ones this tool is worth the money. The only issue I leave open is durability of this Diamond Sharpening Steel. Theoretically it should last forever but in reality it remains to be seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"There is nothing in a kitchen more dangerous than a dull knife. I cooked for a living when I was younger and appreciate the need for a well maintained tool. I've had Henckels knives for over 20 years, kept them very sharp and rarely had to use a stone to do so - and never a strop. My old steel wore out and I was excited about this one. With it, I have reduced sharp knives to my version of garbage - the steel is simply too coarse. I don't require a \\"polished\\" edge but I do require sharp and this steel will not do the job."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ultimate Edge Standard Diamond Sharpening Steel","review":"I bought this sharpening steel a few years ago, and it worked great in the beginning. It left the knife edge re-shaped but a little rough, so I used a regular steel to remove the roughness. As time went by, I noticed that the diamond cutting power was reducing and now the middle section of the ultimate edge diamond sharpening steel has little or no diamonds left on it. It will not re-shape a knife edge anymore and barely smooths the edge as well as a good regular steel. I just ordered a new diamond steel from a different manufacturer (Wusthof). Another negative is the fact the knife edge particles that are removed clog the space in between the diamond particles and must be removed on a regular basis. There are some other designs that work better I believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works for a few times...","review":"This product wears out fast and then does nothing. Don't waste your money.

I had to write it for my father's father, who was blind and had alzheimer's, and I was so glad that I did. Everytime I read it now that he has passed I can almost hear his voice. My mother's father did his without me but gave me a lot of information that the family didn't know. My family actually used it to help plan his funeral when he passed. If I had any complaint about this particular book it is that it focused so much on religion that it seemed to ask very similar questions several times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotionally Breathtaking","review":"My daughter was 18 months when we purchased this for her grandfather. When he opened it Christmas morning he had tears in his eyes. I know that when my daughter is older and her grandfather gives her the book back (with his life written inside), she will have tears too. The book has beautiful pictures in it and everything will be listed that you might want to know about a grandfather.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Christian","review":"I've been looking for a grandfather-specific journal to give to my father-in-law. This looked respectable enough but I was disappointed to find Christian prompts and biblical quotes at the bottom of every page. If you're not Christian, you might be willing to overlook questions like \\"Your favorite verse about God\\". Unfortunately it's harder to ignore the random bible quotes at the end of every section.\\"We love Him because He first loved us.\\" This book is less of a celebration of the grandfather in your life and more of a devotion to the Christian faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Combat a needed but only periodically needed suppliment","review":"I found the World of Darkness book of Combat to be a helpful book. There are times when you need a system to help define what someone can and cannot do.The system still sticks to its old adage of the Storyteller being the final arbitrator of all disputes but it gives back to the players a bit of power to define what their character can and cannot do.A few areas of improvement: I feel the book could have used an alternative set of rules for separate martial arts and the handling of a differing but combined styles. I feel that maneuvers were too expensive for what they do. Especially since anyone can do any of the maneuvers but only with a higher difficulty number.With a few minor alterations I have found it to be a most helpful book. However, the rules should not be used in every situation combat occurs. It slows the play down considerably.

I've read Crichton and Clancy, but for me Cassutt is the third \\"C\\" in this genre, and one whose works I particularly enjoy as spaceflight history is something very near and dear to my heart, and the subject of many of my own books. He is a gifted writer, and this is a beautifully-paced, well-written story that is very closely based on contemporary spaceflight matters and philosophies. I think in another five years I will retrieve this and the other two books (\\"Missing Man\\" and \\"Red Moon\\") from my bookshelf once again and enjoy them all over again. I might also add that as a writer I also rely very heavily on Michael's non-fiction books on spaceflight history - they are regarded by me and many others as the definitive source of reliable and well-presented facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pedantic","review":"If you are new to mysteries and suspense, then perhaps you will think this is a great read. If you like space and the possibilities of space then perhaps you will think this is a great read. If you like the jargon of space and NASA then you will think this is a great read.But it is not. The writing is very simplistic. The plot is transparent early on, and thus there is no suspense. The use of flashbacks and scene chopping is maintained through a great deal of the work and makes the book a puzzle to read.The premise started well, and if the book had gone in the direction of a Crichton thriller with the use of the biochemistry arena that the jacket purports it will, then the story would have succeeded far better. In all waste your money elsewhere, Cassutt is not ready for fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"generally well done","review":"The other reviewers describe this as a fine outline of Jewish views on a variety of matters, and I agree. One caveat: the last 100-200 pages (which focus on the Holocaust and Israel) are essentially a description of Jewish history rather than Jewish ideas, so I thought they belonged in another book.

I understand how Snort works, how to deploy it, and most importantly, the pragmatic side of using Snort in the real world.This is by far the best of the Snort books out right now, the others are either low on detail or are extremely poorly written.

I'm buying this book again so that I will have an up-to-date edition. I'm an amateur astronomer and I still use and love this book.

It's copyrighted 1952 and I doubt that there has been one bit of update. The author saw fit to illustrate the star-maps with crude handmade drawings. You've seen the type. It's basically a book for your local library's Children's Section.Anyone who has seen a very dated, and hand-drawn book dealing with astronomy will know this kind of work. Pass it up.

The tables run from 1997-2006. The tables in the current edition are therefore out of date (type \\"134\\" into the \\"Search Inside\\" box and look at pp. 134 and 135).I realize this is a minor quibble, and it is the ONLY reason for my 4-star rating.

Wonderful!!","review":"About 12 years ago, I checked this book out of the library and was immediately pleased to discover how quickly and easily I was able to become familiar with a sky that used to be a confusing jumble of stars. I ended up renewing the book over and over again until I finally bought myself a copy. The author does such a wonderful job of drawing the constellations by connecting the stars in a way that makes them so easy to find. He also provides a little bit of history about each constellation which adds to the significance of what you are learning. An excellent manual for those who want stargazing to be easy and a whole lot of fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick Read; Completed my goal of learning constellations","review":"One of my recent goals was to learn the constellations. I think it's a simple thing for someone to do, given that all of us have access to the stars.I chose this book based on the current Amazon rating. The book was indeed valuable for me to learn the constellations. I was able to read this book easily within 2 weeks. Since I finished it in February, it was very chilly at night to look at the stars. So I spent about 20 minutes once or twice a week looking at the constellations in the book, based on the time of year, and memorizing the layout.Last week, the constellations were very bright near the beach. I was surprised at how quickly I was able to spot out 6 constellation groups. If I had the book with me, I would have been able to find another 6 constellations just by referencing the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book about the night sky","review":"When Albert Einstein, my Astrophysics professor, and the head Scoutmaster of America all highly recommend a book, what a book it must be! H.A. Rey's _The Stars_ whimsically and insightfully introduces you to the constellations. (Fans of Curious George will love his illustrations.) The book is acclaimed because Rey's constellation pictures actually make sense! Moreover, the last section 'Some Whys and Hows', clearly and wittily explains basic astronomy -- why the sky changes throughout the year, why you can see different constellations in the Southern hemisphere, why the Zodiac constellations are special, and more. This last section was invaluable in my first astrophysics course."},{"rating":"2","title":"THe Best Introduction to Observational Astronomy","review":"The Stars by H.A. Rey is a classic that is unsurpassed in it's accomplishment of it's intention. It is an introduction to observational astronomy. I have never found a better explanation of astronomical terms, celestial, lunar and planetary movement, and above all, the location and appearance of the constellations. If you don't believe me, read Albert Einstein's comment on the back cover! I have purchased and given away at least 10 copies. When someone asks me for a beginning book on astronomy I always recommend this and a pair of binoculars, (or its companion book for younger readers \\"Find The Constellations\\"). Most people will recognize the type and illustrations as the work of the author of the Curious George series of children's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a wonderful book","review":"I purchased this book because it was how I got interested in astronomy when I was 8 years old. It is a great introduction to stargazing and despite naysayers who don't like Rey's interpretation of the constellations, it is very friendly to young people who may want an introduction plus some more depth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read!","review":"This book is 100% guaranteed to keep the sparkle in your marriage as well as laughter. My favorite read on relationships. All the answers for a happy and healthy relationship can be found here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important Information for CBRN Professionals","review":"Not for the casual or typical reader, \\"America's Struggle...\\" is great background information for those closely engaged in the CBRN business. Love or hate Al Mauroni, he is the only contemporary author writing on the specifics of DoD's CBRN defense program. Particularly interesting is his description of the near death of the U.S. Chemical Corps and how circumstances and the actions of some key leaders helped preserve this key capability for the U.S. Army. Sections of the book dealing with materiel programs such as decontamination and protection detract and divert the reader's attention from the true strength of the book which is the history of policy making and action in this key area. Going for over $100 on Amazon, don't pay that much, but if you get your hands on this book, it is worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for a while.......","review":"Some say this game is horrible and a waste of money. If you ask me this is a fun game to play with a friend or by yourself. The one downfall of this game is you arm gets a workout and starts to hurt after playing for a while. But everything else in the game makes it all worth it, like building up you person in each event to try and win the gold metal. I use to rent the Playstation version, that's how I first heard of this game. Then when the Dreamcast version came out I bought it as soon as I saw it. The graphics, game play, sound and basically everything else is so much better on Dreamcast. This game is fun for the first week or two when you get it, but as most games you will get bored of it. But for 20 bucks its well worth it for those two weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Game","review":"If you've been told that your finger's are overweight and in need of a workout, then this game is for you. Otherwise pass this one up, if it's free pass it up, if it falls out of the sky and lands in your hands don't pass, run. The constant pressing and alternating of A+B buttons for every single event nearly crippled my hand. About 10 minutes after I bought this game I threw it out my window. It stunk that bad. If I could have given this game no stars I would have."},{"rating":"1","title":"What do you think my Dreamcast controller is, a drum??!!","review":"This game really [is not good] due to the fact that in every single solitary event you have to repeatedly press A and X. I'm not gonna break my fingers and my controller over that. The only game that's a little fun in it is kayaking, in which I was able to win. But everything else, including kayaking, was frustraing me and my hand. I couldn't even know what was going on with the cycling. The fitness excersices also [were not good] because they really didn't help you. I returned this game to the store the very next hour. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty but a bit small","review":"This is a lovely addition to the collection~however, it could be a little larger in order to accommodate a full size cake!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality glass dome","review":"I bought this item primarily for the glass dome to use with an 8 inch Anchor Hocking glass pedestal that was sold without a dome. I was pleasantly surprised that this was a nice heavy glass and not too delicate to hold up to everyday use. The grape patterned pedestal is nice, too, though. I'm sure I'll find a use for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wedding Gift","review":"We gave this as a wedding gift. They had it on their registry elsewhere. I was glad to find it here!

The stories are good to excellent. However, there seems to be a formatting problem with the Kindle conversion -- the copyright notice for each story is arbitrarily inserted somewhere in the story text instead of appearing in with the title and author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catch 33","review":"It's finally here, and was it worth the wait! This maybe the best effort Meshuggah has put out. It's very good! Most will hear the connection between \\"I\\" and \\"Catch 33\\" both musically and the fact that Catch Thirtythree is once again a single forty-seven minute single song, broken up into thirteen chapters with the lyrics signalling the end of one chapter to the next, rather than the music contained within. Catch Thirtythree doesn't stray much from the Meshuggah design of the past, and most likely won't convert those who have been unconvinced up until this point. It will also disappoint those who had hoped for another Destroy Erase Improve (1995) or Chaosphere (1998) too. They have progressed so much and gone above and beyond everything they've done before. Super technical well crafted metal music. Math Metal behemoths Meshuggah are back and better than ever. Pick up your copy today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wild.","review":"Meshuggah's music is relentlessly heavy. The only time the band takes a break from bewildering chugging guitar riffs and frantic drum patterns is to serve up some truly eerie atmospheres. And that's hardly ever. They'd much rather dish up crazy, ethereal moments of confusing madness.Sometimes listening to this album is quite a challenge. It certainly pushes my toleration for repetitive metal. Some will listen for maybe 10 minutes and will get earache...some will become entranced by the complex playing and some, like me, will do both, depending on my state of mind at the time.If you enjoy the more extreme side of metal, then this is surely for you. If you don't usually go for such stuff, but enjoy expanding horizons (like me), then it's well worth a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth buying","review":"Poor poor john hartley, if only he would clean the wax out of his ears he would then realize that this album is not nearly as bad as he says it is. John, ever heard of Q-tips? Well if not, then go study up on them, and then proceed to buy some whether or not you have heard of them cause they really work. Once you use them, then listen to this cd again and you will realize that you were so wrong from the beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"what is this?","review":"I'm an old meshuggah fan, I love all their works and I only was a bit disappointed with _nothing_.

I hope they change their sound in the next release."},{"rating":"1","title":"YaY","review":"same song played over and over again.dont believe me? listen to at LEAST the first 3 tracks and close your eyes lol."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is a piece of crap","review":"I have been listening to heavy metal as long as I can remember. I have a very open mind when it comes to different styles of music, but I must admit that I am a bit surprised by the number of positive comments posted for this album. I think most people are a little biased, and are forming opinions based on the bands other (and much better) albums. There is absolutely nothing good to say about this album, and I certainly do not recommend purchasing it. If you must get your fix, I will sum up the entire album for you:[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"horribely overrated","review":"it seems the tech bands nowadays have always had a goal, to exerpiment new ideas and push there techinque aspects by playing faster and or more complicated. Catch Thirty Three.....in designs seems like so, but all this record is a repetitive over wrought death march that goes absolutely no where. The albums high points are the opcassional rythyms shifts and the offbeat time signatures that are beat to living death out of.The songwriting is awful (its a 47 minute song that couldve easily been 20), the progessive element is a fools gold joke. After hearing bands like Between the Buried and Me and Dream Theater its hard to be impressed by an album of such dull calibur."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meshuggah?","review":"This is by far the worst album I've ever heard! The whole one song to a cd thing is very overrated. The worst thing is that the guitar riffs never seem to change. I love other Meshuggah albums, but this one is just trash. Would highly reccommend you listen to this album before you buy it, or else you'll be stuck with this one song wonder. For shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"i hate this cd","review":"dude...messhgugah totally freakin sold out...i hate them now, if you area fan of this band go buy sum of there earlier cds like destroy/rebuild or wutevr its called. the ep I was very good, so i thought that this cd would hold to its standards, but NO. dont buy this cd, its a waste"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave this about 10 seconds, 9 more than it deserved","review":"I recommend this for the deaf, they would be least harmed by it."},{"rating":"1","title":"avoid this trash at all costs","review":"Disingenuously selling itself as a clever spoof of recently popular independent movies, this film is instead a vile, sophomoric, and idiotic waste of time. The R rating is, unfortunately, a totally insufficient warning of the crud that marches across the screen from the opening scene, when the viewer, without warning, becomes witness to a male-male scene of simulated anal sex...and goes down hill from there. Obviously geared for the crude tastes of middle-school bad boys, this mess is an insult to viewers of all ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst","review":"I saw this in L.A. in October. There were three other people in the theater besides myself, and two of them left. There were points where I even fell asleep. I see what they were trying to do, but ultimately they failed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spoofing Good Movies...","review":"Why is it nowadays producers find the need to spoof good movies? That's all this film does in an attempt to be funny. I was already taken back in the beginning when they started off by making fun of Pulp Fiction, one of the greatest movies ever. I'm all for making fun of Bring It On and such but leave the great films alone.What I don't understand is in order to even understand most of the films they mock, the viewer would have to be in their mid-twenties yet the humor is that of a middle-schooler. Either society is dumbing down with age or the younger are getting old way too fast. The only reason it gets two stars is in hope that whoever watches this will go out and rent the films this \\"movie\\" trashed on."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW -- what a load of $*%&^!","review":"I so wanted to like this movie and was looking forward to enjoying a good spoof parody film in the genre of SCARY MOVIE or NOT ANOTHER TEEN MOVIE. But this film was not one tenth as funny as these examples. SM and NATM are not great films but they do make me laugh and are better than other similar films like HOTSHOTS, AIRPLANE and POLICE ACADEMY. I was expecting something within the same ball park from BIG FAT INDEPENDENT MOVIE. It's seems in theory that this premise could work. Make fun of all the independent movies of the last 10 to 15 years. But this was crap because of the lame actors and terrible script which inevitably means bad direction as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"The Burgess books are very very great.

Jack Maggs was to me a most sympathetic character, and his adventure a compelling one. The descriptive passages were excellent; I could see, feel and hear those dismal London streets. My only confusion with the book was that some of the characters seemed to change \\"character\\" as the story went along; Buckle, for instance, who started out as a sympathetic, kindly fellow, turned out a villian. And Jack's \\"reception\\" by the other characters seemed to be inconsistent--one minute they sympathized, the next they didn't. And what happened to Silas? Did he die in prison?Despite that, and the fact that I had to read the first chapter or so over again to get my bearings, I thought it a wonderful book, full of adventure, skullduggery, and a charming ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing in many ways","review":"The premise of the book is very good and even the characters are excellant but after that it falls short. I love Dickens and this book is a sore excuse for a spin off. While set in the time of Dickens little else here resembles a Dickens work. The plot is just your standard modern day [same old stuff]. This is the kind of book that makes you so sick of modern day literature that you long to read the old classics like Great Expectations again. Unfortunately, Dickens is dead while Carey lives on to write more sub-par books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless","review":"I finished this book and sat wondering why I'd read it. I found the plot random, the characters confusing, some of the details suspicious. I enjoy these books that put a spin on some old classic, but this invites comparison, and this is not a good idea in this case. I think this writer was trying to show us the dark side of Dickens. Nice try, I guess. Or not. I'd go for Charles Palliser's \\"The Quincunx\\" for that. I ask myself why all these other people liked this book so much. I think they have low expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Great Expectations, Skip Jack Maggs","review":"Out of the 41 online reviews thus far, only three have not recommended this book as a good read. I am proud to be the fourth. I was informed that Jack Maggs is told from the perspective of the convict Abel Magwitch (from Great Expectations). Besides the fact that Jack Maggs is a convict illegally returning to London, I recognize no Abel Magwitch in him. Furthermore, Carey's other characters are either not based or are so loosely based on Dickens' characters as not to be recognizable. Overall, Carey's plot, characterization, and dialogue are seriously lacking. I wish this book had never been associated with such a great work as Dickens' Great Expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finally gave up on it.","review":"I've been trying to read Jack Maggs for the past couple of weeks. I found myself always trying to find something else to do. This included catching up on magazines, playing Freecell on my PC, etc. Tonight I finally gave up at about the halfway point in the book. Unfortunately, I didn't really care about what happened to the characters and didn't find the story at all captivating or even interesting. I read quite a bit and it's pretty unusual for me to quit halfway through a novel. Obviously many readers loved the book, but I didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting, romantic, clever, delightful","review":"This is an excellent book. I loved the way it was written, how all the elements of the story were tied together without its ever seeming contrived. It was the best of Dickens without the struggle of trying to understand old-fashioned language or satire on subjects I know nothing about. I would like to read it over again more slowly to savor it. I've never read all of \\"Great Expectations,\\" but now I might try it again. My favorite Dickens book is \\"Bleak House.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Only if you've nothing better to do ...","review":"I can't help feeling there is something autobiographical in Carey's portrayal of Tobias Oates, an author who annotates each page with the fee he will receive for it. Whilst the quality of writing is excellent, you can never lose the sense that this is a book written by method - the characters have colour but never live; the plot holds but only weakly and at the end you are interested but don't care.As such, the book is the literary equivalent of a TV mini-series. If you have a quiet weekend ahead, then this is as good a way as any to fill it - but make sure you've exhausted all the alternatives first."},{"rating":"1","title":"It ain't Dickens","review":"Yes, Great Expectations is obviously the inspiration, but Jack Maggs is certainly not comparable. It's a plodding book with a plot contrived to make a boring postcolonial point. The mesmerisim device fails to mesmerize, the selective details of 19th century London are sparse and unable to conjure the pictured streets Dickens so ably conveys in all their uproar and foggy familiarity, and the characters--while I suppose more psychologically ambiguous thanks to Carey's having benefitted from 20th century novel writing and all that Freudian guff--barely stick in the mind the way Dickens caricatures do. A novelist should be prepared to do justice to the chosen source material. Jack Maggs hardly does so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not universal as described!!!","review":"It's not universal...This so called pin lock only fits the small half inch hole on the receiver and is lightweight and cheap.

Absolutely fantastic book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good advice rarely is heeded....","review":"Romm brings quite a bit of expertise and gravitas to his arguments. Arguably in the know about government policy practices Romm lays out both a convincing scenario about global climate modification (see no GW balderdash!)and a set of coherent policy solutions to prevent the worst of the problem.

After listening to some more songs like the infectious \\"Sea of Stars\\" and \\"Run to You\\", I knew I had to buy their album Departure in which the songs can be found on. Ever since I received the album just yesterday, I have been unable to stop listening to it. I am simply hooked on the melodies, pulsating dance beats and Henrik's vocals. The songs are really fun to listen or to dance to. Despite the fact that Henrik left the band, I am looking forward to the group's next album. I definitely recommend for synthpop fans to check out Code 64 and their Departure album.

Perfect for mixed groups, not all action and not all romance, but a nice balance of both with a good measure of slapstick and clean enough that your grandma won't be offended. Then Dennis Quaid whips out that crowd-pleasing smile, and you can overlook Kathleen Turner's bizarre low voice.And don't forget Stanley Tucci!

Perhaps he expectedHigh Cinema and instead got simply a good, funny movie. Dennis Quaid and Kathleen Turner have a wonderful chemistry as Jeff and Jane Blue, Fiona Shaw is perfect as the evil Novacek, Obba Babbatunde and Larry Miller are delightful as the hapless detectives, Park Overall and Tom Arnold are great as the \\"normal\\" couple, and Stanly Tucci absolutely steals every scene as Muerte (\\"as in Death\\") the would-be mugger.

I came upon it by accident on TV late one night and have been a fan ever since. Turner and Quaid work very well together and the villainess is a hammy overracted gem. The humour is gentle but persistent and mature in a way that it appeals to adults rather than 3 year olds. I think this film is underrated and deserves to be on more people's must see lists. My wife and I seldom agree on what is a good movie but we both like this one.The DVD transcription is okay but if you demand copious extras look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh out loud funny","review":"This is one of my favorite films. I know it isn't a \\"great\\" film like Citizen Kane but it is one I get a kick out of every time I watch it, which has been many many times. Stanly Tucci as Muerte is an absolute riot. Kathleen Turner and Dennis Quaid are perfect together as a loving, dedicated couple with a less than a year old baby daughter, who just happen to be undercover agents, on maternity leave, in New Orleans. Of course they don't stay on maternity leave for long as they get pulled back into service to stop an old adversary from selling experimental high explosives to terrorists around the world. If that sounds serious, it is about the only thing in the film that is. From start to finish. it is a lighthearted lark with great comedic performances from all involved."},{"rating":"2","title":"My name is Muerte!","review":"Undercover Blues would never win any Academy award, but despite some of the rather sappy and silly dialogue and unbelievable stunts, this movie somehow works. The chemistry between Kathleen Turner and Dennis Quaid works as we really believe they're a couple of spys on maternity leave vacationing in New Orleans. Stanley Tucci as \\"Morty\\" steals the show as a ne'er do well thug out for revenge while Larry Miller with his comic southern accent holds his own as an out-of-the-know Nawlins dectective. Watch out for the seen with Saul Rubinek as Turner & Quaid talk over his head. Some gags, like the bank van go ridiculously over the top, but it's supposed to be a fun movie, not for deep thinking! The movie is filled with lots of action and gives Ms. Turner a chance to even \\"dress down\\" a bit. It's stil PG because of some cursing and violence, but still overall very watcheable. \\"Don't miss the gators, sister.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Undercover Blues","review":"One of the funniest movies out there.

When I watched it this time I realized that the humor was a bit silly but still entertaining. If you liked Kathleen Turner in other film like \\"Jewel of the Nile\\" I think you will enjoy this little known gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this movie","review":"Undercover Blues is an under rated classic. Stanley Tucci is hilarious. I love the interaction between Cathlene Turner and Randy Quaid. Story is so-so, but it is fun from beginning to end. Larry Miller is also hilarious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supporting Cast Adds Spark","review":"There are enough laughs to make this worth seeing. There are enough odd characters, too. That's no surprise when you see the supporting cast: Stanley Tucci, Larry Miller, Fiona Shaw and Tom Arnold. All of them put added spark to the film.Tucci, as \\"Meurte,\\" is most obvious as he continually tries to mug the leading couple, played by Kathleen Turner and Dennis Quaid. Miller plays a weird cop with a lisp and a very weird accent. I guess you could call this movie \\"quirky.\\"Turner and Quaid are so smug as modern-day Nick and Nora Charles, you want to root for \\"Muerte\\" to succeed. Frankly, I never found Turner, except perhaps in \\"Body Heat,\\" to be that alluring. However, I think she is an underrated comedienne.As a whole, this comedy is a little rough in spots, hence the PG-13 rating which often means more profanity than R-rated films. This is not for the kiddies, but adults will laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor!","review":"I couldn't even get through the first 1/3 of this movie. The jokes are not here. The acting is poor. For an action comedy, where is the comedy?The worst part is the script. So hackneyed and formulaic, one has to wonder, where did this guy learn how to write?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Soooooooooo smart and funny!","review":"Don't heed Marshall Fine's review of Undercover Blues; he's wrong! This movie such a hidden gem it's sick! I'm a reasonably savvy moviergoer and I know what I likes. And I likes this movie. I've never been a huge Dennis Quaid fan but I gotta admit, he rocked in this film. Stanley Tucci is absolutely hilarious in his ridiculous and somewhat loveable badguy role. Kathleen Turner is also excellent, as is the perennially funny Larry Miller (I love that dude!). Honestly, rent or even buy this movie. Good for kids AND adults, and smart in a subtle manner. A truly good comedy that curiously slipped through the cracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the funniest movies ever!","review":"This is without doubt my favorite comedy-espionage movie, much funnier than either Austin Powers film. Dennis Quaid and Kathleen Turner are terrific and the supporting cast is hilarious, too. Morty/Muerte is a riot and the ending is perfect. With the exception of one use of the f-word, there's nothing objectionable since most of the violence is somewhat light-hearted, from the stroller self-defense right down to the mud-fight at the end. It's too bad the critics blasted it and the box office was small or I could look forward to a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Undercover Blues is the spy spoof side splitter of the year.","review":"Here it is...a James Bond 'knock-off' rip-roaring, tongue tickling, spy spoofing, movie ...and if you can say that without tripping, then this is a must see movie. Like Tango & Cash, Turner & Quaid find themselves a once again rehired CIA spy duo out to save the 'World'. Along the way, they run into a scene stealing 'El Fuento' co-star. Grab the popcorn for this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Movie is SO funny!","review":"My Friends and I LOVE \\"Undercover Blues.\\" Muerte is hilarious, and Quaid's sarcasm accents the humor. A definite must see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book Discussion Book","review":"\\"Don't Leave Me This Way\\" is a fast read that centers on how the medical community deals with patients.

She now has a better understanding and has removed the mental ward number off of her speed dial.

What happened to Julia is what you pray every day doesn't happen to you. And yet somehow, without candy coating it, she is able to transform it into a positive experience. This alone would be remarkable, but to then author a book that is so unabashedly blunt, insightful, and at times wickedly funny is an admirable achievement. This book is a must read for all health care providers and stroke patients."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Leave Me Like This","review":"The title denotes the determination in Julia's attitude,toward life and this situation.

I love the music I've heard on the Invictus label; addictively catchy post-Motown soul from Holland-Dozier-Holland and their great stable of artists. But Ruth Copeland? She is nothing more than a dreadful hippy-chick who warbles and screetches over some truly awful material. There are a handful of good tracks here: the excellent \\"The Music Box\\" (until she starts her crying jag in the middle!) and of course the gem \\"The Silent Boatman.\\" But \\"I Got a Thing for you Daddy\\" is as horrid at the title implies, and the world does not need more half-rate covers of \\"Play with Fire\\" and \\"Gimme Shelter.\\" Not even some wicked Eddie Hazel guitar playing can save this mess of an album (actually two albums on one disc). If you are an Invictus fan, stay way clear of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"no wonder I never heard of her!","review":"After seeing a DJ in a Garage dance party holding up her album, I did some research, and it sounded intriguing: the songwriting team of Holland/Dozier/Holland (the best and most successful Motown writers, along with Smokey Robinson) started a record label after Motown. They signed her, so she must be good, right? Ugh.Her voice is - on a raw level - very good. But her DELIVERY, the SONGS (which she has joint or sole credits for, save the cover songs), the PRODUCTION (which she did), and even the ARTWORK (which she also did) is GOD AWFUL. I've never skipped the majority of so many songs on any CD. This holds true for both \\"albums\\" contained in the collection.In short, except for possible collector's interest, this CD would best be used as a coaster or Frisbee."},{"rating":"1","title":"oversimplified neither complex nor catchy","review":"the mood of this record to me is depressing as opposed to driving and uplifting. there aren't any hooks. it just takes up aural space like muzak. i really don't see an upside to this band except that it may garner numerous daft punk comparisons. this is what daft punk would've sounded like pre-homework when they were still ironing out their sound. of course we all know the disappointment which became of daft punk post HOMEWORK which makes listening to these guys all the more depressing. luckily i received this album as a promo and i didn't have to pay for it.

I own all but his very first album, and \\"Spirit\\" is by far my absolute favorite. Someone else wrote about the last track, \\"The Wings That Fly Us Home\\", and I agree wholeheartedly. The whole album is good, very good, but this one song is exceptional. Words cannot describe the feeling I get whenever I hear it. I can almost feel my own spirit wanting to take flight with the music. When music brings tears to your eyes, that says something and this one did it long before John died. This is John Denver at his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think this cd is one of John's best","review":"I love this cd..i had the album way back when..was very excited when it finally became avalible on cd.

So, I was surprised to see this release. I bought it with minimum expectations and was amazed at how good he sounds. Pete's voice, singing, and style has really matured. The whole band is tight, and lively. The recording is excellent, having an intimate bar setting to it. With song selection, there are a few oldies (1000s on a raft, white room, politician, theme from...), but most seem newer. The music is bluesy, like Mick Abrahams, but much better!

He installed it on his rifle and found that the adjustments would not work; he could not site in his rifle.

To use the warrenty you must call customer service to obtain a number and send it along with $10.00 check or money order to obtain service. My husband called and was told he didn't need a number just to send it along with a letter plus his $10.00 and be sure to send it so it has atracking number. We did all the above to discover that the receiver had moved. So UPS found them only to have them refuse the package.

I have since then shot a box of rounds and needed no readjustment. The only thing that I do not like about the scope is that the length of it is almost too short for a long action rifle, and you may want to look at other options if you are purchasing it to put on one. I did get mine to work, but had no additional room on my mounting brackets.

The experienced artist will learn how to pare away distracting detail and create a pure minimalist drawing that tells a story. All readers will learn what makes a drawing and a caption funny, and will be creating their own cartoons in no time.Hall's \\"Keyhole Ken\\" character is a simple figure that anyone can draw, but with repeated practice, the cartoonist's own style will take hold and transform this figure into something unique.

This tea is caffeine-free, so it's ideal for unwinding at the end of the day or for a quiet escape during a stressful work day. The tea has a strong aroma and flavor, a little bit spicy so not for everyone, but I find the scent irresistable and calming on its own. The flavor is a touch of sweet, a touch of tingle on the tongue. And as a bonus, each tea bag label has an inspirational saying on it. Even if you find the quotations silly, they're at least good for a giggle."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite teas!","review":"I love this stuff. Tastes great, I find it calming.

After about 30 seconds of the packet seeping in the water, I was in love with the smell. I couldn't wait to try the tea and I'm glad someone sent me this tea as a gift...its delicious! It has this subtle sweet taste with just a hint of spice and is very calming to drink. I'm a huge fan of tea and coffee in general and this will now be one of my favorites to keep on stock."},{"rating":"2","title":"My new daily drink...","review":"This tea does take getting used to...the sweetness is sloghtly odd at first. After getting really anxious during the day at work I decided to give up coffee (was on around 6 cups a day).

I actually suffer from clinical anxiety and depression, but prefer more natural methods rather than taking medication. Whether I am feeling under the weather, or I have anxiety or just feeling blue, Kava tea is so calming and helpful. I highly recommend it to anyone whether they have anxiety or not. My anxiety free husband just loves the taste of it :)This retails 6.00+ for one box at my local Ralphs so this is really a fantastic deal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Soothing in the Evening","review":"I love Kava tea by Yogi. I used to purchase this in the local health food store, but they stopped carrying it after negative publicity of possible liver problems from Kava. I was pleased to find it on Amazon.

I drink atleast 3/4 cups of Yogi, Tazo or other brands of tea during the work day. I specifically love yogi tea...I bought a packet of this particular pack over a month ago and I actually do not care for the taste of it. It almost has a rotten, bitter taste to it although there is a sweet liquorish top taste to it. It almost tastes a bit pungent and I actually have a hard time drinking it. I feel this need to not waste money so I am trying to finish out the box and I wish that I did not have to. So I give it a 2 star. It's just not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"The NASTIEST tasting tea I've ever had the displeasure of drinking.","review":"I love tea and drink at least three cups of green tea per day. I wanted to try a tea with kava because I've heard so many good things about its relaxing properties. Unfortunately I still don't know if kava has any effect on me because I gagged on the first sip of this Yogi tea. I brewed the tea as directed, but nothing can help the nasty, medicinal, weirdly sweet flavor. Sasparilla is the second ingredient, and the root beer flavor really comes across combined with the numerous other ingredients including cinnamon, cardamom and ginger along with sweetness from the stevia which I assume were all added to mask the \\"dirt\\" flavor kava is said to have. I just personally can't stand this flavor. If you don't usually drink tea that has numerous ingredients like this, I would save the receipt just in case you dislike it and need to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice after increasing the dosage","review":"This is a good product (good quality Kava root - no stems or leaves - and nice tasting), but you have to use at least 2 tea bags to get the feeling you would get from traditional Kava (relaxing and elated feeling). As far as convenience goes this is an easy way to get Kava but the increased number of bags used factors into the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"After reading the other reviews I just knew I found something to help me sleep.

I was very surprised that the affects were so noticeable although I've noticed I don't feel anything after the few cups if I haven't had it in a while. The affects seem to come after drinking it daily for a couple to a few days. I don't mind the taste either. I brew two tea bags at a time and if I'm under a crap load of stress I'll brew 3 bags which is pretty strong and lasts all day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"I love the taste . The price is the best I can find. The only thing is, I wish it had more Kava in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little too sweet...","review":"This tea would be nice if wasn't so sweet. The cinnamon tastes great but the sweetness is very strange and overpowering and ruins the tea. I use stevia to sweeten other teas and my coffee and it's not sweet like it is in this tea. The effects are nice however, 4 hours later I do have a bit of a headache. I may look for another Kava tea or perhaps try it in another form."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells and tastes hideous!","review":"I'm traditionally a big fan of Yogi teas, but this one was an unpleasant surprise. It tastes like it smells, a bit like a cup of hot chocolate that's gone off and has begun to sprout mold.

I have tried this using 4 bags, and the effect was negligible. You may have better luck with this product than I did, but just don't have high hopes of the effect being akin to that of traditionally prepared kava or quality kava extract like Gaia kava."},{"rating":"1","title":"My $0.02","review":"Hegel was immensely popular in his time but I do not think his ideas hold up well today.

Yes, so I thought. I wish Melanie would have released a Christmas album back when she was in full command of her voice and had proper studio backing. There are a lot of songs on this album, the best being the songs she wrote. It is in these original songs that Melanie's passion is clearly on display. But, once she sings the classic Christmas songs, she slips both vocally and the production is cheap(at best). However, she does do a fine verson of \\"O Come All Ye Faithful.\\" \\" Silent Night' and especially \\"O Holy Night\\" suffer from tedious vocals. \\"O Holy Night\\" is a song Melanie should have nailed; she is a very emotional singer but here she sounds bored. The rest of the CD suffers from tedious vocals, trite production and it has a \\"let's get this over with\\" feel to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was better than I expected.","review":"I am an old Melanie fan, so when I saw she had a Christmas CD, I decided to check it out.

Agora meets market or nmmeting place and the story is of Hypathia, woman philosopher and resident of the rebuilt library at Alexandria, Egypt.

If you want to see contemporary campus opinion on religion dressed up in ancient garb, this is the film for you. An epic set in ancient Egypt turns out to be nothing more than a diatribe against Christianity. No wonder the film did poorly in Europe and worse in the US.It bombed because it's not good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame film-making & bogus history","review":"I don't mind films taking some liberties with history if it improves the story - Kapur's Elizabeth is a good example. Timelines are greatly compressed, Robert Dudley (Earl of Leicester) is turned into a naive pretty boy (which he was not) and it's spiced up with some dramatic episodes that didn't happen (like Walsingham murdering Mary of Guise). But the story, cinematography, and portrayal of life in the Elizabethan court (especially the politics) are absorbing and completely credible.Agora lost me when the young woman protagonist used a proposition of Euclid to \\"prove\\" that \\"we are all brothers\\". To a viewer who knows something about the history of science and philosophy, that was the last straw. But the plodding narrative style and series of two-dimensional characters spouting cliches already had me reaching for the Stop button."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really enjoyed this movie","review":"I had heard of this movie from friends and went to every Wal-mart and BestBuy around and could not find this title. Why do I ever look any further than Amazon?! Movie Mars has now satisfied my searches for hard to find or out of circulation movies over a dozen times in the past. If I ever look for a movie again-and I know I'm gonna (probably this sometime week)-I'll just save myself the trouble and legwork and check out MovieMars first!As for the movie, I loved it. It's nice to see a well-made movie with lesser-known actors playing the starring roles, as the whole movie theme doesn't scream \\"Look at me, I'm Russell Crow/Brad Pitt/Tom Cruise!\\" The acting was very believable and the screenplay well-written. The effects were convincing enough without all the CGI that usually cloys the production of such films. I've watched it twice now and I like alot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"This is an outstanding movie, unfortunately in order to appreciate it one should be enthusiastic about history, power politics, mass movements, the classical history of science, and have some knowledge of mathematical astronomy, otherwise it could be taken as anti-Christian propaganda. Because of these perquisites its audience is probably going to be very, very small, probably in the dozens. That said, if historical drama and intellectual stimulation is your cup of tea, this movie is for you. Be forewarned, this movie is a tragedy unless religious repression and violence is also your cup of tea.One thing, although I am confident the movie makers did a reasonable portrayal of the power politics of the time, I question whether anyone can be certain of the fate of Hypathia. History is at best a lie agreed upon. I read another interpretation Hypathia's death that has her dying at an old age.That said I going to buy the DVD, and I am not one of those people whose buys DVDs of movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you enjoy pondering the stars and human existence","review":"...then there's an element of this film that you will enjoy.

It is lovely to look at, but the actors are horrible. The plot idea is good, but the execution fails. The dialog and movement seem really false.

Horrid."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great dissapointment","review":"There is not much to say about this movie. Rachel Weisz lent her talent to a movie that her acting could not hope to save. The plot, predictable dialogue, and message are dumb ed down to the point of insult to the viewer. The \\"historical\\" setting is sloppily anachronistic. Instead of being the edgy, controversial film that exposes Christianity's less-than-holy rise to power in the complex society it developed in, Agora is a slide show of charicatured Christians and pagans. Setting aside the movies goals and style- it is painfully bad and nauseatingly boring. Spare yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissappointed","review":"I came to this film after reading promo reviews of two highly respected Aussie critics, who described it as visually stunning. It was not!!! The premise was poor. Ignorant religious bigots destroy books and knowledge, and lives. Gee, nothing revealing in that. This movie was a waste of time and money.

Lonesome Dove was, in my opinion, one of the best movies of all time. So, those are big shoes to fill. If you remove, Tommy Lee, Robert Duvall, and Dianne Lane, you removed the backbone of the film. Jon Voight did a much better job as Call than James Garner did in the Streets of Laredo but he was still NOT Tommy Lee. However, Barbara Hershey did make a much better Clara than Angelica Houston did in the original. She was the only poor acting in the original.

Augustus McCrae died in the first and this has left quite a void in the second. The continous banter between Gus and Call added so much to the original movie. The loss of it definatley weakens the Return. Jon Voight does an OK job of depicting Captain Woodrow Call, but, the shoes were just too big to fill. Tommy Lee Jones was born to fill that roll and this movie would have been so much better with him playing that part again.

Not as good as the original, however, Voight plays a good W. F. Call because in the original book he is more of a straight man. Tommy Lee Jones' Call was good and I liked him just as much. I don't think Voight and Duvall would have made as good a team. I liked Barbera Hershey better than Angelica Houston, but without Gus to play the light side to Call's straight man it is a little less entertaining. William Peterson as Gideon Walker is a good preformance, and I always like Lou Gossett Jr. Of course Ricky Schroder is good and the story is good also.

Voight is less than nothing. Return to Lonesome Dove is less than nothing, but perhaps I'm being unfair since I bailed after the first abysmal hour.The only element of interest from that first hour was Oliver Reed's Donnegan, and only because of the wraith in Donnegan's improbable Montana mansion. The wraith is Awbonnie, a native servant who flits through a few frames with Elle Woods-Witherspoon. Donnegan is probably a hack Hollywood stand-in for Granville Stuart, Montana's grand old man, who married a Shoshone woman named Awbonnie. One of their dusky daughters married another grand old man of Montana, Teddy Blue Abbot, cowpuncher and best bud of Charlie Russell.Donnegan's attempt to comingle Elle & Mr. Newt suggests to me that Elle is not Donnegan's wife, as advertised, and that Awbonnie is.

Lonesome Dove is a clean wholesome movie with a story to boot, not just a shoot em up movie but a superb movieAll the actors in the movie to my mind are the best in the world and i don't think that any other actors could play those parts better than Duvall or Jones. I can't wait to view the return to Lonesome Dove, i have allready seen streets of Laredo and could not understand for the life of me how could Lorena be married to Pea !!! what happened to Dish? its like chalk and cheese so untill I view the return to Lonsome Dove all I can say is good work.! Good work!."},{"rating":"2","title":"Return to Lonesome Dove","review":"Don't overlook this simply because Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones aren't \\"in the picture.\\" This is a wonderful depiction of the magic of Larry McMurtry and Jon Voight does a great job as Captain Call.I bought this about one year ago and I'd recommend it to any \\"Lonesome Dove\\" fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product","review":"The movie is great.

A rather dull original after seeing the original. All the character action and dialogue seems robotic and not spontaneous as in the original.Let's see, in the original, Captain Call had the first cattle drive to Montana and the Indians were still ar war. In this one the year after they arrive in Montana, the territory is largely settled and full of large ranches. Come on!Watch it to see an alternative Lonesome Dove vision, but it is only mildly entertaining. Best bet, watch this one first, then the others. It will be less disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Return to Lonesome Dove","review":"This is a great movie. Thank you so much.

But to try and do it with mostly all new actors and with a script written by a different person is practicaly impossible. This movie would have been a fine western had it been released first or on its own. But as a follow up to Lonesome Dove it does not cut the mustard. Jon Voight is a fine actor but his portrayal of Cpt. Woodrow F. Call is not on par with Tommy Lee Jones's. With Gus (Robert Duvall) gone the banter and friendship between the two, part of the initial movies appeal, is also gone. So many of the original characters are gone and much of the feeling was lost.This movie is decent but the original was a hard act to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Worthy Sequel......even if not an epic","review":"LONESOME DOVE is my favorite movie yet to date.

It is nicely made and solid and fits onto my glass cooktop nicely however mine is not non-stick and I have been rather unhappy with its performance. I have owned it for about 6 months and make pancakes on it several times a week. My pancakes always stick to the surface and are difficult to get off of the griddle making a mess of the pan and the pancakes. I have to use a squirt of cooking spray before each new pour of batter or else I cannot remove the pancakes at all. It is also very difficult to clean as well. I cannot get my stuck-on pancakes off of the surface and have tried numerous different cleansers and soakings to no avail. I'd appreciate any input from those who have had good results from this pan, otherwise I will be purchasing a higher-end calphalon double griddle that is truly nonstick as I have other calphalon products (2 skillets and a wok) that have performed beautifully for years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"This book gives only the most basic of overviews for what you need to know for the real GMAT exam. Additionally, the math questions have many, many typos (for instance, they use a '+' instead of an '=' in the question), so it is impossible to know how to answer the questions. I didn't bother carefully reviewing the verbal section, because I was so disappointed with the math. I would recommend this book, only if you need additional practice math problems, and typos don't drive you crazy. I highly recommend the actual book from ETS and Kaplan books (the other 2 I used) for studying for this exam. (Also Elements of Style by Strunk and White may also be useful to you.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"While this book covers many of the same strategies as other books, it is nowhere close to being as complete or as challenging.

Moreover, the explanations are poorly written and organized.I have returned the book to the store right away."},{"rating":"1","title":"More harm than good","review":"I bought this book in preparation for the GMAT exam. While the tips on how to solve some of the quantitative problems are valuable, they can be found in other books. The serious problem with this book is that the practice problems in both the verbal and quantitative sections have numerous errors.

None of the monsters are from hell, they're all the horrible results of lab experiments gone wrong. None of the weapons look like the ones from the game except the BFG. It's an abysmal, insulting attempt at both a movie and a book of one of the most popular PC games ever.Anyone who gives this book a good rating has NEVER played the game.

Theys sound more metal than punk. The only song I kind of like their cover of Black Sabbath's Iron man. The cool thing about NOFX is that they've gotten better with age. Only buy this if your die-hard NOFX fan. One more interesting thing about this CD is that NOFX had no idea that CD was being released. They saw it one day in a record store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible","review":"Like other reviews posted, I am also a big NOFX fan and I find this to be their worst album. Everything about it is bad, but I find a handful of the songs okay. \\"Bob Turkee\\" \\"six pack girls\\" and their cover of \\"Iron man\\" are the best.

I'm getting old... anyway, all told, I still would not waste my money on this album. it is quite crappy and fat mike would tell you that himself. don't bother with liberal animation either. if you gotta, get their live album for better versions of two older songs. or go see em live yourself. they play alot and will probably play some older stuff here and there. oh, s and m airlines is only marginally better. ribbed is their real beginning. and the longest line marks el hefe's entrance, which is when this band became who they are and have been for years and years..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The truth is told!","review":"This is the worst cd in my possesion.

Thanks Laura and Charles.Pieter (Dublin - Ireland)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disorganized","review":"Abolsutely one of the worst self-help books I have read. There isn't any structure, and it's not simplistic. The advice given is helpful but the authors then reverse the whole deal. Its like one chapter says this will be helpful, and then another chapter says it wont. It just goes all over the place and you cant really follow what the authors are trying to get at.A book I highly reccemend for anxiety and depressive related disorders is \\"Feel the fear and do it anyway\\" Much more simplistic, easier to read and get thru. And much more cheerful.I also dont like that these authors have seperated anxiety and depression from one another. I guess they do have a new book coming out that combines them both. It will be interesting to see if they have learned anything from their last two failures.But for someone that wants quick and easy advice, this book is certainly not for them. I'm afraid that this book of jargon will make it more confusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"stay away.","review":"i bought this book.i recommend you not buying this.didn't like it's content at all.didn't help me in anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make people bored before really learned anything","review":"The book was not written in a way that people can learn the struts programming step by step. It may provide you a lot of theory, but you can not follow it to even run an example. All the examples provided are always just a small piece of the whole picture. There is no way that you can follow the example and run it to see the struts works. I am in chapter 5 now. I am still very confused. I think this book is good for the person who just want to learn the theory about struts and bost around. You can not tell people that I can write a struts program and show you that it works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be called \\"Struts for Dummies\\"","review":"I bought this book without really looking at the content because all my other O'Reilly books are the best on their subject. That was a mistake - O'Reilly have really dropped the ball on this one.Here's some non-trivial stuff the book didn't cover:1. A reference for the Struts tag library (\\"Go read the docs\\" it says)2. How should my Action handle a \\"Cancel\\" button on a form?3. How do I get the properties file to be reloaded without restarting the servlet container?4. Does the javascript date validation work properly? It doesn't seem to handle \\"dd-MMM-yy\\" format....I think the author should have spent more time reading over the Struts mailing list to figure out what people really cared about.O'Reilly are at their best with books aimed at people who can read the online docs but want more. Unfortunately a better name for this book would be \\"Programming Jakarta Struts for People Who Have Never Used Struts and Don't Know Too Much About JSPs\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for all web developers","review":"I bought this book along with the one by Sue Spielman. Both books have been extremely helpful. I like the O'Reilly book because it covers details that apply to real applications, not just prototypes or small...ones for school.The coverage of logging, exception handling, the model coverage in chapter 6 is worth the price of the book.One of the best books that I've ever purchased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lot of holes","review":"The book is organized in a strange way. When I was looking at one example, the essential parts would not be explained until a few chapters later. Lot of details are left out (like some of the attributes of the config file were not explained). It seems that the author assumed you knew it already. A lot of time was wasted in hunting for the information back and forth in the book and sometimes I need to go to the Struts site to find out. A lot of frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of trees","review":"I was quite happy when I received this book but it turned out to be a waste of money as the examples are written in such scatterbrain fashion, the index is an example of corrupt laziness, and the introduction is a schizophrenic mess to get you even more confused. What's worse is that parts of this were written during a transition period between 1.0 and 1.1 struts so you're not getting a full picture of how struts really works. What's needed are good, fully developed examples of code since the API and documentation on the struts website lack such things. Instead, you get a half-assed section on taglibs which only are clips of what's needed to really get newbies started. I suppose if you want a \\"high level\\" introduction to the basic theory behind struts, this is okay. But for anything sophisticated, add a few more bucks and buy something with better developed examples."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good as reference","review":"This is the first Struts book ever published and the one I bought when I first learned Struts. Being a Struts developer himself, the author understands the topics very well. For exmaple, the MVC design pattern was explained well, and so were Struts Validation, HTML , Bean, and Logic libraries. Tiles is also covered well. However, there are some parts where he stumbled. For example, he could not be sure whether the Action class is part of the Model in the MVC pattern or part of the Controller. Therefore, I don't think you should get this book if you just first learn Struts (For tutorial, get \\"Struts in Action\\" (Manning) or, better still, the lesser known \\"Struts Design and Programming: A Tutorial\\")Overall, this book deserves 4 stars, included in my wish list for next editions are EL and JSTL (for the View part in the MVC) and real-world examples."},{"rating":"1","title":"To learn Struts or \\"their\\" example????!!!!!!!!!!","review":"The organisation of this book is not very pleasing. While explaining topics they jump from one to another...I get bored very soon while reading this book. The shopping cart example is also not provided in a user-friendly way. It is scattered all over the book. The way of explaining things is really irritating me.. If you buy this book, download the examples from o'reilly website and keep that open always. Because, if you wish to learn a new topic say DispatchAction class, you should first learn how their StorefrontDispatchAction class is defined!!! To learn this class you should learn some other class and the chain goes on.... The author could have explained it with some simple examples instead of this big example."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a complete mess","review":"I've bought this book to have an overview of struts, beeing myself an experienced java programmed for years, it would be a good choise. I was wrong! BAD choice. It's a complete mess. You don't understand anything by reading this book! \\"You will build up an application\\"... where?

However, if you want to really get in to how struts is built and how each part works this is the best book on the subject.The only thing is that it explains each part but doesn't give you a simple step by step to get started."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorely Lacking","review":"I am very dissapointed in this book, as I purchased it thinking it would give real techniques for using struts. Instead it's just like so many other technical books out there where they give top-soil kind of overviews of the technology. It may be for getting basic concepts of struts, but whenever I find myself trying to lookup up real-world solutions there are no answers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"i've just joined a new company using struts. i am a java programmer of more than 5 years but completely new to struts, this is the book i was given by my boss but i cant understand it.

I got the book trying to follow a logical sequence buy I found a lot of theory. Very helpful for a begginer who wants to learn J2EE and struts or for a teacher.

Beleive me !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Struts, smuts","review":"Book is kind of simplistic, but it reflects an 'API' that is overly complicated for what it does. Abstraction is a good thing - as long as it conceptually simplifies an interface. Struts is abstraction for the sake of abstraction. It is a complex abstraction over a set of complex APIs. It seems to me that the designers of Structs just wanted to write an abstraction layer for the sake of writing one. There are lots of complicated things that I normally program that Structs can't even begin to do. And, all the objects that Structs creates makes it perform slowly."},{"rating":"1","title":"didnt understand even a single word","review":"i could not understand what they are talking about. Please dont buy this book and waste your money. complete reference is a good place to start for beginners. Jbuilder is a cool tool to develop struts application. Struts is a cool technology. Hope some one writes a great book in the future. All books are so cryptic"},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive from beginning to end","review":"This is the best technical book I've ever read, by far. It's packed with nuggets of wisdom that extends beyond Struts and into programming in general. I would say that it's an advanced book and covers many advanced concepts, but those just starting out with Struts will learn alot as well.The only downside is that it doesn't touch on security within Struts, which is one of the places that I'm stuck. I've read the reviews here and someone else mentioned cover security in a 2nd edition. I would strongly encourage it be covered in the next edition. This is not something that gets talked about in any of the other Struts books in enough detail. Please do.Other than this one flaw, the finest book on Struts available. I can't recommended it enough if you are using Struts in your daily job like I am."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses the point","review":"Reading Programming Jakarta Struts, I had the feeling the authors were grasping for methods to properly explain Struts to the user.There are far too many subjects introduce in the book without a meaningful method to part knowledge to the reader. After reading the book, a reader will be familiar with the various accronyms of J2EE but lacking a coherent picture on building a Struts application.Struts makes developing web applications using Java technologies relatively easy. Explaining how to best make use of the Struts framework is more complicated.It would have been a better book if the authors started with an example and introduced the various aspects of Struts through the example."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak covertage of Struts 1.1.","review":"Tiles, DyanActionForm and validation coverage incomplete and not used in samples.

But I felt the steam went out of this novel approximately 100 pages into it, there was simply not enough plot development to sustain an entire novel. This is a character study that simply got out of hand. There is great poetry in the prose but I found that once the heroine of the title moves to the boarding house from her family home the book becomes a muddled mess with little rhyme or reason. The sense of whimsy and pathos that enriches the beginning quickly becomes a plodding dose of endless pathos without sympathy or motivation to attract the reader.

Also, I was not impressed with the fact that there were no itemizations on the preview on the amazon website.We did enjoy the videos we saw, and it just made us want to see all the episodes.

A moderate box-office success, \\"World of Comedy\\" includes classic moments from the bespectacled genius: iconic clock hanging in \\"Safety Last\\" (1923); the inventive jail escape in \\"Why Worry?\\" (1923); and the exciting \\"get to the church on time\\" climax in \\"Girl Shy\\" (1924). Oddly enough, there are sound sequences from \\"Feet First\\" (1930), \\"Movie Crazy\\" (1932) and \\"Professor Beware\\" (1938) - which suffer in comparison to the golden age of silence. For many years, this 94-minute collection provided film buffs with the only access to Lloyd's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS ONE YOU NEED TO OWN","review":"This is one of the most fascinating books of the genre I've had the pleasure to read.

Good, I mean \\"really good\\" nature books are hard to find. This ranks among the best.

On the surface it simply follows all the life forms around a pond through 1 year.

In stand alone mode, we were camping and it rained. It rained outside, and inside. I found a note on the label inside that said something about the best waterproofing had been used but in heavy rain that water would come through. I wish I could have read that before I purchased it. What good is a tent if it won't keep out the rain? I seems to keep bugs out OK, but if it is going to rain, it should keep that out as well. They suggest getting a fly for the tent if you are going to use it in the rain. But it turns out they don't make a fly for this tent. I would look at the newer 86000 model. It is a slightly different design and comes with a fly. Maybe it can keep a little more of the rain out of the tent; maybe?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great concept, fix the details","review":"Purchased the hatchback tent for our annual trip to the 24 hours of Daytona.

A better design would be a strap from 1 wheel well over the top to the other wheel well, sewn into the sleeve.Item 2: one of the shock cords broke when we were taking it down.

The accessories are really neato, and the little rubber Necronomicon prop is a toy all by itself, I kept finding myself with it in my hand, fiddling with it.

The characters do so many inexplicably dumb things and plot hole after plot hole emerges.Why does Dylan Walsh (in a typically enjoyable turn) become so close to Rutger Hauer. He's killed the sheriff, a hunter, caused two other hunters to freeze to death, and he continues to try and escape. Even after Walsh has stripped to his briefs to keep Hauer from freezing to death. And how can he fall for Hauer's limp treatise on \\"the wilderness and what it's become?\\" It negates Walsh's character's heroic stance and just leaves the audience wondering why an obviously intelligent man would fall for such crap.What is it with the mayor? Why would he not want the leaking pipes fixed? Duh...Why is the sheriff's body found hanging in a tree?Why the ridiculous ending?I like Dylan Walsh, and even in bad movies, he tries his best, but he better stick to NIP AND TUCK instead of bombs like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The first ladies of Rap!\\"","review":"Way back in 1979, I remember listening to a deff record called \\"Rapper's Reprise (Jam, Jam)\\" by the Sugar Hill Gang feat. a young trio of female MC's.

I have every book he has ever written and have most of them in original hardcover. This book was so bad that I had to put it down (and I obviously will never pick up again).

Sorry, guys, don't spend the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another boring bestseller","review":"I wish S. K.'s editors would dare do their job for once. These short stories are typical King: overlong, filled with cutesy-isms, lacking in originality, and just plain boring. He could probably produce a literate, well-written, memorable book if he wanted to, but why change the existing $$$-making formula which has endeared him to so many non-discerning readers?I was turned off after the first ridiculous story, scanned though a few more, then returned this latest tome to the library.I have renewed my vow not to bother with any more of this tripe; I only read this one on the off-chance that it might be even mildly entertaining. It was not."},{"rating":"1","title":"King has gone downhill since the accident","review":"In my opinion, something very unfortunate happened in with King's accident. He seems to have lost that edge in his writing that kept me begging for more. I was pretty disappointed with this book, as I have been with most of King's post-accident work.There was really only one story that I found truly entertaining and that was \\"The Little Sisters of Eluria\\". I have only read one of King's Darktower series, but I think that is where his heart truly lies now. Everything else is just superficial.Also, a number of the stories had been published elsewhere. For my money, the story \\"1408\\" belongs on the audio-tape and should stay there. It was a great story to have read out loud, but it lost something in print."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch out for reprints!","review":"Readers should know that the Roland story, Lunch at the Gotham Cafe, the airplane crash/Purgatory story, and at least one of the other stories in this volume are reprints. I wasn't expecting that, and I was disappointed. On the other hand, since the original publications were in less well-known venues to mainstream readers, they may still be new to many.I found this anthology to be entertaining but not especially strong. A buried-alive (or, in this case, autopsied alive) tale starts wonderfully but falls apart at the end. The gunslinger story is a little silly. The Man in the Black Suit and the haunted hotel room story stand out. Nothing in here had the impact, for me, of something like The Langoliers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tight for a rehash","review":"I am a great fan of Mr. King's work and own many a volume of his. For someone who has followed his career closely, this volume is not necessary to ensure you have all of his works. \\"LT's Theory of Pets\\" was previously published as an audio only release, \\"Little Sisters of Eluria\\" was previously published in a sci-fi/fantasy collection, \\"1408\\", \\"In the Death Room\\" and \\"Lunch at the Gotham Cafe\\" were all previously released on \\"Blood and Smoke\\", and \\"Riding the Bullet\\" has been publishd online. When, off the top of my head, I can recount where I've already read 1/2 the book before picking it up, it doesn't sem a worthwhile purchase in hardback. I did, however read the other seven stories, and although about half of them disappoint (and I still dislike \\"LT's Theory of Pets\\" for being jumpy), a \\"true\\" King fan should add this book to their collection. After it comes out in paperback, that is."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Winning Collection","review":"This is a highly entertaining collection of Stephen King short stories. As enjoyable as the stories are Stephen's insights and observations in his Introduction and comments.

However, King is such a good storyteller, it doesn't matter.Treat yourself to some fun reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kaliley","review":"All in all, I was pretty disappointed with this book. The creativeness in the stories is not up to Kings norm. Oliver Platt's narration of Autopsy Room 4 was good however the other narrators were perticularly \\"dry\\".

A book about 14 dark tales kept me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end. No one story ties in with another, but each one is breathtakingly ingenious. From the autopsy room to the walls of rest area rest rooms, the stories were packed with non-stop action and excitement. Stephen even added his own comments with each story.

Great book that I would absolutely recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where \\"1408\\" Came From","review":"I'm biased when it comes to author Stephen King. It was \\"The Shining\\" that made me want to be a writer in the first place, so I credit much of my fortune to his ability to engage me as a reader (and terrify me when I was nine years old). For those who are curious about this book because of \\"1408,\\" know that just based on the movie's trailers the film is nothing like the short story (which is one of 14 in this book).\\"1408\\" is actually a nod to horror master H.P. Lovecraft, and King almost seems to channel the man through this story. It is creepy and never over the top, and it's not even the best one in this book.The other 13 stories are decent reads, though some are less scary than others, but I don't think any horror or King fan will be disappointed by this collection. Everything from the devil to undead drivers are covered here, and it is King in best form."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy","review":"It started off well enough. The first story about an autopsy was classic Stephen King. It had the great first person descriptions of what was happening and it ended with a nice twist. The next story wasn't quite as good, but it held your interest and made you wonder what actually happened to the boy by the lake. After that... well, it became harder and harder to read. I think it's because of two reasons: (1) The stories were not made to be GREAT, but only average - ie. there is a lot of words, but not much substance, and (2) It appears that most of these stories (except for the first two) are just pale cliches of what Stephen King might write (like writing unnecessary swear words just to try to shock). I don't know. I've been a long time reader (I even read his column in EW every two weeks), but this book was very disappointing. Sorry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, well.....","review":"The last King book I read before this, was 'Bag of Bones', which I absolutely loved. But this...the opening story, 'Autopsy Room Four', was quite funny; the next one, 'The Man in the Black Suit', could have been so much more, but still delivered a few chills. The title story was somewhat interesting, and 'That Feeling, You Can Only Say What It Is In French' had an interesting idea...but none of them quite delivered *the punch*. I didn't read 'The Little Sisters of Eluria', since I never gave a hoot about King's Dark Tower-series, and I read 'Riding the Bullet' a couple of yeas ago, and couldn't bear going through it again...it's utter crap! Mr King has written a good deal of great books, but if you wanna read his short stories, go for 'Night Shift' or 'Skeleton Crew'. This one doesn't do him - or the readers - any justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much good to say about this one...","review":"I'll keep it brief. This is not a good book. King's stories are not very intriguing, and after each one, I kept hoping the next would be better-- never really happened. There are a couple that keep you turning the pages, but NONE that leave you with that satisfied feeling of having read something excellent. The best story, in my opinion, is \\"Riding the Bullet,\\" but King released this one a while ago, and I had already read it.I don't think anyone should make any profound statements about changes in the quality of King's writing-- every author has his/her good & bad books. This is just one of the bad ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost everything's a repeat!","review":"While I am a \\"constant reader\\", it made for disappointment while reading this book. Up to half the stories have appeared elsewhere, particularly if you bought the audio tape of short stories a few years ago. Since his writing is plot-driven, if you've read, (or heard) the stories previously, you might as well skip the story entirely. The title story is, to the best of my knowledge, new, and was great. I just wish the book was half as long and half the cost!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lot Of Fun From The Master","review":"A nice collections of short horrific stories. Every one of them a winner.I hope that King keeps writing despite his earlier comments. He does however make a comment in one of his introductions that repetition is his version of Hell. Too bad because these are a lot of fun.Strangely, the cover of the book is just as creepy as the stories as you gradually turn it from front to back things go from odd to down-right horrifying.

Would you rather be with Zombies or evil Nuns?Everything's Eventual: If you are a underachiever like Dinky, it is not necessarily the pay, but the fringe benefits when you have special talents.L.T' Theory of Pets: She gets the dog, he gets the cat... poor dog.The Road Virus Heads North: Some artwork is not worth the price, no matter how little it cost.Lunch at the Gotham Cafe: Divorce can be a real pain, but a bad waiter can be worse.Luckey Quarter: A quarter tip can definitely better than nothing.The other stories were OK but seemed like filler instead of content."},{"rating":"2","title":"When you don't want to start a new book","review":"Since this book has short stories in it, it is great for when you aren't ready to start a new book, but still want to read something short that will hold your interest.

They won't all scare you - some will give you chills and others will give you nightmares - but they all bear witness to Mr. King's unique brand of compelling storytelling. The \\"Sisters of Eluria\\" (a short prequel story to the incredible Dark Tower series) alone is worth the price of the book.I especially liked the small prologue and/or epilogues with each story. It's always interesting to take a gentle probe into the mind of a man some call a lunatic and others call a genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uneven but still good","review":"Not the best of King's anthologies but still easily worth the price of admission. Yes, I guess many of these stories have appeared in one form or another before, but I hadn't seen them (and I am an inveterate King fan). 1408 and Everything's Eventual were my favorites - classic King - and all in all I enjoyed this collection a lot more (perhaps because I expected less) than several of SK's recent novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspenseful, eerie and of course, well-written.","review":"I enjoyed this book more so than King's others because he doesn't spend the first 200 pages introducing his characters. He gets right to the story and devours your attention. No two stories are alike, it's hard to pick a favorite. King develops solid characters in a short period of time and gives the reader insight as to why or how he came upon his subject matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I was so exited when I heard King was publishing his first new collection of short stories in over a decade. But every story reminded me of something I was forced to read in 11th grade English class.

If you want to get a taste of the different styles of Stephen King, this book is a great starting point."},{"rating":"2","title":"King's Short Stories NEVER Shortchange Readers","review":"Stephen King's latest collection of short stories takes his Constant Readers from the sublime to the terrifying and never lets go at any point. King is a master of the short-story genre, his discipline and use of the form is the best. From his Dark Tower \\"prequel\\" story, \\"The Little Sisters of Eluria\\" to \\"Autopsy Room 4\\", to telling us about the good heart of John Dillenger, King keeps the pace going. The self-indulgence sometimes seen in King's full length novels is completely lacking here. He gives all for the reader.

A must-read for King fans and fans of the psycho-horror and short story genre generally."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad bad bad","review":"I have read better stories from freshman english students.

Each story is different, and each one has its own creepy quality. I pretty much liked all of the stories and the weird twists in them, even Sisters of Eluria, which I did not expect to enjoy because I'm not really into that whole fantasy thing. Out of all the stories, I'd have to say my favorites were \\"The Man in the Black Suit,\\" \\"Everything's Eventual,\\" and \\"Riding the Bullet.\\"As a new reader (the only other book I've read of his is \\"Dreamcatcher\\"), I have never read any of these stories so it was like a new experience to me. They were all very good, and I commend King for his outstanding work."},{"rating":"2","title":"King of the Short Story","review":"Stephen King is a master of the short story, there is no doubt about that (for those that don't know Shawshank Redemption was a King short story) and most of the stories in this collection are on par with some of his best. \\"LT'S Theory of Pets\\", is for the most part a pleasent story about pets and their owners until the surprising ending that just sort of creeps up on you. There are also the real chillers as always like \\"the deathroom\\" and a story about a picture that keeps changing (that I can't remember the name of at the moment) which is especially creepy.After what I felt was the disappointment of Black House, this collection is very satisfying.

My top two favorite short stories from the book are \\"Autopsy Room Four\\" and \\"Lunch at the Gotham Café.\\" \\"Autopsy Room Four\\" kept me reading to see if the doctors would really kill him in the room. \\"Lunch at the Gotham Café,\\" I thought was a very well written story. I liked the main character and how he dealt with every situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"The eighth reason to read this collection","review":"It is \\"LT's Theory of Pets\\". It is funny how pets are both love presents and divorce tools. A cat versus a dog, a man versus a woman, or vice versa in both cases. Pets lead to divorce just as marriage and love lead to pets. But one offers a pet to his/her love because one likes the pet and somewhere maybe hates his/her partner. And pets are aggravating circumstances because they do all they can to break asunder the two partners who pretend to love each other, and they probably do, both the partners love each other and the pets break them asunder. But the end of the story is not that funny because of the interference of a serial killer in the business and a deadly and bloody ending. Rush to it. You will love it. Yes, Dear Abby is right, the giving of pets \\"is an exercise in arrogance\\". And we all fall into the trap one day or another, one way or another.

These wills may not be for you, but they remind you that we all enter and leave this plane in a similar, if not identical fashion and the stuff, such as it is, that we accumulate in this realm, is no more than what dreams are made of, but, in our society, must be attended to.

There's not an awful lot to explain here - if you know of the Hanson's previous efforts then you'll know what to expect; 15 tracks in all, including a cover of the 70's classic 'Get it right back', two-minute, melodic dash-for-the-finish-line stompers, heavy on that distinctive NMN sound of bass and drums.'Give me anything', 'I've been there', 'Honey, I'm home', 'Rookie of the year', 'Joey had to go' (about the late, great Joey Ramone) and the hilarious 'Tranquil', surely the best song NOFX never wrote.

I only wish that I had a good comment on the cd that I bought, but no, I really can't think of a thing. I know this is right because the original record album was great in comparison. The performance was classic, and the sound was invigorating. I loved that album. This is not the only case that this has happened. It seems that quite a few albums from that era were rushed through the process to get a cd on the shelf as soon as possible. Even the cd players(NAD, Carver, and couple of others) had special circuitry that could be used in order to deal with the brightness of the cd format in some cases.

I would rather a refund because it's not the best toaster oven overall.

We tried lower temperatures and this did not solve the problem. Today, I put my oven thermometer inside of it and preheated oven to 300 degrees. Within 10 minutes the temperature was nearly 600 degrees (this explains why oven was burning food...). This oven is a fire hazard. Do not waste your money or time purchasing this product.

I put my old Sunbeam 2-slice toaster away, and put my new toaster oven to work. That was 3 months ago, and I have now pulled my old toaster out, and use that.I've had the same problem as some other reviewers - the timer function is very flaky. Sometimes it works, most of the time it doesn't. Toasting two slices of bread takes at least 5 minutes - since it doesn't toast evenly on the top and bottom I end up flipping the bread over to even out the doneness. I had actually quit using the Toast feature, and just cranked up the Bake feature to 450 and using that to toast. I will be contacting B&D; to voice my complaints, and hopefully can upgrade to a toaster oven that works, and works well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather disappointing device","review":"Okay, so I had this oven for a little over 2 years, when it decided to crap out on me yesterday.

Used mine on a daily basis, since my husband loves his sandwiches toasted. The oven feature is okay. Took a little while to reach desired temperature, but at least the house didn't over heat as it would using my regular oven. During the last few weeks of my oven's short life, it started over cooking things. I would set the temperature at 375 to cook my costco meatballs and within 10 minutes they charred up. Same problem when toasting bread. So, after it's tragic ending, I drove to our local bed bath & beyond store last night and purchased the Cuisinart TOB 195 oven.

It's been in the sun the whole time, but hasn't had any sun rot. The color has modified slightly, but that's all. Other than the slight color change it still looks brand new. She's mostly an outdoor dog, so this house is well used by her. During the winter she stays in it most of the time. There are times when our dog is inside our home but she'll ask to go outside so she can go in her house. We live in cold, snowy mountains--lots of skiing, so we're used to cold weather. Like the other reviewer, we use cedar chips inside--nice. I like the ideas the reviewer gave about modifying the house with foam. I think we might try that this winter to make it even more cozy. The door was frightening to our dog at first, but she got used to it and now she likes it. I like the window that can be removed in the summer.

This is how Saxon presents the material.Saxon is good for elementary school, but after 6th grade it tends to lead kids to math anxiety because of the lack of practice. Home schoolers have a momentum of using these texts and they should ask the opinion of professionals (high school and college professors) regarding their use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eloise at Christmas","review":"Eliose at Christmas Book is like new and arrived before estimated arrival date.

I couldn't like them for being good, and I couldn't hate them for being bad - they were all in some kind of bland personality limbo, stumbling about being one-dimensional. I am a DC resident and read it on the metro every day and couldn't even get excited about all the familiar locations in the story.

It is not a dry theological treatise, but a thought provoking essay. It is written for the lay person, yet would be stimulating for the scholar.He wedded practical and profound insights together like a gifted writer. I was impressed with his use of biblical passages and hermeneutical explanations. I personally did a lot of highlighting as I read the book.Chapter after chapter the religion of Hinduism is explained in a wise and compassionate manner. Whether the subject is Karma, exorcism, rituals, salvation, or the daily life of Hindus, the author unfolds the mystery of the religion, yet does so with a heart for the Gospel.I highly recommend this book as a thorough covering of the issues needed to get a handle on basic Hinduism.

When someone finally does come along, he turns out to be the nephew of the horrible Dark Count, her father's latest marriage prospect. I won't say any more, bu you have to read this book.

The premise of finding love in arranged marriage is usually always interesting. But I found myself ready to just be done with the thing half way through and found myself rolling my eyes repeatedly.The characters gradually became more and more annoying. Headstrong girl in a medieval setting I can handle. But Rhiannon went from headstrong to irritating and immature in about 30 pages.While it is cute that the author used her daughters and herself to base Rhiannon on, it just didn't work in a medieval setting (She mentions who she based Rhiannon on in the afterward).I'm really surprised that this book got four and half stars.

This point was perhaps mentioned once in passing (without support) while the rest of the book tried to describe the evolution of the brain and how certain traumas will inhibit its growth. The title also states that it is a guide to further develop the brain. However, most of the book contains no useful information except for the point that the brain can be further developed by doing new and different activities. This is about the extent of the 'guide'. I was quite disappointed overall and certainly didn't read anything revolutionary or even new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dabbler's Delirium","review":"I was extremely disappointed by this book. The title and the write-up on the back cover held the promise of a how-to manual to use your brain to its fullest potential. The book reads like a superficial mish-mash of philosophy and neurology, with almost no back-up to its major claims and statements about human behavior or the development of societies. At times it sounds like a new age environmentalist screed, noting that poor use of the brain results in the misuse of natural resources. I was kept waiting until the final pages of the book for the magical how-to promised at the beginning. The secret formula for better brain use: be a better person, preferably an environmentalist. The only information of value is Huther's repeated assertion that your brain physiology will adapt to the way you continually use it, and will reinforce this routine way more and more. This has been said by other's before (see Edward De Bono, Mechanism of Mind)."},{"rating":"1","title":"No meat","review":"I read nothing insightful or useful. the word meandering comes to mind.

About 10 years ago I watched the remake with Matt Damon, but was extremely disappointed. I just didn't care for the actors and hated the short scenes which were making it hard to follow the plot. But the new generation of movie directors seems to think short scenes = more suspense. Well, they are wrong.Since then I watched the original with Chamberlain & Jaclyn Smith a few times more and read the book. Great thriller and a very good novel. 10 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bourne Identity - the real version","review":"A must see for those who liked the trilogy of Bourne books.

Considering it was done when it was done and for the medium it was done in, it wasn't a bad production at all. I loved the book and was very intertained by the mini series.

Comparing the 2 versions side by side, you feel the 2002 version feels more like an independent film on steroids more than anything else. While this 1988 version is much more cultured, sophisticated. The 1988 version actually grips you in its intensity.And Richard Chamberlain, what can I say, one of the truly great actors to ever grace the screen in recent memory. In comparison Matt Damon feels more like a rebellious school kid, lacking Chamberlain's finess, culture, and sophistication.I give this mini series 5 stars. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A much more faithful adaptation of Ludlum's Novel","review":"I was excited when I heard that a remake of the Bourne Identity was set to be released in 2002. But I was disappointed when I saw it. I prefer the original TV version to the remake, which I consider a good example of a big budget revamp that really shouldn't have been billed as Robert Ludlum's Bourne Identity since it barely kept even a minimum of the original plot. Personally I think they should have put more effort into updating the original instead of rendering it nearly unrecognizable to anyone who read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"After watching the second Bourne Identity I wanted to watchthe original with Richard Chamberlain.

Ok to every one slamming the new film for not being true to the book etc etc etc please remembera) the books where set in a different era (70's 80's) and the ideas could not have transfered well to the late 90's/ 00's. main point being the vastly different technology we have now and the prominance of computers, satellite tracking etc.b) the screenplay was written by ludlum himself before he died (just after the film was released or finished i believe)and was onset as an advisor. think theres an interview on the dvd with him. he realised that it couldnt be a straight adaption for the reasons laid out before and that the film would only be 90 min +. so dont use the its not faithful to the original argument. it was never intended to be. it was an interpretation. this miniseries was hardly spot on (well more so than the current film but the acting was way hammier which is always a killer in my book)all in all ok. wudn give it tuppence for the new one though"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchable!!!","review":"I dont know where all the glowing reviews are coming from but I couldnt be bothered to finish this snoozer. The dialogue is as mono/bisyllabic as you can get and on par with your average Aaron Spelling production. Chamberlain is a cold blooded killer just because he says so and not because anything we see of him. The producer/director were too busy making him available to Jacklyn Smith to fall in love with and they take every opportunity to make googly eyes at each other. \\"I just need to be held\\", she says.

So if you liked the book, I recommend the miniseries. I think you'll enjoy seeing it come to life. I certainly did.I did not think Richard Chamberlain was miscast, as some have said. I actually think he was probably more what Ludlum had in mind when he wrote the character-a sophisticated, well-traveled, well-trained assassin, reminiscent of James Bond. I also think that Jaclyn Smith was more the Marie that Ludlum intended, as well. Their chemistry worked for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hogwash, not blarney, without any brogue","review":"Possibly the worst read of the summer. Ludicrous situation, not a single character who could have existed outside of this fictitious nonsense. The very premise is insulting... two peabrained characters (the heroine and her aunt) decide that she needs turn-of-the-century adventure before marriage by becoming an adventuress, with no real understanding of what that entails.

Incredibly sophisicated arrangements and some of the best vocals and harmonies in the genre. There are two singles on the CD--Vinyl Bliss and Oxygen, which could each manage as A-sides in their own right. The Neverakka mix of XRV is simply phenomenal, with instant club appeal, and Upstairs at Erics has a nice Yazoo flavor to it. The single is rounded out with a punchy piano version of Vinyl Bliss, a home-brewed club version as well as a razormaid of the title track. This single is the first I've heard of this band, but hopefully will not be the last. A must buy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall, a very good single","review":"This review was originally written by my husband, Daniel Aeschliman, who has given me permission to post it here:We fell in love with this song pretty quickly after hearing it on a sampler CD from A Different Drum. The single adds in some great mixes (from the dancier Nevarakka mix to the '80s styled \\"Upstairs At Eric's\\"), plus another song (\\"Oxygen\\") from the forthcoming album and new mixes of \\"Vinyl Bliss\\" from the previous album Belief. I have to admit some disappointment in the Color Theory mix of \\"Vinyl Bliss\\" and the TDOL remix of \\"XRV\\" (\\"XRV [Xtremix]\\" - a club heavy version that falls prey to the \\"one or two lines of lyrics\\" approach that I truly despise), but the rest of the disc was quite excellent. It should be noted that these two tracks aren't necessarily bad, they just either weren't my thing (Xtremix) or weren't quite what I was expecting (Color Theory mix)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Additional info...","review":"Also found another release (Synthpop for a Darkened Room 2) with a track by The Dignity of Labour called 'Satellite'.

Some of the sillines makes it funny and some of it drags the comedy down. All in all still a funny movie for someone who doesn't mind stupid and silly gags. High points: The reacurring cast, the ending climax scene at the Academy Awards where Nielson impersonates Phil Donahue and Weird Al, Nielson's style of comedy, and the cameos.

One would think that changing the setting from LA to DC would enhance the comedic aspects of this film but unfortunately, the writers were unable to CAPITALize on this change of venue. Although there are some good gags and political satire throughout the film, the characters, especially Drebin, seem to be out of their element which makes for a rather flat performance. Yes, \\"Naked Gun 2 1/2\\" has its moments but for the most part, this is a dull and otherwise forgettable movie.

There is little to distinguish this from the tons of other gag-a-minute spoofs that ape the ZAZ style. In fact, this wasn't even directed by one of the ZAZ guys- Peter Segal directed from a script co-written by David Zucker.Many spoof-comedies simply send-up specific scenes from other movies. How many times has the interrogation scene from \\"Basic Instinct\\" been parodied? More than I care to remember. Early ZAZ classics, including the first Naked Gun, managed to avoid that trap by first crafting a structured screenplay before piling on the gags. The third Naked Gun film is very far from the early days of ZAZ, and closely resembles the many uninspired spoofs that have killed the sub-genre.The DVD features a nice group commentary (with lots of welcoming skewering of the film from it's creators)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leslie Nielson's funniest movie trilogy...","review":"I was lucky to find these movies for cheap, but it's definitely one of the best trilogies I have ever seen.

The depiction of US soldiers as one-dimensional idiots is miles from the truth. The lack of teamwork shown on the various missions seems like an attempt to make the Iraq War seem as full of zapped out characters as Apocalypse Now was. Sorry, nice try, but this creation is a simple and manipulative view of a very complex war.

And the premise showed lots of potential and drew me in. Unfortunately the execution was lacking. The dialogue was stale and there was lots of telling, rather than showing.

Her hero is named Darius? That's obviously Latin, plus she had a Greek king named Edward. Edward! You know, like Edmund, Edgar, Edwin, and all those Old English names. Why not Gawain and Uther Pendragon on Mount Olympus! It just isn't that hard to find a baby name book and look for Greek names or pick up a children's book about Greek mythology. I know the names are a minor point, but it really took me out of the story right off the start. In general, the author was good with the humor but not so good with dialogue (not enough dialogue for one thing) and not very good at characterization. The plot got kind of hokey and the epilogue specifically was a silly idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"I always look for books that involve Greek and Roman gods/goddesses and was anticipating this book as a light read. Well, it was a heavy book in that it kept falling to the bottom of my reading pile, buried under other, more worthwhile books. I would start and read a few pages, put it away and forget about it, then looking for something to read, find it and start again. The female heroine never came alive to me at all. We never learned enough of her psychological or emotional backstory to make her current behavior interesting. It was patently obvious early on who the missing father was going to be and that subplot added nothing the story esp when the sisters accept their father's failure to identify himself with no more than a shrug. The sections on Mt. Olympus were almost painfully trite, e.g. Zeus controls the weather with a computer. In the end, it was just not a very interesting book and I finished it only because I had grabbed it to read while on a plane trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable for all ages","review":"I enjoyed the book just as much as I did when I was younger and read it at a friend's request.

Fattypuffs are fat, their cars and boats are round, they are very jolly. Thinifers are thin, live in tall, thin buildings, and are workaholics. For the two brothers who discover this place, they learn that Fattypuffs and Thinifers hate each other, so the brothers try to help them become friends.I remember it fondly, although it is politically incorrect these days.

Also, Lord Melboure's dialog written to demonstrate his exagerated lisp (which at times was difficult to decipher) also interrupted the flow of the story. Last but not least, the silly bedroom scene on the inevitable wedding night (I skipped ahead), complete with a jealous cat and Irish Wolfhound, was a bit much to believe.I notice that other readers really liked this book, so perhaps I was looking for something different. Nonetheless, I prefer to like the main characters and found that difficult in this case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying","review":"I couldn't be bothered to finish the book.

Grizelda--Zel. That has to be the most unattractive name I've run across in a romance. Usually the heroines have such lovely names.

Tracks such as \\"Superlungs,\\" \\"Speak Now Or Forever Hold Your Peace\\" (some of you may remember the cover that Cheap Trick did of this one), and the awesome \\"Without Expression\\" are just a few of the highlights.

Since the paint squirts out of only roughly 4 holes on the surface of the roller, you end up with an uneven paint pattern, and huge amounts of drips. Also, since there are no clips to hold the roller nap on, the roll falls off at the slightest horizontal pressure, dumping paint everywhere. Save your money and buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a PaintMate Instead","review":"Send the few extra dollars and purchase the PaintMate or TurboRoll instead. I have owned all three models and strongly recommend against the Paint N Roll. I don't know why they sell this model, I guess they want a lower entry price product. Anyway, since you are manually forcing the paint into the roller, you have very little control over the saturation level. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT! Too much and it starts dripping and too little means not enough paint on the wall. The PaintMate uses a ratcheted handle to maintain precise saturation and the TurboRoll uses a battery driven motor to do the job. It is hard to roll the paint on the wall and manually force paint onto the roller at the same time so you have to stop to do it. With the other two models, you just keep on rolling as you feed the paint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relax, your're already home","review":"I can only agree with the above review(By Scott D.

Why the album 'Let's Do It Again' claims itself to be a Bestof from the Perception years remains a mystery to me, since there are no tracks on it from either this or their other Perception album 'Feel My Soul'.This is a nice little soul infected CD from the time when soul was about to become funk. The main emphasis is on the horns, there are some keys to give a fuller sound. The drumming is a bit more varied than on the later Fatback recordings, and this I enjoy a lot.There are also some sweet soul tunes, like 'Gotta Have You (Day By Day)' and the seven minute 'Baby Doll'. The whole session is a party though and it's worth joining in.

By April, 2011, it exhibited serious leaking under the sink. I disassembled the top of the faucet, tightened some stuff, and the leaking got better until about September, at which time there was a daily puddle under the sink that necessitated placing a bucket under the faucet.Right now I'm trying to get Moen to issue a replacement.

The company gladly gave me a new one at no charge after it broke the first time, but I had to pay a plumber to install it, so this time I'm going with another brand. Also, after a year or so the faucet extension never worked very well. Conclusion: it's way too expensive for what you are getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sacajawea","review":"This is a great book.

Here, though, it looks as if they could go on forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Follow-up","review":"I'll admit, I'm new to the Heep. My first CD was the remastered version of \\"Demons and Wizards\\" which blew me away. What a great hard rock album... ranks right up their with Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin of the early seventies. This CD, however, lacks any real stand-out tracks, has very corny lyrics (very \\"Tap\\"-ish), and only has one small section that really rocks (the guitar/drum midsection of the song \\"The Magician's Birthday\\".) I don't know how this album was received back in the day, but I'm sure the band lost some of the following they may have picked-up with \\"Demons and Wizards\\". I highly recommend \\"Demons and Wizards\\" to any Hard Rock/Classic Rock fan. I'd pass on this one. I'm not sure if I'll buy any more Heep albums after this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy. Very cheesy.","review":"I've tried quite a few times with this one. \\"Dated\\" seems like the wrong word to use, considering this IS a recording from the early 70's. However, it does sound dated in a bad way. Bad lyrics, corny vocal techniques, and too much organ make this sound like a parody. I didn't know that Uriah Heep was the inspiration for Spinal Tap until today when I read these reviews. However, I had already come to this conclusion on my own. Most of this album really does sound like Spinal Tap without the humor.There are only two tracks here that I find listenable. \\"Blind Eye\\" is OK and \\"Tales\\" is actually great with it's pedal steel guitar and vocal restraint. I'm giving this two stars simply because of \\"Tales\\".What I'm really surprised by is the praise that other reviewers have laid upon \\"Sweet Lorraine\\". It's a very straightforward and repetitive song that doesn't serve any purpose other than to show that this band is capable of sounding generic, as well as campy/corny/cheesy."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Who Was The Magician?","review":"If you're looking for the album which makes \\"Demons and Wizards\\" sound palatable, here it is. Dead weight trying to pass itself as heavy music, obstreperous and with but one redeeming quality - the silence when it's finally over, assuming it isn't still ringing in your ears and your ears aren't demanding why you violated their Eighth Amendment rights."},{"rating":"2","title":"An impenetrable fortress of kick-a** music!!!","review":"Heep proves, once again, that rock'n'roll can take us to a higher plane.

Kudos to the band for sharing some of this magic with the rest of us.

It can certainly do that and more since I carry three racquets and one even has a full cover on it. This bag could carry 4 if needed. I was afraid that I was going to get a fabric that was more cloth like rather than nylon since I have seen some variants of their bags that are more cloth/canvas like with a sprayed on texturized coating. Not so with this bag. It is synthetic all the way through (nylon/poly ?) so it will resist spills and keep the contents dry even in a light drizzle; which I already experienced.For the price and the quality, I am very pleased with this bag but I have not owned it long enough to reflect on the durability. So far, it has exceeded my expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"English Language in Perspective","review":"This book explains MacNeil's love and passion for the English language through his firsthand knowledge of it. He describes his first glimpses at the beauty of words by telling us the story of his childhood. Although it tells the story of a child growing up in a time of war in Canada it contains information and stories that everyone can find relatable. Any lover of the English language will enjoy this book. He hits you with just the right combination of history and personal experience to make the story real for the reader and yet informative at the same time. The information provided in this book is a mixture of both fact and opinion. Mr. MacNeil provides the history of his life and gives his opinion about how experience has influenced the initial spark and continuing devotion to the English language. I found it intriguing to look at the English language through such a different perspective than my own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent planer but very poor motor","review":"This is the 2nd 20\\" grizzly planer I have owned. The first one worked fine for 5 years . It had a 3 HP motor and had enough power if the knives were sharp to plane 1/8\\" off a 20\\" oak panel. I upgraded to this new one because it is listed as a 5 hp motor and it has solid infeed and outfeed tables. So I was very disappointed when I tried planing 1/8\\" on a 20\\" panel and the motor bogged down . Tried a pine 20\\" panel and it bogged and blew the start capacitor. This has since happened 3 more times and Grizzly has been of no help telling me the motor is fine. Build quality and finish looks good for a machine made in China [my first one was made in Taiwan]. However the Chinese motors are apparently junk. Plan on putting a good USA motor on this if you want to do any serious planing with this. Better yet have Grizzly put a good Baldor motor in it before they ship it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great - if you're not using a flash","review":"This attachment (wide or telephoto) is a good addition to your Canon A620. However be aware that the close proximity of the flash unit on the camera with the adapter itself, means \\"flash\\" pictures will include a shadow on every shot. (It looks like a part of your finger \\"thumb\\" or \\"Pinky\\" that is accidentally blocking part of the lens.I tried all sorts of adjustments but could not avoid the shadow. Probably the only sure bet is to use some software program to retouch the print.Again, this only happens when you use the flash (i.e. shooting a group shot on the living room sofa) If you don't plan on using the flash, or if there is sufficient lighting, to turn off the flash, then you won't see the shadow.The adapter is also useful in attaching telephoto lenses, filters, etc.I tried to upload a sample photo of this but was unsuccessful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably not worth it","review":"I bought the lens because I'm a Realtor and often find it difficult to get good shots of bathrooms or areas with small doorways. The lens creates a shadow around all four corners of the shot and the only way to avoid it is zoom in a little, defeating the purpose of the wide angle lens. It helps a little, but not as much as I had hoped for. You also can't use the flash because the lens creates a shadow in the middle of your shot, just like other reviewers had mentioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring........wanted to turn it off half-way through.","review":"I bought this film,as I love martial arts films, and have recommended many films to others. A couple of friends told me that I really haven't seen a martial arts film unless I've seen Ong-Bak, and the new and greatest martial arts actor Tony Jaa. So, I purchased the film and watched it last night. Now, I know everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but in my opinion, I wanted to turn the film off about half-way through, and watch some re-run on cable. The movie was boring, the story was pretty lame, terrible acting, and except for one great kick in the beginning of the film, I really wasn't impressed with his \\"screen\\" fighting sequences. Sure, this Tony Jaa is great jumping over things, but I really wasn't impressed with anything else. Also, most of the movie was people running through the streets, or chasing each other in taxi-cycles. If you want to see a movie with great story, acting, and fight scenes, buy \\"Ip Man\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice fighting movie","review":"The story is of course totally unoriginal, but who cares?

Brute Force doesn't always take someone down, and all the breakdown beatdowns keep the entertainment meter high.Only problem i need to complain on is the acting of everyone, which, really, does seem to be poor. Some peoples voices are just, ugh...but then again the action makes up for it.The quality was fine and the sound wasn't bad either. I wished it was in English because i wasn't in the mood to watch a film with subtitles, but with the voices most of these characters have, Thai is just fine for.Rent this on your own will, because even though the action lends some money to the acting, it may be too much bad delivery for someone to handle."},{"rating":"2","title":"ong bak rocked","review":"This is what I have been waiting for.

Wire fu in use, not noticable very movingly enjoyable and the action and moves are unseen anywhere else. One more movie to enjoy like a Schwarzenegger flick. Simple plot, awesome action! If you have been moved by Kickboxer the original movie, you for sure will enjoy this one and marvel at moves never seen before.

I flat out disagree. At the very least, Tony Jaa lacks the cinematic charm and appeal of Jackie Chan, and at worst he lacks the martial arts abilities.This film had no plot or story, the script may as well have been ad-libbed, and the acting was horrific. But that apparently doesn't mean much because Tony Jaa is capable of \\"tricking\\". I've seen him perform, and I think he'd get his [...] kicked in a real Muay Thai fight; his background is TKD spattered with enough MT to make him look somewhat beliveable. Otherwise, all he does are tricks. And they're not even very good tricks. FLashy kicks and spins which will appeal to a non-martial artist while the real martial artists just shake their heads and giggle uncontrollably at the stupidity of what he thinks is good for fighting.Let Jackie Chan be Jackie Chan, and leave this one on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Martial Arts Movie from Thailand.","review":"Ting (Tony Jaa) travels from his rural village to Bangkok to rescue a sacred Buddha (statue) head.

The action is great, the acting maybe not quite so much, but no body watches these kinds of movies for it's superb acting and dialogue, right?

The main character is an amazing martial artist. If you've ever liked a Bruce Lee or Jet Li movie then you'll love this. This movie has no strings or digital affects that make the actors do impossible stunts. Everything in this movie is done by the actors. The only drawback to this movie is the fact that in some parts the dubbing isn't that great. When they are trying to be serious you just might break out laughing because the dubbing is so horrid. But overall the movie is great and I recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun Action Flick, Terrible Blu-Ray transfer","review":"This has honestly got to be one of the worst bluray transfers on the market. I currently own over 100 blu ray movies, and have sat and watched every single one of them. I can safely say this is as bad as it gets. little to no upgrade from the DVD. infact, many upscaled DVD's produce greater video quality. A fine action outing, though rather amature especially in scenes like the the go-kart chase. It shows tremendous potential from now action star Tony Jaa, which we have seen fulfilled in more superior films such as Tom Yum Goong (The Protector) and this films sequel Ong Bak 2. Although we have yet to see his real acting chops, no one is watching these films for that. Still, If you own the DVD there is absolutely no reason to upgrade to BD. If you dont own the DVD and cant find it anywhere for a cheaper price then you might want to hold off on a purchase. I suggest sticking with Ong Bak 2 which has an infinitely better transfer though still not perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action at a New Level","review":"I have seen this movie and was amazed.

No on-screen presence, an annoyingly high voice - if he bleated \\"Humlae!\\" one more time... - and, what's worse in this movie, is that he is surrounded by other bad actors. No story, no character, no entertainment - except for Jaa's stunts (which were *always* run twice with a first- and second-camera arrangement that would drive you crazy). Look, there's more to a movie than stunts. Just stunts, no story: that's a circus,folks. It's almost like the old days of porn: guys and girls just doing it before Dirk Diggler discovered that, hey, you could add a real plot and acting. Yeah, let's put on a show in the barn!Maybe Tony can mature as an actor. Maybe he can get better scripts. (And not surround himself with annoying actor-cliches.)

It's about a revolutionary in 19th century Italy. Despite being written by a British author, it never got much traction in the english-speaking world but was apparently very popular in communist countries.This book (first published in the 1890s) is very much of its time in that it takes a romantic view of revolutions and revolutionaries. A view that is difficult to sustain today as so many revolutions have ended in gulags and dictatorships.On top of that I found the main character to be too annoying and unsympathetic. In order for this book to work you have to accept the Gadfly as being some sort of hero but I just couldn't.If you can forget the 20th century ever happened then maybe you'll be able to buy into the worldview of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too good to be true, but also too expensive","review":"I first read this book more than 50 years ago, and it has lost none of its punch.

The title track along with Cold Nights in Canada and Lady's Chains highlight his well-known adoration of the natural world, love of life and are typical of his best work. Berekely Woman and Angel From Montgomery are very listenable tracks. On the other hand, the \\"Christmas\\" song and \\"River of Love\\" are mauldin, almost satirical parodies of country music ballads. The good tracks shouldn't be missed. Perhaps just skip over the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Berkeley Woman\\" Alone is Worth the Cost","review":"What a great guy's song.

My father used to take the tape along when we went fishing in Wisconsin and we would listen to it over and over together. The material is a real departure from what John Denver usually records. There is a John Prine song in there, a Christmans song, a song about the Canadian Rockies, and it all fits together to form a relaxing, interesting record. I highly recommend Farwell Andromeda to any John Dever fan. It's different, but I bet you'll be playing it over and over just as I have.mike grabowski"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as pictured","review":"Received old, yellowed labels in another language.

The story is very simple and maybe you won't be any worry about it: You'll just let it pass. However, the camera does an excellent, beatiful work showing you children's feelings, an old man's smile, a mother's prayings...Moreover, the soundtrack music is played with traditional Viet Nam instruments and piano; both give melodies you would like. But it is not just music and dialogues, it also gives you a nice sound background from the chirping of insects, the songs of birds and childrens... even the broking sound of a vase is not disgusting.This is a movie for people who \\"stop to smell the flowers.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry--hated this movie","review":"I'm an asian female and the strange eroticizing of this woman is freakish to me.

It was poorly plotted, limply directed, and the acting (especially in the \\"grown-up\\" second half) stiff and unconvincing. The main actress grins dumbly as she blissfully goes about her chores... ugh. An Asian \\"Pretty Woman.\\" I suppose that the occasional curfew klaxon and roar-of-jet was a (snif) \\"poignant reminder\\" of the tragic politics unfolding over the wall of the sound stage. But the movie felt like elite Vietnamese and wistful French colonialist nostalgia. Bah! Overrated! Avoid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing movie","review":"Normally, I don't mind movies that use visuals instead of dialogue to tell the story as long as the visuals give a good insight into the character. I also don't mind if the plot is simple as long as it is revealed in a compelling way. However, the visuals seem to give a sense of the environment around the characters than revealing anything about the characters especially in the second half. Nothing in the movie compelled me to feel anything for the character even when she finally got the guy.

There is nothing redeeming about any of the characters, as they are not fleshed out to any degree. Why? Because the director was obsessed with bombarding the viewer with silent, mind-numbing, atmospheric cinematography, at the expense of everything else. It therefore explains nothing about the most important element: its characters--the PEOPLE!I hated this movie; so did my wife. So should you.

Deliberately small in scope (it's all about details), it's a cinderella story set in Saigon, right down to the gold shoe reference. The main character, Mui, grows up a servant in a fairly well-off household, and the story follows her from age seven to adulthood, when she becomes the mistress of her own house. But it's as much about ants, papaya, toads, crickets, window-grates, and cooking as it is about Mui."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple but delightful.","review":"After seeing this sweet little film, I wanted to make my own movies. More to the point, I wanted to run right out and buy my own movie camera and be a cinematographer. I am a still photographer (25 years), but after viewing \\"Green Papaya,\\" I wondered why I hadn't been into film making before.

I can't tell you how amazingly hilarious it was reading about how the perfect boy prince stowed away with peasants and then single-handedly saved the village from barbarians. Or how his poignant heartache leads him to (ha!) \\"win a race by only two lengths, not three\\". With pretentious musings like those, who cares if Alexander's perfection is a dramatic weakness?Unless one considers that perfection itself is his weakness - he finds himself constantly removed from other humans. Although friendly and social, with devoted comrades, Alexander has great difficulty being intimate. His striving to \\"be the best\\" keeps him self-conscious. It's an awkward, pathetic weakness, but I found it endearing. My only gripe is that his transformation into a more worldly figure was not stretched out more in the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"There was no way I would not enjoy this book. I love history, love reading about Alexander the Great, love a good gay romance novel, and appreciate good literature. This novel satisfies all of those loves. AlthoughThe Persian Boyis for some reason regarded a bit more highly by the literary establishment, I personally prefer this one for non-literary reasons: I simply enjoyed reading about the younger Alexander more than about the battles that take center stage in the latter book, and I also felt that the love relationship between Alexander and Hephaestion was more intense, compelling, and beautifully presented than the primary relationship with Bagoas in the second book. But that is only my opinion. Obviously, many readers enjoy the second book more. In any case, I encourage anyone who hasn't read them to read both and to read this one first for obvious reasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really liked it","review":"Great historical fiction. One must keep in mind that generally the farther back you go in history it becomes more fiction and less historical. However the character development is good and the story flows along nicely. The only thing that caused me to give it 4 instead of 5 is that she portrays him as being almost flawless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meticulously researched","review":"Mary Renault did meticulous research for her story of Alexander the Great from birth to manhood. It is told from the viewpoint of another young man, employed by Alexander, who became his personal servant and close friend. The various happenings in Alexander's life are taken from recorded history, and fully filled out with descriptions of the culture and mores of the times. Most of the people mentioned were actual persons who interacted with Alexander, including his parents, who fought bitterly over his allegiance to each of them. I found it a fascinating history, and noted a stark comparison of times throughout the ages. Nothing changes."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like fictional history....","review":"I have enjoyed Mary Renault's books for years. Her stories about Alexander the great are some of my favorites.

As for action, there are authors with much more emphasis in regards to the actual battles, than what Mary Reanult handles. In very few words, the historical content is non impressive, the action is missing, and the homosexual content is constant, if any of those aspects bother you, DONT READ THIS BOOK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freakin Awsome!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Just got this cd and it is really good.

I am an avid reader and the material in this book will help me to enjoy and understand the things I read. While I do not believe that just anyone can write a readable novel, this book has a number of useful tips and much insight into the process of writing. This book provides a framework getting the job done as a writer. It also provides a look at the nut and bolts of the life of a writer.The chapter on point of view was especially interesting.

Reading this book was painful as it had all the grammar issues other readers pointed out, and even if you make your way through you realize that it is simply describing stuff you already know a long time ago in an over-complicating way, as if the sole purpose is just to make matters hard to understand.

The first time I tried to fold it up in the cold winter the frame cracked and I returned the stroller to the store to exchange for a new one. I am still quite unimpressed by the cheapness in quality as compared to the single Evenflo stroller system I used to have. As the other reviewer said, it is very difficult to push and manuever, as well as to fold and lift (for me). The front seat does not seem very padded or comfortable, and is not large enough to lie the child down and change a diaper with ease as I used to do when out & about with my other children (at county fairs, etc.) I like the stroller for it's utility, cupholders and the large storage area underneath.

The game looked cheap, it also looked like we were shipped a product that was previously opened. It did not work and I am sure it was a returned product. Called the supplier and was told that we would be e-mailed a return shipping sticker. It never came. Called again and got an answering machine, left a message, still no reply. Called our credit card company and they deducted it from our bill. Two weeks later and still no reply from the seller."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},C=["disabled"],x={key:0},R={key:1};function H(a,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",M,[(o(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(o(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(o(),i("span",R,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",x,"See more"))],8,C)):b("",!0)])}const N=d(B,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-89cec16e"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/33.md","filePath":"guide/33.md"}'),W={name:"guide/33.md"},G=Object.assign(W,{setup(a){return(e,n)=>(o(),i("div",null,[v(N)]))}});export{j as __pageData,G as default};
