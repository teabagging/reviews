I also think that some of the information can be a bit sketchy and there is a portion of the book dedicated to standard aquarium set up which I don't feel should be included in a fish specific book..

However, sailors have called ordinary seamen \\"deck apes,\\" \\"powder monkeys\\" and the like for centuries. One can find discussions of this in many online dictionaries. The lyrics in the film say \\"the monkeys have no tails, they've been bitten off by whales,\\" a rather whimsical view of maritime life. The verse, \\"He won't go back to Subic anymore\\" obviously is meant for the \\"Doc\\" who sheds a silent \\"tear\\" as one of the \\"monkeys.\\" Clearly, the audiences since 1945 have forgotten the naval slang. I'm satisfied that no insult toward our WWII allies even contemplated by cast and crew. Great film filled with great scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A spendid story ... but","review":"This is certainly a classic John Wayne war movie. I take a star away only because it departs too much from the book of the same name. The true story of Admiral (then Lieutenant) Bulkeley's exploits in the early days of the war is a much more powerful story than that portrayed in the movie. I had the honor of meeting Admiral Bulkeley before his death. As a naval officer, it was an honor to follow in the footsteps of this unassuming hero; a holder of the Congressional Medal of Honor. He helped shape our victory in WWII and the Navy that followed after. Watch the movie and cheer John Wayne on. Then read the book of the same name."},{"rating":"2","title":"Randy O'Toole...otoolefam@msn.com","review":"There is no doubt in my mind that this is the best war movie ever made. Many people thought John Wayne was just an allright type of actor, but he gives his best performance of his life in this movie. Robert Montgomery, who had just came back from active service, gives an outstanding performance as the skipper.As all John Ford movie's are great, this is a masterpiece. The action scenes alone are worth the admission. The cast is very well known, but it seems that they are not acting, but actually fighting this war with a great sense of dignity and valor.I wish that Steven Spielberg would do another war movie like Saving Private Ryan, and do a remake of this film. Most people today are not aware of the dark days for the United States that took place right after Pearl Harbor, and the fight that our men and women took to the Japanese is this lost cause.They were gallant. They were brave. They were Expendable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another of the great war films.","review":"This is the one that should be paired with \\"Bataan,\\" instead of \\"Back to Bataan.\\" John Ford had directed and filmed a number of combat documentaries before making this film, while Robert Montgomery had been a PT Boat commander in combat. The result is another of the great war films. LIke \\"Bataan,\\" it is very poignant and noticeably absent is the hyper-patriotic jingoism of many war films of the era.

I am a former submariner, so I was looking forward to reading my first book from this author.I only read the first 1/3 of it and put it away. I am not a prude, but the graphic (I mean REALLY graphic, unecesary sex scenes, and unnecesarily sick torture scenes were so blatantly offensive that I will probably never read another book by this author again! It should be restricted to a shelf in an Adult Bookstore.Aside from that, the book is cluttered with too much procedural detail.

For example he states that \\"nobody really knows what causes St Elmo's fire\\", yet most high school science students know exactly what causes it. He also discusses ball lightning as if it were real, when it's never been proven to exist. Rather than trying to be easy to understand, the author opted for cutesy phrases as if he were talking to a four year old, to the point that it is difficult to understand even the table of contents.

If you eject and reinsert the disc, it will usually, but not always start up again about half a second after it froze and you can keep watching. It is a real annoyance, and you aren't supposed to have to do this on such an expensive system, but you can actually watch almost any disc. Still, for this amount of money, they should bloody well have made a player that can read non-defective discs without freezing up.You are better off putting together a component system yourself.

My age group is busy gathering facts so I think this book may be too misleading. For example in the last part of the book, General George Gordon Meade is killed by Wade Hampton supposedly along Pipe Creek after the disasterous defeat at Union Mills. Meade's body is carried back to the confederate camp where General Lee hears the good news. But according to another reference book General George Gordon Meade was an American general whose dates are 1815 to 1872. The defeat at Union Mills in northern Maryland was within days of the July 1-3, 1863 battle at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. But I loved the dialogue in the story. It shows the North slowly beginning to produce generals and an army to defeat the South. The characters also tell the hardships of total war that both sides experienced. The dialogue catches the reader and sounds very natural."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very solid ppv","review":"I enjoyed this ppv quite a bit.

In his role as a WW2 submarine commander, he does not disappoint. The film works very well with his able and steady hand at the periscope. Their mission is to infiltrate Tokyo Harbor to get important meteorological information. Their journey has the travails suffered by sub crews - air attacks, medical emergencies and other near misses.Remember: This is a war film made to encourage Americans in a still desperate fight against Japanese fascism. The scales have not yet tilted in America and democracy's favor. So yes, there are jabs at the Japanese as the enemy but that makes this film not just realistic but an authentic piece of recorded history for the temperament of these times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Destination Tokyo","review":"One of the definative WW-II sub movies ever made. Plenty of story lines and action and drama. It was made at the height of the war, before we turned the tide in the Pacific. It was a morale booster for the people of the U.S. Today's Follie-wood would not make this movie. At least not as it was originally made.

It depicts properly the Japanese system for what it was and chronicles the American soldier's hope for the future and his pride in fighting for it. I recommend this movie for sound minded American patriotic viewers, young and old alike, who collect movies for both historical accuracy and quality entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"You might be surprised.","review":"A WWII sub film made during the war? Probably a jingoistic, even racist, bit of ma-and-apple-pie propaganda with woefully dated special effects. That much is true of Destination Tokyo, to be sure. From that angle, it's still an interesting bit of WWII-meets-Hollywood history, and its plot even ties into the famous Dolittle raid. (The film never calls the raid by that name, but it uses the actual footage of the bombers leaving the carrier Hornet, so it's all clear enough what the inspiration is if you know WWII history.)Destinaton Tokyo is also a strong enough film in its own right as long as you can accept/stomach its propaganda aims. The action sequences are pretty exciting by the day's standards, and the nicely acted slice-of-life bits with the colorful crew are formulaic but quite entertaining nonetheless. They're often funny too, thanks to John Garfield's perpetually horny braggart character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had To Return","review":"I was rather disappointed because this DVD would not play on my DVD player.

Unlike a lot of pretty movie stars, Grant had talent & could play anything believeably. Proof here. He is Capt. Cassidy of the USS Copperfin. It can be forgiven its jingoistic, propaganda tone (hey, there's a war going on!) because it is a very good movie. It was done in the Warner Bros. trademark style: efficient with no wasted effort. It has the added virtue of being done mid-war, 1943, like its competiton from Century Fox, Crash Dive. It is slightly better without that silly Tyrone Power romance nonsense. It has the stock character actors most notably Alan Hale as Cookie. I love that guy! Also just like a Warner Bros. film, it was shot in glorious black & white which is the way I prefered it, thank-you. Great war-time stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slammin!!!!","review":"AllFrumTha i's self titled debut is nothing short of slammin. It is a typical Westside Connection-type album with production be Mack 10 and cameos by the WSCG bunch (10, Ice Cube, WC, Comrads.....) but it outshines most of the others' work because the beats are strong. The album is hard core G-Funk. \\"County Jail\\" is tight; they tell a chilling tale of going to jail among enemies over a sample of Roger and Zapp's \\"So Ruff, So Tuff\\" you can lowride to. \\"Caps\\" is a hard core song with a tight beat.

Normally, Baldacci's strength is his plotting and pacing, but those skills are largely absent in this novel.The characterization in TOTAL CONTROL is paper-thin, which is a common problem with a lot of Baldacci's work. Normally, his plotting skills make up for the cartoonish characters, but that doesn't happen here. The result is a tedious, confusing read that is not worth your time.I've read about eight novels by Baldacci, and I would say TOTAL CONTROL was probably the worst of the bunch. Avoid this one, and read ABSOLUTE POWER if you haven't done so already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would make a great silent movie","review":"Interesting idea, but oddly written. I'm not talking grammar and syntax, like some other reviewers. I refer to the over-the-top style. Everything is a crisis!!! On every page characters are wincing or gimacing, their throats are constricting, they cannot breathe. I spent a lot of my time rolling my eyes. Why didn't I just put it down? Good question- it is just compelling enough to keep turning those pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite a Thrill Ride","review":"This was my first David Baldacci book and not the usual genre of books I read, but I found it to be a face-paced, exciting tale of industrial espionage and counter-espionage. The many characters and numerous plots twists and turns keep the reader engrossed throughout the almost 700 pages. Written in 1997, the computer and internet technology described may have been somewhat complicated then, but today in 2002, is very easy to read and comprehend. My one criticism is that, like many other authors today, Baldacci appeared to be writing this novel with a screenplay already in mind. Yes, it would make a great movie - but I think he was making that assumption just a tad too early."},{"rating":"1","title":"Raves, or Ads?","review":"A piece of advice to surfers reading these reviews: a rave is one thing, but one that seems so worshipful of the text in question as to be nearly orgasmic should be highly suspect of being less a neutral review and more an advertisement submitted by paid employees of the publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing pages","review":"Enjoyed the book. Like all Baldacci's books it's a fast entertaining read. But, this book came without the first 16 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable read!","review":"This book grabs you from page one. Looked forward to reading it each day. His characters are believable and interesting. His knowledge of background information shows a lot of research. You will enjoy this book. His style is similar to John Grisham."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost A Good One","review":"Baldacci almost struck gold with this one. But..... The narrative starts off at a fast pace. Got my interest going quickly. Then the first surprise came up. Good One! Hadn't thought of that possibility. But then the book keeps going, and going, and going, and going, with plot reversal after plot reversal....to the point that it is difficult to remember how one got to where the book is. This book could have been shortened by half, or turned into two books. The thing is just too darn long, and never comes to an end."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring book","review":"The story gets lost among all the emotional situations depicted in the book.

I liked the questions he raises about the potential excesses of technology, and the underlying greed that motivates many (but not all). I got a little tired of all the gunfights, but I liked the pace, and I was surprised by the ending. The protaganist is appealing, though I really didn't believe she would want to spend all her time at home with Amy. Was that a subtle message to us working women?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Baldacci's major gift is dialogue.","review":"I am surprised that not more of his books have been put to film because Baldacci is a master of dialogue. I imagine that it may be due to the fact that \\"Absolute Power\\" was so badly mangled as a film and by the Clint Eastwood no less.I put down Philip Margolin's \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" and opened this book up trying to catch up on some novels that were lying around. I rarely don't finish a book but Margolin's dialogue was so terrible that I just could not finish \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" even though the plot was semi interesting. So Baldacci seemed like a breath of fresh air. The criticisms about the plot implausability from many other reviewers is somewhat true, but it is well crafted and reads well because his characters come alive with their always spot on dialogue. A lot of the internet dot com intrigue seems a bit dated already, but it still is an excellent page turner. Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet another page turner!","review":"In this novel of intrigue and science, Baldacci suggests a world where the bad guys develop technology that turns the entire world's security on its head. By inventing a technique that renders security screening obsolete, a frightening new world could be ushered into being. Unless of course Oliver Stone and his club of misfit friends, with the welcome addition of an MI 6 operative can stop it. Well constructed, and within the bounds of possibility, this makes for a good read indeed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This was my first David Baldacci book and I loved it. Will be reading more of his books for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Real Disappointment","review":"Don't you just hate in the slasher movies where the teenage girl is being chased out the front door by some guy in a hockey mask wielding a cleaver and instead of running toward the potential safety of neighbors, she runs around the house into the dark, secluded woods.That's exactly how I felt reading this book. The main character just keeps making terrible choices that kept me wincing through the whole book. I'm not a stickler for believability in a book like this, but I hate when a supposedly intelligent lawyer, wife and mom makes absurd choices one after another.I'm not sure why I finished reading this book except to say that it held my attention just enough to keep me reading to the end.And see how many times Sidney, the main character, has \\"tears streaming down her face\\". I lost count.You probably want to pass on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A terrific read right from the start!","review":"I had never read Baldacci before, but this book grabbed me right from the start and didn't let go!

It had an even more compelling middle (who? who is the bad guy??). The last third of the book imploded as I was pleading for lead character Sydney to get \\"done in\\" by the bad guys for being so utterly stupid and annoying. Nothing in this book added up well as it concluded. Baldacci let me down on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOTALLY FIRST CLASS!!","review":"BALDACCI DOES IT AGAIN, HE FOLLOWED UP ABSOLUTE POWER WITH ANOTHER EXCELLENT ADVENTURE. I ONLY HOPE HE CAN KEEP IT UP AND NOT TURN INTO ANOTHER JOHN GRISHAM. TOTAL CONTROL IS FAST PACED, VERY SAD AT TIMES AND PROVIDES SOME GREAT INSIGHT INTO THE WORLD OF EMAIL. IF YOU LIKED ABSOLUTE POWER, THIS IS A MUST READ.

Doesn't follow from the stor"},{"rating":"2","title":"Total Control draws the net and wont let go!","review":"Absolute Power started the roller coaster ride that is continued by Total Control!! Through the eyes of Sydney Archer, we are taken for a thrill ride of suspense and danger that doesn't forget that we have emotions. David Baldacci did a masterful job of introducing us to characters that we can understand and sympathize with. The characters respond in ways we would expect them to if the situation were real, not like puppets to make the novel run smoothly. We learn to love and hate, and even to mourn with his characters. Baldacci has forged for himself a place with the great action and suspense authors like Dick Francis and Clive Cussler, and he will always be welcome on my bookshelf"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Control is a Total Disappointment.","review":"To those of you who are expecting something at least as good as Absolute Power, wait. Wait for the paperback so you can cut your losses. The story goes in circles. The key to a good novel is that it makes you wonder what will happen next. This book doesn't. Hopefully, he'll find his voice on the next book"},{"rating":"2","title":"A terrific read","review":"This is an older novel that has lost none of its steam. Their are many twists and turns, but for the most part they retain the plausibility that often goes out the window. Since this is an older book and technology plays such a strong role, there are many things which technologically are out of date. If you look at it as a historical novel, albeit recent, that potential problem area fades rapidly. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"It kept me going","review":"I liked the book. It wasn't as good as The Simple Truth in my eyes but it kept my interest. Good characters in Sidney,Jason, and Sawyer. If you like Balduccis other work you'll enjoy it. I also think if you like Sandford, Grisham, or Martini you should try to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair thriller -- he has done better.","review":"The dialogue is a bit weak and the story isn't believeable at times. Descriptions of the emotions of some of the characters was excellent but other parts of the book were very sub-par."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable! Great 'beach read'.","review":"Baldacci is no Stegner when it comes to writing style, but despite the 'unpolishedness', I couldn't put it down. The plot twists were both surprising and convincing. The characters were stereotypical, but were still very likable (or hateable!) and not altogether unbelievable. I will definately take Baldacci to the beach again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally absorbing novel,couldn't put it down.","review":"High tech read. It was great to see a woman with brains.

I highly recommend this book and his other novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Letdown","review":"The book was interesting, but to do all that reading and be let down at the end...Very disapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful.","review":"Baldacci must have a lot of close personal friends. There is no other way to explain a positive review of this book. Bad character development, rediculous plot, poor (if any) research."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Follow-Up to \\"Absolute Power\\"","review":"David Baldacci showed he had a knack for characters and plotting in \\"Absolute Power.\\" In \\"Total Control\\" (and his subsequent novels), he loses that knack. This book starts off very slow as he throws all of his character detail into the first few pages. He also has a very bad habit of telegraphing things that will happen later on in the story, so when it does appear the reader is neither surprised nor riveted. I won't bother writing a review for \\"The Winner\\" and his subsequent books; they are all the same. If you suffer from insomnia, read the first few chapters of his post-\\"Absolute Power\\" works; they'll put you to sleep in no time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Beleive it or not, I stayed up the whole night to read it.

I almost stopped reading it,but, because I really like this authors work, I continued on --and on---and on. The second half of the book was better, lots of action, but it was really implausable. The end was so fast paced and so impossible that it was almost funny, a lot of super people running around offing each other. I thought it would never end!! I am a prolific reader and generally finish a book in two days, sometimes less, but this one was the exception. This bokk was certainly not bad, but it wasnt good either!!! When it comes to action, sometimes less is better than more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baldacci back in \\"Control\\" again!","review":"After the disappointing \\"True Blue,\\" it was nice to read another Baldacci thriller that fills the bill again. Sidney and Jeffrey Archer are your typical upwardly mobile couple, raising their little daughter Amy. Jeffrey works for a technology company, Sidney (yes, she's a girl) is a corporate attorney. Jeffrey has been doing some mysterious stuff after hours but the plane in which he is flying to LA mysteriously crashes, killing nearly 200 people. On the day of Jeffrey's memorial service, Sydney receives a phone call...from Jeffrey...which sets a non-stop thriller in motion that ultimately goes off in so many directions it's sometimes hard to keep up. There is corporate greed, a sex scandal, double identities, sociopaths, chases, gun battles, people sneaking around in dark office buildings. It's a thriller you can't put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Total Control","review":"I thought this was a very good book.Again David Baldacci did a good job with the characters and getting you root for the good guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puerile writing","review":"The negative reviews by other readers here say it all.

And so did the woman sitting next to me. We both proceeded to plow through the thing. But the whole time, I kept asking why? Contrived and ridiculously implausible plot. Characters so thin they seem to lack substance entirely. I mean, a corporate lawyer-mom who can outmanouver an entire swat-team of bad guys? Come on! But, hey, it did the job. Before I knew it, we were home, and we'd both finished the damn thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trips up on his technology","review":"For someone who brags about his research (many discrepancies noted by other reviewers) Baldacci (or his editor) needs to try harder. I was particularly put off by the plane crash gaff, by instant on/off laptops, by a character rushing through airport security with a computer (having often been delayed proving that mine didn't contain a bomb), by the flawless operating of AOL. Most of all, thriller writers should spend time at a gun range and with other hands-on research of weapons. Baldacci might then know that semi-automatic pistols (better called \\"auto loading\\") do NOT fire on full automatic when the trigger is held and that the Winchester Defender, with its plastic stock, is hardly the battering ram Sydney makes of it. The author's omniscient viewpoint was downright annoying; with phone conversations particularly it is hard to tell the characters aren't face to face. Dialog ranged from TV script trite to legalese pretentious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the first book but still good","review":"I thought Absolute Power was GREAT!!

Mr. Hagen's new book, like his first book, \\"Buddhism: Plain and Simple,\\" does an excellent job in describing the \\"wisdom\\" component of Zen Buddhism. But just like in his first book, Mr. Hagen's new book is totally devoid of any discussion of the \\"compassion\\" component. Thus, this book makes Zen Buddhism seem like a purely intellectual excercise, devoid of any warmth or heart. Compare, for example, Mr. Hagen's books with anything written by \\"Bhante G,\\" Henepola Gunaratana. In his books, Bhante G makes (Theravada) Buddhism come alive with wisdom AND compassion. The tone of Bhante G's books is one of warmth, with a human face.

Idealizes Buddist teachings as unique and superior to all others. Does not seem aware of his own motives for buying in. As the Publisher's Weekly review above states, he is \\"didactic.\\" He assumes a teacher-student relationship between himself and his reader. Critical readers will revolt.

Darcy goes home at the same time to help her crippled father and the two meet again. True love prevails (or so we think) and then the story falls apart with a crash.

They then asked for the model. I sent them a photo of the model # located under the battery. Their last E Mail to me stated \\"Thank you for the pictures and the verification. The exact case should fit your device perfectly.\\"They offered a refund IF and ONLY IF I paid the return shipping. Then, they were going to deduct an additional 20% because the package had been opened! How could you even know there was a problem without opening the package? Huh?

It is very interesting to see how the show has changed from this season. Best person on this show - Austin Scarlett!! He is amazing and I am rooting for him on All-Stars! He needs a fashion show! You will also love to hate Wendy Pepper! Do see this season, it is great to see where it all began"},{"rating":"2","title":"Campy, Queeny, and Classic!","review":"We all know that Season Two is when this series really took off, but if you're going to appreciate what happened later, you need to know where it all began. If you enjoy fashion, queer culture, or just high pressure competition, you SHOULD OWN Project Runway Season One. Yes, yes, I know that Project Runway isn't marketed as a \\"gay\\" TV show, but with flamboyent characters like Austin and Jay (and dare I say Tim Gunn?), the show's fabulous nature just can't be denied. Combined with the fashion these designers produce, which can range from stunning to sickening, this series is one you just can't live without."},{"rating":"2","title":"good start","review":"I watched PR starting from season 3 and recently I read the newest book by Tim Gunn so I decided to get the first Season on DVD. Pulled an all-nighter and had a blast watching how it all began and comparing it to how it works now (Heidi doesn;t do as much personal greeting, Tim is smoother but still right on the mark, the basement where it all began looks so pedestrian!)The whole Wendy drama was a bit much & at the end-- SPOILER ALERT-- I really thought Kara should have been disqualified or penalized more heavily for the way she cheated with the shoes. It's tough to make Wendy look sympathetic but Kara did that with the way she handled the shoe issue. Wendy called her out and she was spot on. I don;t think Kara would have been allowed to get away with this on later shows. But I guess since Jay won it was a mute point. Tim did his best to level the playing field--and the show must go on. If you want to see its \\"rough\\" beginnings, this Season is a hoot and well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely amazing!","review":"As a reality show junkie, I was skeptical that this show would offer anything new. Unlike other shows, the participants are judged on their talent alone. Backstabbing and plotting, which has become commonplace in other shows, will not save you here. As one designer will eventually discover...what goes around, comes around.Another thing to note, Heidi Klum carries herself gracefully and isn't in your face, like other models with reality shows. She isn't building herself up and she never acts fake to impress other people.This show was nominated for an Emmy after the first season. Trust me; it is the greatest reality show ever. If you live for fashion, you will appreciate the talent and technique on this program. It was unbelievable to watch these designers bring material to life in just a few hours. I gained enormous respect with anyone with the ability to sew and design. I cannot wait until season two!

But, my girlfriend made me watch it, and I got hooked. More than the later seasons, they got a bunch of characters together and stirred the pot. The clothes are important, but the real show is the interaction between the designers. It's entertaining, and the more you like \\"drama\\" the more you will like the show. Some of the smallest things get blown so out of proportion, and that's just more entertainment for us. A wonderful show, and they have just the right people (Tim Gunn, Michael Kors, Nina Garcia) involved, helping the designers along and judging their output. Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"One day you're IN, the next day you're OUT\\"","review":"I would never have guessed that I would someday purchase the DVDs of a reality show, but this is the one that changed my mind. Aspiring fashion designers compete to win the chance to be \\"America's next great fashion designer\\" - what could be better? First of all, it is a competition based on true talent and skill - there is no faking it in these challenges - either you can put together a garment or you can't. Secondly, as fashion designers are artists, huge personalities abound (judges, models and contestants!) - no shrinking violets here. Finally, each weekly challenge is unique meaning each episode remains fresh - occasional twists help this cause.Overall, one of the most fascinating shows on television today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clothing design for the untalented viewer","review":"I caught one Project Runway of the second season and really enjoyed it. Therefore, I asked for the first season for my birthday. I just got it last week and finished it in two days. Morning, noon and night watching till I was bleary-eyed. I absolutely loved it and am going to order the third season right now. I am not a bit artistic, can't sew, not a great cook; in other words I am not runway material. But, I am in awe of talent and these finalists do have it.

There was only one store locally that was selling it, and I was ready to pay $100 for the set, if they only could find second seat cover. Not only are this seat covers comfortable, but they are also cool looking ( especially in black Mustang GT). Everyone with leather seats knows that love/hate relationship with temperatures ( too hot in summer, too cold in winter). Sure, this seat cover does get warm in closed car during summer, but not even close to the heat of leather seats. All together, not only very practical, cool looking and durable seat cover, but also got them for great price on amazon, and ordered additional set for gift to friend who always wanted same set. There is only one tip: this seat cover goes over the hooks for seat belt in mustang, so you will have to cut the opening for the belt or leave it as it is ( like I did)."},{"rating":"2","title":"For SOHO business operators","review":"How to Promote Your Home Business is a basic how-to book for those who are anticipating or just starting a home business.

Nevertheless, it is very interesting and a good book for any backpackers in Peru to have. He gives a good feel for what an expedition is like and the preparatory drudgery that is involved. He covers no less than seven different expeditions. Some are covered in two sentences because he only discovered that nothing was in the explored area. But when he discovers the lost cities, you want to start exploring yourself and, because of the pictures, you feel that you are there. In general, the more you know about Peruvian exploration, the more interesting you will find this book.

The plot device used to build a good part of this story is overdone in recent romance literature, but Ms. Sterling made it intriguing all over again.I was struck by the incredible intimacy of the first love scene. It was so well written that I was reminded once again of why sex and sharing is a vulnerable experience and why it must be treated with such care by both parties.

No -- it's not a juvenile romance, but a purported legal thriller (although \\"thriller\\" is not an apt term for this tedious plodder). I love to read mysteries that develop the main characters/investigators, but not at the expense of the mystery and story itself. Unfortunately, this book does not succeed in balancing characterization with plot. The plot is not compelling; I never had difficulty putting the book down. And even the characterization fails, relying on artifice (the nun's voice) and stilted dialogue. I am giving the book two stars instead of one simply because I did appreciate the description of the pre- and post-trial processes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Summary of Clive's Work - But Beware Editorial Description!","review":"This is a well-compiled group of Clive Gregson solo tunes from his first solo album in 1985 through the most-recent \\"Long Story Short\\".

This one is a nicely remastered collection of Clive tunes, some of which have been re-recorded or completely re-mixed. If you're a Clive completist (which I am), this is a must buy.

It's very similar to shows like Nadesico or Dragonaut. The thing that makes this anime good like the others I mentioned is the multitude of cool characters it has. There are plenty of neat characters that are fun and that keep the story interesting. The story line is pretty cool. There are 3 men stuck on a ship of women. In their world women and men live separately and do not interact. This makes for a lot of funny and awkward situations. The animation is pretty good and the voice acting isn't bad either. Vandread isn't exactly an original masterpiece, but it's pretty entertaining and lots of fun. If you're looking for an amazing and original story, then look elsewhere. If you just wanna laugh and have fun then Vandread is a good place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and Fun","review":"Animation is quite good. Story is also interesting. CGI scenes could have been better, yet, still much better than the Divergence Eve series.I liked the characters also, they are very distinct and varied in nature.Most of the time the series is full of cliche anime stuff but that's why we like'em. Nonetheless the story has nice twists and turns and also some great scenes. I don't want to spoil but, there is one scene that put tears to my eyes. (Hint: Second Stage, Third Episode)I enjoyed it very much. Though not great, I can easily recommend this series, its nice and fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard Hitting!!! The truth is out there...","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I recommend it highly. I spent 1984-85 in South Africa when the policy of \\"Apartheid\\" was the law. Races were heavily discriminated against, and some ended up as human slaves. Later, in 1998, I witnessed this again, but this time in a United States Commonwealth. The book, Modern Slavery and the Global Economy, identifies the horrific realities of Modern Slavery through first-person accounts. It also gives insight to the growing global economy and a possible connection.

Unfortunately, jackets of this quality are available at Wal-Mart for less than $20.00 and I passed on them.I don't find this jacket to be very well designed. To protect against rain, you had better be sure and keep the hood on tight. Otherwise, the fuzzy fabric lining the hood gets drenched.

Their version of Truby Trio's frenentic \\"A Go Go\\" takes things down a notch and ups the reverb factor. But when they give up their own tracks, the results can be just as good. Les Demon Flowers give a funky downtempo spin on \\"Under My Sensei\\" and Soulboy Collective goes for uptempo breaks on \\"Night Over Manaus.\\" And their collaboration with Emo on \\"Can't Take No More\\" is pure dub heaven.

A very enjoyable read and I hope to see more works by him soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thirst for knowledge","review":"I feel that one must read 'the cosmic serpent', his previous book, to truly appreciate this work. However, having said that, this book is an excellent extension of his earlier thoughts and shows another angular viewpoint to the ultimate questions of life. I believe Narby is \\"on to something\\" with his work and I admire the heart and soul he gives to furthering our knowledge by gracefully pushing the envelope of the Western mindset.

It's a beautiful piece of furniture that performs well as a record player/tape player.The CD player is a little bit funky. Maybe I'm just getting used to it.

Nice wood finish, and the sound is impressive. Now I saw someone here said he had problems with the tape deck so I tried and I can confirm it is the weakest link of the whole unit. Do not even think about playing a tape, chances are it will catch into the mechanism. But who cares about tapes, anyway? The CD changer works great, and the record player is quite decent.

I had two CDs in the CD player and I had to take the entire CD player apart in order to get my CDs. The CD player plays the CDs but the mechanism to open the compartment no longer works, so that doesn't help matters at all.

Get a copy or three before the print run is over!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good poems, great translation","review":"This translation is very readable. The notes are always very interesting and help the text come alive. Red Pine has really provided a lot of value through them - without them, some of the poems could be very obscure. It is rare to find a translation of the complete works of a Chinese poet: most books only present a selection. If one takes the time to read the complete oevre, however, the author comes alive in a different way - you begin to recognize certain recurring moods and themes; in the end, you feel you have learnt something about the things that concerned him, and come closer as a result.The only criticism is that Red Pine uses a personal transliteration that is neither pinyin nor Wade-Giles; as a result, it is often hard to be sure of the identity of people and places he mentions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!

GREATLY improve the waist-strap so the weight is actually carried there and the padding is enough to handle the load.2. Tilt the kid slightly forward so they aren't leaning back away from you.

Its reaching the straps and clicking them into the buckle that is difficult. The buckle is situated at the botton of the seat, and getting my son into the seat along with my hand to hold the buckle so he doesnt sit on it is impossible. (Big hands). So hes not a fan of sitting on the buckle and my hand trying to remove it just to strap him in. In addition, it is difficult to take off your back without help, but having the expandable base allows me to sit it down on the couch, chair, or ground and remove the straps in order to take it off.

I could not wear this for more than 15 minutes without my shoulders and back killing me! My husband tried it too and had the same reaction.

I tried it and after 10 minutes my back was killing me. Very poor ergonomic design. No matter how tightly I pulled the shoulder straps, the so called padded back would not come in contact with my shoulder blades. The entire weight was sitting on my sacral bone, actually cutting in, not very well padded at the bottom. I had to lean forward to try counterbalance the weight, which causes a lot of strain on the lower back. Too many straps, way too complicated. I am no wimp I can carry the Baby Bjorn with my 16 lbs daughter for 2 hours without any difficulty. I bought this so I can take her for longer hikes. This was a total failure. I returned it the next day. On the positive note, my daughter enjoyed the ride, she even fell asleep.

Apparently the other reviewers are not dancers. This is the worst dancing film I've ever seen. This was worse than watching my parents dance. The sound quality is bad. The lip synching and dubbing are hilarious, but in a bad way. I watched the whole movie like I was watching a train wreck...I didn't want to look, but the visions on the screen were too terrible to turn away. One of the dance moves he does is to roll back and forth on the floor for 30 seconds. The dance scenes never seem to end. The plot was okay, but having to sit through bad dancing by someone with no style or rythym was horrendous."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK, it's overplayed ...","review":"That's why your radio has two knobs, one to change the channel and one to turn it off.The point of this song has, unfortunately, vanished in its virtual omnipresence. Though it is my understanding that the song is about his mother, \\"Again\\" can be universally applied. It's is simply put a song about missing someone and wondering if you will ever be able to see them whole, to feel them against your skin or the warmth of their presence. It's about missing someone and longing to see them. It's beauty and eerie nostalgia are proof positive that it's possible to miss someone so much that the only relief you can have is that person.And if you don't like it, turn it off. Don't spoil it for the rest of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I hear this song \\"Again,\\"again, I'm going to throw UP","review":"I just don't get it.I can't stand this song,and radio stations keep playing \\"Again,\\" again and again.Its the same cords and words repeated again and again.I wonder when I won't have to hear \\"Again\\" again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make room on your shelf next to Morrow, Blish and Miller","review":"SF has always had a fascination with the tension between religion and science. The result has been some of the most intelligent, literary and enduring novels ever written in the genre. Donnelly has written such a novel in \\"Letters from the Flesh\\".Two seemingly separate but resonant plots move you through an examination of what it means to believe and what it takes to be a believer. But watch carefully, because Donnelly has as much to say about scientific dogma as he does religious belief. This author obviously understands and sympathizes with believers of both.But this novel is not a dry intellectual exercise. Donnelly's tightly written plot moves at an almost blistering pace, taking you from the crowded streets of ancient Damascus to a media-driven riot in modern America, delivering you at an unexpected resolution that is surprisingly tender.Sometimes outrageous, always brilliantly executed and well-written, this novel is well worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Book!!!","review":"I was plesantly surprised when I read this.The Book is in the form of letters. The first set are from an Alien visiting Earth around 2 thousand years ago.The second set are e-mails between cousins.I wasn't sure how both correspondences fit togather but Donnelly's storyline brought them togather effortlessly.I was a little hesitant about the writing style but it really worked for this book.I kept eagerly reading each letter to see where he was going with it.Very good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very clever; a fitting debut for Rob Sawyer's new logo","review":"This book started a bit slow, as the author set the context in perhaps too much detail, but is well worth perseverance. As the complexities grew, I feared that the author would fall into a common SF weakness of an abrupt, elaborate and unconvincing ending. Fear not; the ends are tied up neatly, and despite a playfulness that may offend some readers, cleverly leaves an opening for (broadminded) Christian beliefs.Althought this could hardly be called a conventional novel with conventional pot or characters, Donnelly evokes interest in and sympathy for the characters, to the point where I let out a fervent \\"Oh, no!\\" at one plot twist.This book would be excellent fodder for a discussion group.PS A tip for Donnelly: The consistent repetition of Lilian's annoying e-mail salutation is NOT one of the highlights of the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What If?","review":"This tale sets a new dimension in science fiction and examines what we think we know about our past, present, and future. Kudos to Marcos Donnelly for giving us a very interesting and original story."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked the book because it was action-packed.","review":"The author has a way of writing that made me feel concern for the main character. After reading only a few pages I was drawn in. Brian Boru was very brave but he had many problems. After his home was burnt and his mother killed, he vowed to take revenge on the Vikings. When he picked fights to escape from his problems, his father sent him to a monastery where he learned to be a warrior and a scholar. Even so, he was scared when he went into battle. This was an historical book but it read like a novel. I learned about history by getting connected into the lives of the characters. In the end, Brian pays a price for going to war. If you want to find out exactly what happens, you'll have to read this book that I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"watch for this power junkie","review":"great card , i have to wait for 5 min after i start playing earth 2160 to know the real needs for this card; because my power supply blow up at 350W, i tested with 400W and the game blow it up again, final choice had to be 500W and it work fine, the card perform great ; i had 200+ units moving without problem in the game earth 2160. i only recomend a minimum of 500W power supply."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Planescape Campaigns Should own this book","review":"This book expands upon the factions so much from the box set.

Because the factions are central to the entire Planescape feel, it is extremely important to know them well.

This one kept me reading all day on Sunday to finish. There may be technical or other errors that other people may note, but I read for enjoyment and nothing jumped out at me right away. One thing I do want to note, after reading reviews of the prevous book in this series it seems that people don't realize Tom Clancy does not write these books. They need to read the cover before criticizing Tom Clancy, the concept was created by Tom Clancy and Steve P. and is now written by Jeff Rovin (I think is his name)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and predictable","review":"The author Roven is no Clancy. If you are looking for something interesting and full of twists, don't go here. It is a slow drawn out plot of no interest, with no reality. There are several characters that could be the bad guys, but you don't really care if it is them or all of them.

I agree with a previous reviewer, an annoying penchant for totally stupid acronyms. Annoying \\"faux Clancy\\" factoids (e.g., totally useless details about the Apache helicopter that had nothing to do with the plot and were just distracting).I loved Clancy's early work, but his later work (and these subcontracted ghost-written pieces of junk) are pathetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"a fuller, richer sound for this fun, poppy band","review":"This album really marks the height of the musical maturation of this band. While their earlier albums (betti cola, come out, come out) were fun and poppy, _Mauler_ is much fuller and richer sounding. Fb song is truly amazing with great lyrics and a real band sound.

It's a shame the group is no longer together, but this album is a perfect ending for the group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freaky","review":"This album is totally amazing.

Dealing only with housing and urban planning, we see how the influences of New England formality, Mid Atlantic practicality and southern climatic responses, along with Bahamian building types, create the unique and not so unique stew that is Key West.

When I pointed out that so many people would not have requested replacements if this part had been designed properly, the customer service rep admitted that this table saw is not one of their better products and it will be discontinued shortly. He stated that the product's performance was hurting Delta's reputation, and it's not meant for commercial use. We used the Shopmaster to cut redwood boards for a small terrace and it worked fine. But it's just a matter of time before something else breaks, and then Delta won't have any replacement parts in stock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little jobsite saw","review":"I've used this saw for a couple of years now on the jobsite for both framing and limited trim work. It has seen moderate use by several workers. It needed no adjustment out of the box and has performed fine for what it is....and inverted 10\\" circular saw fixed to a table. It is light and easy to move around. It sometimes trips off on overload when I rip much framing material. The miter gage is plastic and I've had to rebuild it once rather than spend $40 bucks for a new one. The switch has failed and it was easy enough to get a replacement on-line. Everything else is still functioning properly. For the money, its a good value and adequate for light to moderate use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delta SM200L","review":"This is the second one I've bought. It works really well.

He grabbed me at the beginning and I looked forward to reading my book every night. Then, he just lost me and I found Acts of Faith to be predictable and at times, boring. The religious aspect, traditions, rituals... were all interesting, however, the storyline became long and drawn out. I could see why some might like it but personally, I need a few more twists and a bit more excitement. It's another book to put on the shelf that may or may not be a conversation piece one day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and Entertaining Romance Novel","review":"This is a stupid, corny story, infested with trite cliches, but it's an entertaining read, especially if you're not fond of reading.A Rabbi's son rejects his \\"duty\\" and chooses a career in finance, then gets disowned by his father. His sister, the Rabbi's daughter, smooches with the Irish \\"Shabbos Goy\\" and gets sent off to live with an abusinve family, then the Irish street-thug \\"Shabbos Goy\\" goes to a catholic college, becomes a Priest, knocks up the Rabbi's daughter, nearly becomes the Pope, and the saga continues.This would make a great mimi-series on the Lifetime Network."},{"rating":"1","title":"And I thought \\"Jepthe's Daughter\\" was preposterous!","review":"I'm going to go out on a limb here and be a heretic by disagreeing with the other reviewers of this book. I thought it was an utter piece of trash. The book was entirely predictable. I knew from the third chapter that the Catholic Timothy would become a priest and he'd fall in love with the Jewish Deborah who would be tossed out of the family home by her one-dimensional father. In fact, I found all of the characters to be disagreeable, the plot tedious and the manipulation of religion to suit the storyline distasteful.I suppose if you are looking for a good laugh, this book might be interesting. I, however, didn't even find it funny. I found myself exclaiming out loud \\"Oh come on! That's ridiculous!\\" at multiple times as the book progressed.

It is organized into many small sections which can be used for quick refrence once you have finished reading it. The author givers her opinnion on many matters concerning spirituality, practice, and ethics. She states her opinion but also notes that it is just her opinnion is not necessarily the right or only one (this I like). By no means is this the only book you need to begin to practice wicca but it is definetly a good start if you want an overveiw or just an easy explanation of the very complicated and numerous topics connected to witchcraft.

I also note that the most gushing is from Ororo - Eileen's close friend!! As a witch of 28 years, I can assure you this book is full of re-hashed information that has been written a hundred times before. It is obsessed with magick and spells. It has nothing to do with Wicca as a belief system. Oh, it touches on them briefly, then promptly takes you into more hocus-pocus. It is extremely irresponsible, with paragraphs on why love spells are wrong, then devotes several pages to them. It's no good saying that is up to the reader's integrity - she also condemns \\"cancer\\" spells, and doesn't feel the need to explain how it is done. I also found it quite disturbing that she seemed slightly smug and proud that she did a binding spell on a stalker and his baby was later born with a whole in his heart. A complete waste of money, as I think the more experienced witches have agreed."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!!!!","review":"Ounce i saw this book i thought it would be the kind that u read and throw away but boy was i surprised.

See does seem overly obsessed with spells, I say, and bluntly writing -harmful- spells and publishing them in this book was overly irresponsible, especially when it seems to be attracting newer practitioners. :(If you read this book, by all means, please read others as well.

After multiple weeks of software updates, Bose took the system back, and returned it after about 6 weeks. Needless to say it is now as bad as ever, and the warranty is now long gone. So now one of the key functions on a $5,000 ( after professional Bose install) purchase is defunct.

It was bulky and broke within a few weeks of use. After going sans case for a few weeks and shattering the screen after a single drop, I needed something different. I was unsure if the Boxwave MicroDot Case would work, but wanted to give it a try. It arrived quickly and looked exactly as described (a semi-clear, plastic-like smooth case). It fits snugly and wraps all the way around the phone in a single piece. You have to stretch it around the corners of the phone, so once it is on, it's there for (almost) permanently. After several months of use, I can confidently say that it's been an excellent purchase. It doesn't add bulk, looks fantastic, the plastic doesn't snag in your jean pockets, and provides the protection this phone needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best mallet I own","review":"This is my all time favorite mallet.

The writing in many places is of a \\"text book\\" nature, but the content of relating Hoagy's life puts the reader in the center of life as it existed in the 20's through the 60's.

Trevanian's finest hands down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievably wonderful and totally different","review":"Shibumi is an experience, not a novel.

But Trevanian takes all the cliches and turns them around in a genre-shattering book that both parodies and transcends the run-of-the-mill. Shibumi offers real food for thought in with the fun and thrills, and Trevanian writes like a slumming poet. Well worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Over-the-top entertainment!!","review":"I loved this book!!! A lot of people have to realize that this was written in the 70's and there is a lot of outdated philosophies in it. GET OVER IT!! It seems to me that it wasn't meant to take itself too seriously. The fact that Nicolai Hel DOES dake himself so seriously is part of the joke... That's why it's called fiction, not life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your Kidding me Right?","review":"I first read this in high school when it first came out. I decided to read it again just in case I read it too fast 25 years ago. The hero is just too perfect. I mean he doesn't even have interesting emotions, insights or flaws.Dig this: The guy is a perfect lover, has the best ageless genes, with a mind of a genius and looks like a hunk? Oh and get this- he learned Basque from a book while in prison. I mean this guy is 007 with Mata Hari thrown in.It was an airport thriller when I bought it. After trying to read it the second time, I realized there is a template for an airport thriller. I read it around the same time I read Leon Uris' Exodus. The latter stayed with me forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Philosophical spy thriller","review":"Amazing to think that we are still dealing with the same world-wide issues today that Trevanian dealt with 20 years ago. Although this novel is a bit dated it still delivers with fascinating character development and an intriguing plot.I enjoy his irreverent attitude toward the West, especially in juxtaposition with the character's knowledge and use of the wisdom of the Far East.Throw in a complex spy novel plot and it makes for a modern classic. Kind of like Memoir of a Geisha meets Nelson DeMille."},{"rating":"1","title":"The perfect lover...","review":"This book stands out as the worst book I have ever read in this genre. The plot is outlandish, but that could be forgiveable if it weren't for the ridiculous hero he created. The hero is the most special and accomplished expert on every aspect of existence that the world has ever seen. Everything he does is better than anything the reader can comprehend. He might as well have written an exclamation point after every sentence. The part that really made me laugh out loud is that he is such an incredible lover that some young girl he screws, upset at their inevitable parting, kills herself because she knows she will never find another man who can satisfy her. Has the author ever even met a woman? His interactions with women read like what a 13-year-old would write during slow moments in math class.The term \\"shibumi\\" has been a joke in our household for years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Careful reading","review":"I read this book when it first came out and recently read a magazine article praising it. After re-reading it I am puzzled by other reviews. It is a slow moving spy thriller with little action. Worse, this novel has a strong anti-western slant. It's filled with stereotypes and is very condescending to any person who knows basic history. All the characters aside from the main protagonist are caricatures. Want to read a thriller? Check out the non-fiction \\"Unbroken\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle edition is not worth it!","review":"When the paperback is available for $10.20 and the Kindle edition is $11.99, I have utterly NO interest in rewarding that sort of behavior of the publisher ... particularly when it's an old book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Meet Expectations!!!","review":"I've read The Eiger Sanction and The Loo Sanction by Trevanian which is the reason I bought this novel. Both Eiger and Loo were exceptional. This book was a real pain to finish. It's 458 pages long. If you ripped out pages 101 to 350 and tossed them, it might have rated 2 stars. The brunt of the book is about \\"Nicholai's\\" life, boring! I'm being generous by saying there are a few dozen pages of elite killer stuff. Too much on how he's a first level lover and some moves if done by an inexperienced lover could cause personal injury. PLEASE!Save your money and look elsewhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Effortless perfection that is SHIBUMI","review":"I was 19 when I read SHIBUMI. Some 10 years later, it still is my favorite.

Trevanian explains the beauty of the philosophy called shibumi in his book. I won't even try and explain shibumi here; I know I could never do it properly.

About 95% of the book was just about the hero's life history and the book does NOT have even one proper action sequence. It's just talk, talk, talk, spend a hundred pages explaining how the hero used to have a psychic gift when he was a boy (which has aboslutely NOTHING to do with the story.), talk some more, then just wrap the story up with a very vague action scene that ends in less than page.Now dont get me wrong. I like a good low-key intellectual thriller with good characterisation just as much as anyone else but it's just that around 95 percent of the book is completely irrelevant to the plot and it is very boring if you read the book, expecting it to be a thriller. It reads more like the life account of a man, which if it had been marketed as, I would have given it 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that changes peoples lives","review":"I first read Shibumi back in 1981. I was changed forever. Since then, I have lent, bought it as gifts, and encouraged those who I thought would appreciate the importance of the book. People laugh when I say it is the best novel of the 20th Century. It was given to my non-book reading father in 1986; since then he has become a serious reader of fiction and historical novels. The characters are gripping, real and are perfectly placed within the story line(s). An education in history, geography, geology, politics, and Eastern philosophies are waiting for those who are willing to take the journey. I still have the original hardback, but re-read a paperback version at least once a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much More than a Thriller","review":"In short, “Shibumi�?features Nicholai Hel, half Russian, half German brought up as Japanese. Hel is a master assassin, a fabulous lover, an adventurer, and much more. On the other side of the story, there is the “Mother Company.�?An organization of energy companies, which control the CIA, FBI and the Government in general. Having said that, “Shibumi�?is much more than your regular thriller; it has deep insight into Eastern philosophy and life in general. This book is by far the best thriller (although I shrink at describing this book as such since it is much more) I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trevanian is a lost treasure.","review":"I cannot, for the life of me, resume what SHIBUMI is about. If you think it's a spy thriller, you're a fool. If you think this is a spoof, you're slightly more enlightened but you're still narrow minded. It's the masterpiece, the time-defying work of an enlightened soul with democratic intentions. Trevanian is a literary writer, yet he sturctures his stories in a way for most people to feel intelligent and enlightened. Most important, it's a vehicle for his opinions and passions.To keep it simple, it's structured around the principle of the Japanese game of GO,which has been known to be a framework of thoughts of the great warlords. What happens to Nicholai Hel in this movie is filtered through his state of mind and separated like the movements of a Go game. Enlightening, stimulating read for the curious mind. Very impressive character study. In fact, it might be the most impressive I have ever read. A stunning work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting character development","review":"Well put together plot with an interesting central character The use of the game, Go as an organizing principle adds to the appeal of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"IN MY OPINION, THIS IS A DISAPPOINTING BOOK","review":"I heard about this book, I believe it was from the book called \\"The O'Reilly Factor\\" by Bill O'Reilly. He thought the book was good. After reading Shibumi, I have to say I will now question O'Reilly's judgement a bit more than I have in the past. Maybe I went into this book with expectations set too high, I don't know, but I can say, after reading it, that I did not care for this book. The book was not very realistic and rambled in certain areas. For example, in one area it goes on and on about exploring a cave, which did not have that much to do with the story. The ending left a lot of questions and was unbelievable, in my opinion. I don't want to get into everything, so I will just say that book was not that good. It was not terrible, but just not very good. Quite overrated from the way I see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Start, Then Crashes and Burns","review":"I couldn't put the book down, as they say, for its first half. Although I knew I was reading a Japanese view of WWII, it was nonetheless fascinating if terribly incomplete and as one sided as an American WWII propanganda film. Then when the book moves locales to the Basque region and modern times, it tumbles and falls deeply into coyness and predictability. All of a sudden, it's as if some ronin author barged in, drugged the first author and started writing some one dimensional cartoon novel. The characters become cardboard and cute and the protaganist's sermonizing puts him right up there with the Sunday T.V. preachers genre, albeit the protaganist is pushing a different theology.A good writer realizes there is no black and white in any character: within the circle there is the yin and the yang and even within each yin there is a little yang and vice versa. This makes for authenticity, for we see ourselves in the mixture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shibumi","review":"Wouldn't recommend this to anyone.

Everyone in the book dies and the hero is planning to kill himself by the end. All the action is \\"off stage\\": Hero walks behind a curtain with a comb, bad guy is dead. Then he walks behind the curtain with a credit card, another bad guy is dead. Great build ups to no pay off. Hero becomes a \\"Go\\" expert: Never plays \\"Go\\" again in the book. Just a bunch of grandiose wish fulfillment by the author. It does have a great caving sequence. (like the nice moutain climbing in his last book.) If you must get the book read the chapters about the caving. They stand completly alone very well without bothering with the nonsense of the rest of the book.

IF you're not stupid.","review":"After reading the few negative reviews of this book, it occurred to me that the people who wrote them just don't seem to realize that Trevanian was making fun of them. Shibumi is a parody of the \\"super spy\\" genre- something Trevanians fans have always realized. Trevanian himself was always mystified to learn that there were people out there that weren't in on the joke- it seemed obvious to him. The people who are complaining about how ridiculously \\"perfect\\" the protagonist is at everything are just too slow to catch on to the fact that the entire point of the novel is to play off as many spy tropes as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad about the Kindle price","review":"I read this book in paperback years ago. I was thinking about re-reading it, as I truly enjoyed it. But that ain't going to happen. It is absurd and exploitive to price a 33 year old book as if it were a best-seller. Who are we kidding? It sure didn't cost me eleven bucks when I bought it in paperback in the eighties. With all the production cost of printing and shipping a tangible book eliminated, it whould not be that much now. Sorry - but eleven bucks is too much for 33 year old electrons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life and the art of GO","review":"While not easily categorized, this is a fascinating and enjoyable read, a portrait of a man who has endured, experienced and accomplished much but in the end sought only shibumi - withdrawing from the conformity, materialism and tyranny of the Western world to seek overwhelming simplicity and calmness - to which he is ultimately successful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shibumi","review":"Since I got the Kindle app for my iPad about 2 years ago I have read dozens of books; I can adjust the font size to a point where I can read withuot my glasses! I have been rereading a lot of my old favorites of which Shabumi is one. This version, while still a compelling page turner, has been modifyed from the original due to some content in the original being deemed as \\"dangerous\\" by the author. I noticed it very early on in the book, but am still enjoying the story.I think that if there have been changes made to a book, for whatever reason, it should be noted on your site. I probably would have bought it anyway, I just would have liked to know.jz"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite novel","review":"I have read this about 4 times over the years, most recently on my iPhone through amazon.

I even named my doberman Shibumi after the first reading. For anyone interested in the Asian martial arts culture along with intrigue this is a wonderful adventure.

But the main character is so cliche -- the ultimate assasin, the ultimate lover -- he's clever and heartless (but give me a break, how can he be the ultimate lover, then?) ...isn't this the fantasy of every 16-year-old? There are some interesting concepts about eastern religion in places, and definitely some good page-turning sections (the caving part was particularly good). The writing style and quality is very uneven. (I wonder if a lot of this was ghost-written...) Anyway, it's enjoyable and exciting at first, but it became annoyingly implausible and childish by the end.

Very easy to follow along and the instructor does a good job explaining certain positions and the benefits they each serve. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to follow, appropriately challenging","review":"I've taken a few yoga classes and was looking for a home workout that would also work for a neighbor who has not yet taken a yoga class. We did this 60 minute practice today, and found it to be both instructional and appropriately challenging. The first 30 minutes focused more on stretching, while the next 30 minutes of flow gave us a decent workout for the first run through. (We were looking for a complement to our bi-weekly aerobic classes.) I liked it right away and believe it will be a DVD that I can use regularly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not for yoga newbies","review":"I notice now that most of the great reviews on this video are from people who are already into yoga. I am very flexible and rather strong, but the pace and expectations here are not at a true beginner level...maybe an experienced beginner. After 15 minutes of the flow, I just gave up. The poses weren't hard, but there wasn't even time to get yourself into position and check if you were doing it right before he was on to the next.Also, so much leaning on the hands so early on, my palms are still red and sore. He says to go at your own pace, but if you slow down to check your posture, you have just missed the next pose.It's a shame...I really wanted to like this video, and the instructor is calm and pleasant. I want to be his friend. But he's focused on his own workout, not helping me figure out mine. I bet he's the best instructor in person, but this video is not an introduction to yoga."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Instruction, Good Workout","review":"Really great for beginners (and I am a rank beginner).

I am building strength as well as flexibility -- I see the results every day."},{"rating":"2","title":"My review","review":"Recently purchaced this DVD to add to my collection. My first impression is it's an excellent DVD for beginners. Easy to follow, clear instructions, ect... So I have been regularly adding it into my daily routines.My only dislikes for this one are that it feels like it's a rushed routine. If he was to lengthen the time of some poses slightly & slow down transitions between poses, it would definitely create a better calming effect, allowing for breath practice & create a more relaxing experience. To sum it up, this is more of a physical exercise routine then a calming stress reducing, meditation oriented session.The only other slightly annoying part is every time he says exhale, he draws the word out & it sounds like he is saying eeeggggs-hale (eggs-hale). To me it just sounds a bit weird."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout","review":"I like this DVD a lot. I only wish it had more levels so I could increase difficulty as I get better.

Because this is definitely, hands down, one of the best Yoga DVD's I've ever taken. The instruction is super clear and easy to follow, you could literally do it with your eyes closed. It's perfect for beginners, mid levels, and advanced. No matter what level you are, the 30 minute sequences put most hour-hour and a half work outs to shame!

A much better product than the previous All Areas DVD, but in this day and age of digital production the video could have been much sharper. This was Michael Sadler's last show before leaving the band a few years back to embark on a solo career. Unfortunatly for Mike, but fortunately for the rest of us, he has since reunited with Saga and seems little worse for wear and tear. Overall a decent product with audio and video actually taken from the same songs, rather than stock guitar solo footage dubbed in (what were you trying to hide in Bonn, Ian?). If the video were up to today's standards, this DVD would be worth five stars. Unfortunately it's not, but still worth picking up if a fan of the band or musical genre!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Saga-Contact:Live In Munich DVD","review":"Exceptional live performance of the Canadian Prog-Rock band Saga.

Basic editing is part of a decent book, and someone did a terrible job on this one. Aside from the typos in the text itself, far too many of the Solved Problems give a wrong answer! It has been maddening to sit and do and re-do these problems to check my work, and I feel that if the easier/beginning sections have this many problems, I will be screwed when I get to the more advanced sections and can't so easily spot the mistakes.

I hope that they bring back more classic Sesame Street episodes such as this. I also hope that in the volumes to come that they don't repeat the same thing. If customers want to see segments over again, they have a button on the DVD remote that can repeat it. I think it's just a waste of DVD space. Other than that, this is worth it... and then some.

It has worked great (though Bose did replace the hard drive for a small fee).Since a software upgrade a year ago, it now reads and saves disks with MP3 files. It holds much more music than it previously did when it would only rip CDs.The biggest problem with the unit is its lack of support for HDMI and digital audio. My PS3 and AppleTV both use HDMI for video, and either HDMI or Optical cable for audio. The Bose only supports 1 optical input.I got the AppleTV so I could do AirPlay from my laptop, but I really should have looked into an AirPlay compatible receiver.The Bose VS-2 adds HDMI switching capabilities to the Lifestyle receiver, but doesn't touch the audio stream.I really wish I didn't have so much invested in my Bose system.

You are (of course) Link, and (of course) have to save Zelda. I just got my new gameboy advance in the mail today, and i am very exicited about that. Anyway, the plot, you have to save Zelda and 7 other maidens, get 7 crystals, and 3 pendants or something like that. The plot doesn't matter that much here because the rpg elements, plus the joy of it all equals pure brilliancy, the work of a genius. I love the entire series, but this (so far, wait for Wind Waker) is the best. Awesome! I love this game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Totaly Awsome I Give It 5 Stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I have played about 4 Zelda games altogether, and this was the best ever!!! I haven't even played the multiplayer Four Swords adventure yet, and I give it 5 stars already!Plot: The plot doesn't really have any real effect on the game itself, though there are some hidden twists. +1Graphics: Not the best I've ever seen, but works fine for the gameplay. +1.5Gameplay: I've yet to see better. There are amazingly vast series of beasties, and each one is unique. Every item you get is usefull, the dungeons are fun, every boss is great, hard to beat but not too hard. I love it. +3Sound: The only thing I didn't love.. The sounds don't always suit the situition, and it's like the whole games music isbalanced on a few songs that keep being recycled. -1Replay Value: O.K., I guess. +.5All in all, if you want a good game to play for a while, then I suggest you try Legend of Zelda Games(this one in particular).GO, ZELDA!WAHOO!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it No Reservations","review":"I Can fully recomend this game without any reservations. I was one of those guys that has \\"A Link to the Past\\" on SNES. I poped this game into my GBA SP and couldn't put it down. When I first started playing everything except making you sit through the introduction, and a slight difference in the controlls (duh 4 buttons compared to the six on SNES) was exactly the same as the SNES Version. The controll issue took less than an hour to resolve, and if your new to this game you probally won't even notice. Maybe I shouldn't of bought this because I won't get anything done except beat the game again and again. I can't comment on four swords yet, I'm too busy playing A link to the Past. This is one of the games that makes buying a GBA worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Link to Childhood","review":"I first began playing the Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past years and years ago when my family still had a working NES. And it's safe to say that it's set my standard for all Zelda games I've played since then. I had to buy this game when I discovered that my DS was also compatible with GBA games. (I have a busy life, I never stopped to consider.) Anyways, with this game, I can regress to my childhood any time I want.This game also comes with Zelda Four Swords Adventures. The description in the manual seems interesting, but it requires that you have an actual GBA and that all your friends you want to play with have one too along with the connectors and another copy of the game. So, unless you have all that, you can't play it. But I honestly bought this game for the Link to the Past portion of it and I am thoroughly satisfied with that.Happy Winter-een-mas. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing classic for GBA","review":"Legend of Zelda a link to the past used to be for the Super Nintendo. It was so amazing that Nintendo released it for the GBA. The version on the GBA has another game called four swords. Sadly, you need to link up with four people to play, and I don't know anyone who plays this game. The graphics are unchanged from the SNES, which I like. The gameplay is great and really fun. I am slowly getting through the game, trying to find heart pieces, getting more ruppies, and conquering dungeons.It is a must buy for any Legend of Zelda fan. There is one problem. My game will not save unless I enter or leave a dungeon or building. Please just get this if you want it. It is not that expensive(used)."},{"rating":"2","title":"great game, buy it!","review":"this is a great game. i got it last year as a trade for harry potter 1 at gamestop. it was a horribly great game! i beat the game, but i couldnt have done without a walkthrough. seriously, this is a great game, but the puzzles are extremely hard. (...) oh yeah. THIS IS A GREAT GAME! BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Zelda: Fun, Challenging and Cool","review":"This game is really fun. Just like in most of the other games you get all sorts of weapons and you use them a lot. Sometimes you go places just to explore and you find something that turns out to be really useful. For example, one time I was just cutting some grass with my sword and I found a hole. When I jumped in I found a fairy fountain. Also, if someone else has it you can link up with them and play Four Swords. I like this part a lot. What you do is you go around doing just about the same thing except this time you are the same team. For example, you have to push buttons at the same time to open doors or you have to use the magnets to pull each other across a hole. There are also new weapons. Plus, when you defeat the boss you'd think that it's over but you still have to get more types of keys. All in all it's one of the best games I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the game, mad at the seller","review":"Loved this game, when I purchased it I didn't realize the seller sold me a bootleg copy (was not notified it was bootleg) and after a few months the game deleted all of my saved progress, I was pretty angry, now I don't know what to do with my copy. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"review","review":"Nothing beats the classic game for nostalgic impact. I remeber playing the game as a little girl and its just as much fun now.

Nearly everytime i turned around i had to go to a website to find how to get out of someplace. It's also too long. I perfer games like Mario where the levels are orginized with a map but here it's just all laid out at once and it take you ten minutes to get from one side of the world to the other. For the serious gamers(the ones who collect Pokemon cards and dress up as Link for halloween) I'd tell them to buy this but for the average games(who live a life outside of video games)I'd highly recommend Mario 2 or Yoshi's Island."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"What a waste of money, this game is the same thing as the one for the original gameboy.

I have played (u)moria for hundreds of hours, so i'm not the type that sees graphics as the most important aspect, but come on, zelda, no. link moves waaay too slow, the selection system is unintelligible. it may be that is was among the first rpg's but that does not mean it is one of the best! The story may be great but playability is too low to grab me at once (in contrast to phantasy star, which is really far better and about the same age).my advice : borrow it, and if you have no friends with gba, rent it. do not fool yourself and pay >$5 for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Married a Zelda fan","review":"Bought this for my husband ...a big Zelda fan. He has played it multiple time and now has our oldest child into playing as well. If you have been a fan of previous Zelda games you will be a fan of this as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"great game","review":"This Zelda game back in the early 90s made up for the 2nd game being a piece of crap. The world map is big with a light and dark world map making the game twice as big. There lots of new items like the pegasis boots for running, the master sword, and the mirror for switching to new worlds. If you did like the origonal game you will love this one. So I say you should check this game out. There is a 2nd game on this besides A Link to the past, The 4 swords. I havent played it since you need 4 friends with the game, but buying it for just A Link to the Past is still not a waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zelda is spectacular!","review":"This game is a very good game. My experience with it was emotional, for I played this game on SNES and it broke on me. But, this game has no flaws, perfect gameplay, spectacular graphics, and better effects. It compares with Sword of Mana for it's XP points, Final Fantasy Tactics for its graphical design, and Golden Sun for it's art and creation. The game is good because it doesn't cross the line at difficulty and it helps the player with common sense. It puts the player in Link's shoes. There is no flaws, it is all fabulous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zelda at its Best","review":"This is the best Zelda game I have ever played. Ever. Both the controls mirror those of the classic N64 game, Ocarina of Time, as opposed to the Oracle games and Link's Awakening on Game Boy Color. The graphics are a lot better, too. But I don't buy games for the graphics. The game itself is great. The best part is that Four Swords, the multiplayer game, is unlike any other multiplayer game, because it is an adventure in itself. Rather than the normal idea of players being against each other, this game requires you to cooperate with your teammates as you battle through a dungeon. There are three multiplayer levels, as well as a tutorial level you can play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Link has returned!","review":"This game is a remake of the classic Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past for the Super Nintendo. It has timeless gameplay, smooth graphics, a wonderful plot, and amazing replay value. I reccomend this game to anybody, whether you be an action gamer of a roleplayer, it's a must have.This is the ultimate gift for any gamer, and with the all-new multiplayer adventure, you might even find some companions to share the game with.You can't go wrong buying this game. Go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"its my 3 coolest zelda","review":"My 1 is the new one I got it on import . the second is oc for the 64 It was so good then we come to the four swords.

However, growing up in the early 90's, the Super Nintendo version of Link to the Past will be the one I will have fond memories of and cherish the most. Any updates are just that- updates for all the young people out there who weren't around when the classics were being released. With that said, either version is a nice addition to your video game library. Grab some hearts, battle some classic bosses, and have a ball. The adventure of a lifetime is back."},{"rating":"2","title":"the first one i played the best one i've played","review":"i first played this game when i was 4 on the nintendo now on the gba. its the same as the others basically but with multiplayer and a better ending"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game!","review":"I bought the game as a gift for my boyfriend, who is currently stationed overseas.

I'm glad that I can finally play it again with the benefit of taking it where ever I go. The only problem is that unless you know someone else who has the game for the gameboy too, you'll never be able to play the Four Swords. I would recommend this game to others who love rpgs and zelda.

Unfortunately when I purchased it (no sample available, since the sample would be the entire content) I found it just contained the first story in the book. So I guess for 1/21 the cost you get 1/21 the content. Nothing wrong with that but I wish Amazon was more clear upfront that only one of the 21 stories in the paper book was included. I would suggest Amazon remove reviews of the print editions from the Kindle editions unless they are largely the same content, which this is not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some really good tales and some not so good!","review":"I am not usually a big fan of the short story. There are some really good ones in this collection by Sawyer who in my opinion is the current best at the scifi novel. Each tale is presented with an introduction as to how Sawyer came up with the idea for the tale.There is an excellent tale involving Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson being drawn into the future to solve a puzzling riddle. There is also a tale about high school student who is kind of nerdy but smart. He is always the last one picked (or not even picked) for sports teams in school. He gets the ultimate revenge against the jocks that wronged him.There is are several tales that deal with parallel universes and dinosaurs. All in all I really enjoyed about half the tales and the other half were just so-so.

They are not perfect, but the optics are great. I seen no obvious spherical, nor chromatic aberration so obvious in cheap binoculars. Brightness is great in low-light conditions, which is a plus in terrestrial viewing. The only area of concern that I have found is flare when looking at something such as a star or planet, and the object is proximate to a bright source of light.

My initial use was on a trip to London and was able to capture a great family family photograph by wraping the flexible legs around a metal railing to obtain the right height and angle. It is also easy to carry as the tripod can be folded to fit almost any camera bag; a strange appearing item but it went right through airport security without any inquiries!

I thought it was just wear, but recently looked closely and saw that the black plastic around the circumference of the loose sockets was cracked. I removed those segments, and now have stiff legs again, but the topmost joint (the bottom of the clamp base) is also cracked, so it will no longer hold up the weight of my SLR, even with no lens.This is a weak design, and I'm hesitant to buy a new one unless they've acknowledged this issue and improved it.

It is a clever product that is very well executed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked As Advertised ..","review":"My husband used it with his SLR on a recent trip to Paris and got some fabulous night shots. He normally uses a tripod, but this was so much more convenient, because you just wrap it around a street pole. No set up required, just leave the Gorillapod screw on portion on the bottom of your camera, and when you are ready to shoot, attach the main portion to the camera. A bit bulky, but you can put it in your pocket or if you are not carrying a larger camera case.I have the smaller version for my point and shoot and love it. Rarely are there flat surfaces right where you want to shoot the picture, but there are always street poles nearby in cities and towns."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Defective Items","review":"I bought one in a local brick & mortar store. The plate or \\"shoe\\" that attaches to the camera would not release from the tripod -- it took me 20 minutes to free my camera from it (the screw head is under the plate and inaccessible when attached to the tripod).I took it back to the store, where the friendly clerk offered to exchange it with another model from the shelf. We opened the package before I went home, and it had the exact same defect: the \\"detachable\\" plate or \\"shoe\\" would not detach from the tripod.So she gave me my money back and is shipping both back to the manufacturer as defective.Fail."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR SLR cameras","review":"the nob on the hotshoe is very stiff and difficult to fasten/unfasten and I ended up breaking it trying to unlock it. If you are thinking to have one these for you SLR Camera then DON'T get this one. Even the larger ones are not reliable enough to risk putting your camera on with awkward sort of positioning.The other main failure with this mini tripod, it keeps wobbling for ever due to the flexibility of its bendable legs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joby gp2","review":"Perfect and useful product adding a fast shipment! I used a lot for shooting nice pictures with my camera from impossible places."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great.!!","review":"Great product. Ease of use. Fits everywhere with a good grip. Compact enough to carry along everywhere. Bubble level also helps a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not strong enough for a dSLR","review":"Seems like it should work well, but it's just not strong enough for my Nikon D90 with kit lens. Sitting flat on the table, it's okay, but even then, if you want to angle it up or down, the legs start to slide out from under it. And I just would not trust it wrapped around a pole or something. Probably my fault for choosing the wrong model.Will work great with a little point-and-shoot. That's probably what I'll use it for."},{"rating":"2","title":"adds versatility . . .","review":"This accessory allows you to attach an on camera type flash unit to the Gorillapod SLR tripod. The plastic fitting mates perfectly with the mounting base. It has a slot on top for the flash's hot shoe. Slide it in, lock it down, and your flash can be mounted almost anywhere the versatile Gorillapod can be attached.Remotely mounted flashes are typically triggered via synch cord, wireless transmitter, or by flash as a slave unit. With this accessory, a Gorillapod mounted flash can be incorporated into this type of setup, adding options to your photography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better buy a remote too...","review":"shaky shaky shaky. if you buy this tripod, you better have a remote or you photos are going to be a blurry mess. The neck has no stability! Also i wouldn't wrap the legs around anything too high off the ground. Not the most reliable grippers and joints."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for intended use, but ...","review":"This is a light weight, easy to carry and very versatile tripod for field photography with a few limitations.1. The action is rather stiff, so I added a ball head for smoother action and framing.2. I need to use a stiffer tripod in situations where I need to keep my hands on the camera. This has too much wobble.On the other hand, the wobble damps rapidly, so this tripod works well when the camera timer or a shutter release cable is used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"I ordered this crate pad thinking it would be easier to keep clean than the big pillows I was using, well it is paper thin & bunches up every time my dogs step into their crates, so they're sleeping on the hard plastic crate liner instead. I even noticed my jack russell shivering in the middle of summer b/c this didn't hold in any body heat. Within 2 days they were finding their old beds in our spare room & climbing over boxes to snuggle up in them again. They were clearly unhappy with this replacement. On the 3rd day these were thrown in the closet- what a waste of money!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Daz is the greatest","review":"This album is the all time greatest album.

Cd is from 97' approx, Death Row(minus pac) the good ole days were winding down."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is the BADDEST","review":"This CD is extremely amazing, I can't believe his songs aren't topping the charts!!! He's got songs featuring Kurupt, Makaveli, The Outlawz, Snoop, and Nate. This CD has got some incredible songs. I gotta say the best song has got to be O.G. That song was stuck in my head for days. These are pure Dogg Pound Hardcore Rhymes, just the way I like them."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"OK. This album I bought because I enjoy my gangster rap and have heard Daz guesting on \\"Doggystyle\\". Boy was I dissapointed with this one. Although he appears more than able to rhyme on \\"Doggystyle\\", and produce for various Death Row releases he just didn't seem able to translate his obvious talent into a quality CD. The beats on this album are especially poor and elementary. The rapping is in no way great, and finally the guest appearances don't help to save this poor effort. The only anomaly is \\"In California\\", which is a very good song with a bumbing beat, a nice chorus and decent rapping. This however does not make up for this dire attempt of a solo album. Hopefully this mistake will allow Daz to learn and provide us with some nice tunes to bounce our heads to.All in all, you would be best of buying \\"N.W.A. Legacy\\" as you get Daz's best song and a whole load more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrring!","review":"Yeah, this Marvin Gaye calling, thanking you for stealing his \\"In Our Lifetime\\" album cover! I've heard of sampling beats and even flat-out track-jacking, but THIS is a new low.

In addition, Daz's delivery is flawless. If you like Dr. Dre, you'll simply love this. I have hundreds of rap albums and I am a great rap fan. This album is one of my favourites and every rap fan should pick this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Note on System Linking","review":"For those of you who like to system link there is one point that I'd like to point out because it hasn't been explicitly done in other reviews. You can play 8 player games on either two Xboxes (4 players per box) or on 8 Xboxes (1 player per box). I am not sure about 2 on 4 boxes or other combinations (If someone else knows please inform us), but if I had to guess I would say you probably could."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprise game of the year!","review":"This is the surprise game of the year. Based on the fantastic ign review, I gave this game a shot and was very pleasantly surprised. If you like sports games then you will really enjoy Deathrow. The only note about this game is that you have to give it about an hour or so. I can see how anyone who only plays it for a few minutes could be turned off. The controls and the camera are initially difficult to get used to. However, give it some time and you will get a lot of enjoyment out of this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Time Around","review":"Fighting bitterness over the 8 wasted years since their broken engagement, both Emily and Kevin still have an unquenched love for each other. Carol Steward illustrates well the emotions on both sides and the underlying struggles of their unforgotten love. But it takes a child, not their own, to teach Kevin what is most important in life. You'll want to read the book in one sitting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!!!","review":"If you don't care anything about the Civil War, History, Strategy, Politics, Economics, Nationalism, or Sociology you will STILL love this book! This is just a great story about people and issues that could have been taken fom todays headlines. It also explains how many of the institutions that still affect us today (Income Taxes, The Two Party System, Modern Military Tactics, Centralization of Government Aerial reconnaissance, the Navy, Torpedoes to name a few) came about and why. It talks about such thing as Blacks who fought as Unions and Confederates as well as the Secession of an Indian territories as well. Also read U.S. History for Dummies and World History for Dummies both of which were Awesome!!! By the way did I mention that I hate to read?"},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good study guide","review":"I bought this book to study for the DANTES test on Civil war and reconstruction. It was of minimal help. Its a great book if what you are interested in is battle plans, tactics, and a pretty good analysis of each and every battle. The DANTES exam just wanted to know who fought what battle and where, and had questions on Copperheads, fireaters, KKK,and the Lincoln and Johnson administrations that are only glanced it in this book. This is a book about the Civil WAR. To review for the DANTES test find a book about the Civil War and the Civil War ERA.Since this is the first book I've ever read that was exclusively about the Civil War, I wasn't too sure if 90% of the Southern Generals really were war geniuses and 90% of the Union Generals were compelete idiots, which is how it seems in this author's analysis. The South received more complimentary language than the North. I felt that the author was slightly biassed toward the South."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent synopsis of Civil War","review":"The author, Keith Dickson, provides an excellent overview of the War between the States. I particularly enjoyed how he brilliantly brought all the relevant details to light and spared the readers all the extraneous details that are so prevalent in other Civil War texts. Anyone who reads this book will come away with a good overall understanding of all the major conflicts and the commanders involved. That is primarily what I was looking for.After reading Civil War for Dummies, I have come to realize that the true heroes were not the many flamboyant generals like Lee, Grant, Jackson but the everyday soldiers who willingly sacrificed themselves by the thousands in some totally useless charges like the ones at Cold Harbor, Fredericksburg (Maryes Heights) and Gettysburg (Pickett's charge)This is a fine book for anyone interested in learning all they need to know about the Civil War."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEO-CONFEDERATE BIAS","review":"The author leans heavily towards the racist White South and misrepresents Union personalities. Southerners are \\"brave heroes\\" while Union men are \\"one-time store clerks and errand boys\\". It's hard to believe that the author is a loyal American."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Misleading Title","review":"Yes, there are some sex scenes in this movie but its story is not well structured. It drags on and one wonders what is the purpose. It is the story of a young couple. The guys takes amateurish pictures of their love making. These pictures are accidentally found by a voyeur/dealer. The young photographer and his work are introduced to an agent resulting in a photo exhibition. The girl comes to the exhibition and sees the pictures, gets upset and leaves her boyfriend. But soon they both find out that they can't live without each other and they get back together. If you are buying this DVD expecting to see something related to the title of the movie, you wont be disappointed because there are a couple, or three. But you have to be very patient not to get bored."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the price... it is GREAT","review":"I bought a Delta SM300 unit from Amazon in March 2008. It was just $99 with free SuperSaving shipping, and no sales tax, a great price for a solid bench drill press. Most of the parts are cast iron or machined steel. The unit runs smoothly with very minimal vibration. Nice accurate holes every time. I have only two minor complaints. The cardboard shipping box is not really strong enough for this drill press. The heavy parts shifted in transit and broke a small 1/4 piece of plastic off of the back of the pulley cover. I just glued it back on, but still it was an annoyance. The other complaint is that the motor seems to have a very slight \\"hot oil\\" smell after 20 minutes of continuance use. Overall, I am very pleased with this drill press. I have a larger floor model at work, but for my home use, this bench top unit is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chnese Junk is not a boat","review":"Having been around shop machinery all my life (65 years) I knew I was in trouble when I uncrated this thing. China makes weird looking motors. They don't look like American, Japanese, or Taiwanese motors. They are not NEMA motors. They look like Chinese motors and act like Chinese motors and are very often troublesome. As was this one.It burned up as soon as I plugged it in.Amazon is taking it back and I do want a replacement just to see what the rest of the machine is about. If the spindle runs true and it makes nice holes and the motor doesn't burn up I will come back and write another review. Until then.... watch out! It is risky"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice!","review":"I bought this for my father-in-law for Christmas, I only opened the box when it arrived & looked it over to make sure it was all there & not damaged in shipment (all was fine). It appears to be a very nice drill press for the price. I would give it a higher rating but unfortunately its made in China (which I knew it would be for the price but to the best of my knowledge there are 0 manufacturers of bench top drill presses in the US otherwise I would have paid more & bought it!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"How bad drill press can be?!","review":"Three months of the use and a conversation with service center representative.\\"When will my drill press be fixed?\\"\\"Not earlier than 3 weeks.\\"\\"Why it takes so long!\\"\\"We ordered PARTS; motor, chuck and post\\"This is for you Delta.

He was a hang-up man at Climax and would've loved to have read this book himself. He probably would've swore at some of the bits in there...! I began reading the first chapter out loud to my husband and ended up crying at the memories so many of us have of growing up miner's kids in the 60's and 70's. I went to school in 1st grade at the Climax school and our apartment building was at timberline for heaven's sake! Would someone out there please write another of these memoirs for those of us who are hungry for those tales...make it long and (sorry Mr. Ludwig), please don't be someone who ended up in management so soon!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting voice - solid CD","review":"I bought this CD for my son, then sneaked it into my car. This is a really good group. Isaac Slade's voice is so interesting that I find new things to catch my attention each time I play the CD. I'm glad he doesn't cover it up with a lot of harmonies or stacking. I found every song to be very likeable; in fact most could probably stand alone as singles. Of course, stellar tracks like \\"How to Save a Life\\" eclipse the others, but that doesn't take away from the overall enjoyability of the entire CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"great stuff!","review":"If you are into this melodic indie/emo rock pop thingyy lol!You are gonna love the fray, every song in this albums it\`s simply brilliant, very easy to listen at diverse situations I\`m really enjoying their music.If you wanna know how they sound like, well, if you are familiar with Dishwalla, or Augustana and you like it you\`ll be just fine.I honestly this is the kind of album that ain\`t going to bother a diverse background of listeners at a road trip ;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"never a bore to listen to","review":"I only write reviews when I really like something - a lot. So, suffice it to say, I like this CD - a lot. The lead singer in the band has a yearning in his voice that just can't be duplicated. He sings with such emotion. The lyrics are clever, and the songs sound different so you don't feel like you're hearing the same thing over and over again. I highly recommend this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"they fray","review":"you either like them or you don't i love them i don't buy many cds but they were great and i love them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fray--Heart-wrenching and Thought-Provoking","review":"The Fray wasn't my most favorite CD in a pile I got for Christmas. But, listening a couple weeks later, I'm really interested in them! The first 3 songs are my favorite and Heaven Forbid is really thought-provoking. But, almost all of the songs are worth the money! A band that they kind of bring to mind is the Goo Goo Dolls, although not exactly the same, which is good. The CD includes the lyrics, which I enjoy reading over, so this is definitely good for you! I highly reccomend. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Husband loved it!","review":"This was a gift for my husband; he loved it. Seller delivered in a timely manner. Very pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch \\"Scrubs\\" more often!","review":"Never heard of The Fray until I heard \\"How to Save a Life\\" in the emotional final scene of Scrubs this past week. The emotional and powerful song fit perfectly and I wondered who it was. Keep in mind Scrubs is a comedy and for some reason the writers decided to get a little serious and they hit a homerun with this song. After I discovered it was The Fray, I immediately picked up the cd. So good! I've been taking it from my car to work...back and worth...listening over and over. Great effort for their first CD. Kinda reminds me of Keane/Coldplay/Switchfoot. Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy listening","review":"Two of my favorite songs are on this CD.

I think she only watches Gray's Anatamy to hear them sing sometimes!Even I like to hear this cd and I'm 53! LOL"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland and Uninspiring","review":"I just don't understand the hype associated with this label. The two songs they play over and over and over on (Christian!) radio are about as lyrically uninspiring and bland as they come. The lead singer's voice sounds like he's overdosed on sedatives as he mumbles from one line to the next. \\"With eight seconds left in overtime, she's on your mind\\"??? Huh? I've heard funeral music that has more life than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD I've ever heard","review":"I don't even know where to begin. This is definitely the best CD I have heard in a long time. I got this album after hearing the song \\"Over My Head\\" on the radio, and instantly fell in love. Every single song on this album is unique and it really highlights how talented these four young men are. I recommend this album to anyone who likes good music! It is worth the money! I can't wait for their upcoming album, which will be out pretty soon!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still listening","review":"I've had this CD for a long time, but just got it out again after not listening for a while, and have to say, it remains a favorite.

One of the few I can listen to all the way through without skipping a song...","review":"I really like this album! After recently hearing \\"Over My Head\\", I listened to clips of the album and was impressed. I am very happy with my purchase. These guys are really good. It's the type of album you can put in the player and listen all the way through without wanting to skip any songs.If you like Coldplay and/or Keane, you'll enjoy this album (and vice versa)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"I ordered this CD after hearing \\"How to Save a Life\\" on the Conan O'Brien Show. When I recieved the CD, I was completely shocked. The entire CD was just completely moving. It has something for everyone. Something to make you happy, to make you sad, to make you remember, to make you grateful for what you have. This CD can brighten my day whenever I feel low... And not only are the tracks great to move your soul, they sound great too! Many times on other CD's from other bands, you will find 2 \\"good\\" tracks and the rest are just rubbish... not so on this CD. Every single track is good. Their orchestration is incredible. Using the piano as a lead was a brilliant idea, and the voices of the singers are heard very well and clearly so that you can understand the lyrics to the songs. Incredible CD. I really didn't expect this CD to be that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melodic Storytelling That Rocks","review":"While it's always dangerous to compare bands, I will say that musically you will probably enjoy these guys if you like Five for Fighting, Dave Matthews, Counting Crows, or Augustan. I'm not saying they're the same, but they all have male leads and an ability to deliver strong messages in catchy, melodic rock songs that are consistently easy to take.A collection of short stories about trying to figure out life and other people, I can't say whether or not the songs on this album reflect true stories from the bands' lives, but they certainly sound deeply personal, and easy to relate to.My favorites are \\"She Is,\\" \\"Over My Head (Cable Car),\\" \\"Heaven Forbid,\\" and \\"Little House.\\" I especially like the integration of piano work with a slightly rough-edged guitar. The new TV staple, \\"How to Save a Life\\" is growing on me, but more as pop background than as something meaningful.All in all, you can't go wrong with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to Save a Life","review":"This is an amazing album, all the songs on it are flawless. The lyrics are deep and heartfelt, they're well written and can reach out to everybody, because their meaning is as vast as it is decisive. The best songs on the album are 'How to Save a Life', \\"Cable Car (Over My Head)', 'Look After You', 'All At Once', and \\"She Is'. The extra DVD is a great accompaniment, especially the documentary about the album. Worth every cent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Soothing with Heart","review":"I must have had this cd on repeat for atleast a couple of months. It was the only cd that I would listen to and ofcourse found myself humming the the tune when I did not have my headphones on. I am very happy that I picked up this cd. I would recommend it to those who just want a mellow alternative tune with heartfelt lyrics. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in the album","review":"I only enjoyed one song. The one they always play on the radio. How disappointed I was to pay a high price to just enjoy ONE song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful awful band.","review":"You've heard it right: every song sounds exactly the same on this album.The singer sounds like a drunker version of Richard Patrick (of the band Filter).

These Guys Su-u-uck","review":"A triumph of mediocrity, it's like Wonder Bread licking \\"Grey's Anatomy.\\" I actually forgot the music as I was listening to it--underwhelming, empty, and corporate radio friendly.

Somebody say they were helping modern rock, are you insane there boring and sound like some many other generic bands that get theme songs to shows like the O.C.If you really want to listen to a band that could help save the state of Modern Rock then check out Rose Hill Drive, another band that also happens to hail from Boulder Colorado, or check out Silvertide, a band that rocks out in the vein of the Black Crowes and Aerosmith."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"This CD is absolutely one of the worst CDs I have ever had the displeasure of listening to. The instrumentals are uninspired and weak, the vocals are whiny and weak, and the lyrics are bad. If I hear any of theses songs any more I might destroy my radio. Do yourself a favor and buy something else instead of numbing your brain with this weeeeeeak cd. Its bands like the fray that cause the weakness of modern music. You want a truly good CD? Take a look at Stadium Arcadium by Red Hot Chili peppers, dont waste your money on this piece of junk thats not even worth the bargain rack"},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY A+++++++","review":"This cd is the best I have heard in a long time. I have been listening to it nonstop since buying it two weeks ago, and every song is just amazing. It's one of those that you can just put on and listen to the whole thing without having to skip songs you really don't like or get sick of. My favorites happen to be tracks 2,3,4,7, but they are all great. Be prepared to hear from them in the future. Great music guys, keep it up!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"purely amazing","review":"I bought this cd on a whim after hearing \\"Over My Head (Cable Car)\\" and I am absolutely in love with it. Their lead singer Isaac Slade has a haunting voice that really brings the lyrics to life. Since last week, this cd has been playing nonstop on my iPod. My favorite song has to be \\"Look After You\\" but all of the songs are fantastic. The cd flows really well and I definitely recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Album=Huge Success","review":"The first full album by the Denver sensation \\"The Fray\\" does not dissappoint. Many might believe the only good song on this album is the chart-topper \\"Over my Head (Cable Car)\\". However, this is not the only good song. Songs such as How to Save a Life and Fall Away have just as good rhythm and feel as Cable Car. This is a must buy for anyone who enjoys original sounding and good flowing music. Buy it today! 5 STARS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Homogenized, pasteurized and processed to the point of uselessness","review":"This group is a classic example of the bad effect of the monopolization of the radio industry. These days you can't get on the radio unless you fit the cookie cutter profile that Entercom seems to think qualifies as pop. This group fits that profile perfectly. If you like drunk sounding, inarticulate music with a very limited repertoire of musical variation, then this is the group for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is supposed to be considered good music?","review":"I can't believe there are enough people out there with bad enough taste in music that this album would be in the Top 40. All of the songs sound exactly the same - they all sound like a rip off of Coldplay and other similar bands.How someone could sit and listen through 12 mediocre songs is beyond me. There is nothing new about the Fray, they have just hopped on the bandwagon of other wimpy pop groups with no serious musical ability.The reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1 is that it was PRODUCED and MARKETED well, and I respect that. It was produced to sound exactly like all of the other junk on the radio, and marketed well to the people who listen to that junk.I really hope you could find something better to listen to than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another \\"whining\\" group devoid of harmony and a beat. As if \\"Five for Fighting\\" wasn't bad enough....","review":"No doubt I'll take flack from this band's supporters, but I found this entire album to be an insufferable whine-fest. My God, whatever happened to rock? You know, something with a beat and a singer who doesn't sound like he's about to toss his cookies, so to speak. Even my kids asked \\"why is the man on the radio is whining so much?\\" when \\"How to save a life\\" was thrust on us for the 56th time that day.I tried to \\"get\\" the songs, expecially the beaten into a pulp by overplay \\"How to save a life\\", but just couldn't do it. I simply cannot see how endless whining and whimpering constitutes music. But, based on what commercial radio is playing \\"whining\\" seems to be in. Let's see, we have John Mayer, Five for Fighting, Snow Patrol and now this bunch. Just great.... In the span of a few years we've gone from music with some drive that kicks a little butt to.....this? Ugh...."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to mumble to try to cover up bad lyrics and songwriting...","review":"It's amazing the levels of mediocrity that can spawn heavy radio rotation and hundreds of Amazon reviews. This sounds like Ben Folds in the initial phases of songwriting, mumbling through a rough idea, before moving on to expand lyrics, melodies and arrangements. The lead singer mumbles because he knows that he can't write lyrics!! How anyone would buy this is beyond me. The 2 songs I've heard from this band and the samples on Amazon are enough to clinch the title of bad band of the year for \\"The Fray\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Losery music for losery people","review":"This CD was given to me as a gift. I'd never heard of The Fray so I decided to give it a whirl. Now I want to blow my brains out with a shotgun. Every song sounds exactly the same, which wouldn't be so bad if their formula produced something listenable. Does the lead singer have Down Syndrome? Why does he sing like Corky from \\"Life Goes On?\\" I'm just waiting for him to shout, \\"BECCA!\\" at the top of his lungs.

They have an interesting sound and I rarely buy CDs but I would reccommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard Band to Rate.","review":"The Fray's music is a bit on the slow side at times. So if you're cleaning or exercising, get a different CD. Also, I am NOT a fan of the lead singer's voice (it's scratchy and he is not a good singer). Fortunately, even with all The Fray's flaws, the music still shines through. The songs are catchy and actually have some substance. While, the songs get rather depressing toward the end of the albun (perfect for days when you're feeling sorry for yourself), they leave you feeling at least slightly optimisic. Another pro/con is that The Fray appeals to many different people. Both my mom (mid 40's) and I (16) like their music. This is a con because my MOM like them (Eww). I know their songs are way overplayed on the radio, but buy the album anyway. The rest of their music is still good and untainted by the diabolic radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging lyrics on a strong collection","review":"Like everyone else, I can't get \\"Over My Head\\" out of my head. Often it doesn't pay to get a whole album when this killer of a single has taken over. I was pleasantly surprised that the album is wonderful. The songs are thoughtful, engaging, and worth a listen. The piano playing shines throughout the album. Although the songs sound similar to \\"Over My Head,\\" they each posses their own charm. It was so worth it to buy this album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new.","review":"Yes they have some catchy tunes, but this record is unbearably unoriginal. This music is best suited for a tv drama, rolling in during the scene where the doctor makes a grand effort to save both the mother and the infant in a complicated pregnancy, only to come so close but one dies (in fact I think scrubs had a similar scene); or when the teacher tries so hard to turn her no-good students straight, but one of them ends up dying right after they shape up. I don't much like their music."},{"rating":"2","title":"This record is something you need to have in your life.","review":"Since the day I got the CD, I just cannot stop listening to it.The more you listen to it, the more you love the music.From the begining to the end of the record, the distinctive and very smooth voice of Isaac Slade, the lead vocalist is just amaging. The sounds of the piano he plays are not like someone else's music. He is a very talented musician and an artist.Also the drummer of the band, Ben Wysocki is now one of my favorite drummers. If you listen to the song,\\"Look After You\\", you will see what I mean. His quiet but powerful sound will take you to a totally different world with the singing of Slade.Sometime worlds are just useless to explain something what people to know.This reocrd is worth to buy and to spend your time to listent to."},{"rating":"2","title":"This thing blows....","review":"I got this, along with the gutter cleaning tubes, specifically to clean my gutters. It works! It is all I've tried with it. It puts out a lot of air and I'm quite satisfied with it. My only gripes are that it does not come with any line cord (at the price, I wouldn't expect much more than a pigtail) and it did not have any kind of manual. Most of my extension cords fit fine, but any with multiple outlets on the end will not work. The manual thing is also a minor thing. It does not involve rocket science to put this thing together, but I just like having some kind of manual. Conclusion: It does what I want at a price that I liked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weed Eater bag","review":"The product s a very good blower however, the bag situation needs great help.This is the second EBV 215 I have owned and the product itself is great.

The bags have always been a problem as I have purchased three others for my prior blower/vac.In trying to use the limited warranty I was told by the individual I finally talked to they did not do warranties.

The show does not seem dated at all. It can be a little too silly at times, but that's no big deal; I think the mix of action and comedy is why it was such a big hit.

I guess I just wanted to believe otherwise, and there are plenty of websites where I got my information. However, seeing the secession decuments shows me that that is just not the case. Oh well... as you said, admit the mistake, and move on.However, the most important part, and that part that most of us agree on, is the fact that loving the Dixie flag, and being a proud Southerner does NOT make one a racist.

The whole show had a few simple formulas really, fast cars, keniving cops who get it in the end, and even faster women and it worked so well.

In \\"The Culture of Islam\\" he attempts something which is almost impossible: concisely describe and write about a dogmatically and culturally diverse religion with a depth of understanding that permeates how religion is actually lived. I was sympathetic to much of what he wrote, which comes mainly from Arab examples (and even there from an exceptional case, Morocco), although I did not necessarily agree with all of his conclusions. He is well-versed in Islamic jurisprudence and Arab social organization, and this primer goes farther than most in conveying a palpable understanding of a fascinating system of thought, meaning-making and cosmology. Because his experience is mainly in Morocco, as mentioned before many of the examples come from there.

This game provides hours of fun!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps getting better","review":"Just when you thought that they couldn't possibly make a new Tony Hawk that provided original gameplay, Activision came out with this awesome game. The best addition to this installment has to be the way that they revamped how you achieve objectives. In previous versions, you had to keep retrying the level, suffering through annoying load times just so you can retry the objectives. Now, there is no timelimit on the levels, and you activate objectives by talking to people on the board. Fail the objective? No problem. Hit start and select \\"retry objective\\" from the menu.Other than that, the graphics have improved, yet again, and the replay value is even higher than it was before. Can life get better? I thought it couldn't, but Activision proved me wrong!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have supported xbox LIVE...","review":"...It doesn't support LIVE although it does support the other...third party online play.

It was really fun at first, but then I started to not be able to beat the Challenges and I went to the free campaign mode to play, and to make my school how I wanted. But then, the school isn't a school, it's a bunch of land that you make separate buildings for different classes on. Then kids kept leaving becuase of no bathrooms... even though there was one next to them. The cafeteria always had food poisoning. But the worst part of the game, the one that made this game a snoozer, was the fact that it was incredibly unrealistic. I mean, a roller coaster on a school campus? A skate park? A go kart arena? You have way too much money to buy these things and the students don't go to them. And then, there are deluxe buildings, which cost thousands, and people just don't go to them.This game will trick you, so be careful. Don't buy it, is my advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crashes and stuff...","review":"I have Windows XP. If you have Windows XP, TAKE GREAT CAUTION! I bought the game, and I installed it.

I, personally, thought the game was sorta worth it... until my computer crashed over and over when I wasn't even on the game.I uninstalled it, and reinstalled, that didn't work. I downloaded the thing that was supposed to stop the crashes: no result. Finally, I took all the files I wanted to save and moved them to a new computer screen name.

It's a great idea and, if done right, it could even be my favorite game. But it wasn't. The main reason for this is that in this game, natural disasters (earthquakes, fires, tornados) strike your school about every three or four days. They wreck some of your buildings and you have to give tons of money to replace them. There seemed to be no way to save money. You would think that there would be some option where you could turn disasters off, but I didn't see one, and there's no other way to prevent them. I found myself getting very frustrated and having to reconstruct my school again and again. I would not get this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good, But Not What I Expected","review":"When I bought this game, I thought it would be a lot more fun. Yeah, sure, its somewhat entertaining, but its not what you would expect. The graphics are OK, but not great.

For the few of you who can't get yours to work, don't bother because it was by far the simplest childish tycoon game I have ever played. This game isn't meant for anyone over the age of 10 so if your looking for a challange then just skip it. The most you can do with the game is build buildings and arrange them and that gets old after about 20mins. Don't buy this game its a waste and if I could get my money back I would.On the flip side, if you're buying this for a child then go for it. If you have a semi-new computer then you should have any problems running it. I would, however, recommend something more educational for a child.

You don't have much control over the people, you can send them to the nurse, give them detention, or expel them. After the first few minuets of playing this it froze up, after about a min.

Then there's less time for the sound to end in the opening movie.Unrealistic. All they ever do in the \\"Generic Gym\\" is jumping jacks. All they ever do in the \\"Basketball Gym\\" is shooting baskets continuously. And you lose a star rating just because of a natural disaster. The prices are also ridiculous.This game lets you do little; the back of the cover says you can do more than you can, probably because it isn't specific.What I like the least is that after a natural disaster strikes, the buildings look the same, but are out of maintainance.

This one however - whilst it may be the first one at least i know of to do it is - as you can see - riddled with bugs, for me it was mostly whenever a building began to smoke from not being fixed it would crahs the game. Apart from this the gameplay was farely average, but didnt ever really get past the simple 'build this, then build this and you can build this'. So it got boring really quickly. Overall only 2 start, and i wouldnt recomend it - although at least i can actually say it worked which seems to be more than the others here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Fun!","review":"This game is a lot of fun. It's especially fun for kids who complain about school. You do the basics like hiring teachers and staff and decorate your campus. The school isn't like many would think it would be; it's an outdoor school, hence 'campus'. However, you barely spare it a thought once you get into it.One thing that isn't so great is the simplicity of the scenarios. The first time I played, the first scenario only took me 1.5 minutes. There is a freeform game option, though. Also, it can get rather slow and loading times are a little on the long side. Decorating and deleting items can be VERY tedious.Overall, School Tycoon does have its issues. But you get over them once you start playing. It's a great game for young and old alike. I reccomend it, especially to younger kids. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"Cute idea for a game, but...where is the sandbox mode?

The handle is angled away from the face of the sheet, is comfortable, and just the right length, leaving your other hand free to balance the top edge of the sheet. I'd give it 5 stars if Stanley improved a few things just a bit: First, if they reduced the front-to-back depth of the bottom just bit and made the retention lip a bit higher, the sheet would feel a little more secure (it's not worth carrying more than 2 sheets anyway, as it becomes too hard to balance). Second, if it could freestand a little more securely, it would be that much easier to get a sheet on the thing. It's a pain in the neck when it falls over. In spite of all that, it's still the sheet carrier I reach for most often. Cheap, strong, and reliable.

We both put a glove on halfway through and it seemed to help some. When we got to the single 1/2\\" 4'x12' sheets we were both happy again! (alot less weight than those 8' doubles) lol.

It combines a lot of intense action with a little bit of strategy. Some of you may think this game is simply a sequel to Red Faction taking place on mars, but your wrong; due yourself a favor, forget every thing you know about the first red faction. A lot of this game takes place in a futuristic city. But some levels will bring you out in the wilderness while others will bring you deep inside a military silo. There's a great variety in levels so you'll never get board. Another great part of Red Faction 2 is the many different weapons. You can get pistols, Uzies, assault rifles and even flame grenades, you'll never run out of weapons. The only mane reason I give this game 4 stars is because the graphics could still use some work and eventually the fighting becomes repetitive. Besides that Red Faction 2 is a great game it is worth [money], buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alright THQ, let's get real.","review":"What were they thinking? It has little next to nothing to do with the Red Faction, which what was the original was all about. There is no real POINT to the game. and with all the twists and turns, you don't know if you're the good guy or the bad.And if all this isn't bad enough, they make it short. you can beat it in a two day time span. This is not worth [$$] I can assure you that much.While the game is somewhat fun, it is basically a different game. It only slightly mentions Red Faction a couple of times. You see a character or two of the Red Faction, and that's about it.The game doesn't take place on Mars either. That was half the thrill of the other one. You don't really know what your going to run into in mines that are underground in Mars.The geo-mod in this game is okay, but there is a lot of mesh wiring under most surfaces, making it impossible to pass through.Rent this before you consider buying it.

Its cool havin a grenade launcher/machine gun lik the rangers in black hawk down hav. But otha than dat dont buy dis game. If ur dat intrested in it rent it......youll beat it in dat week anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Game I have ever played","review":"This was one of the worst games I have ever played. I warn you DO NOT BUY THIS! The graphics are horrible they are like PS1 graphics. I like the Halo controls where you use two joysticks but I hate the fact that the controllers are inverted. Overall this game is a 0.1 on a scale from 1 to 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall Great Game","review":"Red Faction 2 is the \\"Halo\\" of playstation, with an assortment of weapons, almost everyone of them with alternative firing modes. The gameplay handles pretty well, and the sound and graphics live up to expectation. This game could have been a bit longer though, and should have had a 2 player mission mode like Halo. The multiplayer mode really shines, with an array of environments/stages, tough enemies and lots of firepower. For Red Faction 3, THQ should give the player control of the hovercraft and tank, instead of just being the gunner. GeoMod in the game's engine is fantastic and gives the game more realism. One and a Half thumbs up!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"RF2 Da Sequel","review":"Here's a simple mixture: Take awesome graphics,amazing sound,hi-tech weaponry, and vehicles and mix it. Season it up with easy-controll,normal difficulty,a huge array of weapons and then bake it in a PS2. What do ya get a really great 1st person shooter game. RF2 starts out easy and slow for the begginer but also starts out with heavy fire power and explosions. The game gets harder and more exiting each time you pass a level. Toward the end it gets really hard especially the last level which it took me weeks to finally beat it. The game also includes tight multi-player games including capture-the-flag, bagger, and the usual last one standing wins. What [is unacceptable] about this game is in some levels you find enemies all around you making the level harder than it is, lots of re-loading, and lots of throwing your controller across the room in frusratation. Overall its a good game but requires patients."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first was great...This is better!!","review":"In the first game you played a miner in a mine on Mars. You are treated badly. When your not in your suiut or bed another miner is. So you decide to revolt. You plan it and you must execute it. It combined the use of Geo-mod technology, special vechicals that can alter surroundings, with great weapons. All this is just in single player mode. In multiplayer mode you and one friend can battle against four bots in several terrains.This game is a step ahead of what I just told you. It is a more strategy based game, don't get me wrong you still get to pull out the guns and kill a few guys. There are also double the number of weapons. There is even an improvement in multiplayer mode, it is now FOUR PLAYERS. Now you and three of your friends can fight it out. I think this game is great!!! I give it SIX STARS!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"done know","review":"game's ok, its fine, RF 1 was bad, i haven't played this, dont want now, but yes ok,,, rite!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good multiplayer","review":"My friends and I play multiplayer against bots on capture the flag, etc. Its a lot of fun.

I have Red Faction I, and I have to say I loved it. The destructible environments were amazing. I'd never played a game like it before.Now We have RFII... I have to say it did not stand up to it's predecessor. The game play is good, much the same as it was for the first and if that's what you care about then you'll like this game. What I miss is the destructible environment. You can't dig tunnels anymore, unlike in RFI where you could on multi-player dig tunnels all over the place.Good game.. doesn't have as much of a destructible environment as the first did.Btw, don't spend 90 dollars for this game. Find it cheaper somewhere else, I spent 12 on it for a used copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"RED FACTION - BEST FPS ALONG WITH TUROK EVOLUTION!","review":"This game rocks!

The scenery was pretty and the horses were beautiful to watch but...First off, the girl playing the star sounded like she was from New Jersey, not Arabia.

It might be palatable to a 5-year-old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Young Black Stallion","review":"This movie is a classic example of marriage between fancy camara work/good music and scenery, and LOUSY acting/plot.

I thought that the \\"movie\\" was too short then and I continue to hold my opinion. The film comes across as a low-budget made-for-tv movie due to its shortness in length and unremarkable plot. I would have liked to see a variety in the scenery and an increase in the action or acted emotions from the actors. Disney has a great idea of making a horse movie with a female lead but this script wasn't quite it. I'd wait until the price drops to around $8 before purchasing this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, short film for girls who love horses","review":"My daughter and I saw this at the IMAX theater, and now own the DVD. It's less than an hour, which is nice for parents. It's beautifull filmed, and the little girl is a fairly strong female character. The horse scenes are great, and it's a real hit with my 4-year-old and with our 8-year-old neighbor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Although the scenery is nice, I am sorely disappointed in both acting and content. It was as tho' I was watching a middle school production with forced acting. Also, the story has little build up in anticipation of it climax. You just get started watching and the movie is over.

I do not recommend this movie.I have read most of Walter Farley's books, this movie does not do his stories justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE READ THE BOOK!","review":"I'm all for movies that are based on books, I feel it encourages more people to read. Yes, there are those who don't even know there is a BOOK (*gasp*) but hey, I'm used to less than observant people. I'm also one that understands that the movies will frequently be a little different from the books because of time constraints. But, this is INSANE. Fifty minutes isn't a time constraint, it's a death wish. And where does the book show up in this?

Almost every question has grammatical errors and the question language is very basic, nothing like the questions I have seen on several other practice exams where the questions are much more sophisticated. There are not only many, many grammatical errors, but the PMI terms are often referred to incorrectly. The basic terms are there, but something is not quite right. This test seems to have been put together by someone that does speak English as their first language or maybe it has been translated from another language and something has been lost in the translation. I definitely do not recommend this CD for practice for the PMP exam."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it but the unit is not as well made.","review":"I have bought 4 of these systems over the years and notice that the units themselves are becoming poorer quality.

No highs, no lows, just this dead castrated sound...even my friend's Sony home theater in a box sounded better than this, and he only paid three hundred dollars for it!!!Since that time I have consulted a number of audio forums such as ecoustics dot com, home theater forum dot com, and avsforum dot com, and have found many people who were happy to tutor me.

I really enjoy all of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoaky and inaccurate","review":"The main tension of this film, Porter's devotion to his career vs. his wife's longings for his attentions, is sad and pathetic, all the more so because the movie's conclusion seems to be some kind of romantic reunion between the two. Is it celebrating it, or does Grant's tortured look over Linda's shoulder betray darker, more forboding elements in their relationship. Be that as it may, they never really delve into Porter's life in any gripping, realistic way. You can hear the music better performed many, many places. It's fun to watch Wooley and Martins' performances, as well as the cameos by the likes of Eve Arden. Not a keeper, but worth seeing once if your a fan of any of the performers in the film or whom the film is about."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate 40's Musical Fantasy","review":"Historically, this movie has Cary Grant, who is history's most ultimate female fantasy, and Alexis Smith, with her wardrobe, both beautiful and stunning. The story is based on Cole Porter's life, but is not his reality. It is simply the art of taking reality and making it beautiful.I enjoyed every minute of this ultimate 1940's musical fantasy. Buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not lovely","review":"If you're looking for a movie that accurately tells the story of Cole Porter, this is clearly not it. Nor is it a great movie in any way. The story telling is cheesy and quite amateurish -- a surprise for a movie starred by Cary Grant. Still Grant's sheer charisma, and Porter's extraordinary music, make this a movie somewhat worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cole Porter music, plus Cary Grant","review":"A classy first-class Hollywood production from 1946, with dreamy melt-on-your-tongue (and melt your heart) love songs. I have to warn you that the sound quality on the copy I rented from the video store was only so-so in places, but don't let that stop you if you have a fondness for Cole Porter or Cary Grant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oye, what a loser!","review":"I love Cary Grant. He is a phenomenon. But this movie missed the mark on so many levels. First of all, Cary looked stiff and he seemed to be NOT enjoying himself at all throughout the entire movie. Cole Porter was a bi-sexual. I know that was taboo when this pic was made, but not even one little hint? All I will say is that the music was great. But that is all that is great about this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate, Inane, and Corny","review":"What can I say? This movie is hysterically ridiculous. Even if it were not woefully inaccurate, the dialogue is stupid -- even Cary Grant had a hard time making the movie. Normally I love old movies, but if you know anything at all about Cole Porter, you can't help but laugh and grimace simultaneously during this corny flick.De-lovely is somewhat more accurate, though not nearly enough. However, it's a better (fictional) story and better produced.If you must watch this, then listen for the music and ignore the inane plot and wooden acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"great game","review":"this is a great game if your are the outdoorsman type.

It is not as heavy, more cheaply made, and it is also noisier by a LOT and it smells, at least at the first use. I am seriously considering returning it, but that's so much trouble and expense. I may be stuck. I am suspicious of Oster after this. Maybe this is a fake Oster since it's now sold by a 3rd party???

The part holding the blades gets loose too easily, i.e. while mounting the holder on top of the motor, while removing it, even while just sitting on the countertop. The result is nasty spills.

We are very pleased with it and glad we went with this particular one. The construction is very nice and the unit feels very sturdy. I like that the pitcher is made of thick glass. The lid for the pitcher fits in very snugly and we have not had any leak problems. The blade consist of four seperate blades and they seem very sharp and well made. The only thing I knocked a star off for was that the different speeds don't seem too different from one another. This thing crushes seven cubes of ice in about 7-10 seconds and they are completely crushed. If you put too much ice, it will leave big chucks, but this is no problem.

Just another company, using their Name and, good reputation, to sell cheap merchandise.No idea why my updates are disappearing, but I have received a new blender today, what a difference a blender, that is not defective makes. I change my rating to 4 stars ****"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oster 6684 12 -Speed blender","review":"After lengthy comparison shopping, this blender was not only the least expensive, but had the toughness and durability needed to make smoothies with tons of ice. More expensive models had plastic blade components, this one is steel and really does the job nicely. I've owned professional grade blenders that cost a fortune and did not work as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST XTIAN HIP-HOP CD OF ITS TIME","review":"I grew up (for better or worse) on Xtian hip hop and from the late 80s - late 90s it was clearly a dessert wasteland of MC's with mostly good intentions who tried way to hard. As a result Xtian hip-hop by and large stunk until 1992 when Phase III came out. I was 13 at the time and this cassette tape sat in my player for a full year, and was regularly in my personal rotation for the next 6-8 years!SFC was the best Hip Hop Group (I owned Saved Man too, but not until 1997) until G.R.I.T.S. (1997) and Cross Movement (2000 when they found their groove)) made it any kind of relevant. Sure some might attempt to point to DC Talk as the best rap group, but really, what were they?SFC's work still stands up today; Doves beats and samples are high quality (a rarity at the time) and Sup C's lyrics were both funny and thought provocing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cornerstone Album In Christian Rap Music","review":"Mannn SUP, i'm glad this CD has finaly been freed up!

Sounds great.Nice warm 'Fender' Tone (sounds almost tube)The 2 channels with very different soundIt looks cool.I have tried many of these small amps at the guitar center and this sounded the best - and was one of the cheapest too.This is not a toy amp - it is something you can get many years of use out of from beginner to pro"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good solid Purchase","review":"Delivery was prompt.

This amp looks nice, feels substantial and lets you hook up your iPod and stereo headphones easily with the appropriate adapters if needed. This amp can be loud enough for you to find out just what your neighbors thing about your musical skills. (You know, bring over a six-pac or call the cops.) Or soft enough to play along with your iPod. Or with headphones. How an amp sounds and what you can do with it is a personal thing. Playing my guitar along with friends or my iPod is fun and this amp works just fine for me. This amp is easy to recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I've used Paul Mitchell Awapui shampoo for almost 2 decades, and have never had a problem with it. It smells nice, and with my already thin hair, it gives me great body and visibly improves the health of my hair.I have no idea what the other 2 reviewers were using or why they claim they started losing hair after changing to Awapui shampoo.My hair is very fine (the shaft is very very thin), so it has a tendancy to break easily. Most shampoos leave my hair stripped of it's natural oils and I end up using 2 or 3 other products to repair and replace the deficiency. But with Paul Mitchell Awapui shampoo, I can simply wash and wear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this.","review":"On the back of every Paul Mitchell product bottle it says \\"Guaranteed ONLY when sold by a professional hairdresser, otherwise it may be counterfeit, black market, old or tampered with.\\"Product diversion is a big issue in the professional beauty industry, if you don't buy straight from the source, you don't really know what you're buying.Not only that, but this version of the Awapuhi Original Shampoo has not been seen on the shelves since about 2008, that is EXTREMELY old packaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad to say but I agree with what the reviewer said below","review":"I used to love Paul Mitchell and used it every day for two years and noticed that my hair kept thinning out. My ENTIRE family from both mother and father had there hair full all the way into their 70's! So why was my hair thinning? Well it seems that if you color your hair (which I do) you can NOT use Paul Mitchell products. My hair came out in clumps towards the end which was definitely \\"unnatural\\" EVEN for natural \\"hairloss\\".So now I use Dove Shampoos, conditioners and soaps. And Pantene color Expressions is good too.I take multivitamins and Biotin which is good for the hair by mouth daily."},{"rating":"1","title":"I lost my hair!","review":"I shampooed my hair with this about a year and a half ago, because I love Paul Mitchell products and wanted to try a new shampoo. Within days I was losing my hair. I have beautiful long dirty blonde hair, one of my best assets, and it was devastating. I knew that since I had made a recent change to a different shampoo, that must have been it. I changed back to my original shampoo - Paul Mitchell's Special Tea Tree shampoo, and I quit losing my hair. I definately recommend Tea Tree shampoo over Awapuhi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awapuhi Shampoo is still the one","review":"I found this as a sample from one of my hotel stays and found it to be gentle, not too stinky, and cleans well.

I would not recommend any paul mitchell product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not academic, but still a great book.","review":"The two parts to this book work well together and it's great to see a bio/technique book about such a unique musician. There are no source notes or anything from the bio section but it is an interesting read. I really like the fact that the book is spiral bound, which is great for keeping it open on the music stand. I've only started working on learning the tunes and I've already found an editing oddity in the tablature for \\"Djangology\\" but nothing serious. The music is difficult though. I'm a professional musician and guitar teacher and this stuff is a challenge but well worth it if you really want a great introduction to Django's style and technique. The acoompanying CD is recorded well and is a good working tool for practicing. I still prefer listening to the original recordings for subtle nuances and phrasing but it's still good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Django Reinhardt : Know the Man, Play the Music","review":"Whether you're a guitar player or just an avid listener of Gypsy Jazz or simply just interested in Django Reinhardt, this book is a wonderful piece of work.It is broken into two parts. The first part is a detailed biography of Django, containing about every factoid of his life you might ever want to know. There is great insight into the development of his music and his particular style. I found it to be well written and fascinating. It reads easily.The second part is an analysis of several of his best-known works, written out in tablature and performed for you on the included CD. I haven't yet delved into this part, but I can see it's laid out well. I love owning this book.It is the kind of book that would make one of those great and thoughtful gifts for the aspiring Gypsy Jazz guitarist or the person interested in Reinhardt's life story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great place to start!","review":"This is by no means the be all end all of Django books. I found this to be a fine place to start. Nobody can play exactly like Django, but they can try. Most musicians never completely work through an entire music book either. This is one you will most likely read and play from cover to cover. I felt accomplished by being able to \\"play\\" all the tunes!I would suggest getting the Django Definitive tab book next if you choose to be lazy and not read music...and of course start listening to Django 24 hours a day. Despite what one reviewer wrote, there are some really good recordings out there... the proper box and the 10cd box on ebay are both pretty good deals with listenable tunes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellence!","review":"This is an excellent introduction to and summary of Django's life and music. I confess I have a hard time listening to Django's original recordings, because of the inferior recording quality, the scatching, hissing, etc. The CD accompanying this book is worth the price of admission alone. I listen to it over and over. Rod Fogg's clean recordings breathed new life into this style of music for me. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angelo Mini Pendants","review":"My order just arrived and I am VERY happy with them--just like the description and just what I wanted. They were shipped even faster than I expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jazz selections from three early albums","review":"This two disc offering is not really a \\"best of\\" compilation, rather is a recap of three early albums. Most selections were written by members Skipper Wise and Ed Cohen. Disc One selections are from \\"Windows\\" (their debut) and \\"Is It Safe?\\". Disc Two is the entire album of \\"Mr. Bongo\\". Only the \\"Gabriella\\" selection by member Tim Timmermans had a very good melody and stood distinctly from the others. I am not enough of a jazz fan for variations on weak melodies and was not won over by several listens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the quality I've seen from Florsheim in the past","review":"I've had at least one pair of florsheim dress shoes for regular use since the late 80s. My current pair is the one being reviewed here. After about 6 months, right shoe had the outside seam going down the heal started coming unstitched. I was able to overlook this quality issue since it only unstitched about 1 inch and did not effect the wearability. Today, about 2 years since purchase, the same shoe had the sole split across the middle. There is still lots of wear available on the sole, it seems that the material chosen for the sole was not a good choice. I'll be buying some replacement shoes but they won't be Florsheim ... I don't think they are the quality shoes they used to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Looking Shoe","review":"Really good looking shoe. I ended up wearing these to my wedding.

Lee gets his big break","review":"In \\"Gone for Soldiers\\", author Jeff Shaara takes us back to the Mexican American war. During this time, we meet a younger Captain Robert E. Lee.I thought this book was great. Shaara continues to write in his fathers style, as he did in the Civil War books. Here, we follow General Winfield Scott and Lee.I recommend this book to anybody that is interested about this small war that we dont know a lot about."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Expected Much More","review":"This novel was a major disappointment. I finish what I start, but this was painful. I kept expecting it to get better, but it didn't. The premise was very promising, involving people extremely important to the history of the U.S. all together during a not very well known episode of American history. The history was, in fact, interesting, but the characterizations, especially of Lee were downright annoying.I am a fan of the three civil war books, but cannot recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dutiful Son","review":"My biggest beef against Jeff Shaara is that he's not really a writer, but a dutiful son carrying on the franchise started by his father, a real writer, who wrote one great book, The Killer Angels. That said, Gone For Soldiers is an adequate read, though certainly not on the par with Patrick O'Brian, Bernard Cornwell, or others of that genre. The dialogue is forced and the research is shoddy, and it really drags at many points. Also, the characters are not beleivable. If you want to read a truly well written book in the same general time frame, pick up Stephen Harrigan's Gates Of The Alamo or The Borderlands by Edwin Shrake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gone for Soldiers","review":"This book was excellent. The author's character development is great. The book lays the ground work for a rereading of the trilogy. Hopefully there is another book coming soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great \\"non-fictional\\" story","review":"I am interested in the forgotten wars of this great country of ours... America. I saw this book, and had to read it. While you read this book, you feel like you are there with Lee. As he steps off the boat at Vera Cruz, scouts for alternate routes to outflank Santa Ana, deals with his superiors... It is a great story, and I am glad I came across this book. Suggestion for the author: Please write one involving the War of 1812!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Spoonfeed Me, Give Me Something To Chew On","review":"As an enthusiastic reader of Shaara's past work I was excited to begin this one but found it soft and flat. I was constantly bothered by little unimportant words and phrases that should have been edited out while important questions, such as the whole San Patricio issue, were glossed over. I enjoyed the battle scenes, particularly Jackson's heroic and efficient working of his artillery and Grant's flanking maneuver, but it lacked the in-depth view into the character's heads and historical detail that I've come to expect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable, though not the author's best work","review":"I rate \\"Gone For Soldiers\\" slightly below the author's two previous works, \\"Gods & Generals\\" and \\"The Last Full Measure.\\" The narrative is a bit slow at times, but on balance, I found the book entertaining. The Mexican War has been a recent interest of mine, but I have been unable to find too many books on this subject. This book -- though a novel -- filled a void for me, and seemed to be reasonably accurate historically, based on the previous non-fiction books I've read on this era."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shaara and the Mexican - American War","review":"In this novel, Jeff Shaara takes us back a dozen or more years to the period when US forces invaded Mexico. Many of the main military leaders in the Civil War underwent their individual and collective baptism of fire in the Mexican-American war. Lee and Grant first show the promise that they would later legitimately claim, on a much more bloody battlefield, in this largely forgotten war. Shaara continues to tell a good story well and doesn't seem to have become \\"bored\\" (as happens with many writers) with the niche that he seems to have developed so nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Novel on a Forgotten Conflict","review":"Having covered the Civil War, Shaara turns his attention to the mexican War. He views it, like most historians, as a training ground for the commanders of the future conflict. The book follows both Winfield Scott and RE Lee with chapters devoted to Longstreet, Jackson , and Grant. The portrait of Lee highlights and enhances the Lee of the author's (and his father's ) Civil War novels. This book is a must for both historical fiction fans and history fans alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Not Finish It","review":"I entered the Mexican-American War with great expectations for the Shaara literary reputation and, after reading the account of the Siege of Vera Cruz, was unable to finish it. I even violated my own 100-page rule requiring me to give any book that chance before forming an opinion and making a go/no-go decision. If there is Shaara brilliance here I did not detect it. I had high hopes of filling in the prequel to the American Civil War but I became impatient with the stodgy, lifeless prose. Perhaps a duller account can be found. I don't know. It plays loose with the facts of the Siege of Vera Cruz and not once in all the prolonged bombardment of the walls of Vera Cruz did I feel the sand fleas biting at my face. I regret the $7.00 for the e-book. -----Jerry Persall"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gone For Soldiers","review":"The book is excellent if the reader is unaware of the history surrounding the Mexican War. I felt it was inferior to Gods and Generals, largely because some of the characters (especially Santa Anna and Scott) emerge as cartoon-like representations of themselves. Not horrible, but not quite what I had come to expect from the Shaaras."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is a good book but","review":"it doesn't hold a flame to the trilogy. This book sometimes seems like its just trying to pack as much stuff about Robert E Lee in it as possible, but I guess thats because he is basically the main character after Scott. The battles are interesting because if you don't read this book chances are you'll never learn about them in any history class, but it is interesting to see how bad Scott beat Santa Anna. i liked this book mainly because it has been my only introducting to the Mexican American War"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shaara Legacy Continues","review":"For those who have an interest in the American Civil War and in some of the more noted people who became involved in the conflict, will be able to see some of these people at the early stages when all fought on the same side. This \\"Prequil\\" to use the term is fitting for this book by Jeff Sharra. Gone For Soilders: A Novel of the Mexican War. Is a very insightful historical fiction. Though the story revolves more around Robert Lee, Jeff Sharra does introduce the reader to an early Sam Grant and James Longstreet.Like his father before him who's book Killer Angels brought to life again the battle of Gettysbugh as seen through the eyes of some of the people found in Gone For Soilders. The characters are well fleshed out and the story moves along well. It should help bring more people to read up on Pre-Civil War America and some of the men whos names are covered in this fine novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read but could have been better.","review":"Jeff Shaara's new novel''Gone for Soldiers'' is a great read but at the same time inferior to His two previous novels. This is partly because the Civil War is missing.Also with the exception of Winfield Scott who is masterfully portrayed here the other characters are not as fully developed as they might be. Robert E. Lee comes off like a teen-ager just out of West Point when in reality He was almost 40 and a twenty year veteran of the Corps of Engineers. Also some of the other characters simply cry out for more attention especially Grant, Longstreet, Beauregard, Pickett etc. But despite these criticisms this is a basically good novel and it has apparently led to some serious study of the Mexican war.An episode in our history that most Americans know very little about.I eagerly await Jeff Shaara's next novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Shaara triumph!","review":"Jeff Shaara has done his father proud again, and written a top of the line historical novel. He succeeds in taking many of the familiar figures from his and his father's Civil War novels to their first taste of war, this time against Mexico. Thrilling battle descriptions, thoughtful analysis of the main characters views and personalities, and accurate depictions of the politics surrounding Manifest Destiny make this account shine. One of the best aspects is how he makes the neglected contributions of Winfield Scott alive once again with his compelling testimony. More on Santa Ana would have been nice, but seeing it is a prequel, the focus is understandably around the American side."},{"rating":"1","title":"Franchise Literature, Ulysses: The Prequel","review":"I purchased this book believing it to be authored by the man who wrote the great \\"Killer Angels\\" and neeless to say I was very disappointed. I think \\"Gone...\\" is an example of what I like to call \\"franchise thinking\\": you take a good idea and through copying it or applying it to other things you drain the life out of it. Franchise thinking prevents any change or attempts at something new; why bother? We found a formula that works, lets beat it to death (Killer Angels WWII, anyone?) . While not exactly horrible, the book is offfensive because Shaara Jr is cranking out nepotistic retreads of his father's great book. Unfortunately, I'm sure there are enough middle-brow military buffs out there to keep him in business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"Jeff Shaara seems to be riding his father's coatails here more than ever. The historical detail is fine and good, but he has no knack for dialogue. All the characters--from Lee to Santa Anna--sound exactly the same: unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Regrettably glossy and superficial treatment of the subject. Neither the history nor biography provided anything of substance. Be content with the Civil War series and move on to something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritatingly Eccentric Writing Style","review":"I was certainly looking forward to reading Shaara's book, not having read his previous works. But the writing style was so off-putting and the dialogue so interchangeable that, frustrated, I gave up early in the game and didn't get a quarter into it. The introduction was so much better written than the narrative that I wish Shaara had written a nonfiction work about the period. Some sample eccentricities, of which the book is replete: \\"No one spoke, knew Scott did not require an answer.\\" \\"He shook his head, said, 'What the hell is the matter. . . .'\\" \\"Lee saluted, did not hesitate, followed Scott down the narrow passageway.\\" \\"Scott did not look at Lee, turned, said, 'We may proceed.'\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to the Future","review":"Very good historical fiction, as you might expect from Shaara. The fascinating aspect of the Mexican War for many people is the fact that the officers who fought together in Mexico ended up years later as bitter enemies in the Civil War. This carefully researched and easily read book delves into the personalities of many of these now and future warriors. With the hindsight of history, we look with sadness or anticipation at the interaction of these men with each other, knowing what lies ahead. In addition to a fascinating account of historic personalities, \\"Gone for Soldiers\\" clearly explains why the Mexican War occurred in the first place. I believe this important war has been given short shrift in the history books, but Shaara enlightens us on the whys, wherefores and especially the hows. Good, educational, enjoyable book."},{"rating":"2","title":"IF YOU LIKE THE HISTORICAL NOVEL, YOU WILL LIKE THIS ONE","review":"This is a excellent piece of work and well worth the read. It goes down easy, is fast moving and just simply fun. In my mind's eye, I had not imagined quite the personality traits of some of the individuals portrayed in this book, but they hey, I did not know them personally either. The story covered a period of time I feel has been quite neglected in our class rooms, therefore should be new territory for \\"non-history types.\\" If the book can stimulate further study in this area by interested individuals, then so much the better.

First of all, never bend to someone who says you aren't good enough, in whatever way that may be. Not being 'intellectual enough', she had to 'prove herself' and this is where it all went down. Secondly, a true Dom would never dominate if she/he did not have a true understanding and respect for BDSM, and love what it is all about.

The remaining 120 pages chronicle how her marriage comes to an end, she becomes financially destitute, and eventually finds some level of peace living alone in a trailer park.

At least in this movie, the repercussions manifest themselves in the lifetimes of the principal characters. The story resolution is much more believable (not to say digestable) than Lisa and the Devil.

After doing so the connection stays for about a day or so maximum and the same problem happens again.I spoke to Linksys tech support and they solved my problem by updating the firmware. The bad thing is that 2 days later the piece of crap started doing the same thing again.I also know several people that have had similar problems with this same exact model. Please do not purchase this product and go with a reliable company like d-link or netgear. I had a netgear router before this and it worked flawlessly. I had to \\"upgrade\\" to a wireless router because I bought a laptop, nintendo Wii, and a nintendo DS that requires wireless connection and Linksys routers are extremely unreliable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Linksys WRT54G Wireless-G Router","review":"The Wireless- G router by Linksys is an ideal machine I have one myself. I also purchased a wireless-G PCI card from Motorola. I am a student at Michigan State University but I purchased these items the summer before my freshman year. The reason I decided to purchase this product was so I could have my computer anywhere in my dorm room and not be limited to ten feet around the internet jack and also so if later I had purchased a lab top computer I could be on the internet anywhere in my room. Since I had purchased this product I have not been able to get it to work here up at State but I was able to make it work at home. I have called Motorola and Linksys about this problem but they blame each other for the error. The product works awesome when it is operational but up at school it just collects dust on the shelve.

Since I wasn't planning on using any third-party firmware, and wasn't planning to use the router for anything exotic, I thought the stock Linksys firmware would be adequate. It wasn't. The router crashed three times while I was clicking through the web admin tool, and (Linksys) firmware updates refused to work.I returned it for the WRT54GL model, and replaced that model's Linksys firmware with the third-party DD-WRT. Installation was painless, and the web admin tool is actually easier to use. I can't attest to the stability of the stock firmware on the L model, because I didn't keep it around long, but supposedly it's better than the firmware on the v5. If you're not looking to replace it with something from a third party, though, it might not be worth the trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless - no customer service support after \\"warranty is up\\"","review":"After this router stopped working all of a sudden, I called customer \\"support,\\" only to be told by them that they were going to charge me a minimum of $30 for troubleshooting the router, that my \\"warranty expired.\\" This is a ripoff so I will not ever buy another Linksys or Cisco product ever again. This is what is wrong with customer service in the United States. Nobody wants to work and they make junk. No wonder North America is falling so far behind other, much better, nations.

In order to avoid frequent freezes, I needed to limit no more than 3 download tasks and global network connections to be less than 100 in order to not-freeze so frequently, but it was very slow.My advice is, if you only use this router for simple internet browsing, then WRT54GSv5 will be probably fine, but once you need to add some real works such like P2P download, then avoid this particular router/version."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"Linksys is the easiest and best wireless router around.

That's amazing, because the router it replaced was junk and would reset itself... every three seconds... so I couldn't actually use the internet. I like that it works. Oh, except I don't like how 8 feet away from it, my signal strength is 90%. I think that's odd, but then again, I can still use it from any room in the apartment without a problem.I am not sure how important the antenna angles are, but I keep them pointed up like in the picture. The router doesn't get too hot, and I never give it a second thought. I just wish I could set it on its side with a stand to take up less space, but then the antennas would not work how I imagine they do now.

This was a replacement device for an earlier linksys router version that died. The Linksys power adapters seem to fail every couple of years so I have seen several generations of linksys routers but this WRT54GS is the most unreliable linksys I have had, failing around twice per week. It is in the same location and setup as the previous one and I use two different linksys routers on different networks here. I am running the latest version(7) and the latest firmware (v7.50.2) so there are no easy fixes yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mac is not well supported","review":"I think maybe I'm having a bad experience with WRT54GS because I'm using both XP and OS X. Every other day, the router stop responding, then I can't even connect to the router until I reset it.I upgraded the firmware to the latest, 1.50.9 released 10/1/06. It worked fine for a couple of weeks, then my mac mini couldn't get any DHCP assigned, even it was connected with Ethernet. This is a known problem, but Linksys hasn't been updated their firmware, and the user can't download older version of firmware from their site.I didn't see Apple OS X as one of supported OS, so I guess it's not a Linksys' fault. But if you're using an OS X, you should avoid this router."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!

My wired and wireless interfaces were easy to configure and I was up and running in minutes. I never even used the included software. I am amazed at how fast websites load, not only on my laptop but also on my wired desktop. They have improved the firewall features. I checked the \\"stealth\\" aspect of the firewall and found it to be totally \\"stealth\\"; something I didn't quite achieve with the previous router. They even added parental control. I haven't experimented with it yet, but plan to shortly. The only thing I had to do when I replaced routers (which is in their documentation if you choose to read it) was to reset my cable modem. I didn't do it at first, but quickly overcame the problem.

So in a fit of desperation (and $30 later after buying an ethernet switch to do the job this thing was supposed to do) I put it on the lone PC in the network - ran the CD-ROM- and it failed at the last step - repeatedly. Again, tech support was on vacation when I called in.On the bright side, my compliments to Amazon for taking this lemon's return.

After wasting two days trying to get it configured so that it would work with two laptops and two desktops, with security enabled, I gave up and switched brands to the D-Link DI-634M. At various times I got the Linksys working with each of the computers, but then when I would get another one set up, the previous one might become unreliable. The last straw was when my newest laptop would connect to the WRT54GS router and then lose its connection and reconnect repeatedly, at some regular interval between five and ten seconds, like clockwork. If you're lucky, it is conceivable that this unreliable box could work for you, but I've had much better luck (and good speed and coverage) after switching to the D-Link."},{"rating":"2","title":"Linksys WRT545GS Router","review":"This router comes with a (PC) set up CD that set the router up perfectly.

I tried for about 6 hours, running through every set of troubleshooting instructions I could find. I finally gave up completely and returned the router.Now, even though I uninstalled the Linksys software - the wireless settings on my laptop get changed about 3 minutes after I boot up, preventing me from connecting to my current network. The only software I have installed is Linksys install - so it is clear that there is something still resident in my system that is rendering my laptop incapable of connecting to any wireless network."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parental control was important to me","review":"After some help from the tech desk, this thing works very well.

The new version of the router has easy-to-use access to built-in firewalls and other tools to limit wireless access. I'm using this with an updated PCMCIA card (also Linksys) without any issues - very fast, much faster than the old 802.11b.

They asked that I go to their website to download the appropriate Firmware and when I went to their website, I found that version 5, which is what was required, wasn't available yet. I called back & let them know this, they checked and agreed that they had a product on the market that was not supported by the correct software. Their own tech people told me to take the product back and look for an older version. Not very comforting for a company the size of Cisco. Faulty product and untruthful advertising.

After being on hold twice for over 30 minutes I took Lnksys up on their internet offer to get an RMA. But the internet form would not accept my case number indicating it was not valid.

I also had problems in connecting between a computer that was wired into the router and a computer that connected wirelessly. Ultimately, after moving, the signal strength was simply too insufficient to create a reliable connection and I opted to run wires.

The configuration is clean and clear, even better than the last Linksys router I used.Particularly nice was that when entering a list of MAC addresses for restricting access to wireless, it presented a prefilled list based on what it sniffed from the nearby aether, so I did not need to work out my laptop's MAC address on my own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Linksys Wireless Router","review":"This router was easy to install and it worked the very first time I installed it.

I would have rated it five stars, except that the setup was frustrating - we renamed the router and yet it named it differently after we completed the setup screens. Also, the setup has multiple tabs; sometimes the info from one tab is called something different in the other tabs which is confusing. Thus, a task that should have been easy -- such as changing the password from the default -- involved searching the internet for directions.

However, I chose to get this as an audio book. What a mistake! Sorry, Lee Meriwether, but not all men sound like they are 75 year olds from the South. The storyline was extremely difficult to follow, as I spent so much of my energy trying to separate the voice from the character. Also, the abridged version of the story was a major disappointment! Much of the storyline was omitted and the ending seemed choppy. Many of the details that might help readers become engrossed in the book were left out. How unfortunate. I almost want to also buy the hardcover book and read it myself to reinstate my faith in Mr. Saul. Oh, well, better luck next time"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reviewing \\"The Presence\\"","review":"I enjoyed this book a lot. I love John Saul's writing. His creativity and style surpass others. He is my favorite next to Dean Koontz. I liked this book for many reasons. For one, I liked the development of characters. His setting was perfect also, he placed a horror/suspense story in the tropical paradise of Maui! This book was very imaginative and is unique in his writing and others. I took one star off because of how slow the reading was for me, personally. It took me a while to get into the book. At the beginning of the book, the foreshadowing stories were awesome. I also was very indulged into the book because of the ties that were placed in the novel between archeology, anthropology, and even \\"strange-alien pods\\" under the sea. I loved the book, I'd read it again, Saul has a way of placing you in the novel as if you are there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time","review":"The hook has promise. Geological and archeological references. some tech, a vulnerable young man, a mothers unconditional love and even rekindled romance. But the author puts nothing together and the read is a struggle. Good writing intertwines the elements but Saul seems to hit points in his story board, dumps it on you then goes onto the next one and the book ending is a perfect example of this. Frequently he just keeps you in the dark which can be ok to a point but in this case he has to add an epilogue just to let you know about what he was writing about. And what's up with the title. Presence implies spirituality and Saul's premise is organic. Not worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Presence","review":"Under beautiful Hawaiian beaches, danger is lurking below for scuba divers. One of Hawaii's wealthiest citizens is trying to achieve his goal by putting the lives of teenagers in jeopardy.

Will she will be able to save her own son's life? The beach bum hacks into Yoshihara's elaborate computer system and sees what an evil man he is. Love finally seeps in toward the ending to make this story palatable. Not one of John Saul's best books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateurish and ludicrous","review":"This was a ridiculous and amateurish novel. This is my first John Saul book and will definitely be my last. Failing to be scary, thought-provoking, interesting, or even plausible, this book is a laughable attempt by Saul to move into science fiction. With only the knowledge of ninth grade biology class, I would be able to disprove nearly every scientific speculation in this sorry excuse for a book. Saul also neglected to include any of the basics of writing in The Presence, ie character, suspense, plot,etc. if you want science fiction/ suspense, try reading Michael Crichton or Robin Cook, not this wannabe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get into it","review":"I own every book written by John Saul and have thouroughly enjoyed them but The Presence was hard to follow. As a matter of fact, I was never able to force myself to finish it. Needless to say it was very disappointing. Not up to his normal excellence."},{"rating":"1","title":"not too well thought out","review":"As far as suspensful, horror stories go, this one just tried to do too much. Too many story lines created too many perspectives, and by the end, when Saul tried to tie them together, it just never gelled. The villains were one dimensional, and the twists were a bit forced to say the least.This was my first John Saul novel, and I can't say that I would try another by him unless I was really desparate. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho Hum.","review":"Not one of the better books I've read from John Saul. It wasn't that scary and the book bogged down in parts.

Someone should remove the exclamation key from his keyboard, as he uses it constantly. (I was reminded of Elaine's editor on Seinfeld, who would have had a field day with this book.) The term \\"the presence\\" never appears in the book. How strange. How insulting!! How can I inappropriately use more exclamation marks to thoroughly trash this piece of dreck?!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"John Saul should be ashamed of himself for this dreck!","review":"This book reeks of contract obligation. What point he may be trying to make is totally lost in the mush of the the first 400 pages and made only more confusing by the amateurish, hasty and totally implausable last 20 pages.

The summary of the book makes it sound so interesting, the archaelogist, hawaii, etc. I was terribly let down by this book. I read as much as I could and only made it to page 70 when I gave up. By then it was going nowhere. Just about a boy who was getting bullied around, and a woman inspecting some bones found beside an inactive volcano in hawaii. Where is the chill? where is the supsense?

The phone has external speakers that have too low of a volume to use while driving.

With this amp you can put it in the passenger seat and hear directions loud and clear. You do not need to strain your ears to hear it either.It also does a great job with MP3 players. It is loud enough that you can have the volume set to half and still get great sound. The speakers are to close together to hear stereo without ear plugs, but that is not why I bought it.It has a internal battery that needs to be charged after about 8 hours of use. It does have a power button to save power when not in use.

They toned down the wildness that was seen in their previous album.Which is good. Don't worry,these guys still have a 'party-like-there's-no-tomorrow' style in their songs,but the songs are a little more mature than Knuckles Up and Skillet. This is still a wonderful,punk rock (or what I like to call 56...speed rock) album. 'City On a Hill' and 'Jungle of the Midwest Sea' are the some of the best in this CD.

From X-men's long history you'd think they could do a few better like the Shadow King or Apocalypse, but no, just a droid with lasers, whoop-de-doo. Sentinel A is cool, but Dark Phoenix and Psylocke are just rehashed versions of Betsy and regular Phoenix, I think they just got lazy.

Synchromesh is getting harder to find these days (rumors are that Pennzoil, Delco, and others don't make it anymore) and it costs about the same as Royal Purple.

Also the to fire the PPC you shouldn't have to hold the butten to let them recycle, you should be able to fire right away.(this feature should really be for the bombast laser).

It has a really good storyline, but the only really interesting events are when you get a couple of mechs after you at one time. It doesn't really involve a lot of strategy.

Especially if that mission took you over half an hour to get that far. No checkpoints. Sorry, but HALO got me quite used to them. It goes on from there. After all the anticipation, I'm so disgusted I can't see straight. I'm going to list mine on eBay to sell it as soon as I'm done with this review. Save your money and try to find it used.

In most missions you can't even choose which mech to go into battle with. Phantom Crash might be a better choice for those of you out there that enjoy a little more freedom in gameplay.

The controls resemble those of Halo, except you're playing from the 3rd person rather than the 1st person.

Beginning in January 2003, there will be a rather large volume of downloadable additional content made available, and it is expected to be free content. This means more maps, more mechs, and more multi-player game types. Without Xbox Live, you will be unable to access this extra content.

Mech Assult is no where near what the original PC game was and is a total disappointment.I have found that a lot of games that are supposed to be so great on the XBox are a disappointment when compared to the older PC and Play Station-1 games.

If you have played Mech Warrior or BattleTech, you will really enjoy the game. It is a literal \\"BLAST\\". If you grew up with the PC versions of the game there are some substantial differences. You live your life in the third party world controlling your mech through a multitude of challenging missions. The true differences from PC to Xbox are there is little to no Mech-Management. You are now the pilot and the focus is the mission, not the Mech. Graphics are fantastic. Buildings explode and then crumble. Mechs suffer, and catastrophically explode. If you have migrated from the PC to the Xbox, the controls are a different (no mouse, no joystick). It takes a very short time to master the controls.I have had a lot of fun with this game and can not wait to go Live. For me it is a must buy, and the first game I picked up. I hope there is more to come for the Mech Warrior fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"mech assault","review":"this is a fun game if your inti the mechs the graphics are good but like the first halo game type the difficulty level are weak to easy to kill stuff but expert setting there only like 7 mechs and then varients of those ones that just have differnet weapons loadout the multiplayer is good but not great"},{"rating":"2","title":"great game","review":"This is one of the best games on xbox.

This was first published in 1957 and again in 1967 and is now out of print which is a real shame as this is some of the best nature writing we have. This is the story of his travels from coast to coast through the American winter. The author's prose is wonderful, his observations acute. Actually, so much of what the author observed in the early and mid 1950s is no longer with us. I was lucky to be around at that time I suppose, in a way, as I too remember many of the things the author points out. On the other hand, it saddens me that they no longer exsist.

The cards can't be scanned easily and often take about 10 tries to make it actually work. The Pokemon cards you scan through only gives you info you already have on the card and the Animal Crossing cards are useless if you don't have a Gamecube. Manhole stinks because it is no fun. And yes it does work on the GBA SP, some people say it doesn't, but I guess they just don't have an SP or used it on their Gamecube without one of those link cables. So, you either can't play something, can't play something fun, or look at information that you can get by looking at the stupid card.

While sex holds the couple together, in their first \\"encounter\\" somehow I knew how Farley was dressed as he enters her room. But somehow I didn't pick up on the garb that Zoe was wearing until deep into the interaction. He seemsclumsy at times and she pushes too hard to stay up with him, even though her heart won't admit there is at least sexual love. Even the end seems a bit contrived, when one finally reaches it.

I also continue to use FP for basic stuff, especially when I need straight HTML programming.I've gone to MS website and read some of the tutorials, checked out their forum, etc. But it seems as if MS wants me to buy all these add-on's (like Adobe does) to get the program to do what it should already do.

Instead I get bread close to burned at the bottom and untoasted at the top, and the warming setting is useless.

The worst monster is the Leech Man, and he is a pain in the arse, he killed me more then anything, because you have to throw dumb burning wine bottles at him, and mostly miss and he runs at you, and it's hard to get distance so you can deploy a burn bottle, he's a jerk, other then him, the whole game is fun.

You're thrust into a world surrounded by zombies and low on ammunition. The survival horror aspect of the game is flawless, and no other series can rival the Resident Evil series in this respect. Yet, flaws such as tedious puzzles and awkward control which have plagued other Resident Evil games, affect this one as well. Difficulty in turning corners can cause numerous frustrating deaths, and most puzzles feel as if they're the same puzzle as the one you just completed, only with a slight superficial twist.Resident Evil Zero is still a great game though, and anyone who has enjoyed the other games in the series, or just likes a good adventure should p ick up Resident Evil Zero."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true Great Resident Evil","review":"It's RE and it's fun. nuff said.

They'res giant bugs like a 50 foot high caterpillar, and a 50 foot long scorpion.; I HATE this game. Where in the world would there be a giant caterpillar in a mansion? Final thoughts: Boring, slow, STUPID. IF YOU ALREADY HAVE THE FIRST ONE, GET EITHER RESIDENT EVIL 22 OR 3 FOR GAMECUBE, or if you dont have the first, get the first. its awesome. RE1 makes this game look like animal crossing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameful","review":"Resident Evil Zero did not live up to its hype. Graphic wise I think its great but gameplay can get boring at times. Some parts meay leave you stuck looking for puzzle answers instead of having some action. If you haven't played any Resident Evil game or Eternal Darkness then I suggest that you play ED first before playing RE0 just so you could appreciate a good game. - Another note, when you don't make use of bullets effieciently the game is pretty much over, while on the other hand in ED you can always use magic, swords, maces ect."},{"rating":"2","title":"peed my pants way more then once","review":"I will start off by telling you Resident Evil one this aint! Zero is very similiar to its predecssor in many ways except for that the scare factor has gone down.....meaning its still really scary just not as scary as the first re.Gameplay wise this game rocks the house, and you do get some some pretty bad weapons.It is a pretty short game but c'mon you cant resist Rebeccas cute face!"},{"rating":"2","title":"La de da","review":"I don't know what those people who reviewed this game wrongly are thinking. This game doesn't have storage boxes because it's on a train. it's not like your going to set something down and never be back in that area. it's a freaking train! back and forth is where you go. the prequel to this series has great graphics and its the prequel to the best horror series of games ever. the graphics alone make this game ten times scarier then the games that came out before. it's just great fun that defenitally deserves these five great stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Capcom has done it again!","review":"This is the best of all the RE's. I am a big fan of these games. The ability to switch characters was the best feature of the game. The graphics were astonishing + it scares you like h**l. The monsters are better than ever. Thats right very few zombies and more leaches. I reccomend this game to everyone who is fan of RE."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best prequels around!","review":"This game is awesome, I got a gamecube just so i could play it. It's great that you can leave items wherever you want and exchange them between characters. The switching characters part is also great. Sometimes these two features can be annoying, but most of the time, it's fun. It's also easier to kill a lot of the bosses in this game, which makes sense once you think about the storyline of all Resident Evil games. You also get to play a bonus \\"leech hunter\\" game once you win. The graphics and sound are flawless. This game is a must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A step up in excitement ! !","review":"Tess gets back to LA and immediatelly has a conflict with her nemesis in the FBI. From there she goes on to have second thoughts about her relationship with Abby, a \\"security consultant\\" with whom she had worked in the past. There's no need to go into the story (don't want to ruin it for you) except to say that Prescott certainly ratcheted this one up a notch from the last in the McCallum series. The story is well told and has a bad guy you can hate (along with some of his friends). Plus, Abby is a little more understated here which gives more credibility to her capabilities. I know these are a few years old by now, but they hold up over time with a good story and writing that is excellent. This is a great read and, in places, a real page-turner.

Private Operative, Abby Sinclair, and FBI special agent, Tess McCallum, are thrown into the same case but from different angles. The story, which begins as hunt for a congressman's alleged \\"stalker\\" and expands into something more sinister, is wonderfully paced and takes numerous unexpected turns. Prescott creates a vivid, at times seedy, world that left this reader constantly guessing.As expected, Prescott has delivered another intelligent thriller with memorable characters and a cleverly layered plot.

To me, this is the sign of a lazy novelist. Masters of the genre such as Connelley, Lescroart, Burke, etc., work very hard at creating credible characters and credible plots and don't rely on cheap tricks or gimmicks. This book is predictible from page one, the characters are one-dimensional, the plot is ludicrous and this is my first and last Michael Prescott book."},{"rating":"2","title":"sounds fun!!","review":"i have not played the game yet but it sounds super great!!!i very much want it,but my parents will not buy it and i have no money buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuutttttt, i could save up!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!!!","review":"I have not played this game,but looking at the screenshots it looks like yet another sidescroller.Sidescrollers,other than crazy drake are (bad)."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"i got it for13 dollers and its not worth it,bad graphics,bad story,bad and hard controls,and finaly this game is boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!p.s. it s boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Possible for Adults to Enjoy along with their kids!!","review":"What a great gameboy advance game for kids AND adults.

There are many intriguing levels to get Kim through and they are each unique. It is challenging and fun at the same time. We take this one wherever we go and it has saved alot of otherwise boring moments, like waiting in offices, or being in traffic jams, ALOT more bearable. For my young readers of this review, ask your parents to get this one for you if you love Kim Possible on Disney Channel, you will really enjoy this gameboy advance game.

A little research on Amazon led me to this beautiful album and de Moraes works. The arrangements range from techno Brazilian to more traditional sounding acoustic...all of which are superb. I highly recommend this album to anyone remotely interested in the seemingly bottomless pit of outstanding works coming out of today's Brazil. -Jim"},{"rating":"1","title":"is this the 1970s?","review":"picked this up...big mistake...very dated and old sounding.

Vinicius de Moraes' music composed with other masters.2). The Electronica elements that enhance these Bossa Nova gems are very elegant,very well used, never overused and superb.and perhaps the most important highlight here is...3). Paula's angelical voice ! W O W !.So, putting those three ingredients together, you have an awesome album. Two great guests on this album are: Celso Fonseca on guitars and vocals, and Paula's husband Jacques Morelenbaum on cello.The stand-out cuts in this album are:- O Nosso Amor- Insensatezand..- Brigas Nunca Mais.If you love Bossa Nova/ Brazilian Jazz, and appreciate great vocals; this is for you by-design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good support.","review":"I've had this throne for some time now and it feels great comapared to alot of other thrones that I have had.

Don't buy it. Don't even rent it. I rented it and I wished I hadn't. This game is so bad. Myabe it isn't bad for some other gaming systems, but for GameCube it is bad. I like to play any game with the control stick on the controller. I don't know anyone who prefers the little plus-sign directional pad over a control stick. Well, if you plan on jumping at all (which is necessary to any fighting game) don't plan on using the control stick. For some reason, some programmer thought it would be a good idea to make the stick useless and go back to the old school directional pad. Dumb idea.It was also very stupid for them to put the moves in the pause menu. This is a pain. Overall, there are much better fighter games. I am not into fighter games but I wanted to try this one because it was X-Men. Well, except for the obvious license. This could have very well be any other generic fighting game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Man...","review":"I wanted to like this game; I really did. I love the X-Men series and love my Gamecube. However, this game wasn't even good enough for me to convince myself that I could pretend to enjoy it. It's simply a bad game.The controls are incredibly awkward, first of all. Even on the easiest setting, it was so clunky that I couldn't figure out how to put together any type of offense. Despite my frustrations, I really tried to get a feel for the controls. Sadly, it never happened.The game's only redeeming quality is the roster of X-Men it contains. I'm a huge fan of Gambit and Beast, and after not seeing them in the first two X-Men movies, I was excited about their inclusion in this game. It's just too bad that the game wasn't worthy of them.Definitely rent this before you buy it. Don't waste your money like I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"one word...AWESOME!","review":"OK, this is an awesome game. It's pure X-Men action. With 24 X-Men to play as, including Cyclops, Wolverine, Gambit, Havok, two Setinals, Bastion, Pheonix, Dark Pheonix,Rouge, Beast, Magneto, Toad, Mystique, Blob, Sabertooth, and many, many more, along with great fighting stages, it will definatly keep you hooked. However, you will find story mode to be really difficult, because you play as Forge alot, and he really sucks, plus when ever you punch or deliver a good move, they ALWAYS block it. Game play can be a little chopy at times, but it's still worth it. It can take a while to unlock characters and costumes, but the more reason for you to buy it:the challenge. So go, now, buy this game! You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"X-Men: Next Dimension Review By Mike","review":"This Game is a must for X - Men fanatics.

It's real bad. I have been playing beach volleyball for 10 year (Miami Beach). It dose not come close at all to the real thing. It only has the concept of the game. I can put it this simple; it's so bad that it does not have and out of bound line. There is no tourney just pick up games.. It's that simple. Way to easy, 2 buttons control the whole game all u can do is spike and dink o and handset. No cuts shot or deep shots. The girls only talk in Chinese with translation line in the bottom. I could not find a way to make them speak English. Well enough trashing. Lets look at one and I mean one good thing, the graphics are awesome.

I have to admit that I really like the volleyball action, it can get intense after the first week of the two week vacation. Winning all that money at the end of a victory can be fun, going shopping when I'm not playing a match and buying presents to the other gals in the game. The option that I really liked the best was being able to play your own music tracks by copying them onto the XBOX, instead of listening to the same old pop music already in the game. I didn't really like the casino too much because I lose alot of my hard earned money. Other than that this game is a must for anybody even for females because of the girly things to do.

This game, as advertised, only serves as eye-candy for perverts and a waste of money for gamers everywhere (much like the XBox system itself). Now, don't get me wrong, there are definitely some good things about this game. The disc makes a nice frisbee and I'm sure there are some great posters out there, but beyond that, it does little in the way of providing a good gaming experience. But then again, so little of the XBox games do, anyway. I suppose \\"Panzer Dragoon Orta\\" will probably be their one and only breakthrough, but beyond that, they have little to offer and will thus go the way of the Sega Dreamcast. There is one truly great thing about the XBox, though: it makes a truly excellent doorstop.

The casino is incredibly boring. The graphics are nice, but so what? How long can you look at cartoons in bikinis? The HUGEST, most GLARING failure of this game is that there are NO character endings, i.e., there is no goal to achieve in this game.

In my opinion, it's pretty cool for what it is. This game is like Sega's Virtua Tennis, except that's it's volleyball and with characters from Dead or Alive. Basically, it's very easy to play but not very deep compared to games like NFL2K3 or FIFA. Graphically, the game is amazing. The music is very good and you can make your own custom soundtracks ala the Xbox hard drive. The Dennis Rodman voice-thing kinda turned me off, but you can change that in-game. Don't think you can change that for the movies though. In any case, if you like games like Virtua Tennis, you'll like this game.

Great graphics.However, what I really expected from this game was not just spectacular (and sexy) graphics, but a killer game engine that would overshadow other Beach Volleyball games (on any system), just like Dead or Alive 3 had excellent gameplay for a fighting game (and spectacular graphics). Unfortunately, this is not the case. The gameplay comes down to pretty much push one of two buttons. Even the camera isn't up to the task. More than once did I have to dive for the ball off screen...If you are a fan of the characters: Get the game.

Everything in this game after the graphics was very dissapointing. The name of this game shoudl have been Dead or Alive dress-up. It appears the only goal in this game was to dress up you or your partner and the volleyball is just a mini-game to acheive that goal. Volleyball.. not fun. For a franchise that has multiple combo hits and kicks as well as reversals this game is extremely simple, I expected more. Also the camera angles didn't help. For some reason it doesn't give you a complete view of the court. Meaning there were times I had no idea where my character was.

However, this was perhaps the worst thing I have ever played. Basically, I started jumping on little pads in the game to earn money. Once I did that for 10 minutes, I went to the casino. I bet all my money and ended up winning it all back, and then some. I went to the store, bought the thong thingy, and that was it. I accomplished what the game basically was asking. i beat it in approximately 15 minutes. I tried playing vollyboll. horrible.

It turns out that it is 2 player game and you control 2 girls at the same time with each analog thumb thingy. The camera angle only shows 2 to 3 girls at a time so you can hardly play and it scrolls to the other side of the net with the ball.

You get only an angled view and it is annoying to try and get your girl into place on the court. Most importantly, the game play [is poor]. You serve it and then have a short rally until someone spikes it and wins the point. There is not a whole lot of strategy as you just keep spiking it until the other person can't return it.

Well I was wrong, I was tortured the first few levels and then only somewhat amused when the switch happened.

You don't even need a second human player! Cool!The only downside is that LucasArts had a hard time transferring the controls over from the keyboard to the Gamecube controller.

The cd of how to play like van halen is a complete joke. First of all, the tone stinks and does not sound like van halen of any era. Second, the riffs and licks are not challenging and certainly won't give you much insight into how to play like van halen.

They are monophonic. After thorough re-mastering many of them still show their age. However, despite some technical flaws, this albumcontains many well known standards, that made Cavallaro famous.Performance of \\"Brasil\\" or \\"Dancing in the Dark',\\"Carioca\\" played by33 year old pianist show his improvisational skills and unmatchedvirtuosity as well as his characteristic ornate style. On many of these recordings Cavallaro and his band play as instrumental accompaniment for Bing Crosby , Dick Haynes or Andrews Sisters where Cavallaro remains in the background. All recordings remain a great gift to all Cavallaro admirers bringing back a flavorof an era of big bands and unforgettable piano soloists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good buy","review":"The case did not close properly and scratched the phone.

Scanned a few slides, then came back to in a month later. The unit would not load or unload slides. It made all sorts of grinding noises. Minolta fixed it under warranty. When they shipped it back, it had a damaged face plate. I stupidly did not bother to call them back and demand it to be fixed again. I did not care about minor cosmetic damage to the face plate. I subsequently scanned over 500 slides with it with good results. I did not use if for several months, and now the unit is dead. Won't load or eject the film holder. Now Minotla claims it is damaged and not under warranty. Before you buy this unit, look for others will similar repair problems. I wish I did before I bought this scanner.

I've not produced a single usable scan yet. Most of the time my scanner has been in transit between my house and Minolta's Technical Service. The scans have fine parallel streaks that show up on large prints. After I posted the resulting scans on a photographer's discussion list I got e-mail from many other people who had problems with Minolta scanners. It looks like this product has a very poor quality control. After three repair attempts Minolta agreed to replace my scanner. Today they went back on their word. Someone from their service department called and told me my scanner is \\"as per factory specifications\\" and that the streaks \\"can only be seen at high magnifications\\" - as if that was not the whole point of buying a dedicated film scanner. My advice: get a Nikon. You don't want to deal with jerks."},{"rating":"1","title":"worked great when it worked","review":"I was greatly dissapointed in this scanner.

There's a bibliography but where did he get the information for his most 'profound' statements? This is an interesting story but when an author claims to know the intentions of people 2000 years ago he needs to clearly state his sources. Whoever claims that this book seals the deal for them is a person who read this book 'wanting' the 'answers' in this book.I read this book with an open mind and finished with pages of questions that were raised and not answered. Now I'm rereading it and trying to find and read the books in the bibliography and find out who the authors are and what their agenda was. Everyone has an agenda.This book is may be a starting point for the quest for truth but should not be an ending point.

On the old NES, there was hardly a better game, and I spend hundreds of hours on each one, fighting, shooting, blowing stuff up. I was so excited for this one I could hardly stand it, and I didn't care if it was 2-D. In fact, I WANTED the game to be exactly the same as the old ones. I bought the game, put it in, and started to play.Then I got bored. Fast. I couldn't believe it. I played for about 20 minutes and couldn't take it anymore. I shot some stuff, but it just wasn't fun. One of two things happened. Either this game is horrible compared to the old games, or I just plain grew out of Contra. I hope it's the former.This game is hard, but in a frustrating way.

It really doesn't take much to make a game, Shattered Soldiers is all glorious artwork, tight controls, music, and stage progression. The plot was a yawn, but Contra never was plot driven, I felt like I was fighting for my life, and perpetually dodging a hail storm of bullets. I would rank the difficulty as being similar to Rockman 1 (Megaman), and you basically can't afford to throw your lives at bosses like kindle.Wicked"},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy sequel","review":"Contra: Shattered Soldier is a 2D \\"run and gun\\" shooter for the Playstation 2 reminiscent of games like Rush 'n Attack, Elevator Action, Mega Man, etc. Compared to the better games of the Contra series, it holds its own. A unique twist that distinguishes this edition from its predecessors is the ability to switch between 3 different weapons on the fly instead of picking up power ups. There is also a special weapon that shoots in all directions that you can use by holding down circle, but it is not very effective. All in all, a fun game, and worthy of including in any list of Contra games worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Contra Fans Only","review":"Long has it been since I've seen a game like this. Back When I was a small child, my favorite video games were ones like Super C for NES and Contra III: Alien Wars for the super nintendo. Both were hardcore action games. The feeling of being overwhelmed by enemies and battling supremely challenging foes was an intoxicating experience.Now comes Contra: Shattered Soldier, reviving the nostalgia of impossibly difficult combat action. I would imagine only old-school Contra fans would enjoy this title, because it's so difficult, has very simplistic gameplay, and the overall genre of an action-arcade shooter.My only complaint is that it is alittle too short, but other then that, its a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contra: Shattered Soldier","review":"I was somewhat disappointed when I bought this game. After hearing that this was one of the more difficult games for PS2, I expected a very fast, exciting, and well developed game. Contra is not that kind of game. If I wanted a 2D game, I could have gotten a SNES game. The only movements you can make are forward, back, jump, crouch. What a waste of PS2's graphic power. The gameplay is anything but entertaining. Basically, you play the mission until you come to something you have never seen before. It kills you. You restart the mission and kill it. This cycle goes on for the rest of the mission."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is so BAD","review":"This game was one of the worst I've ever played.

It basically takes you through examples of deploying servlet, JSP, Stateless and Stateful session beans, BMP and CMP Entity beans, and Message-driven beans together with some ancillary technologies such as JTA.Good as far as it goes, except that it focusses far too much on the generic rather than the specific issues of using these on Weblogic, which is why people will be buying this book!The unforgiveible thing about this book is twofold. The examples are filled with mistakes, and the publisher has no complaint or erratta mechanism at all. They have a 'contact Sams' link on their website but as far as I can tell it's for the order department! Mistakes are forgivable in any book given that there is a reasonably speedy mechanism for getting corrections out, but Sams seems to believe that the transaction ends once they have your money.

Its recipes are just regular plain, not the best recipes at all. I own a lot of other Cajun cookbooks and all of their recipes are better than the ones of this Top 100 Cajun Recipes of All Times.

We both think that it is a great workout, and perfect for an introduction to yoga. It's a tough workout, but Brian encourages you to practice at your own pace.

What a deal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Set - I Now Live for Yoga","review":"What can I say. Blend a handsome yoga guru, challenging poses, beautiful people and what do you have, a winning combination. I have never worked so hard at yoga in my life, until I practiced with this set of tapes. Bryan is an excellent teacher who really knows his stuff. At first, when I was reviewing the tapes I was a bit ovewhelmed about doing the poses. To my suprise, I'm more flexible than I thought I would be. With his motivational techniques and encouraging wisdom, Bryan really brings out the best in one's yoga performance.

It's wonderfulto have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bryan Kest's Power Yoga Series","review":"I liked this series very much.

I had never tried yoga before this dvd, but I'm very glad I started with this one. Bryan Kest's Power Yoga is an intense workout that will definitely leave you feeling like you've worked hard. After two days, my whole body was sore, but in a good way. It targeted muscles that my usual kickboxing workouts never reached, and this dvd is definitely capable of making you sweat. I've tried various other yoga dvd's since starting with this one, and this one is still my favorite. The other dvd's just don't make me feed like I'm working quite as much as this one. This workout can also be worked on many levels. By that I mean that anyone can do the poses in this dvd because you only do them to your level of ability, and you can always push yourself farther. So you never completely master a workout.

He explains and demonstrates each pose well, with minimal confusion or guessing. The workout is challenging but easy to adapt to any skill/experience level. He's a little geeky/dorky, but that gives the video \\"real life\\" quality that's easy to relate to (if you're a dork, too! hee). Actually, I really like his philosophy about yoga and about challenging ourselves as individuals, taking the \\"competitive\\" and \\"perfection\\" vibes out of yoga, which turns me off of many videos and classes. In short, a good workout that doesn't get boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bryan Kest power yoga","review":"This is a great CD. Bryan is engaging. At first I was put off because their is a lot of talking and ego stroking happening at the front. But once you get into the workout, it's great. I like the style of it being taught in a class with him moving about. There's an attempt at being arty that kind of bugged me at first, but then I realized it's from LA so of course it would be like that.If you have a clue about a yoga practices this is a great choice with 3 works or combined 90 minute. As I mentioned Bryan grows on you and actually becomes very soothing and someone what sexy as in he is differently connecting honestly with his audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 routines of good, solid yoga","review":"I was curious to see what Kest's \\"Power Yoga\\" was all about, and there is nothing too new here for anyone who has been to a bunch of yoga classes. These are primarily standard vinyasa moves, with a couple of minor modifications (such as Kest's optional push up in between updog and downdog). The best thing about this video is that it contains 3 complete routines, which are each different from one another, yet all are very much the in the same style. Kest's Power Yoga seems to put a bit more emphasis on aerobic moves and breathing, and less on complicated stretches. It is a good program. It seems that some people like poking fun at Kest's shirtless torso or rock star hair - well how about his husky voice and what seems to be a Massachusetts accent? Just kidding - he leads a good class, and if you do yoga at home from time to time (a real class is always better), you won't regret this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout, ignore the self indulgence","review":"This is a great workout! I have had low back problems and it really stretches me out. The videos contain some of the best stretches I have ever done. My flexibility is dramatically improved.I will admit that Bryan Kest can be pretty annoying. The long hair, the cutoff blue jeans, and the shirtless look are a little too hip for me. After watching him handle his female students I wouldn't want my wife or daughters in the classroom with him. Just focus on the exercises and you'll get a very challenging workout that will stretch and tone you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yoga with Yanni or Fabulous (?)","review":"The Yoga workout is just dandy. I can't use it because this guy is too much. Can't listen to him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too fast and not enough explanation!!","review":"Power Yoga is great, it is the up-beat i guess you would call it of yoga. Its almost the exact opposite of what you would expect of yoga to be.I bought this because of the fairly decent reviews and i was very disappointed to say the least. They do not show or explain every position enough and it gets extremely confusing when there are more than one person in a room and trying to do a position.Also everything starts to move too fast way too soon leading you to get irritated instead of relaxing you and helping you meditate.This is going out on my next yard sale maybe someone else likes Kest yoga style and teaching not me though!!I would not recommend this or any of his other DVD's nor would i buy any of his DVD's again."},{"rating":"1","title":"might be OK if you're 20 and ripped!","review":"Mr. Kest apparently has no concept of \\"beginner\\". His easiest program is WAY over the head of this 50ish and very athletic lady. Unless you are extremely strong and totally flexible and have been doing Yoga for years, you risk injury if you try to keep up with even the easiest of these programs. He tells you to modify the poses to be easier - and do only what you can comfortably handle and breathe thru, but virtually all of the demos are at the most difficult level. His \\"warm-up\\" is no warm up, and initially, the length of time he has the demo people hold the poses is ridiculous although the pace picks up to be TOO quick toward the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's All the Fuss About","review":"I bought this video years ago. I didn't know anything about Brian Kest. I hadn't done yoga in 20 year. I was able to get right into the poses.(as well as I was able to). Why are the main complaints about the tape soooo shallow ie: his hair, the room, perfect people? I want to see the beautiful people, I take the way they look as inspiration. I'm finally going to get the next 2 tapes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you want to do more","review":"It's true. This video is very good.

There are three levels of practice and depending on my mood and flexibility, I choose the level that is best for that day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginner's","review":"I bought this based on another review on this product and I was disappointed. The monotone voice ,long hair. and Bryan strolling around shirtless in blue jeans is ridiculous for a fitness DVD. I have never done yoga and was looking for something with basic instruction. This DVD is for people who know how to move fluidly from one pose to the next. I understand that is what this type of yoga is about but I thought with the different DVD's it would gradually build up to that. I ended up purchasing \\"Rodney Yees: Yoga for Beginners\\" and like it much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value and 3 great workouts!","review":"The instructor's attitude and the students in the video really encourage me to go to the limits, but not so far that I hurt myself. I love how I can choose a workout that fits my mood in one DVD. Each one is under an hour. Energize is truely energizing and a precursor for the last two. Tone will work your glutes and abs! Sweat is a combination of the first two and definitely a challenge for the intermediate! I would not recommend this DVD to a beginner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheesy but good","review":"This was my first attempt at yoga, the DVD is pretty cheesy but oddly entertaining in it's cheesiness. It was simple to follow and a great workout, I've tried more current ones since but I still like to do this one on occasion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh jeez-Kest looks like a yoga Fabio","review":"I will say that despite the hair, stange jeans/cut off long underwear combo and machismo introduction-this dvd kicks butt. He reminds you to breathe regularly and it always seems to be just about the time I am focusing on the pose more than I am my breath. Kudos to Kest for that. Kest also routinely tells you to make the micro adjustments that make each pose more effective. I would like to knock off a star for cheesiness but alas-Kest is a great instructor. He is especially great when you are in downward dog (or any pose where you can't see the tv) and not looking at him and just listening. I would not recommend this dvd to beginners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corny, slow video","review":"I did not like this video at all. The flow is way too slow for me, and he spends too much time just walking around and talking. You don't really need a specific level of yoga to do it, since it seems to be all about the flexibility (even if he says it's not).All the people featured in the video seem to be extremely flexible (more like ballet dancer flexible not so much yoga), and the quality is mediocre at best. It feels like a cheap 80's setting.I did not enjoy, I did not sweat and I really won't do it again. If anyone wants my DVD they can have it for free.Not even comparable to Rodney Yee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Sound Quality","review":"This DVD would be just fine if only the \\"background\\" music was not so loud. It always competes with Kest's instruction, and at times actually drowns him out. It is very annoying, since most of the time, if you are doing the exercises, you don't want to look at the screen, just listening should be enough. I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners!","review":"I rented this video while shopping around for a good at-home yoga workout. I have gone to a handful of yoga classes at my gym and really like it, but Bryan Kest does not offer the detailed positioning instruction that I need. Also, half the time I don't even know I'm not positioned correctly, and that's why it's important for beginners to have an in-person instructor to physically adjust your position so your muscles can remember what the pose should feel like.Bryan's attitude is very encouraging and I'm sure I'll be able to work up to this level soon, but for now I'm still shopping for the best beginner's yoga video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor audio quality & boring","review":"What annoyed me most about this video was the ridicuously poor audio quality becaue the instructor is not mic'd. I also found the routines to be just ordinary. I sold my copy on e-bay."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"purchasing this cd was a great value; three great work outs for the price of one cd. i found b. kest to be educational, inspiring, and motivational all of which has made me a b. kest yoga fanatic!go bryan!!!!!!! i love to learn from u!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Yoga Workout","review":"I have just started taking classes and I bought this tape so I could do yoga at home. I found it to be a solid tape for a beginner such as myself. You aren't even watching the TV during most of the poses, so I find Brian's instructions clear and easy to follow. If you're hung up on asthetics I guess maybe this isn't the video for you; but if you want a good workout that leaves you feeling refreshed and revitalized, then go for it! I am buying 2 and 3 to add to my home library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exercise and Meditation in one","review":"I love these tapes. I have back and forth over the years and always come back to this Power Yoga tape. I feel very challenged and feel a great accomplishment when I can do the difficult poses. One thing I noticed is that it is not a matter of doing the pose correct, in a sense it's that you are in the moment breathing into the pose. I practice mindfulness daily and since I have been doing the tapes with mindfulness as Bryan Kest's suggest, I find the poses to be easier than struggling through them waiting for the pose to be over because it is too stressful. I like the setting of the class. It looks real, unlike other videos with a fake background. I am glad I found these tapes. I have all three, I interchange them daily. Volume 1 2 and 3 are all powerful each building on the other challenging you a little more with each one. I highly suggest this tape."},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding introduction to yoga and relaxation","review":"This video has transformed my body and my life. I highly recommend it to first-timers. My muscle-bound husband has recently tried it and really liked it too. Before purchasing, I rented a number of videos and found Bryan Kest's to be the most instructive, relaxing and appropriately paced for a novice. Now that I know what I'm doing, I still use it to tone and relax. The other Kest videos are exceptional as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bryan Kest - Vol 1","review":"This was the first Power Yoga video I ever purchased! I have viewed many other videos, taken several classes, attended conferences, and now also instruct Yoga myself, and this is the video I always recommend. Yes, It's a challenge, it's not the average \\"beginner video\\" but, I still think that beginners can do this video. There are participants shown at several levels in the video. Beginners just need find the level that fits them and listen to the cues that Bryan gives. I've quoted many of his cues in my own classes, I find them to be powerful andtruly meaningful...directionally and spiritually. After you try it, you'll understand! You'll literally tingle when you're done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout","review":"I'm very athletic, but have little yoga experience. I find this DVD challenging and a good workout. As I continue to use the DVD I improve my poses and can hold them more easily. I can feel different muscles getting a good workout which is also nice. It's a little cheesy with his early 90s long curly hair, but the exercises are good for varying levels of ability. A good value for the money too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you Bryan Kest for making this DVD!!!!","review":"I love love love this DVD more than any yoga class I've ever taken in a studio! I have been using this on and off since 2002... It is not for newbies - you should have basic understanding of poses before you even try Power 1. And for those who say it is too easy for them, you must be super fit as Power 3 includes advanced forms - and and he says, \\"Most poses are endless ...\\" so you can always push yourself more as you hold each one. I like in particular Kest's calm encouragement and words of wisdom that you can apply to daily life. There's no chanting but there is a nice sense of some spirituality for those of us who don't think of yoga as just a work out. But for fitness buffs, it's pretty straightforward so don't worry, it's not really new age-y. As a combination of strength, flexibility & cardio - this is the perfect workout and about 50 min. long. I have introduced this to quite a few people and everyone has loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"Its hard to write a negative review on something that should inspire the opposite. Bryan has the unfortunate way of almost barking his instructions and his twang made me uneasy for two times i tried the DVD for. If you are immune to his voice and posturing then i am sure there is a worthwhile few hours of yoge here for you. There are many teachers and DVDs that nudge the student into feeling the pose here we have Bryan strutting up and down the class like a bully."},{"rating":"1","title":"well...","review":"i bought this set because i thought it would be a good workout. it looks like a great one but i can't stop laughing long enough to start doing the moves. i turn it on whenever i need a good laugh. the instructor takes himself WAY too seriously and the outfits he wears are also hilarious. the things he says are even amusing. if you can get past all that, more power to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I much prefer Rodney Yee. Bryan Kest appears a bit new-agey and strange to me. That's just preference, though. Not really for beginners, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not astanga yoga!","review":"Brian Kest is way to concerned with how he looks and trying to be deep! Not to mention the fact that this is not astanga at all and should not be billed as such. (The back of the box claims it is astanga). I bought this video to use in conjuction with the weekly astanga yoga class I attend and was very disappointed. END"},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"i usually put a lot of weight on the product review so i have to tell you its not worth ur money...its about 1:30 of routine and thats it...the guy wears jean?!!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!!??! and it just seems outdated i regret the purchase"},{"rating":"1","title":"know your level","review":"I read many reviews and decided to get this DVD. Didn't regret it.The video is from the 90's, but don't think it is outdated, asanas are the same, be patient and you will get there. There are 3 levels, and don't get frustrated if yoy can't do it all.I'm still on the first level but my balance and flexibility are much better. It incorporated aerobics too so you cannot get bored. One full hour literally flies with this DVD. Definitely would buy it again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended for a begginer","review":"As a beginner who want to try yoga (with no knowledge at all) this is defiantly not the DVD to recommend to start with.....find it difficult right at the begging with no explanation/showing on how to go easy on poses you cannot even think to perform...also, was fast to learn it that I needed to do return- back so many times till I got sick & tired from this DVD...NOT recommended for any beginner at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"This is not a good video. The guy just wants to show his own body.Yoga is about flowing from pose to pose. This video has no flow. It shows the people in a class with Bryan teaching them moves, then all of a sudden breaks to a separate shot of Bryan with no shirt on doing the move somewhere else. How am I supposed to get into my flow when I keep having to look at this guys long nasty hair and hairy chest? I do not recommend this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"who does yoga in tight cut-off jeans ?","review":"it was more talk then action. he spoke sooo much and sooo loudly i couldn't even get into the dvd. his students did the poses, and he had close body contact to his students in \\"helping\\" them pose right. the times that he did do yoga seemed more like showing off then demonstrating. if i ever walked into his studio seeing him wearing greasy 80's hair and tight cut-off jeans, i would have ran the other way never looking back. im sorry i wasted my $7.00.sigh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheesy but great workout","review":"This is a great workout and when you start out it might look easy but unless you're already in great shape its not, but when you get past that you can really feel a difference. (Getting a yoga mat would be a good advise before starting the workout)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perserverance, Fortitude, Breath.","review":"I've never had the desire to purchase another Yoga DVD. In fact, I purchased the VHS version of this collection some five plus years ago and I am completely satisfied with the challenge presented by this series. Kest does not instruct you how to breathe but, he does constantly remind you of the breath. He is unable to physically make adjustments to your posture but, he explains the poses very thoroughly. I recommend watching 15 min. of Power 1 at first then, trying that part along with his instruction. Build up your stamina in 15 min. increments until you can complete the class. When you are happy with the skills you have developed, move on to Power 2 and work the same way. I feel great from my Yoga practice. Namaste!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent value for money, 3 great yoga sessions","review":"These yoga sessions are great, especially if you are already practising yoga, and have some other dvd's or books to work from. They are not a \\"complete\\" or comprehensive set of yoga sessions, but they do cover the basics, at 3 levels (beginner, intermediate, and advanced); and they are intense enough to give a good, strong, and exercising and challenging session. And since there are 3 complete sessions on one DVD, it's definitely good value for money and very convenient."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for Beginners","review":"I have only made it through the first video in this series and I found it difficult. To begin with the workout is very fast paced and Kest does not show you the proper poses as I would expect a beginner tape to do. The people shown taking the class appear very advanced and are in no way beginners. In addition, I found Kest's constant jabbering extremely annoying and this made it difficult to get into the right frame of mind. I much prefer Yoga Zone and Rodney Yee's tapes to these and think they are much better suited for beginners. I did not enjoy this tape."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is great but not easy!","review":"Bryan Kests Yoga tapes are definitely a challenge! However, if you want to push yourself and set your thighs on fire - Bryan is your Power Yoga Guru. You will sweat and be left feeling empowered. Total yoga rush!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent for stretching, not much of a \\"workout\\" though.","review":"The stretching and poses are excellent but I thought the words \\"power yoga\\" \\"sweat\\" and \\"strength\\" were rather misleading. If you are already fairly fit, these videos probably aren't going to make you break a sweat or gain strength. The only strength-related pose involved one pushup every few minutes. For beginners, this would be challenging, (the instructor says \\"don't worry if you can't do a full pushup!\\") but for people who are already fit it's pretty tame. The poses do provide a great stretch though.I found the host of this series to be very annoying. He's pretty dorky and new-agey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst video ever","review":"I was so frustrated with this video, I had to write a review. His directions are endless and meaningless. He will go on and on about nothing, and then curtly cue for the next move. I have only been able to get through the first 20 minutes, and I get so frustrated, I have to quit. I'll be hanging out in a pose, and then I hear him say something that can't be done from where I am and realize he has changed poses. Somewhere along the way, I missed his cue. I go back to see how I missed it. It's because he will only say \\"down\\" or \\"float\\", and that basically is the cue to change to something else. I found myself trying to be ultra vigilant so as not to miss any cues. This is no way to \\"lose\\" yourself into the poses.I would not be surprised to learn the five star reviews are from paid reviewers. Quite a few of the five star reviews are not \\"verified purchasers\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bryan Rocks!","review":"These are my favorite Yoga videos. I have some others, but they really don't compare. Bryan's workouts are well organized and I always feel better after doing them. The second in the series is by far the most difficult physically, but all three are fun, which is not something I say for the others in my collection. I personally like Bryan's teaching style, and I think having a class setting helps by letting you see how each person does each pose differently, reinforcing Bryan's teaching that the poses conform to us, we do not conform to the poses.One warning, however, I wouldn't recommend these for an absolute beginner. But if you have a couple of months experience, you should be fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"good tape...","review":"The workout itself is wonderful and will definitely build strength,as the postures are held for what seems like a painful eternity...There are some really good ones here..I did find the \\"erotic'aspects (\\"the shirtless longhaired Kest,perfect chiseled bodies,and the adjusting of the students\\")just a tad distracting,but thats just me I guess..It is still one of the best tapes out there.."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Yoga--As Tough As You Want It.","review":"About a year ago I was introduced to Bryan Kest. I have four of his CD's and have taken my yoga practice to a much deeper level with his instruction. However the CD's go on for 90 minutes or more, time I don't always have, so I find this DVD attractive because the three levels of yoga practice included are each around 45 minutes. For the money, this DVD can't be beat. It will challenge you no matter what your previous yoga experience, and even a beginner can benefit as long as they go slowly."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must be missing something...","review":"I read the other reviews and was excited to get the tape. I was disappointed. The video is almost an hour and was filmed while the instructor teaches a class. There are lots of long pauses while he walks around correcting his students positions. Meanwhile, you are stuck at home doing nothing for several long gaps while in an awkward position. It just didn't flow. Also, many of the positions are very difficult to do. Power Yoga for Beginners is a much better tape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout!","review":"I enjoy this workout very much. Being a firefighter I need a physically challenging workout. Running and weight training for years started to wear out my knees and compress my spine. This really allows me to push myself to my edge every day without the knee beat down or back problems. I gave it four stars instead of five because it has a few too many pushups which if done this way, will burn out the arms and won't let me do it every single day. Some days I skip the pushups all together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer Workout!","review":"I love this series! It is a tough, sweaty, muscle quivering workout. I wouldnt recommend it to anyone who is not familiar with the basic postures, because he moves right along. This is the one if you want that power yoga workout!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the quickest toning I've ever had","review":"This is my first experience with power yoga. Brian is wonderful at explaining all the poses and providing encouragement along the way. I have always worked out, but never had the results this has provided. I noticed toning in places I've been trying to target for years. It is great for mind and body."},{"rating":"2","title":"Focus on Breathing and the Body Will Come","review":"Focus on Breathing and the Body Will Come....That should be title of this DVD. I am convinced that Bryan Kest Power Yoga has taught me how to breath....I mean, really breath. Its not like I was asthmatic or had difficulty with my breathing before or anything its just that I don't think most people are taught to take deep full breaths on a regular basis. We just go about breathing the barest minimum necessary for survival.Who knew a DVD could be so important to your breath!I bought this DVD over a month ago and I've tried to do at least 30minutes every other day. What a difference it has made in my breathing and definitely in my body -- long and lean muscles is a by-product of the breathing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kest delivers again","review":"This collection is a great buy for any intermediate to advanced practioner. All three practices are challenging, yet Kest does a great job of giving modifications or places for beginners to back off as needed. Let's face it, we don't always have time for a full 90 minute practice, but it's much better to get on your mat for 53 minutes than none at all! Which is about how long each class lasts. My only criticism...why not a full hour? The closings seem just a bit rushed, but that's what the \\"pause\\" button is for; add your own inversions, etc. Sometimes you just need a good sweat, and these classes do just that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent yoga","review":"As a beginner to yoga, yet not at all new to fitness and exercise, I wanted something that I could start out with but continue to be challenged by. I have had these tapes for 6 months and still have room to improve. Being somewhat familiar with the poses, Brian's instruction is easy to follow while you are not looking at the video. (If you do need to check things out, the sights are not at all bad). His voice is calming and the poses are held just long enough. The videos are approximately 45-50 minutes in length.I continue to alternate all three videos. They all have a basic structure yet enough variety to keep the body guessing. Personally, I like his style and would highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud disruptive music","review":"I've been practicing yoga for 4 years and started using DVDs a year ago. This DVD was by far the most annoying, mostly due to the fact that the music is loud and thumping. It's very hard to get into the flow and focus on breathing when your pulse starts beating like a drum in your head to music that you can't turn off (even during savasana). This might work for some, but definitely not for me. If there were an atmosphere rating (scene, music, loudness of voice) for yoga DVDs, I would have known better before buying this one- buyer beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout!","review":"I have several yoga DVDs and this is the one I use most. I always feel so relaxed after practicing yoga. My muscles are looser and it works the upper body well. It's a bargain!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Cross-Trainer","review":"I have been a 5-6 mile, 2-day-per week runner since I was 11 years old; that's 20 years now. My knees are holding up but my back has been on-and-off hurting for at least 5 years. Since I have been using this video, I feel a drastic improvement. I was uneasy picking out a yoga tape, though I'd heard about the positive benefits of yoga: I was afraid that a yoga video might be new-age cheesy. No cheesiness here; the emphasis of this tape is definitely on the workout itself. I cannot say enough good things about incorporating something like this into a workout schedule. I also lift weights once per week; but neither weights nor running has made me feel like this when the workout's over - balanced and rested. The poses are challenging but definitely not disheartening; I was surprised to find that I could do all of them. When I'm ready for it, I'll be buying tape #2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even finish the DVD...","review":"With his rushed delivery and his aggressive, boyish swagger, it was a little hard to take Kest seriously. I tried to at least give the DVD a chance, and do the 1st level through to the end, but I found that even for all the words Kest was cramming into the available amount of time, he failed to teach the poses in a manner appropiriate for beginners to learn the poses safely and correctly. For the experienced practitioner, his chatter was distracting and even patronizing.One demographic this DVD may appeal to however, is people who think they're too \\"manly\\" to do yoga--still, this DVD would be better as an intro rather than a CD to practice regularly with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very uninspiring","review":"Did this dvd once and had a hard time getting through it. Not difficult however, very uninspiring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywoodized Yoga","review":"I guess the MTV intro with the video footage of Kest approaching the backdoor of his studio set the whole tone. The instruction though good is drownedout by the jazzy Rock beat and background music. Hard to concentrate on innerpeace and relaxation when the opposite is being broadcast. Kest seems sincerebut the whole scene reeked of ego. If you're looking for the spiritual aspectsof Yoga I would forget about this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wasted my money!","review":"Not for the person who needs relaxation during their yoga practice. All three programs are basically the same workout, and the yoga student spends most of the workout in downward dog pose.While Bryan is a good instructor, he spends very little time in meditation at the end of the video, and NEVER stops talking. The is not real yoga.Caution: If you have back or wrist pain, these workouts are NOT for you. Please be careful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful","review":"Bryan Kest is a terrible Yoga instructor. Yoga is supposed to be relaxing, and he talks throughout the entirety of the DVD. I just wanted him to shut up. He is also shirtless and looks like a dumb hippie. His workout out is nothing like P90X Yoga. P90X Yoga looks professional, is soothing, and gets you into shape. Bryan Kest's workout is run of the mill, not soothing, and not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK DVD","review":"I only tried the first portion of this DVD and I am an intermediate level. I've been doing yoga for 5 years, and I was trying to increase my yoga library at home. I read the reviews left here, and was very disappointed. Mostly due to the instructor. I did not like him at all. He was a bit too \\"creepy\\" for me, if that makes sense. The practice is decent, but I just couldn't get over the teacher. I much prefer Shiva Rea's Shakti Yoga and Fluid Yoga. I also really prefer the yoga matrixes, rather than this style of DVD. I ended up giving this DVD to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"motivating workout","review":"The programs on Bryan Kests DVD are movitating and challenging. I would not recommend this for true beginner as it assumes knowledge of alignment in certain poses. This is challenging enough for an intermediate practice-but not our of reach for an advanced beginner if they follow the verbal cues to respect thier body and to not try to work beyond their limits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spare yourself","review":"I bought this yoga video based on the reviews. I was looking for something new and on a different level. This was not it. If you are used to the simple meditative Living Arts videos this is definately not for you. I like to get into a quiet state of mind when doing yoga, this guy nearly drove me nuts. He never shut his mouth, and went on and on about nothing, until I had to turn it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a good workout. Could be a better video.","review":"It seemed as though all 3 parts were the same. I did not find much difference in the 3 parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE - WAY OUT OF DATE - HORRIBLE","review":"This video is NOTHING like Bikrham and TOTALLY out of date. This guy wears 80's stone washed jean shorts over spandex and has Kenny G hair - you can't take this seriously today! His class is all wearing white 80's spandex leotards... soooooo bad.... DO NOT WANT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it","review":"I just hope that for those of you using this video, that this is not your only exposure to yoga. Nothing beats a live class. This video, compared to a good yoga class, is a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Me...","review":"I tried 3x to watch this DVD, everytime I had to switch to another DVD. Besides beging visually unappealing, I cannot get past the way he speaks nor do I care for his verbal \\"abbreviations\\" of the moves. Also, the way he touches the students kinda creeps me out. I did not feel comfortable watching this DVD. For power yoga, I would recommend Baron Baptiste's sets over this one any day. Baron probably talks just as much, but the DVDs are a little more grounded. For something more zen, Shiva Rea is just awesome. Best to those who this DVD works for, but it was not for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"ecstatically relaxed","review":"This DVD set is awesome. I have never done yoga before this, its easy to catch on and get in with the flow, it is awesome. I have been doing the video for about a month now and I have definately seen improvement in my strength. Most of all i see more definition in my shoulders and legs. It has given me the energy to pursue other activities, as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I have been doing yoga for about a year and this video has become one of my favorites. I started off with an AM/PM DVD with Rodney Yee and enjoyed it but did not feel very challenged. I moved to a Power Yoga DVD by Rodney Yee and found it very challenging. I did that for about 6 months and then needed something different. Bryan Kest instructs more during the video then Rodney. He walks you through all of the posses and makes you really feel part of his class. Rodney goes through the posses with out any type of conversation. If you need encouragement during your workout then this Power Yoga would be a great choice. The DVD has three workouts each one harder then the next."},{"rating":"2","title":"yoga man","review":"Good workout, but, at the begining of the workout there is some time wasted on needless video of Bryan. Some of the commentary by Bryan is a bit \\"over the top\\" on the philosophy. The video could be improved by just getting into the workouts and fast and effective teaching of the proper form. Other than these items, this workout is good, and I always feel good physically after the session. I would buy this DVD again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Power Yoga for strength & flexibility","review":"This video (3 levels) has been a great motivator for me to add stretching to my weekly routine. I run 4 days per week and have noticed tightness in back and hamstrings as I age. When I do level one at least once per week, I find I am looser in legs and typically enjoy my runs more. I have also seen an improvement in my core strength which has allowed to add speed work to my running.The video incorporates strength poses into the stretching so you still feel like you have had a good workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak video","review":"Having watched and practiced nine yoga videos this year I have to say that this was the worst video - I hope nobody has hurt themselves doing it. Read some of other negative reviews to know why and notice that other Videos have all positive recommendations. The best videos on the market I've tried are: Total Yoga with Tracey Rich or David Swenson's Ashtanga tapes. If you are new to Ashtanga/Power/Vinyasa Yoga then Power Yoga (stamina version) with Rodney Yee is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it so much! it is a hard workout","review":"This is a yoga workout that you will enjoy if you like to work REALLY HARD. If you want a simple stretch lay-around yoga mellow routine this is not your dvd.I only got to stage 2 and you can feel the invigorating power of the workout, it is amazing. Just give yourself enough time and be patient practicing level 1 before going on 2 and so forth. It will be worth it. There are no yoga workouts like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kick your buns yoga!","review":"This is my favorite all time yoga DVD. It's a little dated (from the 90's), but the workout is phenomenal! There are 3 sessions on this DVD and each one is about 50 minutes. I really like that Bryan does a good job balancing poses with counter poses. This is by far the most difficult yoga session I've done (although I'm a relative newbie). If you want an amazing workout, be prepared to sweat with this one. I highly recommend it. I just wish he made more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not that easy to follow","review":"I had to keep rewinding the tape to keep up. You cannot follow the rutine by merely listening, and while in some positions, there is no way to look at the tv. Other videos make it easier to follow the workout without watching. Also, this is not an easy video for beginners. I would not recommend it as a first yoga video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some initial flexibility would be good","review":"This will be a good video for me in about six months (I rented the first one from the library). He moves fast enough through the vinyasas that you would be lost if you didn't have some familiarity with what he was doing. None of the movements are particularly difficult in and of themselves, but he has you hold downward dog for a length of time that is too long for me. This is a good video for achieving a lot of stretch, but it is too challenging for a beginner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous!","review":"There is not enough warm up in this video, and it leaves one prone to injury! You have to get some blood to the shoulders before holding upper push up lower push up, or downward dog. All three of these are done right at the beginning, with no warm up!! For this reason alone, avoid this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"couldn't get past his voice","review":"Well, I can't speak to Bryan's great cueing or his holding poses for the right amount of time. This is because I was so put off by his voice that it was impossible to continue. Imagine a grating, annoying, nasal voice telling you ad nauseum how important breathing is...\\" And you gawda remembah that da breath is very impooortent...\\" I applaud the others for braving that for a workout. But I couldn't do it. I wish someone had mentioned this in a review before I bought 2 of his DVD's. I returned both Bryan Kest DVD's the same day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A difficult start..","review":"When i first got this tape, I only did 20 minutes of it with my partner and we had to stop. For a beginner, this is harder then I thought, but since then I've been practising yoga for nearly 6 days a week! I don't really know much about the preperation, pre or post exercise but I seem to be doing ok. So how do you know if you're ready for tape 2?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A little too creepy","review":"I bought a bunch of yoga videos for when I've been working long hours because it's a lot easier for me than getting to the gym. I have to say, I wanted to like this video but there's something extremely creepy about it. The people in this video have that possessed look about them like you'd see in a horror movie. Ryan Kest talks so much that it's very difficult for me to follow the moves without continually looking up at the screen to see what is going on, which I find disruptive. He doesn't tend to use the names of moves, instead tries to talk you through the change in position, but I just end up lost the whole time. It is also NOT a good workout for us less flexible people. There are 3 workouts but I have not made it past the first one. I tried to give it another chance after a few weeks but I'm afraid I'm just going to get rid of the video."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not what yoga is about","review":"Instructors like Kest are the reason yoga is so misinterpreted in the U.S. This DVD is not real yoga. Yoga is about transformation and using the body to slow the mind (which eventually leads to enlightenment), not getting a workout while watching a porn-star looking man in jeans graphically touching male and female students (the male on sweaty male \\"adjustments\\" are very creepy even for an open minded liberal yogi). It's interesting all the good reviews on this product say \\"it's a good workout,\\" when that is so far from what yoga is about. If you want exercise, go to the gym. If you're going to try yoga, do it for the right reasons and try a purer form of the practice. Bryan Kest's practice is flat-out disrespectful to a beautiful, ancient practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Yoga DVD I have tried!","review":"Maybe I just don't 'get it' with this DVD, but the poses and sessions are totally not what I am used to. This guy is really 'arty' so if you are looking for that, this would be perfect for you.If you are looking for simple, strength building poses that are easy to follow and clear, look else where. I have become a really big fan of the Rodney Yee series by Gaiam. He doesn't take himself too seriously, has a soothing voice, and the workouts are great!~andrea"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yablo Yoga","review":"Wow! This video is quite dated. You may be better off just turning on your own music and doing your home practice poses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Ugh - I was really excited to get this dvd, but I popped it in the player and had to turn it off. I just couldn't stand his voice! It really grated on my nerves and I couldn't work through it. Oh well, back to the drawing board."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't toss the message because you don't like the messenger!","review":"Just a quick note for those who may not investigate videos because of the presenter's voice. I agree that there are certain 'sounds' from a voice that may inspire some while others grate against us.Either way, I have often tired of hearing the verbiage of almost any of the videos I have, and have simply turned down the volume and replaced my own 'heavy metal' sounds on some days...and 'soothing environmentals' on others.Obviously I need not point out, that I do this once I have 'heard' the instructions and recognize the upcoming exercise...Hope this helps those who would miss a lot of awesome messages. Maria"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent before buy","review":"I don't actually own this video. I'm not the kind of person who buys a pair of shoes without trying them on first. The same goes for exercise videos. I've learned to add them to my NetFlix queue and experiment before making a commitment. I've adopted this pattern after collecting an embarrassing number of barely used exercise videos that while all promising to better the others, suffer from poor audio or irritating glitches that display poor production methods. I racked up plenty of balmost new videos that offer marginal re-gifting options. Fortunately, our public library and Goodwill accepts these donations with open arms."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a \\"look at me\\" video, not a \\"how to \\"!!!","review":"This Yoga tape is ridiculous! You may as well sit on the couch and watch it b/c it's impossible to learn anything from it! You either see a group of people huddled together, so that you can't make out what they are doing, or there is a close up on someone so that you only see a portion of them; either way, you can't figure out what you are supposed to be doing! I've since purchased some (less expensive!) tapes from the Living Yoga series & they are much better. You only have one person to watch, & they are more focused on the yoga than on camera angles so it is much easier to learn. Brian Kest- your \\"be where you're at\\" was a good idea, but you blew it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated!","review":"I was highly dissappointed with this video. It says it is from 2004, but the Copyright on the back says 1995 and you and can tell! Yuck!Anyway, I did not like the style of his presentation at all. Very slow and boring and he has a bit of a mushmouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bryan Kest Power Yoga","review":"I've been doing yoga for years, in studio and by dvd. This is one of the worst videos of yoga I've seen. It looks like it was done in a warehouse in...well, I won't say what state. Just can't take a guy serious who shows up looking like \\"Fabio\\" wearing knee length blue jeans w/ white spandex showing underneath. I'll stick w/ Rodney Yee or Jonathan Urla (yogalates) when doing yoga at home. If I could get my money back on this I would. After reading the reviews I really expected something better; this is a very disappointing video!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This video is far below the standards I expected....","review":"Too much style and not enough substance. As an intermediate/advanced level Ashtanga student, I can safely say that Mr. Kest has a huge ego problem as the video puts way too much attention on him and his bad boy good looks with gauzey shots and hard body close ups and not enough time on the actual work, I was very dissapointed. Also the tape runs 36 minutes long, not the advertised 54 minutes, a rip off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this lousy video","review":"I've been practicing yoga for 5+ years.The first move he had us do caused my back to hurt.Poor description of poses.

I love yoga, but found this to be fairly boring. It is challenging and a pleasure to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good yoga video series","review":"I just tried this yoga series. After practicing for 8.5 years I honestly did not find this very challenging and that's what I was looking for. The cuing for poses is not good unless you are familiar with poses and in particular sequence of poses. I did like his message and feel that's the best thing about this video series. I'd actually like to try a live class with him at some point. I just don't think it's the best video series available for at home practice. That said, I will reiterate his message is very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissatisfied","review":"I found Bryan Kest to be very annoying -- he never shuts up and has a very annoying voice. Some of the poses are tough, and it is a decent workout, but I couldn't get past his jabbering throughout the entire video. I had to give this one away. I much prefer Rodney Yee's videos."},{"rating":"2","title":"He Will Haunt Your Dreams","review":"Awesome workout. Well crafted. Sadly, it's one of the better DVDs on the market. I have just one caveat...WARNING: Do not look him in the eye. His yogi eyes and manly eyebrows will stare at you through your TV and into your soul. You will be mesmerized by all the hairless, bare chested men bending and stretching. This is to say nothing of the woman in the awesomely tacky thong.SPOILER ALERT!: The best scene is at the end of the third workout where a shirtless Brian Kest leans on another shirtless dude and puts his cheek on the guy's back with Bryan's awesome curly hair cascading down the other dude's back. If you put that in a parody about yoga, it's so over the top that no one would believe it."},{"rating":"1","title":"great body, horrible production quality","review":"We do a yoga video each morning and this one was poor. The que's were bad and late, and it was just Bryan walking around a class in cut off jeens. The video was grainy but worst was the audio. It was almost too poor to listen to. We have a really good sound system and TV so it matters when the production does not even bother to use a mic. Now, Bryan's body is great and his power is amazing and that is why this is not a one star. I would love to take a live class from Bryan. I think it would be great, but the video for us was a one time watch due to the production quality issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners and not good","review":"There is no doubt that Bryan Kest is good at yoga, but based on this video I am very skeptical of his skill as a teacher. I am familiar with yoga, and I'm not in terrible shape, and there is NO way this video is for beginners. I didn't like anything about it. Not the look, not the music, and especially not his nonstop new-agey babbling as he wanders around, touching his students inappropriately. It would have been helpful as I tried to replicate some of the postures, to see a whole person, rather than various body parts of the lithe, professional dancer types undulating through the difficult routine. I actually laughed out loud at one \\"beginner\\" move that I was supposed to be able to do, I would maybe be able to achieve it with human growth hormones and several months of weight training to build up my arm strength."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"I just wanted to say that all the other reviews were very influential in my decision to purchase this product. I am glad that I did. It is difficult--I still can't do all of step one, but it is a good workout that will challenge you for a long time to come. I feel better already. It is definitely good for your back. Well, most of what I have to say has been said, so that's it for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Challenging but not impossible yoga. Bryan Kest is soothing and encouraging, so even if you aren't advanced, this collection will work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive","review":"First of all, to say there are 3 complete workouts on this video is a bit misleading. Technically, this is a true statement- however the 3 workouts are all *very* similar to one another, so it's not like you're getting 3 different workouts. This video is hard to follow because the audio isn't very good- rather than explaining the moves clearly, Brian Kest spends most of the time trying to be profound and inspirational. But he comes off as creepy. He seems to be completely unaware of the fact that if I'm in a downward dog, I can't see the screen, so the audio needs to be spot on.The overall production value of the DVD is very low (the video is grainy and low quality). Pretty disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging and instructive.","review":"This is basically a very good instruction video. It seems aimed mainly at a female audience, but putting that aside, it is well structured and well taken. Some reviews say that the camera angle is not good and you can't see the poses well. Personally, I think otherwise, but some poses ARE difficult, requiring balance and strength. There is certainly a lot to learn, gain and enjoy through this video, and it feels great, learning to balance yourself in any position, even upside down."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is POWER yoga! Not for the faint at heart","review":"A yoga teacher recommended this video to me - talk about out of touch with her student!! If you want POWER yoga this is fine. Someone commented that the participants in the class looked like beginners - my foot! They looked like they had done ballet for years. I'll keep trying but this is definitely what the title says -- POWER yoga."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ewwww...","review":"1. Does that really look like Fogger with all that cloth on and everything.2.

I received this book as a gift for Christmas. The museum is just amazing if you ever get the chance to visit, its just a ton of amazing medical maladies and specimens. The wall of skulls is probably my favorite area in the museum itself. I thought the book was well done but obviously doesn't hold a candle to the actual museum.

Haunting, eerie and even beautiful...yes, beautiful. From cutaneous horns to conjoined twins to rare diseases, all of these are covered with meticulous detail and respect in this book and turned into objects of beauty, not of morbid fascination.Mutter Museum: Of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia is amazing and worth every penny of the purchase price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Chilling!","review":"Great Book!

It was lovely to see artistic impressions of the items at the museum. If you are photographically inclined or artistically interested in the odd, or simply looking for the 'coffee table book' none of your friends would have-then this book is for you. The images are wonderful and I enjoyed the book for that purpose alone.If you were looking for a book that reviewed detail and information on the items at the museum then my opinion is that it was certainly lacking and that this is not the book for you.Having not visited the museum myself, I was hoping to have the book contain more in the area of exhibit contents or even detailed information on specific items in the collection. I believe those who are neither photographically nor artistically inclined would not enjoy the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice vocal . . . bad French","review":"Too bad Julio doesn't speak French.

I would hate to think Amazon is supporting such a poor quality product. Maltin apparently via e-mails in response to complaints sent to him has been backing away from taking responsibility for this, but I would think as the name behind this series he should stand up for consumers who use him for guidance on their purchases.Since you do not offer any contact information Doug, I am using this forum to reach you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walt Disney Treasures-Disney Rarities","review":"Reminded me of old times when we used to sit around the tv.

I wanted it to share with my 4-year-old, and he loves the folk lore classics, especially. You just don't see many representations of these anymore. While some people would be offended by a couple of the cartoons that have racial stereotypes not acceptable in today's society, I think it's great to have a record of where we've been as a culture. It opens up opportunities for dialogue about it. I talk about it wirh my 4-year-old. I'm really glad I bought it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So GLAD we got this!","review":"This is WONDERFUL!!

I've appreciated the sectoin dedicated to Alice comedies; they're not cartoons form the special series, but they are interesting beacues were made by walt disney and his staff in the 20s before Mickey. I've rated this DVD 4, because two shorts from the serie have not been included in the collection (Susie the little blue coupè , casey bats again, were released in the 50s and the collection contains the specials from 1938 to 1962)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad and disappointed","review":"I have all 18 of the Disney Treasure DVD's. Until this year, they have been of excellent quality. However, this year, with Disney Rarities and the Chronilogical Donald, Vol 2, I was very disappointed.The selection of material, in both the new additions, is exemplary, as usual. The quality of that material, however, is what leads to this poor review. Most of the material looks like it was untouched, and certainly not remastered as the packaging would suggest, before being transferred to DVD. Given the unforgiving nature of the medium, the material really looks poor. So poor that it takes away from any value this set might have had to a collector, and poor enough that even a casual viewer is going to be left unsatisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.......","review":"False advertising!! These shorts have NOT been remastered. The quality is poor and definately not up to Disney standards. I am shocked at some of the seasoned reviewers on Amazon that gave this 5 stars without even addressing the quality issue. Even worse is the reviewer who acknowledged that these shorts are not remastered but gave the collection 5 stars anyway. Disappointing. Don't let nostalgia cloud your decision to accept an inferior product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings me back...","review":"A friend and I were on a hunt for a specific cartoon and we found it on this collection.

The contents appeared to be in good condition. However, the collector tin is worthless. The outside packaging was in good condition and the label under the shrinkwrap that covered the damage was unmarked leading me to believe it left the factory that way.

I've had the chance to live on Cyprus for about a year so I've had time to read both and compare what they say with my experience of the island. And the result is that I highly recommend this book. It has well written and fairly detailed sections pertaining to the islands history and culture. Each region of Cyprus is dealt with in reasonable detail. Additionally, the book does not shy away from the difficult political and social issues that vex Cyprus, and in my opinion is even handed in assigning blame and praise (there is plenty to go around!). I didn't feel at all like one of the other reviewers, that the author disliked Cyprus. Cyprus is a bit of a difficulty as well as a bit of paradise - in fact, it's history and current reality are quite heart rending to grasp. But there is still much to appreciate. This book has been invaluable to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont buy this book","review":"I bought this guide for the summer I am spending in cyprus.

The track bring you back to what it was like growing up as a kid. From have G.I. Joe's and Cabbage Patch kids to having your bike stolen.Another one of the tracks that I'm sure you have heard by now is \\"Move Bi**h\\" (Ludacris featuring I-20 and Mystikal). If you're having a bad day or are stuck in traffic on the way home just open th windows blast the song and sit back and relax!Also, the song Posted by Shawnna is a tight song.

I agree with the editorial reviews that one does not need the film to appreciate the soundtrack. Although, I do really like the film too.I am a big fan of Ornette Coleman. It is difficult to compare this work with other Coleman work because the setting is o different. Coleman's soloing, and the use of his soloing, is insipred.

I've had this soundtrack for a few years now, and just put it on again today. This is a series of brilliant compositions played by orchestra and the inimitable Ornette Coleman so the compositions are in a sense really collaborations between Shore and Coleman. Not intrusive music, like another reviewer said, natural sounds as if played on a record player next door. The Simpatico/Mysterioso piece intertwines Coleman runs with Monk's Mysterioso. And then there's the Interzone Suite.A highly recommended pastiche of themes and riffs."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is an FPS....","review":"Graphics 9/10: This game has great graphics but it doesn't use the full power of the Xbox.Gameplay 5/10: If you want a good FPS then just get Halo. If you really want this game get it for PC. If you get it for PC, my friend says you can get third-person for guns and everything. If you get it for Xbox, you can only get 3P mode for the lightsaber.Sound 0/10: You don't really hear much sound except for the gunshots and lightsaber swings.Replay Value 0/10: Their is pretty much nothing to make you play this game again except multiplayer. The multiplayer is pretty boring. BTW I have never gotten the internet to work.Overall 3.5: Gets old after a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good game","review":"So far the game is good but alot of puzzle solving going on. The controls are like halo which I am very fond of this control scheme. Different options are of control are implimented. Sound is Lucas tweaked. Graphics are so so and could have been improved over the pc version. Light sabre conrol is something that will take time to master. Good game so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS A AWESOME GAME","review":"This is a very cool game Kyle Katarn is a famous person who defeated the dark lord Jarik.

From the graphics to the way the game played, Jedi Outcast was weak. I am really glad that I rented this game first. I am a huge Star Wars fan, but would not buy this game. I am hoping Knights of The Republic is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"This game kicks BUTT!!!!","review":"This game rocks.You start off as a Rebel infiltrating Imperial bases.You don't your lightsaber or the Force at first but don't worry you'll get them later.Once you get the lightsaber and force powers and fight another Jedi, you'll get addicted.This game is extremely difficult unless you hve the proper cheat codes[Which i do]This game also has a cool arsenal of weapons like the E-11 blaster rifle and a disintergrater gun.The multi player is also cool. Different games like Free for all, Duel, and capture the flag. The games puzzles are really hard at times but don't give up. The final fight is worth it.[I'm really 13]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Subpar","review":"I won't go into the games other aspects as the other reviewers have done a good job desbribing the story, controls, and overall gameplay. What I will touch on is the AWFUL character animations and overall mediocre graphics. Maybe I'm just jaded from playing Splinter Cell but the characters here are laughable, especially the death animations. The AI is also pathetic. More than once did I have at least 3 to 4 Stormtroopers run from me in terror.Add in the frustrating puzzles plus repetitive music and you have a game that (i found to be) barely playable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holy crap son.","review":"This is probably one of the worst star wars games ever made. Its diffucult, you die easily, the first few levels is a shooter game which is not what i bought the game for and you die all the time. Going thru the level is liking blindly trying to follow someone you get a vague idea of where youre suppossed to go but then its a random way of getting there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Challenging Game","review":"This isn't your typical run through game, you actually have to think and take risk at times. It does get a little difficult as stated in alot of reviews but that's the thing I like most about it. I rate this just as good as Jedi Academy. My only flaws were the default controls, those were a pain. I highly recommend changing that and the force powers were a pain to use at first but once you got used to it it wasn't that bad. This has a decent story line as all the Star Wars games do and fun to play. I had to use a few cheat codes on some of the levels (like Level Skip)because it gets pretty tough, but I didn't have to do that much, maybe twice. Anyways, this is a definately must have for all the Star Wars fans out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rule of thumb for concrete designers","review":"This book is a must have.

The Journal itself once read is interesting but is it really true? What Ptolemy wrote,has been written before in many books,hence this is not really a discovery.The book is written by 2 people Weber and Ptolomey.Weber is rather imaginative,however it has names and locations of many tribes,which previously were not written.Ptolomey well if it is true.It is a great discovery.On the other hand if these are indeed the chornicles of Alexander why the Archeological world has not mentioned it?I still give it a 5 stars,intersting and extremely entertaining.However,Alexander died of malaria not of poison as Weber writes here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truely revealing about the historical basis of Christ's life","review":"Although at times this book appears to be targeted towards the seminary student, I found this book both intriguing and highly introspective for the common layman by providing a historical basis for the events and the works that occured in the life of Jesus. For those events and works in the life of Jesus that I once took for granted and assumed as fact, Meier has given me a historical basis for either supporting that belief or given me a basis to understand where there is a reasonable doubt and the reasoning for such. Meier has taken simple miracles and events and given me a much expanded conceptual outlook on each and how they related to Jesus ministry. I found my faith strengthened and not weakened by this book. Overall I rate this book a B+ for those hoping to obtain an expanded look into the life of Christ with the only reservation being the tendency at times to write on a \\"seminary student\\" level"},{"rating":"2","title":"First Rate Scholarship, Well Worth the Reader's Effort","review":"With the first two volumes of \\"A Marginal Jew,\\" Meier has proved himself one of the premier New Testament scholars in the English language. \\"A Marginal Jew\\" is not an easy read but rewards the reader with solid scholarship. Throughout, Meier confronts 20th century commentators (such as the Jesus Seminar) and reveals the degree to which preconceptions have colored their conclusions regarding the historicity of the four gospels. The extensive treatment of John the Baptist, the Kingdom of God, and Jesus' miracles are each worthy of publication as stand-alone texts and would be accounted among the leading works on these subjects. I eagerly await volume three."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must own","review":"This book studies John the Baptist, Jesus' message, and Jesus' miracles. Meier goes through every passage and extracts history from them. He manages to go through every miracle story and determine whether the passage is historcal or not. You just can't find such an in-depth study in too many places. For this reason I think anyone interested in the historical Jesus should own this book (and probably the rest of the series)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best - Keyboard - Ever","review":"I have been using this keyboard for about a year now and I would just like to say it is awesome.

I thought I was buying the 2011 Horror/comedy movie named Dentention in which dane cook plays the principal and there is a serial killer and which also made bloodydisgusting.com's top 10 horror films for 2011. THIS IS NOT THAT MOVIE. What this is, is a not very good ghost movie.Unless the reveiws giving this movie five stars mention that it is a ghost horror movie you should disregard them. I was hoping maybe I hadn't wasted my money because this was stil a horror film but no this movie is simply dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many Detentions!","review":"Most of these reviews are for a 1998 film, \\"Detention\\". I was looking to find the David Carradine film, \\"Detention\\", a horror story. Amazon, or somebody is goofing up these titles. Anyway, the David Carradine film is pretty bad: dialogue like when the teens are dropping like flies and one girl, hearing sounds says: \\"I wonder who that is?\\" I actually turned it off about 3/4ths of way through it, hoping it would get better.

However, I am reviewing the item that I bought from Amazon. The item I recieved was not the item pictured on this page. The item on this page is a DVD in a nice little cardboard fold-out container. This container is durable, convenient, and aesthetically-pleasing. The DVDs I recieved were packaged in a simple, plastic, cheap-o, clamshell container.

Especially tragic is Tim De Laughter's butchering of the lyrics of the sublime \\"Witchi Tai To\\": \\"War spirit's feet are swinging 'round my head\\" instead of \\"Water spirit feeling springing 'round my head\\". A rather different nuance, is it not? Try listening to Jim Pepper's own recordings instead of Robert Charlebois! (Or better, read Pepper's own transcription of the lyrics.) And, it's hard to believe that \\"Kill 100\\" was a \\"hit\\"--the English must be getting really desperate! I give this 2 stars rather than only 1 because the booklet graphics are really cute. I will miss them when I ditch this turkey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome 2D fighter","review":"If you've played games like Street Fighter Alpha 3 or Capcom Vs Snk 2, then you'll love Marvel Vs Capcom 2.

If you're only into 3D fighters like Mortal Kombat: Deadly alliance, Dead or Alive 3, Tekken 4, and all the stuff, then I don't recommend this game to you, but if you're a fan, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the first","review":"Marvel Vs Capcom 2 is 110% better than the PS one orginal.

NOW THE NEGATIVE, it's out of print and resells for WAY too much money, the BG's are HD looking, the characters are NOT, NO Fantastic Four characters, and it has the most annoying music and male voice overs of any fighting game I've ever known. WHY is there some random guy saying \\"JUST WHAT I EXPECTED\\" and \\"I almost Had a heart attack\\" WHO CARES! I don't know WHO you are nor do I give a bloody damn if you're having a stroke! If the creators had had any sense they would have made it THE WATCHER or Galacticus or ANYONE which would have made sense to have characters fighting each other.

ALOT!!! Why did it take so long to come out!!! It was worth the wait. Everything looks the way I played it in the arcade a few years ago. The game blows any fighting game I have away, even Capcom vs. SNK 2!!! Since they were moving it to PS2, it would've been awesome if they had added a few more charcters to each side. Capcom here's some ideas for MvC 3!! For Capcom's side: Vega, Zero, Evil Ryu, Shin Akuma (Capcom vs. SNK 2 version), Guy, Haggar, Yun, Yang, and Eagle. For Marvel: any Spider-Man villain, Jubilee,andanybody else. Plus make the boss have 4 forms (abyss had 3 and Onslaught had 2).

Needless to say once you've unlocked everything you feel an immense satisfaction... But I'll say now NEVER EVER SELL THIS GAME, especially if you like to play with your friends, and family... this game will keep being fun for years to come....But there are only one concern I have for this..1.

Now I understand why I have enjoyed \\"Downton Abbey\\" so much!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is better when you listen to it","review":"I borrowed the book on CD from the library first and liked it so much that I had to buy myself a copy. The book itself was very entertaining. It becomes even better when read by the terrifc Richard Morant.

I am also glad it was short so I didn't have to suffer through more than 265 pages.The nameless first person narrative is not a literary device I enjoy. So that took away from the novel for me.Also, it was just DULL. Plus, I saw the ending come from a mile away. I did not sympathize with Edith at all and - spoiler here---I thought that for her to foist another man's child onto Charles was despicable. Charles was a sap and should have kicked her to the curb."},{"rating":"1","title":"would be better as a work of non-fiction","review":"While Fellows provides interesting observations on the English class system, this is a poorly written novel with an obvious plot.

(Written in first person by \\"actor\\" from an aristocratic background (which is an actual description of author). Jews are described and \\"loud talking\\". There is an underlying polemic which attacks abortion and supports \\"blood sports\\" (rather disgusting English hunting practices). With few exceptions in Mr. Fellowes world, women are either very silly and concerned about how many duchesses they know, or much more importantly having children. Yes it is supposed to be ironic, but underneath the mild comedy is a very parochial, conservative viewpoint. Mr. Fellowes, in addition to his show business work, writes speaches for the Conservative party in Great Britain, and, one suspects, would much prefer the days while there were few non-white citizens, and the Peerage controlled all. . . . left a yucky taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid in every way.","review":"This book is so sly and deft in its storytelling that it belies the seriousness of its social commentary.The writing is skilled, effortless and full of acute observations about men, women, and marriage.

Don't miss this brilliant entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"good insight into human nature!","review":"The author here has an uncanny ability to describe precisely certain emotions in a way that no one else can.

This hilarious portrait of one woman's ascent into the nobility, subsequent fall from grace, and realization that there's something to be said for a life of privilege reveals the quirks of the idle rich in a way most of us would otherwise never see them. Fellowes makes his characters--particularly the well-drawn mother-in-law--human and sympathetic even as they engage in the petty cruelty and downright snobbery suggested by the title.Better yet, Fellowes can out-and-out write, and every page or so you'll stop yourself to note a gem of a sentence that wraps astute observation in the cloth of literary genius. This is, surprisingly, one of the best books I've read in a long while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored. .","review":"I found \\"Snobs\\" a very slow read full of very boring people.

Their last, self-titled album was okay, but the production struck me as a little thin and the songs unmemorable (with the exception of the slower, melancholy ones).On \\"Into the Abyss\\" I was immediately struck by the improved production and songwriting. The guitar tone sounds thicker and the crunch heftier. Peter Tagtgren also uses a variety of vocal styles, from his black-metalish screams, to his death growl, to weird, modulated singing. The songs are much more immediate on this album; excellent riffs abound and the songs stand out from one another. Standout tracks here are the slow, lumbering \\"Resurrected\\" and the chugging \\"Digital Prophecy.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A great debut!","review":"I first heard Into the Abyss on the \\"Goth Rock 2\\" album... The song Banner of the Fray on this CD was very good and it was nice to see that they got a Studio Album. This album is very good. I was impressed by the bands first work. If you are into dark gothic music, this is the album for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hypocrisy's miss o' the day","review":"As times have moved on, Hypocrisy has been a hit-or-miss outfit. While my general rating may be a little low as I enjoy some of the tunes here, Tatgren and Co. seem to be lacking their usual flair and love of diversity. It almost sounds as if they tried a bit too hard to capture the love of your typical extreme metal fan. Some of the songwriting is significantly lacking for this album, as well; most notably with their thrashy tune \\"Unleash the Beast\\", which runs for 5 minutes and contains a total of three riffs (one being a short transitional run). Old-school Hypocrisy fans may be pleased, but \\"Into the Abyss\\" is a little too bland compared to past releases \\"Abducted\\" and the eponymous album."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy","review":"this is terrible to inflate and even worse to deflate! dont buy if you want a mattress for the grand kids its a genuine pain in the bleep!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun Nascar game that manages to nad second place.","review":"NASCAR: Dirt to Daytona is a fun game, but it is not up to the standards set by Nascar Thunder 2003.

It has an entire mode that you can use to do serious racing and do an entire career. It also has the other stuff that all racing games have- a racing mode. You can go through an entire weekend and mess around or try to get ponts and unlock new special modes. It is easy to crash if you set some settings right, but you can adjust the settings to make it so that it is almost impossible to crash too.the only cons to this game would have to be the unrealistic damage. you can turn up the damage to full, and then ram the wall and drive away.otherwise, this game is exellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best physics in any console title to date","review":"Unlock the realistic physics bonus (it takes some commitment), and you're good to go. What you find lacking from games like the Gran Turismo series is actually represented here: losing traction in turns, losing balance during braking, independently-locked wheels, peeling out, internal and external damage, etc. The Gamecube's controller is wonderful for this game, if you don't have a wheel. This is the way you imagined the analog triggers going to work as throttle & brake, with button shifting (although there are other schemes too, if you'd prefer). Quite impressive. This title just misses out on a little polish - not all tracks are playable in every mode, and with just three road courses, the great physics model is sadly underutilized. NASCAR: Dirt to Daytona is a hidden gem, that won't be given its due in video game or racing sim history."},{"rating":"1","title":"If not race fan need not buy","review":"I\`m sure it is a really fun game.

What they fail to understand is that NFL Films does not own the footage from the TV broadcasts and therefore cannot publish such material.The actual documentaries are of an excellent quality, both in cinematography and in narrative. Of course, with narration from the likes of John Facenda and Harry Kalas, the overall effect is multiplied.These documentary films really capture the spirit of the big games, and to have ten of them on five discs, and the season review films, plus extras, represents excellent value for money.

But aside from that, I like this game. If you are a Street Fighter fan this game contains many of the more popular street fighters and has all of the characters from the first marvel vs capcom. If you are a Marvel fan, this game gives great moves to spiderman and includes many of the X-men (but most importantly CABLE).

Dog Food is the best known unknown band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Popski's review","review":"I think the album is wonderful. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I've seen the boys play live and they are so good in concert the CD doesn't quite measure up. However, in any form (live or recorded) the songs are beautifully catchy, slightly disturbing, mildly funny,and very well played. It's also quite simply the best album to come out in the past year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are you hooked yet?","review":"Susan Juby lives up to all expectations with \\"Realist at Last\\". Though it's not quite as hilarious as her first two novels, it is still enjoyable. Alice (the mail character) has decided to be a screen writer now and so throughout the book you get to read her screenplay \\"Of Moose and Men\\". In which she overemphasizes the \\"hardships\\" she must go through, including the fact that her mother is currently in jail for a \\"good cause\\" as Alice's new therapist likes to make sure. Goose has also moved away, sadly for Alice, freeing her up to date other men, all of whom turn out to be older or younger or just not right. But, of course, if you've read \\"Alice, I think\\" and \\"Miss Smithers\\" you're already hooked and didn't need my review, so, happy reading..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jimmy Fallon CD","review":"It's pretty funny but a lot of it is stuff that's already been on Saturday Night Live in a way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Medium At Best","review":"Jimmy Fallon is an excellent impersonator, as seen in the Troll Doll skits, but unfortunately the cd was dissapointing. Save yourself the money and download the troll songs and hammertime. Fallon's a great comedian, but he needs to work on his material before making his next release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not \\"Wild and Crazy Guy\\", but then again what is?","review":"Fallon is the new comedy superstar-to-be of today's SNL cast, and he shows off his talent here... especially his musical impressions, which (if you've seen his SNL work) are as spot-on as Weird Al at his best.However, as others have noted already, this first effort doesn't rank up there with the best from Pryor, Martin and Carlin... heck, not even close. The problem is that Jimmy is almost TOO hip... his delivery and choice of material is spot-on for a single performance in front of a raucous college crowd, but there's not enough humor here to sustain listening over and over. (Think of McDonald's and their \\"1/4 pound before cooking\\" -- then imagine cooking that poor burger three or four times over.)I think Jimmy is a real winner... and, come to think of it, Adam Sandler's first album wasn't his best, either. There's always tomorrow for dreams to come true... I predict we'll see much better from the big JF in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad, sad comedy","review":"I agree that Jimmy Fallon's debut album is not one to miss, but only if you find that someone has discarded it somewhere along the road--and only then if you are going to laugh at him, and not with him. Reading the Amazon.com editorial review of a certain product is usually good for a laugh of its own, but this one really hits the mark on why this album isn't worth your money. I just had to try to balance out this buyer score, it's as if these people own the entire Adam Sandler collection on DVD or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miserably Un Funny","review":"As if his one note tenure on Saturday Night Live weren't enough to ensure Jimmy Faloon's future will go nowhere, this collection of half baked ideas, unimaginatively presented is sure to be the first fully hammered nail in his career coffin.

This is a horrible product."},{"rating":"2","title":"jimmy fallon...hot and hillarious","review":"If you love Jimmy Fallon on SNL, you'll love his cd.

I was angry that they made the graphics look too nice. Suikoden was known for its classic RPG graphics, and I loved them more than the PS2 graphics.This game's plot is very weak and stupid. First of all, you have to follow the story through three different people's lives. If you don't do this in order (no true order is actually specified in the game) then it gets really confusing. You don't understand the plot until you go through everyon's character.This game is so bad, that I dont even consider it a Suikoden. This game is so horrible, that I haven't heard Konami talking about a Suikoden 4. If it is anything like 3, I hope they don't. Go buy Suikoden 1 and 2"},{"rating":"1","title":"I am so tired of this!!","review":"Common sense to me in making a good video game sequal,would be sticking to what made the previous installment/s great...NOPE! That ain't gonna happen in this age! For some reason game developers are almost sadisticaly compelled to add \\"new\\" stuff and completely throw away the tried and true elements that veterans of a series have come to know and love.Suikoden 3 is the fourth RPG that I have played for the PS2 which originated on an older system.And like the other three(Wild Arms 3,Legend Of Legia 2 and Final Fantasy X)it [bites] because they change way too much;almost to the point of feeling like an entirely diffrent game instead of a sequal.I hate to say it,but I think the death of good rpgs is upon us.Fun and traditonal gameplay is being replaced with eye candy and foreign concepts.I'd rather play good ol' dragon warrior on the 8bit nintendo than these peices of junk!I STRONGLY advise lovers of the first two installments of suikoden to rent this game before buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply perfect","review":"This game is great. I spent such a long time making my castle and recruting all of the 108 stars in the game. It is very addicting, you buy this and you'll be pulling all nighters because of this PERFECT game.

They both are great games, but this is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"suikoden 3 letdown","review":"I am sorry. I just bought this game and have been playing it for a week and have come to the following conclusion that it is not all it appears to be. The first two games in the series were awsome but this game has none of the things that made those games great. The game is totally linear with almost no freedom to explore and the 3d graphics do nothing to enhance the game and any similarity to the first two of the series seems to be put in as an afterthought. They attempt to make this a more plot filled game but the plot is unispired. The trilogy system just means you have to go through the same boring plot over and over again with different characters. I looked forward to this game so much and am hugely disappointed. Don't wast your money on this game.

Excellent product but this one is poorly thought out. Look for the set that comes with the additional items and you won't regret it. I do love that the insulated cup keeps my smoothies from thawing before I get a chance to drink them and the cup does not sweat. It's also got a rubber base so it doesn't slide or mark your surfaces.

I make a breakfast drink every morning and it is so nice to just pop the ingredients into the cup and put the blade, gasket and base on and blend away. You have to clean the aforementioned parts of the blender but you don't have to clean a big 40-ounce blender jar every time you make a drink.

I missed this cd when it was released a couple of yrs. ago. I am impressed with the quality of material Gerry Beckley produces. I have not been disappointed with anything he has done and this cd is no exception. This is a great cd to put in the player in the car and take a cruise. My favorites are Here & Now,Keeping the Light On,Warm Gone Gray and Somewhere Somehow though I like them all. The folks who play with Gerry on this cd help make it the wonderful work that it is. Rust Young, Charlies Adelphia and Mimi Parker give especially impressive contributions. Joe S"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Songwriter","review":"Gerry Beckley has consistently shown that he can produce intelligent and enjoyable pop/rock music. This new set of tunes features an all star supporting cast of back up musicians that round things out nicely. Rusty Young of Poco fame lends his pedal steel and other skills to 'Arms' and my favorite drummer of all time, Russ Kunkel is featured on 'Love & Leaving'. The only thing I miss on Gerry's solo stuff is Dewey Bunnell. I love Gerry's unique voice, but I prefer the America stuff where the disc is broken up by songs in Dewey's lower register. A whole disc of Gerry is too much of a good thing for me sometimes. This probably comes from years of saturated America listening! I keep waiting for the 'Dewey' song to come on to break things up. Anyway, you can't go wrong with this CD if you are a fan of America and Gerry's great songwriting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beckley at his best","review":"I have listened to this for a few months now, and I've added it to my permanent playlist.The overall feel of the music and the quality of the songs is very high.Beckley at his best (\\"Clarice\\", \\"Here\\", \\"Till The Sun Comes Up Again\\") establishes a reflective, dreamy, and somewhat melancholy mood, and that is the case here. Instrumentation is perhaps a bit more spare than on his America songs, but he uses horns in some songs to nice effect. The beginning and end of \\"Somewhere, Somehow\\" reminds me of Bacharach. \\"Here and Now\\", \\"Warm Gone Gray\\", \\"I'll Be Gone\\", \\"Arms\\" are quite lovely, deceptively simple love songs. \\"Crying\\" and \\"Saturday Sky\\" are uptempo pop songs.Being Beckley, the songs are all quite melodic, and for the most part avoids the occasional \\"icky sweet\\" lyricism of his lesser songs. Considering how far past 1972 (and the debut America album) Beckley is, this is a surprisingly beautiful, and welcome song cycle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Music","review":"I ordered this because I love Gerry's voice with America and was not disappointed. I've been playing this non stop since I received it a month ago. My husband who is also an America fan doesn't like it because its too mellow for him, not the \\"America\\" sound.

So nice!!!","review":"A very philosophically mature Gerry Beckley comes full circle and lands smoothly in \\"Horizontal Fall\\". Sumptuous melodies meshed with delicious acoustics and veracious lyrics give this masterpiece a secure place in any library or on any ipod playlist. Songs like \\"Crying\\", \\"I'll Be Gone\\", \\"Warm Gone Gray\\" or \\"Here & Now\\" all have a distinct \\"America\\" flavor. The up and coming CD from America to be released in January of 07' will include \\"Love & Leaving\\" which is also included on this solo performance. Very impressive!!! Do not miss this Oh-- so nice CD!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stuff","review":"All the songs are winners. I've listened to Horizontal Fall all the way through more than I have any other CD in years. Every tune is beautifully crafted. The sound is pristine.

The result is the Horizontal Fall smoothie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gerry Beckley, Horizontal Fall","review":"Like Wow!! Bright and Fresh but with That unmistakable G.B. Vocal. I haven't heard The New America Album yet, but this Record, could easily Pass as The Best America Album since \\"Hearts\\". From start to finish the Landscape of songs is Pure Magic. In todays age of disposable and poor rehashed releases, it is A real pleasure to buy a Record where every song is worthy. There's no filler here. While it's unmistakably The Guy from America, G.B. has no fear here to try different sounds and musical textures that makes this Record New and Special. There are some big name guests contributing on this record including Son Matthew B, but having seen America Live I suspect most of the musical magic here comes from the hands of G.B., not unlike Emitt Rhodes or Paul McCartney in his finer moments. This is not a Hard Rock record, But if you like Melody, Sensitive Vocals and Something to Play for Pleasure, This Is It.Can't wait for The Next One G.B. Thankyou. Pete Dacy, Melbourne, Oz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"First off let me say that I have most of America's studio albums and I thought Beckley's Van Go Gan was a fine solo effort...but this CD is very poor. The songs are lackluster and without any hooks to draw you in. America has never been known for having thought-provoking lyrics but the words in HF are just plain sappy. And to finish off this sickeningly sweet album are the album graphics. The front cover looks like an amusement park in the distance at night and on the inside is a picture of Beckley's dad sitting next to an airplane? There may be some vague reference to these \\"themes\\" in a song but I couldn't find them.To be short; just about any of America's previous work, except their latest release, or Beckley's fist solo effort far surpass HF.

I wouldn't say that the pills wore the solely responsible for the weight lose however they helped extremely with providing energy and suppressing appetites.

I didn't change anything in my diet, schedule, or environment..

At a later time I tried 1 pill in the morning and had a less severe reaction but one that was very unpleasant none-the-less.Although I do like the regular Lean System 7, I cannot recommend the Max one.

But for an almost $40 price tag, I expect a lot more detailed instructions, including pictures of each step, rather than just the finished piece. The introduction seems to be geared to beginners, but it contains no basic spinning instructions and very little explanation of the author's techniques. The book itself is very small, making some of the text difficult to read. Spinning books are difficult to review, as it's the sort of very visual and tactile art that really needs to be a video or in-person class, but if you're interested in art yarns, get this one from the library.

The advertised extras are all there, the subtitles and alternate audio tracks are there, but the movie itself looks like some old AVI bootleg, not DVD-quality video. Namely, it's badly interlaced - meaning that any time there's movement on the screen, the moving object breaks up in to off-synch horizontal lines. This is something I don't see even on things like Youtube anymore, much less on a professionally released proper DVD.

A young boy living with his recently widowed Mom is befriended by a group of fairly benign older kids who are marginally into the skinhead scene. There is an actual warmth about the way they take the younger kid in and get him the clothes and the haircut that helps him fit in. They seem like a likable enough and relatively harmless bunch guilty of nothing more than some vandalism.The film takes a decidedly ugly turn when a former neighborhood leader returns from prison and the group splits into 2. From that point on the inevitable descent from racist posturing to actual violence is quick and brutally depicted.A very well done film on many levels and the actors, none of whom I had seen before , are uniformly believable and realistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerful and unforgettable movie","review":"\\"This is England\\" is strong and unsettling in the way powerful and violent literature can often be. The story is a simple one: A youngster, Shaun Fields (in a flawless performance by newcomer, Tomo Turgoose), lives with his mother in England after losing his father in the Falklands during the early 1980's. Bullied, ridiculed, or ignored by his classmates, he is befriended by a gang of skinheads, led by the likeable Woody, (Joe Gilgun).Shaun's role gradually changes from mascot to convert as he begins participating in increasingly horrifying acts of violence until the movie's brutal climax.Like literary classics such as \\"Native Son\\" or \\"A Lesson Before Dying,\\" \\"This is England\\" is as much about youthful initiation and class disenfranchisement as it is about racism. Due to this movie's violent realism, it can be difficult to watch at times, but it captures a period in history, as well as the universality of needing to belong, in a remarkable and unforgettable way."},{"rating":"1","title":"good theme but ...the plot?","review":"The themes of masculinity, and disallusioned youth seeking justice are great themes. I applaud the makers for taking it on. But what it lacks is something key to entertainment: an interesting story.

There was a bit of violence and some good acting but there was much too much talking. Even though it had a some emotional impact, I found it rather choppy and amateurish. I also found it hard to understand the English accents and think that there should have been subtitles for an American audience.

I bought a couple different pairs of shorts to wear underneath them because my thighs always rub together and chafe like crazy. But these are my favorite, and ironically the cheapest. I just bought two more. They're mostly cotton so they wick away moisture even on the hottest, most humid day and honestly I sometimes forget that I'm wearing them.

The waist band is about an inch or so above my navel, and the lower hem ends a couple of inches above my knee. There is, indeed, no tag, and I see no laundering instructions, so I am going to wash them medium (permanent press), and dry on low. I don't think they will shrink much with just 43% cotton, but with 14% lycra, I don't want to wash and dry them too hot or roughly. They will make good liners under shorts to work out, or even under other clothing for \\"curve contol\\". Not bad for about $14. There are not terribly thin, but too thin to wear alone.

This sound comes from multiple joints unit have. Due to the joints, it is very adjustable, but the price for it is this cracking sound.Another thing is that volume control broke after 2 years and one earpiece is often muted.What is good about this headset is that they are portable as they are light and can be assembled in a flat shape so they don't take too much space in your bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"I purchased this to replace a less expensive headset I got from Dell.

The major downfall of this headset, and the reason for 2 stars, is the poor fit and subsequent discomfort and headache after wearing them for one hour or longer.

It probably depends on the style; my glasses don't wrap around behind my ear.If you're suffering with mediocre- or low-quality sound because your computer has a low-end sound card, I'd highly recommend this product, especially if you can get it for under $30."},{"rating":"2","title":"Logitec Personal Notebook Headphones","review":"The headset meets all of my needs for making IP phone calls via my Lenovo laptop.

He loves the headset and so far has had no problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well with Vonage. Be prepared to experiment","review":"Bought this to work with the Vonage \\"V-Phone\\" portable USB VOIP device. It works much better than the cell-phone style headset provided, but be sure to play around with the voice settings first. I called a willing colleague and tested various levels and options before settling on a compromise of volume and quality. Fairly comfortable for an hour or so at a time, and doubles reasonably well as a headset for music playback. Very portable for travel, which is the main goal for me. Use the analog (non-USB) plugs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique design for a headset","review":"Was a little awkward to get used to for the fit but once done it was nice to use. There may be some issues with the USB plug adapter as the headphone jack doesn't work when fully inserted but must be backed off a bit to get both speakers to work. Mic is superb for recording and teleconferencing. This set is still a good value at the special pricing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I got this headset a little while ago. I have found it to be very comfortable. It sounds great when listening to music and it works great for gaming. It sounded great when play UT2004. It's USB adapter is very handy and works good. It nice because it folds up into its own hard case. If you want good sound on the go, for gaming, chating online, or listening to music , i would recommend this headset.It is once again proof of Logitech's great quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect companion when traveling with my MacBook","review":"I purchased this headset to use with my MACBook.

Perfect for travelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not sure it is worth the premium BUT then again","review":"Kind of expensive for what is basically a microphone and headset BUT...it works GREAT (I use the USB connection)...it is very comfortable and sturdy...and the carrying case comes in really handy.I would say probably worth it for anyone that spends a LOT of time making calls/voice chat on their computer.Also a minor plus...the nice behind the head band (as opposed to over the top of the head) DOESNT mess up your hair!!! lolKind of pricey for a headset, but ultimately worth it if you can afford it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd get them again.","review":"These are great.

I wear glasses, and don't experience the difficulty that some people have with wearing this headset.They are not the best music headset out there, but they will pass as mediocre. For the price, it is not bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clumsy, weighty, dumbells.","review":"The components--earpieces and microphone--are actually good quality. The design, however, is plain stupid. If you wear glasses, just forget it.That being said, if you want a pair of dumbbells hanging on your ears, then go ahead. The earpieces do pivot and have a minimum range of horizontal adjustment. But adjusting them so the band doesn't push the back of your ears out is not conducive to best audio quality due the pear shaped design of the earpiece, which fit the ear best in the upright pivotal position."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loditech around head headset","review":"The very long chord is cumbersome. The product itself is NOT very light. The overall quality was pretty good. Noise cancellation etc. The reason for the deduction of starts was due to it NOT being adjustable (as a geadset that's pretty important). So if you have a head that's small it will not work for you as it will just droop in the back & weigh down your ears instead of being supported by the back of your head. I had to return this item & lost money on shipping (both ways) and a 15% restocking fee (avoid AOnline as a company to purchase from their customer service is lacking)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate, sensitive microphone good for voice recognition","review":"PLUS --The microphone works well with Dragon naturally speaking voice recognition software. I'm using it to write this review while listening to the radio and there are very few errors. Also, I like that the cord is nice and long, so you don't necessarily feel tied to the computer. You can move around quite a bit. The headset looks sleek and modern and isn't bulky like many others.MINUS --It might be perfect, if only the headband were more adjustable. This isn't a big deal, but strangely, the width is locked in place and you cannot adjust it to better fit your neck and head. The ear pads are adjustable,but I haven't found that feature very useful.VERDICT --Overall, this is a comfortable headset and a good pick for voice recognition."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing for a reconditioned unit, unsure about full price","review":"Bought this reconditioned, came perfect in the box. A real joy compared to my old logitech headphones much better sound reproduction. If your computer is older I imagine the USB converter is good - but I didn't notice much difference.I am a particular person when it comes to sound, but not willing to pay for it. This exceeded my expectations, plenty of adjustability. Fit and finish are good, but not premium."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre sound quality","review":"These are just \\"OK\\" or average and I would compare the sound quality listening to music or voice (skype) as equal to several other $10 to $20 headsets that I have used. I have not adequately tested the microphone with Dragon dictation yet as my Dragon software will not run on my current Win 7 64 bit computer. Overall a disappointment considering the list price and Logitech brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is broken","review":"I have used it for a while.

Didnt even use the usb portion yet but i am sure it is worth it. excuse the spelling. definatly worth the money. no need for microphone to me as i dont use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three Strikes, You're Out","review":"I would have given this headset 4 or 5 stars if it weren't for the fact that i have just gone through my third pair. I bought them three times and that should say a lot, however, i keep having to buy a new one for the same reason: poorly put together. The ear adjustment just keeps becoming really lose and/or braking. This causes it slide off your ear very easily and constantly needs adjusting.Another complaint, although minor, would be the volume knob. Unless attached to you, it always seems to get in the way and the volume unintentionally changed.Other than that, i really enjoyed the headset. I do not recommend buying it, however, if you plan on using it a lot or are heavily into playing games on your computer."},{"rating":"1","title":"not durable, sound good","review":"worked okay for linux(debian etch) with skype. clear sound, microphone picked up voice fine.i do a lot of traveling with backpack, carried this around in its case, one side of headphones stopped working after month and a half."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked fine until the earpiece broke","review":"The mic and earphones on this headset worked and work great, however the cheap plastic used to make the headset broke where one of the ear pieces connects, so while I COULD technically still use my set, it would uncomfortable and impractical. I had this about two months, using it maybe a few hours a week at the office before it broke on me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please do not buy this product - it is so flimsy","review":"I used it for three days and the unit broke.

The day I recieved this headset, his friends could tell an immediate difference. The voice comes through loud and clear without background noise. The headphones are comfortable and adjustable. I purchased one for myself the next week and I use it for gaming also. It is easy to transport and store with its custom case. As of today more than 10 people that he plays with have also purchased this headset due to it's high quality.Used these sets for over a year and I will never go back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well with Dragon 11.5","review":"I recently upgraded to Dragon 11.5. With my previous version of Dragon, I used a very expensive (over $300) stylus microphone. I was not pleased with the speed nor the accuracy, so I actually stopped using Dragon. I read a positive review of this Logitech notebook headset, and decided that, for around $80, it was worth a try (I already traded away my stylus microphone). I have been VERY pleased with the combination of this microphone, and Dragon 11.5. I use it for medical dictation (even though I don't have the \\"medical\\" version of Dragon). The dictation is fast and accurate. I like the headset (versus the handheld) because the microphone is always well-positioned, and my hands are free to use the keyboard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does its job","review":"I bought this for home use and they were $50 at the time.Was used as headphones for a time in place of speakers...I made some tutorial videos for my dad with the mic...my ears would start getting irritated after about an hour or so of use, meaning my physical ears not from the sound.I cant really give a review from a business standpoint and I never really cared for good speakers beyond a pair of $10-$20 ones but it seems like a good headset. Noise cancellation in the mic works very well. I think it could be more comfortable and the foam around the ear speakers could be more durable as they started to come off after a couple of years.Now that I'm thinking about it I believe these were designed for laptop use which is why they fold up and store in an included case...so its pretty decent for its design but Id rather have paid $30 for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why bother?","review":"This is your typical, often high priced, poorly made, undependable headset. It is so hard to find a high quality and durable headset in one. If you find one let me know. I only gave it one star because the rating system does not allow for zero or less stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shinobi, a waste of time","review":"I have heard that people really liked the game play of Shinobi, but I felt it was really lacking in some areas. Althought the fights were very interesting and actually fun to go through, it ended up being the same thing over and over again. Also, the story progressed nicely, but it you really had no hand in how the story progressed. It was as if you were in a maze and your objective was to get to the other end of the maze, but the only problem is the maze only consists of a solitary line, going from beginning to end.I just do not see any re-play value in the game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shinobi, The Classic Super Ninja is Back!","review":"If your a hard core gamer, you have probably played the Sega game Shinobi. Now 8 years later, Sega is putting out that game for PS2 that couldn't be cooler. In this game, you will play as Hotsuma, a lightning fast ninja swords man, who must protect modern day Japan from evil Demon ninjas . This kick ... ninja can slice through enermys with his katana (sword), run up and across walls like the Matrics, and use ninjyutsu (ninja magic) to obliterate any enemy in his path. This will be an extremely high-speed combat game with very challanging enemys, such as thirty foot tall demons, demons that can turn invisible and even military tanks. This game is going to be a very hard, very bloody, and very intence. If you don't like those kinds of games, don't get it. If you do, this will be one of your favorite games!"},{"rating":"1","title":"beware of this game!!","review":"Beware!!!! i watch all the reviews and thought it was a good game WROGGGGGGGGGG i played for two stages and that was it for me.lost all interest right away. so BEWARE this is a waste of money.im not going to waste writing more because it doesnt ZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzZZZZ sorry i felt sleep, i try to play it again zzzzzZZZZZZZ"},{"rating":"1","title":"all flash, no substance","review":"i had high hopes for this game, and bought it the day it came out. i absolutely loved the old shinobi series, and was glad to see a new installment. but this game fails to take advantage of the 7 years of progress in gaming since the \\"shadow dancer\\" hit the streets for the genesis. the potential was there for this game to follow in the footsteps of the tenchu, metal gear solid, and siphon filter series - open-ended levels, a need for stealth and intelligence, and an arsenal of cool weapons and items. instead, this game is a basic hack-and-slash affair with very little room for improvisation. you have a couple of cool moves, but can fly through levels just jumping around and swinging your sword. aside from the graphics and cutscenes, this game was a HUGE letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed.. Not what I expected!","review":"After seeing this game on TV commercials & on GTV (Games TV on Digital Cable CH.136) I decided to BUY this instead of renting first which you should not do. Anyway, The graphics are looking 32 bit (Genesis) and the gameplay is just like a typical sega genesis game! I agree with the guy below, Falling in a pit is gaurenteed more than your satisfaction with this game. You can tell this was a rushed project! The cutscenes are the highlight of this game, they were cool but the graphics during gameplay ....! The enemy AI is worse than Ninja Turtles & GTA, They might as well be mannaquins! The obstacles were harder than the enemies. The first boss is a helicopter which is lame! I highly recommend Way of the Samurai & Devil May Cry 2 instead if this game. Dante will be able to run along walls in the upcoming sequel! Rent this before buying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Enemies pop up out of nowhere","review":"When i bought this game one of my expectations was that it would have some sort of stealth involved.I mean Ninja=stealth right? they were assasins and spies in fuedul japan, there had to be stealth involved. I was disappointed to find that all you do is go around slaughtering enemies, that literally pop up out of no where! And the reason you kill is, for revenge.Wow! How original. If you like the older sega and nintendo games then this game is perfect. You get: enemies pop out of nowhere, massive slaughtering, nintendo style techno, and levels with the same scenery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Style and Gore","review":"An excellent action packed game. The controls are intuitive and easy to learn; the lock feature makes it even easier to attack. Yes this game is challenging and yes you'll will die, and die again. But isn't that what video games are supposed to be like? I personally love the rotation of the camera to any angle giving you complete views of your surroundings. The graphics are OK and the combos are repetitive, however the characters are well designed and flow in their own stylish ways. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for a challenge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey this is a good game, grpahics aren't everything you now!","review":"this game offers you a great battle system, plus a very good storyline, the characters in the game look awesome, like moritsune(reminds me of sephiroth)Ageha, and hotsuma...it gots a lot of extras, like stage select for example (I will not tell the others cuz I dont wan t to spoil the fun...).The most cool thing to do its a Tate attack (when you do a tate on the air of about 10 kills...yo now you are getting pro)And dont hear that says that this game its to hard,cuz it not that hard...just look at it as a challenge, or a way to remember old school games!..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck!","review":"Okay? I see a lot of great reviews for this game. Maybe it's just me or maybe there is too much hype around this game. I just bought this game and the first thing I noticed is the lame graphics! then I noticed that the scenery is repetitive. Plus people say how shinobi looks cool???? I for one can't find any reason to consider this game worth while. And please don't compare it to Devil May Cry cause it is nowhere in it's league in graphics, gameplay or fighting mechanics. Hell there isn't even a similarity except for the fact that they are exclusive for PS2. This game really blows! It is so apprarent they just put this game together quickly slapped Shinobi on it and put it on the shelf to sell on name recognition alone. Let me tell you on it's merits alone in gameplay it's falls way short! The only thing I found worth while about this game is the CG cuts and that's it! Please rent and do not buy...I'm telling you now or you'll really regret it. Trust me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shinobi is Hard, but fun!","review":"Shinobi is one of those games that won't let you through a stage until you master it. If you want a good game with high difficulty then shinobi is you game. Also if you collect 40 orobo clan coins scattered throughout the game you can play as the original shinobi--Joe Mushasi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"Whatever happened to the Shinobi plotlines in the old Genesis games such as Shadow Dancer, Legend of Shinobi and Shinobi III? What happened to Joe Mushasi and his faithful dog sidekick? What about the evil Union Lizard Corp? None of that is in this. It's just generic hokum and the Ninja dude is the only one to save the day.The graphics are very cool and the soundtrack amiable enough but the gameplay is so boring and gets very old and tired even by the second stage. It was cool slicing the bad folks in half the first few times but when the game takes time out to show them spurting blood for the fifty-millionth time it seriously gets on your nerves.There's no variance or long-lasting appeal to this. It makes me long for the old-school Shinobi. Side-scrolling beat 'em ups such as Shadow Dancer are still better than this. It's very dull. It looks good but it plays poorly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgrace to the original","review":"I remembered playing Shinobi (the original arcade version) when I was a kid and it was the first game I ever beat. That was a great feeling and I'll never forget that. I was really looking foward to this and I bought it the first day it came out. All the other reviews are correct, after level 2 it got repeative (even the graphics)and really difficult. If anyone decides to play this I recommend gameshark codes, you'll need them. I like challenges but this was more frustrating than a challenge. I was very dissapointed with this, they could've done so much better. This game I wished I waited till the price went down, definately not worth the $50, but I went ahead and bought it anyways; bad mistake on my part. Some will like this and some will not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fails on many levels","review":"If you can't handle a full on rant don't read this or my Golden Axe Beast Rider review I did a few months back. So here we go Shinobi PS2 or Shinobi 5 if you are a casual gamer don't bother with this game it's very difficult. It has to be said d**n you Sega you have to bring back an old franchise & like how Sega has been ran since they went 3rd party have f***ed it up & the story is pretty good but sh***y controlls ruin it bad camera angles the controller freezing up I have to skip levels which makes me miss out on a pretty good story & it's about this ninja Hotsuma who is trying to stop this group from resurrecting this Sorcer most of his clan have been killed & Tokyo is on the verge of collapse because of these new creatures called Hellspawn. Other than a good story this game is epic fail to what could have been a epic game. To Sega Shinobi, Golden Axe & Sonic all kicked a** on the Genesis/Megadrive 1989-1998. How about you play the original Genesis games Simon Jeffry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where Do you Get Fun Here?","review":"I personally cant Believe i spent [the] bucks on this game. i never thought that sega made that good of games and they seem to be keeping it that way.

It *is* a light, but helpful, introduction to most of the pifalls of C++ for a person who has worked with Java for some time. The problem is that the approach to memory allocation and the standard library tools are very different in Java and C++, while the syntax of both languages appear to be very similar; the author makes this point clear with examples. Compared with some standard references for C++, with lots of detail and almost thousand pages, this book is very readable and enjoyable. This is not a reference type of book, there are plenty of those out there. It is a book for those who reached OO programming via Java period."},{"rating":"1","title":"good as brief view, tends to analyse unimportant points","review":"The book is nice to read, and shows some important points, but has two main drawbacks: 1.

It has too many cross references, making it sometimes hard to follow if you're not a C/C++ expert."},{"rating":"1","title":"C++ comparison for C++ programers","review":"I am a java programmer trying to learn C++, and find this book VERY hard to follow.Most of the syntax is not explained and too much time is spent explaining subtle details, rather than key concepts. Some of the real differences between c++ and java are clouded with confusing fragments of explanation, mixed with unexplained code.It seems to be more of a comparison or overview for C++ programmers than an introductory book for java developers.I am confused and left reading pages over and over again trying to make sense of this language. I think it would have been easier and quicker to just buy a c++ book, forgoing my java background."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you a crytographer????","review":"... Then maybe YOU can make sense of this book. C++ has some different syntax, some of which is not explained in this book until after chapter 5 (& - the pass by refererence operator for example) -- meanwhile the author gives examples using this unique syntax for over one hundred pages. In addition, my fingers got sore from flipping through all the cross references (See my final comment) It seems to me a well written book would explain something and then build on that knowledge. Instead this book relies on cross referencing that can loose someone new to c++ in seconds flat. Do yourself a favor and find another book.( this is a significantly less irritating example of the silly references riddling this poorly written book.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"This is a good book highlighting the major differences between the two languages.

Fireblade is in between. It has some aspects that feel like a simulator, (it has a harder than usual control scheme), but since it's a console game, it leans toward arcade action.

Michael Veron's 1st golf fantasy/mystery, \\"The Greatest Player Who Never Lived\\" surely have been anxiously looking forward to the release of Veron's follow-up, \\"The Greatest Course That Never Was.\\" This second book is okay but not nearly up to the standards of the 1st book. The premise is just so far-fetched; as my friends asked me, \\"How can there be a great golf course that exists but no one knows about?\\" Veron's solution to this is puzzle is fairly absurd. I won't spoil it here. Yes, it is fun reading -- IF you are a total golf fanatic, and enjoy things like hearing a recapitulation of every shot the protagonist played in an 18-hole round. As the book prgresses, the plot gets more and more ridiculous and the coincidences more outlandish. It is always a fine line asking the reader to suspend belief and indulge in fantasy; Veron pulled it off with the \\"greatest player\\" book but did not with the \\"greatest course.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"An Incredible Story","review":"Charley Hunter, who uncovered Beau Stedman in \\"The Greatest Player Who Never Lived\\" is back and this time he hooks up with Moonlight McIntyre, an old caddie from Augusta National so Charley can tell the story of a secret golf course that was built by none other than the legendary golfer Bobby Jones. This book is fascinating in that you virtually go with Charley and Moonlight to find this golf course and experience the magic of the course as if you were there. It has mystery, intrigue, legal encounters, is loaded with golf history and has stories within the story. It even has a secret within the golf course! Even if you don't play golf, this book is so well written and the golf history blended in so well with the story that it becomes a believeable story that's almost real and thoroughly enjoyable. You can lose yourself in this story and when you get through reading it you feel like you've been a part of it. What an incredible story. Keep them coming!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The thin line between farce and tragedy","review":"Few authors explore the juxtaposition of tragedy, reality and farce as frankly and yet compassionately as Evelyn Waugh. His everyman heroes - to include Crouchback, the central character of this tale - seem intuitively to understand and uncomplainingly accept that rather than representing points on a continuum, tragedy/reality/farce exist simultaneously, and that the only thing a good Englishman can do in the face of the chaos that inevitably ensues is to strive to do his duty, preserve his dignity, and maintain a stiff upper lip. Could be that Waugh is just an adept social satirist - but I suspect his insight has a lot to do with growing up British. Goodness knows, in 3000 years of history the English have had ample opportunity to observe how often farce and tragedy coexist. This story provides many, many examples of both in the run-up to WW2, embedded in a tale that may leave you - as it left me - simultaneously laughing and mourning. Excellent read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I was expecting to greatly enjoy this satire of one English gentleman's mobilization for WWII, but came away bitterly disspointed. I found it very flat and dull, with none of the bite and sharp wit I had expected. The story follows a middle-aged man who comes home to become an officer after living for eight years in Italy. The books plods about as he goes through training and then gets moved all over England with his regiment. It's all rather dreary and slow, and the few moments that twinkle are not worth the time spent to discover them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and disappointing","review":"Very insular and without context.

Unfortunately, the album as a whole does not live up to the standards set by this song. The disc has its undeniably catchy moments, such as \\"Rubber Band\\" and \\"Squeaky\\" (which doesn't appear to be on this amazon version of the CD), and Ryder's delivery of the lyrics has a certain charm, due mostly to Happy Mondays nostalgia, but for the most part the songs are lyrically vapid, pointless, and, well, pretty stupid. It's like an entire album of throw-away novelty songs: one may be amusing for its ability to take a dumb idea like a sex-crazed dad and extend it into an entire song, but ten of them in a row? It's more than my attention span can bear.

Yes of course takes time to get used to controls and you wish you could go faster or do some other things other reviewers have mentioned and have not such a small amount of time for some challenges but other than that it really gives you the feeling of flight and what he goes through. The music is ok but nothing compared to the music from the movie, so i tell you this, make your own mix from the music from the soundtrack and the game really becomes different, no lie. The game becomes more fun. Also some graphics of superman and other characters while in cinema mode could be better but over all this game has almost everything superman fans want."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just got too boring and repetetive...","review":"Superman The Man of Steel seemed like a super game at first. It controls well, has decent graphics, and has all of Superman's powers. However, I didnt even finish this game, since it got so boring and repetitive. It had great potential, but every misson feels the same, and they all are. They are all basically \\"go to point a and destroy those robots\\". And after you destroy those robots in point A, it makes you go to point B,and over again. You can fight villans though. If you are a hardcore fan of Superman comics and stuff, you may enjoy this.

But to no avail because there are no people who populate it. The only difference between this and the N64 game is that it's not a virtual world and it takes a little longer for you to realize the game (is less than par). The controls are horrible, the missions are way to tedious;the designers throw fifteen task at you at once and give you a 2 sec time limit to complete. That's supposed to be fun? This game was definetly rushed and its a shame we consumers have to suffer through it. Designers please take the time to do a game right, beta test it, fix the mistakes.

I'm looking forward to the entire game.I think it's to easy to be critical of a game that got a so-so review to begien with.

The subject of a woman loving two men from the same family is a not uncommon in the romance genre, but rarely is it handled as well as it is here.The writer realistically built tension between the hero and heroine while she imbued in them with a sense on honor that earned the reader's respect and sympathies.What I liked best about this and the best of Bright's other works is that the characters, especially the women, have full lives outside to the primary romantic releationship. The heroine dated other men, had concerns beyond worrying the outcome of her relationship with the hero and a career.This book almost fell into the trap of having a jerky hero who believes all manner of evil about the heroine, treats her like trash and is forgiven after an epiphany and a quick appology. The hero in this book showed real growth, angst and intergrity and the book was the better for it.Well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun,but not extravagent","review":"The purple dragon is back on Gamecube!First,let me get this straight,if you buy this,don't have ANY pre-concieved ideas of what's is gonna be like.You many end up dissapointed...Anyways,Spyro:Enter the Dragonfly is very well put-together game.The plots flows,the graphics rule,and the music is catchy.The levels are VERY detailed and there's plenty of hidden corners and secluded spots to snoop out.My only issue,is that is just doesn't seem to have as much as the Playstation and GBA games.But if you're a die-hard fan of Spyro,or just a fan of pleasurable,entertaining game,this is a good one.Just don't get any ideas of what's it'll be like!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grab Spyro Today","review":"Ever think things can't get any better?

You'll like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as playstation 1 spyro","review":"I love Spyro for PS1 and the only reason I wanted PS2 was for Spyro. Thank goodness I have found other games because this one is not good at all. Spyro's reaction and walking is slower and doesn't move as smoothly as the PS1 versions do.

I would not recommend this game for anyone who truly loves Spyro and is used to playing him on PS1."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this game!","review":"I have always enjoyed the other games, but this one suck. In the other games you visited other worlds, and had really great challenges. But this was only in one little world, and hardly any levels or challenges. I would suggest you not get this game. It was really bad. The only thing that was good was the change in the quality of the graphics compared to the other games, and the extra special powers that Spyro gets. But to be honost, it's not worth having. I mean I beat this game in half a day and I like games that are challenging and take some time to accomplish. Not something that you can beat in half a day. Don't waist your time or money on this game. It isn't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring and easy","review":"This is the worst game ever, definately not a good game.

The music sounds like a retarded monkey in a music shop. The voice acting is so choppy, it sounds like William Shatner after eating a peanut-butter sandwhich with popcorn kernels.

The game lacks for inspiration in other areas besides graphics. The story is just a rehash of the first adventure, which by the way is a classic game.

Long load times and frame rate problems are just a few of the problems. I played this game for 10 minutes and I could not play it anymore. Don't waste your money.

If this is the case, why even study cultural and social diversity--to just check the block and say we're trying to do better? Another thing that bothers me is that much of the research in this text is not updated for this to be a 2007 edition. Statistics from the 1980s or early 1990s?

The play is a witty jab at therapy, sexuality and blind dating. A must have for any Christopher Durang fan.

I didn't know until I was about to buy it, but since I was a big fan of the books I decided to take the plunge, if you will. It's a great version even if you haven't read the book - that way there's elements you haven't seen before, and the whole thing isn't too predictable. As can be expected, the gameplay is excellent, as are the graphics and sound.

DO NOT spend money on this. If you think you must play it, rent it. Frankly, I rented it and I'm depressed that I paid Blockbuster $5.99, it wasn't even worth that. Game play is completely boring and campy. If you're a LOTR fan, play Two Towers by EA. It is 1000 times better than this. It has exciting, challenging, pulse-racing game play as opposed to this snooze-fest. Two Towers has actual movie clips throughtout and even has cast interviews that you unlock after beating levels. The movie cast does the character voices and the characters look quite a bit like the actors. In FOTR, they are cartoony imitation people. The whole thing is incredibly lame.I supposed if I hadn't of played Two Towers, this game might have been better. But after seeing how EA did it, this leaves a LOT to be desired. I definately say rent, don't buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thoroughly Disgusting","review":"After waiting for 30 minutes to get through opening dialogue and the never-ending loading screens, I was relieved that there actually was a game part to this... until I started playing.

Later in the game you get help from Strider, Gandof and all of the other characters from the book (if you read the book). When everybody is together, it is very cool because you have to fight lots of orcs and other monsters. Im not going to tell you but at the end, you (Frodo,Strider or Gandof) and everybody else together will get a big surprise! Though 50 bucks its worth it! I hope this review will influence you to get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont buy this game","review":"this game was a great dissapointment. although you got to play three different characters there were no special moves and the whole game was not challenging whatsoever. there are parts that have nothing to do with the book, and it took me about 3 hours to beat the game. it's not worth 50.00. so dont buy this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible game, avoid at all costs....","review":"Wow, what a let down. Here's the short version.1. Horrible control. Very awkward, especially the camera. Worst camera I've seen in a game like this in a long long long time.2. Short/small/linear. Laughably short.

Uses a similar engine (the good parts done by surreal), but just a much much much better game, in every way imaginable.I certainly wouldn't recommend buying this, and I be hard pressed to even recommend renting it, it's not even worth the 6 bucks it cost to rent....what a let down, avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Even For Free","review":"I made a terrible mistake and bought this game for $49.99 the day it came out. If I waited a month (which I wished I did) I could've bought it for $20. This has to be by far one of the worst games I ever played. Needless to say I played it for about 45 minutes and quit, I never played it again. I thought it was boring, graphics and movement were terrible. Honestly if someone gave me this game for free I wouldn't take it. I love the books, all 3 movies were great, this game shouldn't exist.

Very little of Tolkien's trademark atmosphere is present in the game, and none of the environments truly feel like a living world at all. Key sequences are diminished by cut corners or perhaps technical limitations, such as the Council of Elrond scene. Apparently there were only so many character models to go around, as the council consists solely of the nine members of the Fellowship and Elrond."},{"rating":"1","title":"better off renting","review":"I bought this game three days ago.

But looked at as a fan of JRRT as well as a gamer I am compelled to give FOTR a 5 star rating. The graphics (which require a 128 meg card for full expression) are a gorgeous representation of middle earth, especially the Shire. The most enjoyable aspect of the game is not gameplay but rather the music and mood and walking around the Shire. Later games in this series feature more action and swordplay but FOTR more truly captures the world feel of JRRT's creation. This game is more suited to lovers of the book than fans of the movie and perhaps should be played more in the spirit of a renactment than an open-ended adventure."},{"rating":"1","title":"A weekend renter","review":"Actually, rent two games, because you'll finish this one in under 3 hours, and won't want to play it again (NO REPLAY VALUE WHATSOEVER!!!). There's enough to keep you fairly entertained for that time period, but boring battles, lame bosses, and an overall lack of challenge will make you wish you had looked deeper than that \\"official\\" Tolkien product. Another complaint that I have is the lack of autosave at the end of each mission. The fact that this game so religiously follows the book and works some of the minor passages into entire levels saved me from rating this game a 1.This game is perfect for people too lazy to read the first book in the trilogy, but who want to see all the stuff that got left out of Peter Jackson's first LOTR film. Even so, my advice to you is this: save yourself [some money]by going to see The Two Towers instead of buying this game. You'll be far more entertained."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rental Only","review":"After beating this game in one night, i realized that i had basically wasted my time. The game can be fun at times, but not often. Aragorn is fun, but he is lacking combat moves. If you're a fan of the movie as well as the book, i would recommend this game as no more than a rental. This game claims to be based off the book, but there are lots of lines, word for word, from the movie, and there are many levels and tasks that aren't in the book or the movie. Bottom line, if your looking for a good LOTR game, buy the Two Towers.

The way Sonny escapes from the traps is even sillier. And the exotic spiritualism is never explained in a way that makes any sense. After a while it is so much Mumbo Jumbo. The shame of the matter is that Anaya is a prose master, and the images he conveys are effective.

Not as challenging as lets say pokemon, but it took my sister and I playing together about 3 weeks to finish and it was an enjoyable experience.

There are many missions and such to do. If you've seen the show it is also for any age range, and take a look at the price cheaper than most games this is aw deal if I ever saw one.

You go around finding all the ham hams and getting them back to the clubhouse. What you think it sounds ez?!? Well I haven't even begon. Some of the Hamsters are very stuborn and you have to convince them to come back to the clubhouse. To do that you have to learn new ham chat words (its the hamtaro language). Sometimes you even have to find them things before they will come back. It took me about 2 weeks before I got all the Ham-Hams. After that you have to learn all the ham chat words.

Usually when you find a collection, there will be one good movie and the others are inferior. This collection you will find that all four movies are superior.

Each movie is a classic and could stand alone, but when put together in a group it makes this one of the greatest finds you will find in a long time. And the price is amazing. You will not be disappointed in this collection and even if you only like one of the stars or one of the movies', it is still a good bargain.GLS"},{"rating":"2","title":"4 Movie Marathon","review":"Very good and inexpensive movies.

Carl Koch, on the other hand is a professor of education, human development, and English at Saint Mary's University of Minnesota Graduate School. If you are looking for a work on the Church by a true historian, look elsewhere. I recommend strongly the works of H. Daniel Rops, Phillip Hughes, and the especially readable Warren Carroll (History of Christendom series is superb).The work itself is the typical liberal-'catholic' dogma. Luther was a great guy that had it right and was wronged by the Church. ..those familiar with liberal garbage can probably guess the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks nice but installation instructions are terrible","review":"I love the way this looks in my kitchen. It is beautiful! I too saw the globes and thought... \\"ew\\" but it looks completely different than what I thought once I got it up.However, the installation instructions that I got were flat-out wrong. If you hook it up yourself and it doesnt light up, have someone look at the instructions to tell you what is wrong with them, because its probably not the lamp itself. I'm a novice DIY but I have put in a fair share of light fixtures. I've had instructions that were vague, but this is the first time I looked at it and said, hey, that's just flat-out wrong. I'm glad I already knew my way around a light fixture.It looks absolutely fabulous in the kitchen, though. Gorgeous.

Against the Clock is none of that. This is a superfical hour-by-hour laundry list of what happened. During hour 456 deer number 38 crossed the road in front of me. On hour 675 I stopped for gas.

That was my big mistake. Lots of brief scenes involving too many people to enable you to be able to keep up with them. The very short second episode did not make things any more enjoyable. A complete lack of anything resembling a decent script made this a very tedious affair. Performances were okay most of the time.

Soon after the front cover of the adapter fell off and would not stay on. Therefore, in early January I sent the unit back and they sent me a new adapter.

So did the GI Joe","review":"If you grew up watching GI Joe and to satiate your nostalgia, you watch the old series then find yourself disappointed by its tameness, well Warren Ellis and Justice League's Joaquim Dos Santos have something for you. GI Joe: Resolute is the 80s series all grown up. No more parachuting out of exploding planes. If COBRA troopers and Joes shoot each other, they take casualties. If they fall, they die. And so on. There's even a graphic assassination scene within the story. Just as COBRA Commander said, they laugh at me before. Now, they'll die (or something like that).The story starts fast and never lets go. Fan favorites Gung Ho, Ripcord, Duke, Flint, Snake Eyes, Roadblock are all here and meaner than ever. It's satisfying action that was missing from the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good movie!

It's GI Joe for ME, NOT my kids.The movie is fantastic and as an adult who never felt the need to \\"outgrow\\" cartoons I enjoyed it throughly.As others have said, if you were a Joe fan as a kid in the 80's then buy the movie, you'll love it.

The storyline isn't even close to a western themed game. I know this is an RPG style western but it fails in that respect. It follows other RPG game formats to closely. It seems the creators of this game were too scared of losing RPG veterans interest in the game. A new concept for RPG would be most welcomed. I was hoping for a Wild West adventure but this is too much like other RPGs what a shame.This game had so much potential.Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland, Predictable, Terrible RPG, Not worth your time!!!","review":"Wild Arms 3 is a terribly mediocre RPG that simply never should have been made.The Good:Relatively nice cel-shaded graphics. Period. Nothing else.The Bad:Incredibly flat characters, predictable and cliched storyline, repetitive and stupid battle system, lack of any good enemies, you can't get any new guns, music is very limited, doesn't sound like the Wild West.Conclusion:Wild Arms 3 could've been a good RPG worth 4 stars with some improvements, unfortunately the developers obviously didn't try very hard. Don't even bother with this game. Not worth your time at all. Try Final Fantasy X, Final Fantasy X-2, Dark Cloud 2, Suikoden 3, or Grandia 2.

I see that there a lot of mixed reviews on the game, and I don't understand why. The game itself is made very well. The fighting engine in the game is very fun, and makes you actually think proactively, since you make all the moves for the entire turn at the same time, and need to anticipate what the computer will do. The characters are interesting, although the prologue's can be slow. The game play is different, and the different story lines are unique and exciting. Some games can be so repetitive and predictable, but this story line was written well IMO."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible...just horrible","review":"Well I am very disappointed...very.Here are the bad things.- Horrible graphics- corny storyline- no real voices- same old battle system.what else?

People get mad over having to do random battles after your \\"ecn\\" gauge goes to zero are dumb.

It's light weight, but feels solid. It generates copious amounts of steam, heats up fast, stays on for a decent amount of time (before automatically shutting off), and best of all, is stable on its rear end.

The game was made for an arcade and therefore works properly with arcade controls, in this case the big sniper rifle. Playing this game with joysticks is such a pain. I would give this game five stars if I was playing it in an arcade. Aiming and shooting with that big gun is simple. You can move the gun to a target as fast as you want. With joysticks, however, you go at a constant rate. If you have the speed set too slow you will never beat the missions before you are killed. If you have it too fast and go too far, you have to tap the joystick over bit by bit until you are on target, in the meantime you're getting shot by 10-20 people and you have NO chance.

He seems to harp away (one can only suppose this is his strongest belief) on the fact that Abby was killed at the same time or AFTER Mr. Borden. Coagulated blood, cool body and stomach contents mean nothing to Mr. Masterson, for he does not believe it! And if she killed both victims at the same time, she must not be quilty! Huh? Save yourself money and let this self-published \\"eureka\\" stay where it is...presumably lining Mr. Masteron's shelf. If I can save one person the cost and time wasted reading this drivel, I will consider it my contribution to \\"Lizophiles\\" everwhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Kindle Edition Is Not Fairly Described","review":"The book is full of photographs and document reproductions.

The first two-thirds where Masterton deals mostly with just the facts (though somewhat selectively) are the strongest part of the book. The last third where he theorizes is less effective. He's perhaps not a very convincing theorist, but he writes well and this book is a really fun read, with a few humorous witticisms thrown in.David Rehakauthor of \\"Did Lizzie Borden Axe For It?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Too cutesy to be clever","review":"I have read many Lizzie books and this one is among the worst. Mr. Masterson is sarcastic and obnoxious in much of the book. He mentions how he will prove to us forensically that Lizze didn't do it but there are no forensics there. There is nothing but wild supposition and lots of made up facts.The truth is that no one really knows who killed the Bordens. It really is that simple, no matter how muddy Mr. Masterson makes the waters."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Historical Record Cooked by a Chemist","review":"We know \\"Lizzie Didn't Do It\\" because that was the verdict in 1893. The first half of the book is best as an introduction to this case. In the second half William Masterton creates stories about the other suspects. Presumably they were all investigated by the Fall River Police Department and ruled out as suspects.The two main suspects, based on other books, was Joseph Carpenter (the former bookkeeper who embezzled funds from Borden's business), and William Brayton (the member of the family who was swindled out of property by Andrew Borden). Both had alibis for the time of the murders.William Masterton concocted a story that Abby was killed after Andrew! This is historical nonsense! The alarm was raised not long after Andrew was killed, the home was guarded, there was no opportunity for Abby to have returned home after Andrew's death. You can only guess at the reason (or prejudice) for this.William Masterton didn't solve the crime."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay, but could do better","review":"a well made glove, but the catching-webbing is not big enough for a softball.

I have every one of their CDs and their sound changes on each album. This album is very chill and energetic. It's a weird mix, but they make it fit. Seriously, I believe Brand New keeps rock music alive. If it wasn't for them, I'd probably give up on rock. I love them. All 3 of their CDs have been masterpieces. Check every CD out and check brand new out live, they're amazing. I've seen them numerous amounts of times and don't intend to stop. I hope I get another 20 years out of them.

I can't recommend it enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vinyl goodness X2","review":"I won't go into a review of the musical content, as the CD has been thoroughly reviewed here. We purchased the Vinyl collectors edition, and have to say were were really happy with the quality of the pressing, and the overall packaging. Ours was pressed on two platters of white vinyl (while it is a single CD, it is a 2 album set on vinyl), which was a really nice touch. While most folks will choose the CD version, this collectors edition would make a great gift for the Brand New fan, if they have a turntable or not as they will really appreciate the homage to musical times past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than ever","review":"I've been a Brand New fan for a long time, and this album has only increased my love for such an innovative, talented band. Many bands change their styles to please more people to become more famous, but Brand New has not done this. Instead, they continue to grow in their own style and grow in popularity anyway. This album includes Jesse's thought-provoking lyrics, awesome guitar parts, and meaningful melodies and harmonies fans have come to expect.

They're a great band and I absolutely adore Jesse Lacey but what happened? Yes I understand artists have to evolve but I think this album really deviates from what they were doing before. I fell in love with the punk/pop tunes, not some strange ambiance music they probably use as background music on movies.I don't agree with any of the reviews, particuarly the ones who say the instrumentals were the best songs. They're boring to say the least. The song I enjoyed off this album was Millstone, but that didn't have a lot of playback value.If you want to get into Brand New, BUY DEJA ENTENDU! That is by far their best album. I just hope that Jesse, who I must say is incredibly talented, will not follow in Thrice's footsteps, who also made the mistake of \\"evolving\\" and creating a \\"mature album\\" of absolute [...]..Bring back the punk sound!

It is quite rare that you find a band that alters its sound from album to album. Brand New has managed to change their sound with all THREE of their CDs.The Devil and God is something totally unique, something extraordinarily different from Deja Entendu and Your Favorite Weapon. The Band continues to produce amazing lyrics, catchy riffs, all combined with marvelous complexity. Each song is different in feel, yet equal in greatness.This CD is so different than the other two, it is sometimes hard to remember that you are, indeed, listening to Brand New.

It will entertain children at any age, in many different ways; Reading, Rhyming, Counting, Animals, Things they do, Where they live and so on.

However, there was a good sale at a local department store and I decided to buy it. I was not disappointed and am very happy with the game.The story line is nice and the graphics are very good. You'll be kept very busy as there are numerous challenges and things to constantly find in the game. The issue about the yo-yo weapon is somewhat valid. It isn't easy to control, but you can master the device after some practice. After that, you should be able to enjoy the game to its fullest. When I first started this game, there were no load times at all. The game was so seamless that I didn't even know that the game had started after the first video sequences were finished. :)For an action-adventure game, HAVEN will give you lots of entertainment value for the buck as well as a very big world to enjoy and explore."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"It's not often that I regret spending a mere $5 on a game...but this game really makes me want my $5 back. The graphics are cheesy (worse than some ps1 games), the dialogue is corny, the music and sound effects are irritating. I found myself muting the volume at times to make gameplay more tolerable. Some levels are ridiculously easy, some are ridiculously hard. There's no real climbing skill level. Many of the levels get monotonous, making you perform the same kind of actions over and over and over again. The story could have been good, but all the other elements drag it down. A sore disappointment. Never played a game by these people before and I doubt I will again."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst hype ever!!! do not buy this game","review":"though ambitious in design Haven fails in every way.

The game is hard by virtue of it's controle issues not beacause it presents anything challenging gameplay wise. Basically Haven is not fun to play, period.also the first thing you see upon placing this game in your ps2 is the word loading flashing over and over.... for a game ment to never have no load times why did the developer decide to start with a loading screen when it could have eaisily made some opening animation ot cover this up... just like everything else in this game sloopy slow and devoid of any thing closely resembling creativity..."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD","review":"Satisfied with product.

Why put signatures of enthusiast Maltin and Roy Disney on it when this means nothing?So not only these shorts are a thing of the past, even good DVD-quality is - just a few years after ists promising beginnings!

Until this year, they have been of excellent quality. However, this year, with Disney Rarities and the Chronilogical Donald, Vol 2, I was very disappointed.The selection of material, in both the new additions, is exemplary, as usual. The quality of that material, however, is what leads to this poor review. Most of the material looks like it was untouched, and certainly not remastered as the packaging would suggest, before being transferred to DVD. Given the unforgiving nature of the medium, the material really looks poor. So poor that it takes away from any value this set might have had to a collector, and poor enough that even a casual viewer is going to be left unsatisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some people like being lied to..","review":"I, on the other hand, don't.

If you aren't inspired to boycott this product simply because of it's shoddy-looking material, you'd think you'd at least take offense at the fact you were lied to. Non-directly of course, because Leonard Maltin and these tins have built a very good reputation; you assume you're going to get the best when you see the signatures on the back.

The author provides little real analysis and has only a limited grasp of the actual historical source base, instead working through the translations of others. The result is a well-intentioned, but ultimately unsatisfying work full of both minor and major mistakes of fact and interpretation.

Then there's the version I saw in gym class, where the cumming monologue is edited out. I want to know if this one has the cumming or not. I like the cumming.

My favorite episodes are the ones dealing with the Oberon, Titania, and their Children-on this DVD that is The Mirror, City of Stone, Avalon, and Heritage. I love magic, and I love fairies, and this does a commendable job of not portraying them as overtly cute and charming, instead they are flawed, arrogant, awe-inspiring, and helpful when they want to be.This series indirectly led me to so much, studying folklore, resurging interest in animation, and so much more!

That episode, with its twists which I will not divulge here, demonstrated the imagination and sense of fun that the creators have.I started to watch Gargoyles regularly, and found it to be a series with incredible range: from the absurd and hilarious to the dramatic and suspenseful.Even if you were only moderately impressed by the first season set, which was released last year, I fully recommend purchasing Gargoyles -Season Two, Vol. 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Show Yes, but Poor Image quality!!!!!!","review":"I'm so upset!

It has a good amount of action but at the same time, always ends with a good moral for the story at the conclusion of each show. The animation is excellent, both the backgrounds and the characters are beautifully done. The voice actors are great and were well picked and the sound tracks are beautiful. But, most importantly, Gargoyles has excellent story lines. Every story in the show draws you in and makes you to see more.My only disappointment is that they have not released volume 2 of this season yet. Hopefully in the near future! This is an epic cartoon series and a great addition to anyone's DVD collection.Here is the link to the first season of gargoyles as well.Gargoyles - The Complete First Season (Special 10th Anniversary Edition)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Defenders of the Night","review":"After ten years, these episodes are still as amazing as they were when I first saw them.Season 2, Volume 1 continues the tale of Goliath and his clan; adventures unfolding around them as they continue to adapt to the modern world. Greg Weisman shows us again and again that he is an incredible story-teller, with believable characters, adventure, romance, complex villians... the list goes on and on.The quality of the DVDs themselves is better than when I saw them on the television all those years ago; the colours stand out far more, the images are crisp and clean, and the sound is great. All in all, it's a great view - not just for the plot, but for the eye-candy as well.This item is a great buy; very worth the money and a must-have for all Gargoyles fans.Ten years and we're still going strong!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Opening up the World ...","review":"Season two of Gargoyles builds upon the meticulously laid foundation of season one. Those first thirteen episodes introduced us to our characters, gave us a small tour of the world they inhabit, but now we get to truly *know* them. With this first volume of season two, there are no filler episodes, no moments that are unnecessary. Instead we have an ever-widening world: new connections are realized between characters, the third race (Oberon's Children) is introduced (Puck and Brent Spiner fans, rejoice!), and the Gargoyles embark on a new stage of their lives. These are the episodes that confirmed this as my favorite tv show of all time. No, that's not quite right. These are the episodes that took this series from the level of an exceptional tv show and made it an active and engaging part of my everyday imagination. It challenged me as a viewer and as a learner, and encouraged me to explore the different stories and legends it presented."},{"rating":"2","title":"WE LIVE AGAIN!!!","review":"Fantastic!

The stories are intricately crafted, the voice acting is superbly delivered and the animation is usually outstanding. My only hope is that the rest of the series is released soon! It would be a shame to have only half of this season out on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still amazing ten years later","review":"As excited as I was about season one coming to DVD last year, season two is even more exciting. This was when the series really began to branch out, to deepen and expand its storylines, to explore all sorts of new territory Disney had never dared to explore before.Supporting characters included everyone from Puck, the fae trickster, to Odin, the Norse god; from MacBeth, king of Scotland, to Arthur Pendragon, high king of Britain. We discovered the secret of Demona's immortality, traveled back in time with Xanatos, visited Avalon with Goliath, and learned the fate of the gargoyle eggs orphaned in 994.Every episode answered old questions and raised new ones, gave us insight on the characters, and simply entertained us as it did. I can't ask for more than that. I can't recommend any show more highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"gargoyles","review":"I got into Gargoyles late.I just happened to be channel surfing and caught John Forsythe's voice then to my amazement Jonathan Frakes needless to say I was hooked.Star Trek (all of the series) are among my favorite tv shows so I listen for the voices.I am far from young I even got people in their 60's hooked.Not a traditional kiddie show,great for adults too."},{"rating":"2","title":"sit on it","review":"i don't own this dvd set yet and I'm iffy about buying it simply because it's not even a full half of the second season.

I ordered it anyway (it all looked legit) but my perfume has arrived today and even though it smells the same (the longevity of which has yet to be determined), the box and bottle do not state 'Giorgio Beverly Hills' anywhere ! The paperwork attached says it, but the box does not. And the bottle does not even have the words 'WINGS' on it. I definitely remember my previous bottle having the name in gold letters along the side of the bottle.

At the very least if you insist on getting this, for the sake of the lives of your future pets, cut off the astronaunt by his attached cord.

What more is there to say? Spindle's End celebrates our ability to make our own choices, even if we're cursed at our christenings by evil fairies. This novel is perfect for young and old alike: unlike Deerskin, which was only for adults, or Rose Daughter, which had a somewhat high reading level. Get this book for yourself or any young person looking for his or her own path in life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fairy Tale Read","review":"I really enjoyed the book \\"Spindles End\\" by Robin Mckinly. It is a different version of the classic tale of \\"Sleeping Beauty.\\"I would recomend this book to anyone who likes romances, adventures, or fairy tales. This book combines all three perfectly. I loved how the main character(Rosie) was very different than you would think a princess would be like. She is not so pretty, she is a smiths apprentice, and hates wearing dresses. My favorite Rosie moment was when she cut her long blond curly hair short.On the Princesses name day Briar Rose was cursed by the evil fairy Percinica. the curse was that on the princesses 21st birthday she would prik her finger on a spinning weel and fall into a poisoned sleep. The story is about Rosies life growing up in hiding,yet she doesn't know that she is the princess.I rated this book a four, because it was exiting, heart warming, romantic, and kept you on the edge of your seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"an okay read, but an excellent retelling","review":"This is a magical retelling that will certainly keep the attention of any adult, but is appropriate for a child of any age. One thing I particularly love is the tomboyish characterization of the main character. I think that young girls could learn a lot from Rosie, about love, independence, and friendship. It does take place in a fairytale land, so even readers of Fantasy will have suspend their disbelief. By which I mean, it is fully part of the fairy tale world - there is plentiful magic, enchantments, and animals can speak. At the same time, Rosie and the other characters don't act wooden and stereotypical.Another item of note was that it kept my interest from the first page. Robin McKinley has a great writing style which really sweeps the reader away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spindle ends...finally","review":"You know how you think you don't like Thai food, or MacDonalds, or crayfish; and then you go for ages without eating any and you think, \\"Hey, maybe I'm remembering it wrong\\" and you try it again and go 'OK, so THAT's why I don't like Thai food.\\" This is how Spindle's End made me feel about YA historical fantasy. I *love* retold fairy tales, and Sleeping Beauty is one of my favourites, but this is so muddled up and tangled with clauses and double-negatives and just plain dull writing that I couldn't enjoy it. Also, nothing dark or sexy about it, without which retold fairy tales are just..fairy tales. Unlike say,Happy Ever After (Definitions)which was a least very cute and clever, there's just nothing here outside the cliches. I don't mind books that are frustrating or disturbing, but being boring is just a deal-breaker. I coudlnt' wait to reach the end of this particular spindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can only say this..........","review":"This book was excellent, the weaving of fairy tales and reality. If you read this I recommend Clementine by Sophie Masson."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Drag","review":"This was one of the worst books I've ever read. There were about thirty pages devoted to just WAITING. I mean, who wants to read for thirty pages about how Rosie doesn't like how she must wait? It took me two weeks to finish this book, an all time high for me. The pace was so slow that I couldn't wait to finish it. This was a 400 and something page novel that should have been about 100 pages long--or less.I LOVED Chalice, Beauty, the Blue Sword, and Hero's Crown by Robin McKinley, so I was very disappointed by this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"couldn't finish it","review":"I LOVE \\"Beauty.\\" It has been one of my favorite books for over 20 years. I feel pretty much the same about \\"The Blue Sword\\" and \\"The Hero and the Crown.\\"I couldn't even finish this book. Typical of me, I felt guilty and blamed myself at first, but I finally got over it.Robin McKinley, in my opinion, has become what I call a \\"Director's Cut\\" author. She doesn't edit enough. Instead of being tight and fast-paced, her later works tend to bog down in a slow-moving morass of details. Trying to enliven the slow journey from one plot point to the next by beating the reader over the head with a soapbox doesn't help.Sorry, Robin, but you just don't do it for me any more!*Later editFunny how people change. This summer I've read both \\"Rose Daughter\\" and \\"Spindle's End\\" and loved them. What before seemed to be an endless morass of detail has suddenly become a rich tapestry of story. Hmm. Go figure.Sorry, Robin. Guess I was wrong!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spindle's End: Robin McKinley","review":"Sleeping Beauty is perhaps the most passive fairy tale heroine. She is threatened, pricks her finger, sleeps for a long time and wakes up in time to get married. A lovely, languid lady whose role in the tale is simply to lie there.Not Rosie, the threatened princess of \\"Spindle's End\\". She has far better things to do with her time and an attractive cast of characters to assist her.This is another marvellous effort by McKinley, both enchanting and convincing. The author has that certain rare talent of constructing a world which is truly 'faerie', instead of extruded fantasy product. Compelling, delightful and completely satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit slow and somehow un-edited","review":"I bought this after having read several other McKinley books and loving them to pieces. This one was much slower and dryer. Also, I got the impression that the editing was poorly done, or not done at all. There were sentances that didn't end, and jumps in action that made no sense. I found the ending a bit unsatisfying too, but that is strictly opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as Rose Daughter or Beauty","review":"I love fairy tales! I was so excited to see the author of Beauty had another retelling. Spindles End has me very confused. I am plugging through it and hope when I am done with it a second time I can give it more stars. I would not recommend it for younger readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my style","review":"This book might be great for some people... I just wasn't one of them. I like Robin Mckinley, I loved \\"Beauty\\" by her, and I really really wanted to love this book... but I didn't. I would advise anyone interested in buying it to make sure they read the first few pages of the books first. If the style didn't bother you, and your mind didn't start to go numb then this might be the book for you. And more power to you! But don't just buy the book because it's written by Robin Mckinley... in my humble opinion it's definately not her best work. For me it drug on and on and on, I couldn't even finish it, I got halfway through and decided I couldn't handle the migraines the book was inducing. But that's just me, like I said read a couple of pages and decide for yourself. If you dont like the first couple of pages though... don't expect it to get any better... it doesn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitter Disappointment","review":"It took me nearly a month to read this book. I kept slogging along because i really wanted to like it, and because I like McKinley's writing, but this book was s-l-o-w. One reason it took so long was it was just too easy to put down. The real reason, though, why I'm only giving it one star is because the ending was a huge disappointment. I don't want to say too much and ruin the ending for anybody else by giving something away. I'll just say this was one mess of an ending. I'll read more McKinley, but I won't re-read Spindle's End."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stands Out...As a Bad Book","review":"I'm surprised at all the good reviews this book got. Not to be snide, I just genuinely am.This book looms in my memory as the one book I had to drag myself to finish. A book that made me tear up with boredom. The plucky heroine wasn't likable, the names were all forced and strange (none making sense in a universe together--more like an assortment of characters from different books) , not on the unique side, really.I thought any originality forced and unfounded, and wished it would have turned out better for me, especially as the \\"magic dust\\" theory was such a nice start.The ending wasn't predictable, but it was trying so very hard NOT to be, it couldn't possibly have been anything but what it was: Dull.With all these good reviews, and me not having read it in years, it might be worth trying, but I stand firm: take it out of the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Robin McKinley's great but this one lost me.","review":"I'm an avid reader and usually love Robin McKinley but this one was painful to get through. At first, I enjoyed the plot but by the second half, it stopped making sense. The entire ending seemed pointless and unpurposeful, and although Petunia's love plot was nice, Rosie was in love with a 40 year old man. I'm sorry but if you want to read Robin McKinley, read The Blue Sword."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't as good as her other books.","review":"Out of everything i've read by her, this was the most dull. she went into such monotinous detail about EVERYthing. it got a little old. in the end, she was so unclear and poof! it was over before you could figure out what was going on. i found the ending unsatisfactory for more than just how unclear it is. but if i say more, it'll give the ending away."},{"rating":"1","title":"This re-telling of a classic fairy tale put the \\"sleep\\" in Sleeping Beauty","review":"Wow - talk about a slow read! The tale of \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" is one of my very favorites, so I picked this up with great enthusiasm. Unfortunately, this re-telling failed to capture the magic part of a fairy tale retelling. I just didn't enjoy it at all. Maybe it was a case of high expectations making it seem worse than it was... McKinley definitely displayed some originality in the story itself, but overall, it was the style was that spoiled the book. No actual action took place at all... And the verb tenses were almost all passive, making the novel all just \\"telling\\", resulting in a very slow-going and boring book! What a disappointment! I have enjoyed McKinley's books in the past, but this really isn't a good example of her talent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like slogging through a marsh","review":"I'm a big fantasy fan, so I was interested to find this retelling of Sleeping Beauty. Unfortunately, I was not impressed. The author's writing style (at least in this book; I haven't read her others) was *very* slow. She seemed to have a problem with sentences shorter than, say, 9 words. Also, she never said anything directly, which I found infuriating at times.Still, the basic plot was mostly interesting. The ending did leave me scratching my head, however. Overall, I would not recommend this book... too distracted, confusing, and s-l-o-w."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slow too unrealistic","review":"Though I'm an avid fan of Robin McKinley's books, this one seemed to drag on forever. Every once in a while it was enjoyable, but the characters are odd and pretty forgetable. Unlike most books I read, where there is a clear picture of what is happening in my head, this one seemed cludy and fuzzy. It's about as interesting as reading non-fiction (which I'm not to keen on, but is occasionally interesting). Blah Blah Blah. She needed to cut and shorten it up some because there is way too much fluff. If you are a fan of Robin, then I would recommend 1. The Blue Sword 2. The Hero and the Crown, and 3. the Outlaws of Sherwood before reading the Spindle's End."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I borrowed this book from a friend and enjoyed the beginning immensly. It had a great introduction and a fresh look at Sleeping Beauty. However, I agree with other reviews that it was difficult to follow with a lot of skipping around and explanations. I was sorely disapointed with the ending of this book, I found it very unbelievable...how does a horse jump into the sky and land at a country in the clouds? It was very strange and did not flow well with the rest of the book. I do not recommend this book for anyone who enjoys the wonder and fulfillment of fairy tells, it is too much of a stretch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmm...","review":"As I've said, I love all of Robin McKinley's books, but most of them aren't perfect, although they ARE wonderful. This book is no exception. It is another retelling (she's very good at retellings), but this is of the classic story of Sleeping Beauty. It explains the plight that the poor princess was put in, with some humor, friendship, and lots of touching love. The princess (I forget her name again because I own the book but am too lazy to get up and get it now, hehe) was swept away by a fairy after the princess was cursed by a jealous and mean fairy. The story weaves through the life of the Princess (her name MAY be Briar Rose like in the cartoon, haha) along with her loving savior and her family. This story really made me smile, and I hope that RM will continue to produce and \\"spin\\" (what a loser I can be sometimes, lol) such great tales, or retellings,and I hope that more people will discover the beauty of her writings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spindle's End: Not what you'd expect","review":"Readers and fans alike will no doubt find this book to be totally enjoyable. The themes from previous McKinley books are there: human-animal connections, evil to be overcome for the good of all, and love where you would least expect it, but it's the heroine's self-discovery that draws me in. The quality of the story, unprecidented in our literature that contains weak female roles, comes also from the strong female main character (typical McKinley), where our heroine overcomes the greatest of tragedies with an unexpected strength not entirely unexpected of her. McKinley fans will relive the magical experiences not unlike \\"Hero\\" and \\"Blue Sword\\" where the human-animal connection is the factor that tips the scale for ridding the world of evil beings. Delightful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Borring Sleeping Beauty Retelling","review":"I love retellings of fairy tales especially ones based on Sleeping Beauty, but this story was very borring. I once tried to read this book and I was barely able to make it to the ending and when I tried to read it for a second time I couldn't make it half way throgh the book. The characters are borring, especially Rosie the princess. She was portrayed as a tom boy who cuts off her hair and hates anything feminine, I like any princess as being portrayed as inependant, but I still think that it would good for them to still be feminine. The ending left me coufused. If you want to read a retelling of Sleeping Beauty I would suggest Briar Rose by Jane Yolen, it is different but it is also a very good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly enjoyable read","review":"Definitely not your everyday retelling of Sleeping Beauty. Our heroine (perhaps I should say 'heroines') is not quite what one would expect.Rosie (the princess) is not particularly 'beautiful' as she grows up a plain village maiden who prefers being a 'horse leech' and hanging around the smithy to doing fine needlepoint and other 'girlie' things. Her best friend, Peony, *is* beautiful (and sweet and noble and all the things a princess *should* be).Absolutely loved the ending (which I will not spoil by giving it away except to say all's well that ends well and I couldn't be happier for the entire wonderful cast of characters)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Not as good as her other books, but still good.

McKinley is an excellent writer, but she got a bit carried away with the setting here. The descriptions of it get in the way of the plot and characterization. I'd recommend a more ruthless editor...someone with the courage to axe at least 50 pages (maybe 100) to make the story tighter and the book fly. However, McKinley is such a good writer that even reading the unnecessary setting details is entertaining (especially thanks to her wry sense of humor). A good book and an enjoyable read, but not a great one (and Mckinley is certainly capable of greatness)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect gift for new baby or elementary classroom","review":"This, along with several books, is my standard new baby gift.

It's over four hours of good, whole-some cuteness that just won't stop.The other thing I liked about this show is the way the shows themselves are done. Each DVD has three chapters, and each chapter is divided into four, five minute episodes. The four episodes share a common theme making each chapter about twenty minutes long.So, if you like quality anime with an overdose of cuteness then I highly recommend Panyo Panyo Di.Gi.Charat."},{"rating":"1","title":"low-end classical/folk guitar, not a true steel string acoustic","review":"I bought this exact model based on the price and the picture, and want everyone to know the fraud going on.

This guitar (as all classical guitars) lacks the metal truss rod in the neck and the internal bracing needed to withstand the tension of steel strings. The result is a neck that curves forward under the strain, resulting in unplayable string height, and TERRIBLE intonation (notes off key at different frets).It is not ethical to market this as a child's or a beginner's guitar just because of the smaller size and low cost. A beginner would go nowhere trying to learn on this. Do not buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational Music at its best","review":"Brilliant singing, great arrangements, beautiful and inspiring music. All sung by the phenomenal West Point Cadet Glee Club. Add Broadway star Lea Salonga and tenor Daniel Rodriguez and it's a tour de force recording of timeless material. I urge anyone who loves choral music and just plain great singing to buy this disc! You will not be disappointed. Performed in the magnificent chapel at West Point, the sound is incredible also. 5 Stars!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointed!","review":"I ordered this CD based on the sound clips and the reviews but what I got was not what I was expecting. The vocals are drowned out by the instrumentals. At first I thought it was just my car's cd deck but same went for all the other players in the house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Special is Spot On","review":"The Office Special is a spot-on conclusion to the BBC series at the top of its game. The Office Special ends the popular series in a touching and poignant manner wrapping up many story lines full circle. Special features include a must see full band version of \\"Freelove Freeway\\" featuring Noel Galligher of Oasis on backup vocals. David Brent redeems himself in the end by proving he is more than just a 'chilled out entertainer' with his expose on the human condition. Don't miss it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent ending","review":"This is an excellent ending to an excellent show. I was sad when I discovered that there where only two full seasons to this funny show, but after this DVD it is quit forgivable. They handle these characters with extreme care to make sure that they still get a believable happy ending. The documentary with the actors is great. You know that they had fun and that you had fun watching it. This is a great show for anyone that loves british humor and making fun of reality tv shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great CD","review":"Not Bones best. However it had innovative beats. It had psitive messages despite the Gangsta language. From the Heart of it All is a great song as is Ghetto Cowboy.

It's a fun way to learn more about the classical composers for the whole family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for small children -- much too upsetting","review":"I am a big fan of the Classical Kids series and recommend them frequently. My children, 4 and 6, love them and we listen to them constantly. We have all learned a lot from them. They are really wonderful. Except for this one.Of course the music is beautiful, but some parts of the story are really not appropriate for small chlldren -- a child being beaten by his \\"keeper\\", kept in a cage for days, being kidnapped back by his cruel keeper? What were they thinking? This is not how I want to introduce my children to the cruelties of the world.It's such a shame, because the rest of the series is wonderful, but I now won't play it to my children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grand music - Storyline fiction not history","review":"Handel's music is, of course, grand and beautiful. I applaud Susan Hammond's creativity and her hopes to introduce children to classical music. However, the fictional storyline is just that....fictional. Your (and your child's) impression and \\"memories\\" of Handel will forever falsely be tied to this fictional storyline of Thomas, Katerina, and Handel which never occured. There are of course elements of truth in the storyline but the majority never happened. Buy some CD's of Handel's wonderful music and listen with your family! There are several good books you can read about Handel's real life and they are not boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book","review":"The book is very good.

Period. He is a pathological liar. He deceived us in 1994, and he will deceive us again. He lies not only to the world but to his own people. Mark my words, peace will only come when Kim Jong Il is out of power and Korea is reunited under a democratic regime. Only then will the threat be gone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aeromotive 12316 Fuel Filter","review":"This is a 100 micron filter mounted between the fuel tank and electric fuel pump to protect the pump. Very high quality item, easy to install. Somewhat funny there's a sticker sealing the box stating \\"do not return to retailer\\" and to review the instructions if problems are encountered. What's funny is there are no instructions, either in the box or online at the Aeromotive website. The filter housing is however engraved with an arrow and direction of flow markings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Substitute for Butter?","review":"Can't quite figure out why someone would refer to black truffles as a substitute for butter....tbe Italians are better known for their white truffles...question: are these tuber Melanosporum, the classic winter black truffle?

Talk about something you can listen to all the time and never get tired of. You can listen to it all the way through...every single song is good. And if you like songs that get you in the mood...listen to \\"Do it Again\\" (#6). I would recommend this CD to anyone. Old, Young, pop fans, rocks fans...every song has true lyrics you can relate to. Try it out...you'll be impressed. I often wonder why Stroke 9 is not more popular...after you listen to this CD...you will too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophomore Slump","review":"This is one of the most disappointing purchases I've ever made. Having been a Stroke 9 fan since hearing the incredible \\"Nasty Little Thoughts,\\" I was optimistic and excited for their new album \\"Rip it Off.\\" What I got was nothing like what I had come to expect from these guys and I don't recommend it at all.\\"Nasty Little Thoughts\\" was smart, mature, original, and well developed. This new album is none of the above. The lyrics are either dumb or corny, the instrumentation is boring and uninspired, and the band seems happy to fade off into the abyss of indistinguishable punk pop bands with the likes of American Hi-Fi and SR-71.I wanted to like this album. I really did. But it just doesn't make the cut. If they release a third album, I hope it's reminiscent of their previous effort. For now, however, I recommend \\"Nasty Little Thoughts\\" and I recommend you leave this one on the bargain racks, where it belongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll make this quick...","review":"This album isn't no good. It's rock is brane-ded and the lymricks is not as cleaver as Nancy's Little Thoughts. I hope numbre 3 doen't not suck, because this one dos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but its no \\"Nasty Little Thoughts\\"","review":"So many of the other reviewers have raved about this CD. There are some good songs, but Stroke 9 hasn't broken any new ground since \\"Nasty Little Thoughts,\\" which is actually a better album. If you want to buy only one CD by Stroke 9, I'd recommend \\"Nasty Little Thoughts.\\" Washin' and Wonderin' is one of the best songs to come along in a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"They took their time, but it was worth the wait!","review":"Whats unique about Stroke 9s follow up album is that they spent the 3 years in between albums really defining themselves. In Rip it Off, they show off their fun comical sides while still maintaining lyrics that really speak to their audiences. This is clearly illustrated in the tracks titled Kick Some A** and 100 girls. Stroke 9 makes sure that the albums 12 tracks are distinguishable. It starts off with light hearted subjects that are fast paced with more than just good lyrics but also an amazing sound. The last four songs (Reject, Anywhere, Lead the Way, and California) are reasons enough to buy the cd. The last half of the album is where you can really see Stroke 9s talent that sets them apart from generic bands.Plus, they just rock in general!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have album","review":"Great Album one of those albums that gets better and better with each track and then once you through you ready to pop it in and start all over again. This is a must have for any music enthusiast.Edit 10/14/2002Well, Its been over a week and I have listened to the album at everyday. My prediction is for me this will be one of the 10 best CD for 2002.Look at the review's and just remember I picked it on the day it was released.Leading the pack"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best. Album. Ever.","review":"At first, I thought it was a sophomore slump record. Wrong! Let it grow on you. First listen, one track appealed to me \\"Vacuum bag\\" a song with the hit potential of \\"The Reason\\". I listened more and now I feel this is the best album I own. Buy it, listen to it over & over and then you'll feel the way i do about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"After listenting to Nasty Little Thoughts cd so much that I wore it out I was so excited to see Stroke 9 had a new album out. However, once I started listening to Rip it Off I was disappointed. It is, in general, an ok cd, but if you are looking for something similar to NLT this is not it. If I had heard any of these songs on the radio I would have not guessed that it was Stroke 9. The music on this album does not sound like them, rather a nameless alt rock band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter shallow derivative pop","review":"I think my title truly expresses my feelings about this CD, but to go a little deeper: there is nothing original, thought provoking, or interesting about this collection of tired pop. I for one am tired of what another reviewer termed as the \\"factory farming\\" of bland teenage pop out there. Hard to swallow due to boring music and truly un-inspired lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY IT BUY IT!!","review":"What an amazing cd! After waiting for what seemed like decades for a follow up to Little Black Backpack, I can not contain my excitement about Rip It Off!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Impressed","review":"I was skeptical when I heard about this new disc, but I really enjoyed Nasty Little Thoughts, so I decided to pick this one up. It has been worth every cent. The whole disc is excellent, but my favorites are \\"Vacuum Bag\\", \\"Kick Some A**\\", \\"Don't Worry\\", \\"Reject\\", \\"Lead the Way\\", and \\"California\\". I can really relate to \\"California\\". It is rare for a disc to have 6 songs that I truly love.It is unfortunate that some songs on this new disc have not had any publicity (at least in Chicago), because if anything, this CD is better than Nasty Little Thoughts."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT CD FOR FANS AND FIRST-TIME LISTENERS","review":"I have to admit - after listening to very few cds besides Stroke 9's \\"Nasty Little Thoughts\\" for 3 years, I wasn't even sure THEY could put out another cd that I could grow so attached to. But sure enough, Stroke 9 accomplished just that with \\"Rip It Off\\" (which hasn't left my cd player since it came out!). Stroke 9 has managed to mature while not eliminating any of the elements that brought them praise with their first major debut and that their listeners so love. Old fans who loved the catchiness of \\"Washin' and Wonderin'\\" will enjoy the sex-driven tune \\"Do It Again\\" and the fun, punky \\"Latest Disaster,\\" while those who admired the passionate lyrics of \\"Tear Me In Two\\" will appreciate \\"Anywhere.\\" This rocking album will not disappoint Stroke 9 fans and will surely gain many first-time listeners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely fantastic!","review":"All the Specially Yours greeting card papers make terrific cards.

A replacement pot costs more than the original price of the coffee maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't buy again","review":"This is the worst piece of junk you can imagine. The coffee is terrible. It is very poorly constructed, mine arrived without one of the little rubber feet that go on the bottom, so it was wobbly. I went out an bought another coffee maker right away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that impressed","review":"Makes good coffee with the permanent filter if the proper amount of coarse grind coffee is used. It is noisy and slow. The outside of the coffeemaker gets very hot, nearly hot enough to burn.It sometimes will continue making gurgling and hissing noises while dripping coffee into the pot and hot water from around the top of the coffeemaker for 5 minutes or more after it should have finished brewing.It is necessary to raise the lid of the carafe when pouring or it will run down the side of the pot and onto the counter instead of into the cup.It is possible to buy 10-12 cup coffeemakers for less than what this one costs. I thought a smaller size would be a good idea as I only drink 4-6 cups a day. It's not a bad idea, but this particular coffeemaker has not proven to be worth the extra cost.I have considered boxing it up and shipping it to Black and Decker so they can see for themselves why I am not impressed with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super cute!","review":"The fabric is beautiful and the style was very nice.

The irony is I went online looking for a STORAGE ottoman, and went through many items before deciding on this one. Imagine my surprise when I tried to pull off the top and discovered it was all one piece! :) Now that I re-read the description, it does not say storage; it was just listed with other storage ottomans. That said, it's a very nice item, so I will keep it."},{"rating":"2","title":"No music but some nice and revealing interviews","review":"The production of this is on par with the Moody Blues and Cream bio-pics from CA. However, I just didn't find this as satisfying because I think it goes on a little too long. I would have liked to have seen some tighter editing. The extra unused footage could easily have become special features.If you're a hard core fan you will have heard much of this, but you might find a few new tidbits. The lack of a new interview with Trevor Rabin or any with Pat Moraz is more than offset by the inclusion of Tait, Offord and others close to the band over the years. Bill Bruford, Chris Squire and Steve Howe are generally the most entertaining and most willing to share details. A better picture of the inner workings of the band are presented here than other documentaries.I still think YesYears is the best documentary on Yes, but this one definitely fills in a lot of holes and is easily the second best by a long way.Worth getting..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This is a great documentary on the history of Yes, featuring not only its current members, but also a big number of people that were important for the band, as Eddie Offord, Roger Dean or Peter Banks, and even Ahmet and Keith Emerson speak a couple of times!It has a very interesting approach from each one of the band members, giving their very personal opinion in every album or Yes situation.It does not include a lot of live footage, it's basically interviews and cool pictures. It is very detailed and even funny occasionally.Excelent DVD!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but not for casual fans","review":"Do NOT think that this is a performance DVD. This is the history of YES, as told by the band members and other participants. There are over 3 hours of interviews, clips and photos. The interviews are all new, and the clips have not been seen in years, if ever. Many of the stories have been told before, but some are being heard for the first time on this DVDIt was interesting to see and hear from some of the former members such as Peter Banks and Trevor Horn. Other people in the background such as Eddie Offord and Mike Tait also add their points of view. They give a different perspective on events than had been told previously.In the extended interviews on the 2nd disk, it would have been better if the interviewer had been mic'd. It's difficult to hear the questions being asked of the subject.I really enjoyed this, but even as a long time hardcore fan, I could not sit through this in it's entirety without a break."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warning: Only For Hardcore YES Fans!!!!!","review":"Five and a half hours of great interviews with a few videos and other treats. The interviews cover all Yes albums in chronological order, all the way through Magnification. Almost everyone is interviewed but sadly not Patrick Moraz and a few others. Most die-hard Yes fans will already know some of the information given but all will walk away with knowledge they never had before. I only wish everyone spoke as clearly as Bill Bruford."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Meaning of Prayer","review":"This is a very good book. Easy to read and thought provoking.

I thought it was meant to teach your child in a dramatic way about the life of the composers. I was dead wrong. It was very lame! My kids hated it. They are teen, and preteen. Even I thought it was stupid. I would NOT recommend this except possibly for the very young. It does NOT teach about the composers, it is simply a modern (lame) story with the composers music in the background. They don't even talk about what songs they are or who composed them. I would steer away from this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I expected","review":"I love the idea, but I don't want to expose my children to the stories in these cd's.

But it is not true. The sound of this CD is awful, like the tape was saturated, very unnatural sound. I compared a few same songs that appeared on EMI/Capitol release from awhile back \\"The Very Best Of Jay & The Americans\\", and EMI/Capitol sounded better. Perhaps, BGO did not use the original master tapes; a duplicate or third generation tapes? If I were you, please stay away from this release.

Unfortunately, the recurring theme of flippant dialogue played out by a chorus of insolent boys detracts from the overall story and listening experience. The story begins with a child complaining to her mother, which sets the tone for the underlying immature and disrespectful conversations throughout the rest of the story. The musical selections were wonderful, but the dialogue aims at captivating a child's petulant nature, as opposed to more edifying qualities that draw us to classical music in the first place. It is very disappointing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"My son begs to listen to this CD every night.

I'm pretty fond of it myself even after about 3 dozen playings over the last month."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment!","review":"I ordered this after hearing the smart and wonderfully creative \\"Beethoven Lives Upstairs.\\" Sadly, this one is poorly written and badly acted. The setting for the story has Bach visiting modern-day children. This just doesn't work. Also, the producers have Bach speaking with a rather thick German accent. I found it very difficult to understand him at times. I'm sure children would struggle with this even more. Also, the tracks didn't seem to be mixed very well. Often the voices were uneven and difficult to discern."},{"rating":"2","title":"ahh, memories...","review":"I had this as a kid, along with Mozart's Journey through the Magic Flute, and I listened to them all the time.

Also, I just purchased the CD, and when I got it I was so happy, so exaulted, so thrilled. I was smiling the whole time I was listening during math class.

But the result was disappointing. So much extravagant emotion is bettershown than told, especially when the telling is so high-pitched andoverwrought. Granted that the author has some minimal skill incharacterization, much more could have been done with the depic-tions of George Boleyn and his wife Jane. The little we know ofboth, historically speaking, is so provocative--but here George isjust an echo of Thomas, and Jane but a cipher!And where, pray tell, are our editors when an author can get awaywith such obvious errors in grammar and syntax? Ms. Dunn does noteven understand the distinction between \\"lie\\" and \\"lay\\" and continually employs \\"you and I\\" after prepositions when \\"you andme is clearly indicated.For God's sake, let's send the lady back to grammar school beforeshe inflicts any more novels on us!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting novel","review":"This book will change your view of Anne Boleyn forever. Usually written about as a conniving bitch who was determined to be queen, here Anne is a sympathetic character. Her motives are made clear and understandable.Written from the point of view of Thomas Wyatt, a young poet who fell in love with her, this is more Anne's story than Thomas'. Thomas, a sensitive and sweet young man, is endearing as well. Indeed, all the characters in this novel are well-drawn.Although this novel is beautifully written, I did feel that the word 'verily' was used too much and although it was meant to be true to the Tudor period, I found it slightly irritating.However, I would thoroughly recommend this enchanting novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely readable","review":"I am well familiar with the high quality of Taunton Press. That was why I took a close look at this book. I found this book in the local library. I checked it out, along with two others. After a few minutes of comparing, I never reopened the others. I immediately ordered my own copy, along with a copy as a gift for a friend. I am an electrical engineer, so I understand the principles of electricity, but this book clearly and eloquently tells the reader how to be a do-it-yourself electrician."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recalled but not replaced","review":"I received a notification from Amazon that this book had been recalled because of an error in it that could lead to a serious electrical problem, and that I needed to contact the publisher directly to order a replacement or refund. But the phone number for the publisher was ALWAYS busy on the MANY times I tried to call. It was as though they just took the phone off the hook and walked away. And there was no other recourse by mail or email. Very annoying. And what's worse, nobody will indicate where the error in the book is. Don't buy this. I'm also going to avoid other publications in the For Pros by Pros Series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I expected","review":"\\"Wiring a House\\" has a very old style: a lot of text and talking, but only a few drawing for illustrations. It does not have even one good color photo, which can show people the real situations. All the photos are in black and white, which are not very interesting and makes me feel like watching a movie made 30 years ago. A good picture is worth of thousands of words, but this book does not offer excellent illustrations. I will have to exchange it for a book with photo guide. I am disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Was Recalled for incorrect diagrams","review":"I received a recall notice from Amazon about this book.

'Handy' homeowners need this latest coverage, and general lending libraries will find it a fine addition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wiring A House by Rex Caldwell","review":"This book is user friendly and offers insight to persons with little experience and those who are near masters of the electrical trade. It is recommended to people dealing with housing rehabiltation, and is cited as a reference by the State of Ohio, Dept. of Development in the Standards for Residential Rehabilitation. Chapter that explains GFCI's is best yet. Also the information on testers available and recommended is rarely covered in electric books. I recently lent my copy to a vocational school instructor because it has code information, installation demonstrations, and best of all, the mistakes made. Worth every penny,and handy for beginners too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"This book is very helpful to provide another prospective for house wiring. I don't think it is as good as the Black and Decker Books though."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Rex Cauldwell's Books!","review":"This was the first of his books that I have read. I have read it cover to cover a couple of times now.It really is a fantastic book. However for the people looking for a \\"How To\\" book... This is not it. This is a \\"For Pros by Pros\\" book. If you know nothing about doing electrical work, this may not be a good first book. I still suggest you read it however.I have done a fair bit of electrical work and this book has helped me to become better at what I do. Plus Rex's tips, tricks and hints are great. But nothing beats his \\"Above Code\\" approach.I love it! I recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the serious do-it-yourselfer","review":"OK, so this book is NOT aimed at folks who get worried by the mere THOUGHT of electricity. However, if you are COMPETENT at DIY, it is excellent - there's perhaps more about site preparation and getting ready for the electricity company to connect up than I needed, but the above code hints were extremely handy.One or two tips were missing - for example, when wiring ceiling lights it is a good idea to use 12-3 rather than the cheaper 12-2 so that you can put a fan on a separate switch by the door rather than relying on the pull cord.His recommendations for Siemens breaker boxes is right on, by the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"lack of info","review":"Not a bad book but totally lacking in tables and calculations for completing the projects described in the book.

As I read \\"Wiring a House\\", I realized Rex Cauldwell was proving me less than fully informed. Mr. Cauldwell explains theory of distribution centers easily and vividly. (No grounding rods for garages please!). This book is by far and away the best and easiest reading of many differing code and \\"how to\\" books I have looked to for help. Well worth the money"},{"rating":"1","title":"not recommended for beginners","review":"I know I'm going against the grain here, but I didn't like this book at all. It may be a fine reference for more experienced folks, but as a complete novice with no experience at all, I found it left much to be desired. Some parts of the book were better than others, but I was really quite lost with many of the descriptions of various tasks. There were a lot of passages which were incomprehensible. Features and objects were not described clearly in many cases, and terminology was used and not defined clearly. For the beginner, Black and Decker's \\"The Complete Guide to Home Wiring\\" is far better. In that book, color photos illustrate every single step. That's the kind of guidance a beginner needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is Myra?","review":"Oh come on Disney.... why was Myra overlooked on this version of your CD?

You just can't concentrate on the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good introduction to combinatorics!","review":"Every discipline has key introductory texts that motivate the subject, whet the appetite for more, and guide a novice to see the forest despite the trees. 'Combinatorics' by Peter Cameron is one such gem! Combinatorics has a reputation for being a collection of disparate clever ad hoc arguments. The author has carefully presented binding principles such as double counting, the pigeon-hole principle, generating functions, enumeration via group actions, sets of distinct representatives,...see the book for more, that makes coherent combinatorics as a discourse, despite its diverse application."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one put me to sleep!","review":"This was my first novel by the author, and now I know I am never gonna pick up any of her other books.The story was so slow and boring that I couldn't get past the first three chapters.

John Dempsey is a brilliant lyricist, a wit and talent for the stage. Dana Rowe's music is challenging and modern. This has changed a bit since I first read the book and heard the music. The Ballad of Bobby \\"Cracker\\" Barrell is still my favorite. This is a must have for any theater buff.

This is a satirical tale of American Politics gone sour (and it is very funny), but it also tells a tragic story worthy of at least a handy pac of tissues.The music is refreshingly diverse in style, from the Gospel like 'Simple Words' to the Vaudeville styled 'Two Guys At Harvard'. The performances are all excellent.I would recommend this to any fan of the musical theatre in search of something new with a decent story. And of course it is an essential buy for any John Barrowman fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes \\"Cats\\" sound like Stravinsky","review":"Music for idiots who find Muzak challenging. Lyrics for those who think Mother Goose is as witty as Noel Coward. Self-important meandering drivel, typifying America's love of the mediocre.

A show focusing on the right to nonconformity shuning the ideas of a greedy family. The catchy \\"One, Two, Three\\" and \\"Simple Words\\" leaves the listener singing away, and the deep lyrical content in each song questions the thoughts and motives within everyone. With some expicit content and lyric, the overall concept of the story stresses the idea of being yourself, and living your \\"own\\" life, not a society run life. The actors and actresses talents are supurb. John Barrowman and Philip Quast do an exceptional job in the overall presentation of thier characters. A perfect buy if your looking for something a little \\"out of the ordinary.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dated","review":"I studied for the GRE for 6 solid months and have used every book available on the topic. This book was the only one whose verbal section was entirely outdated. For example, there was a practice test that had reading comprehension questions dealing with material that was taken out of the test years ago (such as terms relating to analysis). Also, I had problems with the analogy questions. On the real GRE, the parts of speech are ALWAYS congruent to the stem word. This was not the case in this book!I immediately stopped using it as I didn't want to waste my time and felt that it was a complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor book, software,","review":"Neither the book nor the software is worth the time and money for this combination.The book includes the long pencil and paper examples one expects for the old pencil and paper test. There are a few updates for the new computer based test; mostly just mentioning what to expect. The entire section on the essay portion of the GRE is four pages followed by thirty pages of general grammer review. The mathematics review is more solid, but there are some mistakes in the text. It is a book that is not updated often.The same staleness extends to the software. It works, outside of the occasional fatal exception error, but provides little help above the minimum. There are only three practice tests; reviewing your mistakes is torturous; and the practice essays are not timed the same way as the real exam. There is no help in guessing your score on the essay portions.Overall, the combination of obsolete material and errors reduces the value to less than nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"REA GRE review book","review":"Simply put, this book was the worst preparation I can think of for taking the GRE. The verbal sections were terrible. The relations they defined between words were often tenuous at best in the analogies; their antonyms sometimes involved nouns (e.g., the antonym of \\"mistral\\" which is a strong wind... it's pretty tough to say that a weak wind is the OPPOSITE of a strong wind, simply a varying degree); and their reading comprehension section was the worst, and even included a typo in one of the readings. Their explanations on the verbal were also deplorable; seriously, I actually think doing their verbal sections may have hurt my score on the verbal section.The math sections were alright, but I didn't miss many questions so I can't comment on how helpful many of those explanations were.Seriously, in general, this was a joke of a review book, and you would absolutely be throwing your money away to purchase it. I really regret this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money","review":"I found this book to be completely useless. I went through the entire quantitative section and found that the questions given in the study guide were about a hundred times easier than the questions on the actual test. Many concepts weren't gone over, the verbal section is outdated, and the CD practice tests are incredibly easy compared to the real thing. The explanations on the verbal section of the CD were about the only useful thing about this package but they are torturous to go over. Don't waste your money on this. I'm already shopping for another study guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a complete review for 2006 test!","review":"While the verbal was OK, I felt that the quantitative was far from complete. I recently took the test and had some questions that were not reviewed in the book. For example this book did NOT cover negative exponents and the 1-2-sqrt3 ratio of a 30-60-90 triangle, both a which came about for a total of 6 questions on the test!! Granted these are simple concepts, but they were absolutly not covered in this book and hence this was not a complete review.The practice sections were clumsy in presentation. This book is dated and is NOT suitable for a complete 2006 GRE."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money and time","review":"Where do I start?The vocab in the analogies and antonyms varies....from something a 7th grader could manage to some obscure word that probably five people in the entire world have ever seen before.Parts of speech don't match, and the analogies are sometimes just terrible Take, for example, \\"a particle is PART of an atom\\". Seriously? If you don't know basic physics, pick a different analogy ffs.Reading comprehension questions are ridiculously basic, except for the ones that make no sense and have multiple answers. Oh, and the ones that aren't on the GRE anymore.If you are thinking about buying this book, you'd be better off taking that $30 and flushing it down the toilet. Or burning it. Or using it as toilet paper. Whatever you want really, just anything but this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing failure","review":"Not only is this book full of material that is NOT on the GRE, the disk is not compatible with current versions of Windows, and the accompanying website that should allow one to update the software is of no use whatsoever. Some REA books have been well done but not this one. It is particularly disappointing that the publisher has not gotten a better author and re-written this drivel.

I have taken Kaplan and Princeton Review tests on-line. Both companies make this book and the practice test look shoddy and amateurish. I am much stronger in verbal than in Math but when I took their computer test I got a 672 in Math and a 600 on the Verbal. It is a waste of money. Buy Kaplan or Princeton review. If you want good quality computerized practice tests, you need to pay for them. I thought 6 tests for $40 was too good to be true and I was right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated Software & non-existent tech support","review":"I bought this book in preparation for the GRE. I bought it online, so I based my decision on the claims made by Research & Education Association. They claim to be \\"The Very Best Coaching & Studying Course\\". The other reason why I chose this book was because it offered 6 Full-Length Practice Exams. I got the book and I wasn't too impressed with the set up or the explanations, but I thought it would be redeemed with the tests. I tried for hours to get the CD to load correctly. It was written for ancient machines and the patches provided for Windows Vistas do NOT work. I have tried for 2 weeks to get someone in their tech dept. to help me resolve the issues, but I have not heard back. I also wrote to the main office to express my disenchantment, and they also didn't respond. It is the worse $40.00 (I didn't buy it on Amazon) I have spent on a book!!!

The format is different in the sense, that entire chapters are made of quasi-independent paragraphs which are direct quotes or paraphrases from different people. It gives the book a distinct look, not necessarily a format the average business-related book follows. In that sense, the book takes a little getting used to. However, the book does provide some very interesting insights on some of the events (sort of backstage news) that have roiled Wall Street over its existence. The business-info-buff will most certainly find this book to be useful, though this reviewer didn't find the book very entertaining or well-organized. A good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent overview other coverages barely touch","review":"There have been other histories of Wall Street before: so what makes What Goes Up: The Uncensored History Of Modern Wall Street As Told By The Bankers, Brokers, CEOs And Scoundrels Who Made It Happen so special from the others?

You'd think Angle is the problem; nope, he's fine compared to the other bit characters. The moral of the story is that just because you have a script and a camera doesn't mean you should put it on film without thinking about it first.

I loved that I could actually see the water level in the chamber (my previous iron didn't have this feature), I loved the burst of steam feature, which was especially handy for my kids' corduroy pants. In fact, I was just happy to have a steam feature that worked at all. I was almost enjoying ironing for a while there.Skip to three months and two weeks. The iron now leaks more than it steams, my ironing board is soaking wet by the time I've done one shirt and the reservoir needs to be refilled after I've ironed two. It's not leaking from the visible reservoir areas or soleplate, either -- it's pouring out of the housing whenever the iron is horizontal. I've contacted Amazon who refuses to deal with it since it's been longer than 30 days, and I can't get a single person at Sunbeam to return my calls or my emails.

The inner voice of a black man raised with discipline and demands to excel made upon him by his parents in an upper middle class milieu. To see the world through these eyes was a wonderful experience. The media so often pretends that this segment of American society simply does not exist. It is time that it is given a voice. That is in an entertaining mystery makes it all the better. No ponderous tract this, although I agree it could have been substantially shorter.

There isn't a single character I cared about and the \\"mystery\\" was utterly contrived.Carter's literary style was terrible. Perhaps if it would have been written in the third person it may have worked better. He constantly attributed thoughts and motives to people as if he were a third person narrator instead of a person witnessing an act, e.g. a third person narration can say, \\"He didn't like the gift because it reminded him of his father,\\" but a first person narrator can't know that unless told directly.

Surprises at the end of every chapter keep the pages turning. I read this in a few days, taking the book with me on errands or in the car. I let the phone ring and the answering machine pick up.

There is an immediate impulse to check the front of the book because you think you've picked up one of those self-published or e-books by accidents -- you know the ones where authors pay to have their books publisheed?But not in this case.

Mr. Carter is is an excellent intelligent wordsmith. The characters are real. The thoughts expressed are challenging.

Enjoyment of any book is pretty subjective, but ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO LONG!","review":"Certainly this novel contained some interesting and insightful observations about American society, but generally, it disappointed. The \\"mystery\\" dragged through the first two thirds. Each chapter ended with an annoying pseudo-suspensful sentence that lead... nowhere. There was no character development beyond the initial impressions/sketches of each person, including the protagonist, Talcott, who remained a drip to the end, and his wife, \\"Kimmer\\", who, impossibly, grew more and more evil with each chapter. (Yet he loves her so!) There were, in fact, too many characters to keep track of or care about, especially in the law school. The political musings detracted from the story rather than adding to it. (At one point, Talcott walks past some sort of sub-par ghetto grammar school, and wishes his colleagues who don't support school vouchers could see this proof of their need. What?) The ending was corny and cliched. And did I mention it was too long?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring - where's the story.","review":"I don't mind long books, but this one was way to long. The story only took up part of each chapter and the rest was filler, filler that was often repeated. The constant reference to race was tedious. Who cares, in a (fictional) book it is not important. At about 250 pages I gave up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Officious Tedium","review":"Yes-It is way too long, but, moreover, Mr. Carter seems much more intent on developing in the reader appreciation for Carter's knowledge of law(ho hum)and his knowledge of chess(HO HUM)than in really developing characters that are either likeable or believable.The protagonist is a pontificating jerk. His wife has to be an airhead to fall for a pretty dumb basketball player-and she's a potential U.S.Circuit Court nominee-I don't think so! The rest of the characters are the biggest conglomeration of misfits, wierdos, neurotics and crooks I ever read about, especially \\"the family\\". I also am a lawyer, a chess player and have taught at prestigious law schools, and, frankly, law faculty and lawyers generally just ain't this bad. First time out-hope it's the last."},{"rating":"1","title":"One book that needs a new editor!","review":"I had to read this book for a book club at work and it worse than reading one of those unabridged histories for college! The book includes way too many unimportant characters who may or may not have anything to do with the mystery that is sloppily unraveled at the end. There are some good moments but they're buried too deep. Most of us skimmed the book--too much background description for each person, place and thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped, boring, unbelieveable!","review":"I so wanted to love this book. I found all the poitical proselytizing so boring and repetitive. The dinner party and lunch scenes were particularly unbearable and there was not a likeable character in the whole book..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure if I am going to make it...","review":"I am on about page 350 of this book and am struggling. Like many other reviewers, I think the basic story is a good one, but this book is way too long. The meandering random thoughts are really too much. I am resisting the temptation to read the last 100 pages.As the white(paler nation?) wife of a black(darker nation?) attorney, the whole \\"feel sorry for me becuase my father was a federal judge, I teach at an ivy leaugue law school, and I only inherited the house on Martha's Vineyard\\" is again just too much. If this is America's breakthrough novel offering insight into upper class black society, I worry about the impression it might leave unless the point is that a monied, successful black man can be just as whiny and unappreciative as a monied, successful white man. Sorry for the run-on sentence and for being so harsh, but Misha is the most unlikeable character I have encountered in some time.I'll finish the book, but only to find out the end of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Long For A Thriller","review":"This booked steadily moved from five stars to two as the pages kept climbing. Why and editor didn't shake off some of the excess to get to the heart of the story is beyond me, but as it is I had a hard time staying interested after the first three hundred and fifty pages or so. The other problem I had with the book is I didn't find Carter's protagonist particularly likable.So for me I had a hard time connecting with the guy much less investing in his dilemma. Consequently by the time the novel climaxed in a cinematic stand off, there was little surprise or interest. Streamlined this could've been a taut page turning thriller. There were just too many pages to turn to get to the thrill."},{"rating":"1","title":"there could have been a good book in there","review":"I tried twice, but couldn't get through the boring characters and whining crap from the characters. All the characters from the main family are a bunch of drips with nothing compelling to offer. There is a thread (in the first ~200 pages I read) of an interesting story, but I was regularly beaten down by diversions about the 'paler nation', PC junk, and generally uninteresting comparisons. Fortunately for the author the main characters were not white, so it will be easy for some readers to view their lameness as a great thing that defies 'stereotypes'.Too many pages, too much whining, too much plodding"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tough going.","review":"I had read two of Carter's previous non-fiction works and enjoyed them, however after struggling through half of his first novel, I have to recommend that he stick with non-fiction. This novel is simply too plodding and dull to get through. The characters are unlikeable, the narrator is extremely repetitive, and the plot moves so slow it is almost as if it is an afterthought. It seems as if Carter is trying to make some points here about the black bourgeoisie which would be interesting if they were tied to a more lively entertaining novel with a discernable plot. Instead whatever insight he offers are bogged down by this ponderous effort at creating a mystery leaving the reader bored and exhausted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Tease","review":"I do not usually enjoy mystery novels, but I \\"seemed\\" to enjoy this one. It held my interest, but I felt it left many loose ends. The story gave many leads that went nowhere. The characters were not well developed and the ending was extremely weak. I thought it was a waste of my time because it had promise, but no direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Unnecessary Words!","review":"I love mystery and intrigue and I found some of both in this book, but I had to fight my way through too many bragging words about wealth and superior intelligence. Not what I want so much of in a mystery, or any fictional book. It's interesting and important to learn something about characters lives, but enough is enough. Even some incidental characters were given long, detailed, unneeded biographies. Should have been at least 300 fewer pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Verbose","review":"This book needed serious editing especially the narrative. Carter did not get the hang of thriller writing. The plot was confusing. No character in the entire book was worth rooting for. I practically flipped through to the end as I had run out of patience to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"Reading this book in bed at night, I didn't want to stop. The plot was riveting - there were so many twists and turns - you don't know the bad guys from the good guys. I was trying everything to stay awake, just so I could finish one more chapter. I think the author did a great job of making all the characters feel real and of painting a picture of family conflict. I loved this book - there was wonderful insights and character development."},{"rating":"1","title":"The emperor should abdicate","review":"I found it a very difficult book to read. It took me a month but I wouldn't give up. Very disappointed in the solution of the mystery. By the time I got to it, I forgot who the bad guy was. Like reading a Russian novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is trite, but he shows promise as a novelist","review":"Someone, somewhere should have told Stephen Carter that he is excessively verbose. After nearly 700 pages of racing toward \\"the arrangements! the arrangements!\\", it was a serious let-down when they only kind of came together.... The nearly innavigable twists and turns in the hackneyed thriller plot could give you some serious nausea.That said, the characters here are drawn very well and the observations about black middle class life were pointed and insightful. Nevertheless, the repetition, even in this, was enough to make me wonder if the editor wasn't allowed to cut anything?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Race Overused","review":"I am just on page 60. Being a voracious reader I will complete the book. His constant bringing up of the subjects race and ethnicity is to me somewhat alarming. It seems to appear on every page at least once it not several times. I hope the entire book is not this way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much more than a suspense book...","review":"This book started out a bit slow, but the author's keen observations about relationships, race, and human nature, along with the intriguing plot, kept me turning those pages, and boy was it worth it! I usually find whodunnit-type books boring, but Carter has such an interesting way of looking at things that I found myself reading as much for the thought-provoking situations and thoughts of his characters as for the suspenseful ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intrigue & Suspense","review":"A wonderful change from the one-dimensional plots of the quick-hit thrillers and mystery novels of the day. Kept me guessingright up until the end (when we knew what he'd do with the info)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Successful crossover from non-fiction to fiction.","review":"Previously known for his legal essays, Carter now proves he is one of those rare breed of storytellers who can write an intelligent mystery without resorting to gross-out details of autopsy reports or true-crime gore. The characters in this writer's first work of fiction are true to life, full of passion, cynicism and biting social commentary. When a conservative black judge is found dead, everyone assumes it was a heart attack. But when the judge's son, conservative law professor Misha Garland, receives strange messages and notices someone following him, he's not so sure. Carter ends each chapter with enough crumbs to keep you turning the pages for more clues, but keeps you guessing until the very end. Well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I've read this year!","review":"Despite the number of pages I recommend this book. Carter's commentary:social, marital,famial balanced with the mystery provide an enjoyable read. If you don't like predicatlbe plot twist and like to keep guessing this is the book to tread."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much","review":"A different editor might have helped this work: I found too many characters, some too thinly drawn to be remembered when it counted, too many plot twists, too many cliff-hangings. I have enjoyed some of Carter's non-fiction, to which perhaps he should stick."},{"rating":"2","title":"A First !!!!","review":"I loved this book. It was wonderful to read a mystery novel with a Black protagonist that wasn't a ex-con, cop, or a detective: but an intellectual and a legal scholar. I loved the pace, the interplay, and the intrigue on so many levels. The glimspe into the life of the Black upper-class is a welcome one.As someone who rented on the Vineyard, \\"the way it was before\\",and was not in Jack and Jill, it brought back memories of a different time.The only reason I did not give this book a five star rating is the editing. I agree with several others that some characters could have been merged or omitted and some of Garland's musings streamlined. I did find myself lost amongst the characters and having to look back to refresh my recollections, but that is the fault of the editors. I throughly enjoyed this book and recommend it to any one whose enjoys a good mystery. Write on Brother !!! I look forward to your next book !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's get to the end.......please!!","review":"This book was highly anticipated and I'm glad I got it at the library because had I purchased it, I would have been disappointed. I really wanted to like it and I usually love a thick book but it was just too tedious and with all the characters I could not find one that I even remotely liked. Talcott was such a whiner and I didn't even care anymore if anyone ever found \\"the arrangements\\".As a black woman, may I say that this is a story about this one black family, the Garlands, so please don't think it's representative of middle-class or wealthly blacks as a whole.This could have been so much better. Maybe Mr. Carter's next book will be an improvement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too weak for a mystery novel","review":"This 654 page book could accomplish the same results in 300 pages and be more interesting. There is an excess of meaningless text that does nothing but interupt the basic plot, which is decent. While reading this book, I was thankful that I do not have to read his legal briefs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Brilliant Mind, But...","review":"I have heard Stephen Carter speak, so I came to this novel knowing it likely would be thought-provoking and rewarding. My expectations were well satisfied, but I was surprised that his editor didn't challenge him on things like overuse of some metaphors (such as \\"chewing on cotton\\"--a 650-page novel probably can sustain two appearances, but not more...), providing more reminders of who his myriads of characters were, and help with a few credibility gaps in the plot, particularly toward the end (why on earth could Misha not search his own attic until a hurricane hit, speaking of which, if he was out in the storm himself, any tail worth his/her salt wouldn't be giving up either...). Concerning length, if every sentence, scene, had been perfect (or nearly so!), readers would enthusiastically stay with him till the last page. But, all in all, my vote is that it is a worthwhile read and a great discussion-group novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pedantic, self-pitying, infuriatingly long book","review":"This book and the main character are both so irritating that it is difficult to know where to begin. I wanted to smack Professor Garland and say \\"Be a man!\\". Instead he is a sniveling whiner. I sincerely hope this book is not autobiographical. The chip on this man's shoulder is more like the Rock of Gibralter!I agree with the reviews that say this book needed heavy editing. His descriptions are sooooooo long and tedious that I eventually found myself skipping over entire paragraphs. It is very difficult to warm up to a novel that has few, if any, really likable characters.To Professors Carter I give one piece of good advice - Don't give up your day job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many useless characters","review":"It could have been very good if written using fewer characters. I think the whole story could have been accomplished without the brother Addison & cousin Sally--their clues could have easily been assigned to another of the numerous characters. Talcott's child could have made a brief appearance. I still don't know what \\"dare you\\" from the 3 year old was supposed to mean but having the kid throughout the book was boring. He could have cut down on some of the Law school fellow professors too. I lost track of the different professor's personalities after awhile. I agree with one reviewer who called it Harry Potter for grownups. I'd read another Carter novel--if there ever is one with the hope that it is a little less drawn out."},{"rating":"1","title":"uuughhhh!!","review":"I really wanted to like this book and I kept with the story till the very end but it will quickly become kindling in my fireplace this winter. Seeing this book go up in flames will be the greatest satisfaction that I get out of it! It was drivel. Sometimes I was interested in the story but most times I found myself skipping sentences or even paragraphs just to get through the author's thoughts that had absolutely nothing to do with story line. I also found the reference 'darker nation'- extremely annoying and racist--again, it proved to have nothing to do with the story. It had promise but the ending was weak- particularly given the energy I contributed to get to the end! It really chaps my heiney that books like this just keep getting bought based on the populists-- and it chaps me even more that I become victim to the idea of book-club recommendations. ugghghhh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious, introspective, plot somewhat obscured so far","review":"If you like to read lots of introspection and emotional responses to real and perceived race relations between individuals, this is the book for you. The mystery plot is rather obscured as most of the text is about the character's reactions to colleagues and his wife and other family and only about one thing per chapter occurs related to the mystery. But don't expect any action, at least in the first 200 pages, which is about as far as I have gotten. I am in doubt that I will finish it. I am not normally opposed to character development off the main plot, and often read British mysteries, for instance--but this is so extreme."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sleep Inducer","review":"An intriguing mystery that coukld have been done with a third the length. Trying to separate the mystery's flow from the uninteresting deviations into the author's distaste of his treatment as a minority and into non-important and complex family traits is a numbing task. His adept handling of the language, however, is admirable. Insomniacs will appreciate it, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating...I tried to like it, but unsatisfying ending.","review":"(1) Too many secondary characters receive too much attention(2) A crucial character who is set-up to be intriguing turns out to have no impact on the plot at all(3) A big secret you were waiting for...is never revealed(4) Most of the characters are extremely self-absorbed(5) For a book that supposedly relates the experiences an unfamiliar world. I found very little that could be called insightful or even fresh.(6)There's a couple of nice passages that made me say \\"right on!\\" But not enough.(7) Sub-plots introduced early in the book have very abrupt endings midway through...muting their impact or cause you to wonder why it wasn't edited out.(8) At close to 700 pages the pacing was very inconsistent: at times I coudn't put it down, but more often I felt anchored in one spot for 50 to 100 pages at a time.(9) The tone was unremittingly downbeat."},{"rating":"1","title":"I skipped whole passages and it still droned on and on and..","review":"One of the worst writing styles I've ever encountered. He repeats himself constantly and the minutiae of every little thing, thought or action irrelevant to the plot of the mystery had me skipping passages and reading only what was written in quotation marks. The pacing is awful, his sister is a pain in the *&%$!, he's a whining fool that desparately needs to give his wife a much deserved tongue lashing. I was curious enough about the mystery to stick it out, but will never read another book by this author - it was the worst! I really hate this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Slow Slide Downhill","review":"Devoured the beginning, plodded through the middle, & skimmed the last twenty pages just to say I read the whole thing. A very disappointing, unbelievable ending. Read my favorite short scene while you're in the bookstore-- pages 111-114 (the classroom scene with Avery Knowland); if you still have to read it, check it out from the library.I'm going to try Mr. Carter's non-fiction book, \\"God's Name in Vain\\" since I enjoyed his \\"sideline soapbox passages\\" more than the dialogue and action. Seems he was trying to reach every possible market with this thriller--rich, poor, middle-class, African-American, white, gay, straight, intellectual, young, happily married, unhappily married, FBI agent, etc. etc. etc.My worst complaint: didn't like the use of the phrases \\"paler nation\\" and \\"darker nation.\\" Are these the next NEW politically correct ways to describe one's skin color? This verbose \\"suspense thriller\\" lost its thrill a page at a time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Business or pleasure?","review":"Apparently, Carter has never heard the writerly dictum to 'show don't tell'. His characters are introduced with long wordy descriptions that reveal nothing. This discursiveness extents to every part of the writing, not just character creation. His dialogue is flat. His prose is flat. An MFA program would do him wonders. There's a good plot in there, but the book is a stylistic snooze that makes it hard to plod through."},{"rating":"1","title":"so what was i supposed to get in this/","review":"i found this novel tedious at best.....and i have to admit i found carter's references to the paler nation and the darker nation a bit affrontive.....maybe i'm not attuned to the latest appelations of heritage being of the paler nation.....i plodded through this book primarily on Carter's reputation within the ranks of legal intelligencia, hoping for something more than i found....and found his budding novelist skills lacking....it didn't grab me, i did want to put it down often, and couldn't wait for it to end.....and its end i found disappointing, but i could not have ended it any differently.....his characterization was wonderful in his wife and son, both of whom he loved beyond himself......that was about the only redeeming element of this book...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overwritten and boring.","review":"The plot is long and involved. The protagonist is a wimp who earned my immediate dislike with his continuous cerebral contortions. There is an endless cast of cardboard characters, none of whom I cared about. The only reason I finished this book is because once I start a book, I make myself plod on no matter how hard the journey.I gave this book two stars for Mr. Carter's command of the English language which he unfailingly demonstrates to the reader at every opportunity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow start, lost interest","review":"I tried to wait a couple of years to let the hype about this novel die down before reading it, thinking that time would allow me to approach the novel without any bias from previous critiques. While I don't remember much about the reviews of \\"The Emperor of Ocean Park\\" when it was initially published, I do know that the story seems to lack the pace and suspense required for me to maintain any interest in it. The story centers on unraveling the circumstances surrounding the death of the patriarch of a prominent African American family. I was hoping that the concept along would keep me interested but the story moves too slowly. I'm not giving up on this one but I won't try it again for a few years."},{"rating":"2","title":"a new look","review":"good read will continue with author;book in fair physical condition. will send on to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intellectual and literary legal thriller","review":"Talcott Garland, a lonely law professor, looks into the \`natural causes' death of his father when it becomes clear that his dad has left explicit instructions in the event of an untimely demise.

Bottom line, SKIP IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Emperor of Ocean Park","review":"Claudia Bernard said it all---why have you deleted her review!?This monstrous book is insultingly padded with superfluous verbiage. It might have been slightly more interesting if the multi-monickered protagonist had actually succumbed to his recurring red haze of anger and killed his wife, rather than passive-aggressively risking sabotage of her career. I suspect judicious editing would have resulted in a poorly written short story, at most.

He's a member of the elite 'darker nation', as we are constantly reminded, a law professor, who has to always show his intelligence, and condescending attitude.There IS a great story in this book, but both the author and editor fail to flesh it out in a way to make the reader comfortable. Instead, both have chosen to go with the more confusing, complex and pendantic writing that just weighs down this story and reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Good Thriller","review":"Stephen Carter enters the world of fiction with a bang. The Emporer of Ocean Park comes highly recommended, and does not disappoint. It's full of twists and turns, of familial discord and of mysteries unsolved.Seen through the eyes of Talcott Garland (husband, father and now reluctant adventurer), this story will engage you from beginning to end. Tal's marital difficulties, strange siblings, chillingly dangerous \\"Uncle Jack\\" and the mystery woman who keeps popping up just when his life gets dangerously close to becoming normal again will keep you on the edge of your seat.My only complaint is that this book is TOO LONG! 650 pages is about 200 too many, even for a book this compelling. And, while I enjoyed the way the author wove his love of chess into the storyline, after awhile, the more arcane game references began to wear on me.Nevertheless, I recommend The Emperor of Ocean Park to anyone who enjoys a good mystery- and has a little time on his or her hands to read :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The most overwritten book I've seen in years","review":"This is a perfect example of today's extremely overwritten book. This book should have been half of its 580 page length. The overall story idea was good, but the execution -- the endless minutiae, the overkill on the themes of the upperclass black -- just turned into a complete mess. The hokey cliffhangers that formed the basis for ending almost every chapter were so amateurish and formulaic I was actually embarrassed for the author.What's become of today's editors? Why don't they edit (and cut) anymore? What's become of the single detail that commutes volumes about a situation, a character? This was an assault on my patience.

Same goes for Carter. Good idea, good characters, good story of a multi-generational, upper-middle class black family --but bad , really bad and boring interjection of a mystery (?) that goes nowhere. Why didn't some Harold Ross type put a stop to the flow? I finished it because I was taken with the family story, but found myself sighing with frustration whenever the author veered off into the mystery tangent. I'm sure Carter will produce better fiction - he has the gift, but he needs to tighten up the narrative."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Emperor of Ocean Park","review":"This book was recommended to me by a gentleman while I was traveling on a trans-pacific flight to asia. This is a chilling account of one families assent through the political world and backyards of Washington DC and it's elite.

The author is WAY too hung up on who is of the paler nation and who is of the darker nation, etc. It really distracted me from the book and I had to put it down halfway through. I don't even CARE who killed the judge. I really don't. Seemed Mr. Carter wanted to make some type of social statement that I just don't relate to.

I'm still not altogether certain as to whom half of the people in the book \\"work\\" for (I don't want to get into plot specifics, but the comment betrays a serious failure of the novel). And, worse, I wonder why the Judge didn't just tell Addison the punchline before he died. It would have saved Prof. Carter and the rest of us so much tedium.

The characters in this book - all of them - are contemptible human beings, impossible to care about. And those names! \\"Kimmer\\" - why didn't he just call her Muffy or Bitsy or Lilibet? And \\"Misha\\"? How pretentious can we get here? What a twee name for the protagonist. As a previous reviewer remarked, this book seems to be the unfortunate offspring of a union between an unbridled ego and a publisher desperate for the all-or-nothing blockbuster. And how condescending and insulting the promotional campaign was - \\"Gee, whiz, you mean there's actually been this black upper middle class, right under our noses for the last hundred or so years?\\" The hype surrounding this windy, overlong tome has been an insult to the meanest intelligence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long to take you to a dull ending","review":"I really struggled with this book. Even took it with me on a flight to China and back and could still not finish it with 12 hours on the plane ride both ways. Finally got it done last week and breathed a sigh of relief. I did it! I finished it! But why? Who knows? The book could have been done much better in about 200 less pages and more tension. I could see early on why Kimmer felt as she did. I did too. Avoid this one. There is too much more out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"A John Grisham Knockoff","review":"This mystery is big, clunky, and tiresome. I think it's perfect for those who want to perfect the art of speed reading, because you can whip through the text and get to the plot without missing much of anything. There's loads of reflective thought that turns obsessive in a hurry, and boring and repetitive and irrelevant. I frankly thought this book was amateurish, but there's real glimmers of good writing here and there. You just never know when they're going to hit, and you have to work your way through so much blather that it's hardly worth the trouble. The characters aren't very interesting either. So what's to like? Not much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn...","review":"I was extremely disappoited in this book. While it included some challenging vocabulary, the plot was convoluted and meaningless. What took 600 pages to explain could have been accomplished in about 200. The main character is a bore and, frankly, the reader is not invited to cozy-up to any of the characters. I do not believe that this book accomplished its mission (so I assume) to be a page-turning mystery. Instead, it was a mix between character study and at attempt at social commentary. I could not decide if I was reading an essay or a work of fiction. I do not recommend buying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smart writer, bad book","review":"I have to agree with Michiko Kakutani's review in the New York Times yesterday, in which she referred to this book as: \\"a contrived, implausible and needlessly baroque melodrama, which reads as if it were written for serial publication, with nearly every chapter ending on a hokey cliffhanger.\\"Mr. Carter is an accomplished, smart, admirable and even a brave writer in much of his non-fiction. This book, however, is a mess. I could not wait to read it after seeing the New Yorker profile a few weeks ago, but this is just a complete disappointment. The publisher's hype machine definitely got attention for this book - it's too bad that it just does not deliver. Stick to what you know, Mr. Carter."},{"rating":"1","title":"law professor should stick to non-fiction","review":"A big disappointment from a writer who is much better at social commentary in non-fiction forms. The prose is stilted (and, for some reason, all in present tense), the plot is creaky, unweildy, and implausible, and somebody at his publisher should have gotten him a good editor. This book doesn't read as if it is by an author who has read or enjoyed thrillers. The \\"cliff-hanging\\" chapter endings are silly. It got a long review in the New York Times by someone who didn't know that a black bourgeoisie class existed. Maybe the book will be entertaining for this small and naive audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"A 250-page thriller in a 652-page bore","review":"I decided to read 'The Emperor of Ocean Park' because the story sounded exciting: a postmortem message from an infamous black judge to his son. Mysterious (and sometimes grisly) deaths, a beautiful and mysterious stranger, and the mysterious disappearance of a scrapbook of awful memories. Mysterious, eh?The problem with this exciting tale is that it is buried in 400 pages of irritating commentary. The protagonist, Talcott Garland, is unhappy with everything: his allegedly unfaithful wife, the nasty politics and racial divide at the law school where he is professor, and just about everything else. Talcott has something snotty to tell us about every colleague and family member, and his self-pitying attitude makes him difficult to like. If you can stand the endless melodrama, you might be able to dig your way to an interesting mystery story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring !!!","review":"This book was a nightmare !

I am endlessly glad I borrowed it from the library and didn't buy it. I am a scientist and read many technical documents-I have never read one as ghastly as this.

At that point, I can either stop reading, when I was about 300 pages already in, or keep going. I decided to keep going and it didn't really pay off. By the time you get to what I think the author considers the \\"big reveals\\", they are not satisfying. The characters behind the mysteries are confusing, and I found myself thinking, \\"I don't even remember who this person is!\\" The main questions that keep the lead character going are interesting, the book did not have to be over 600 pages! I also didn't care for the many references to the \\"darker\\" or \\"paler\\" nation as a reference to someone's race.

I've read over 700 pages but I'm here to check the reviews to decide whether I should finish it? Some of the big mysteries are solved but not all of them - just not sure I care. I think the overall story is good - the suprises so far are believable yet suprising - unlike some other authors - but there are just way too many words. I do think he can turn a phrase...but it appears no one edited him? The editor did not do this author any favors in the end.

At times, I wanted Carter to quit going through so many contortions to get from one scene to another (like the Misha nickname, one is led through a twisting, winding path to get to the conclusion of said scenes and it seems as if Carter forgot that the quickest way to get from point A to point B is a straight line) and just get on with it.I think the main problem with the book is that there were too many coincedences and too many characters introduced as a matter of convenience. And the deus ex machina of the hurricane was a bit much, but hey, if you're gonna get it on the big screen you need a big climax."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is a story here somewhere, but...","review":"The writer, though apparently acomplished in his technical field, could use a writers workshop before embarking on a second work of fiction. I grew bored with the almost continuous stream of 'new' characters that just happened to have some sort of relationship with the character to keep the plot twisting along that where introduced and dismissed every 30 pages or so. It seems that few characters are ever allowed to take on more than one dimension in this story. I don't need to like the main character to enjoy a story, but I ask for more substance to his personality to make up for it. The main character comes across a shallow and never seems to really develop a motivation for his actions, beliefs and emotions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic....Classic at end","review":"The Emperor of Ocean Park, did re-new my spark in legal thrillers...the scences, the descriptions were top rate, to say the least...however, as what appears to have become part of contemporary literatry, the ending was plain and suspect.I recomend this book to everyone, however realise it is Prof. Carter's first fiction novel and the cob-webs of teaching at Yale are still present."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Implausable","review":"Interesting but tiring.The author uses way too many pages to tell an implausable story of corrupt judges and a host of characters with very little to recommend them but driving ambition.By the time one finally ties everything together it has taken so long to unravel one hardly cares anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"few flaws, but very enjoyable","review":"I just finished the book, and I really want to call it a pageturner. Yes, Carter sometimes repeats himself, yes, it could be a 100-200 pages shorter, but still, I really enjoyed it and have already recommended it to a couple of friends. Only a few times did I feel like skipping a few paragraphs, but that was also because I could not wait to see what \\"the arrangements\\" were all about.

Then I gave up and went to books on tape..well that was in two parts, I didn't find this out until I got to tape 10 and it was the end of tape set.I went back to library and got abridged CD and finally finished the book. This process took from Labor Day weekend until the end of October. The story just was no worth it, I don't see how this author got all this hype for such a long draw out story.

I cannot wait for Mr. Carter's next project."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-Rated Racial Garbage","review":"Maybe I'm just a middle-class white girl from Un-diverse Central Wisconsin, but this book was way too racial for me. I don't understand how race can consume your entire life, your every thought, your every action. The author is WAY too hung up on who is of the paler nation and who is of the darker nation, etc. It really distracted me from the book and I had to put it down halfway through. I don't even CARE who killed the judge. I really don't. Seemed Mr. Carter wanted to make some type of social statement that I just don't relate to."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Emporer of Ocean Park","review":"This book was tedious, dull and in the end inconprehensible. The characters are stick figures. Marriages disintegrate and yet the couples never once talk about any of their problems. The central mystery of the book is left in the dumpster. Every other sentence is a run on screed about how awful white people are to black people. If that were really true I don't think this book would have gotten a single good review. Do yourself a favor and bypass this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"insomniacs delight","review":"What a lot of long-winded, stream-of-consciousness, plot- destroying, self-indulgent drivel.

My hesitation about a revised rating stems from the fact that I'm still trying to get through the book without ripping up the photo of the author on the back jacket cover. Carter seems to be a talented story-teller, but his \\"issues\\" are distracting...It's hard to view a real life (or fictional life) law professor as a victim...Seems like millions of real life (and fictional life) \\"paler nation\\" (Carter's phrase) folks would love his lifestyle! -Amen"},{"rating":"1","title":"dare you to finish this book","review":"I dare you to finish this book!

The sentences are run-on, too long, too many commas.

If so, the editor should be fired. I couldn't finish it or get half way though. And the names of the characters are annoying: Kimmer, Mischa, Maria, Bentley, Addison, etc. Gag!!!

Crisp, short interesting sentences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time...","review":"While there is an occasional - very occasional - nice turn of phrase here, the book as a whole is awful; dull, downbeat, endless and unengaging.

From the first page it is obvious that the mysterious murder of his judge father is only a subplot. Conversations that lead to evidence are broken allowing the author to vent on race, affirmative action, and his never ending fear that his wife is cheating on him. I could not get into this book. I found myself skiming pages, trying to find some, any, element of plot in this heavy handed, one-sided, lecture on how Carter views race relations in America.

I was surprised and disappointed, almost from beginning to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Stephen Carter brought all the characters to life and engrossed me in the action and mystery of it all.

It is TEDIOUS, repetative (in desperate need of further editing) and no matter what I did, I could not find an ounce in me to care about even one character in this book. The characters are so unlikeable, I no longer cared what the outcome was. Also, all the \\"darker nation\\" and \\"paler nation\\" stuff really was tiresome and over-used. I'm in an interracial relationship and my partner and I both thought that was just bizarre. And he didn't really say anything new or interesting about the law academic scene.

Carter, is a rare modern book, that offers a glimpse into the black elite; a university law school; and a complex multi-generational family. The plot twists and turns between events, clues, false leads, suspects, allies, and bystanders. The hero, Talcott Garland's quest is to unravel a mystery left behind after the death of his difficult father. His quest strips him of his illusions and comforts in life, and forces him to confront the dark past of his father and a network of family, friends, and political and judicial luminaries.

Great descriptions of places and characters and then it drags on the plot. He uses chess as a metaphor for life and to explain the plot - great, except for those us who don't play chess and now are made to feel guilty because we don't.

Carter has written some significant books. His academic qualifications are unquestioned. Unfortunately, his ability to write mystery stories or serious novels is in serious question. This book could easily be 200 pages and 10,000 adjectives shorter. Talcott, the hero of the story, and the son of the Emperor of Ocean Park is as unsympathetic a protagonist as you could ever want. I didn't care for this book at all. And I definitely won't be reading Mr. Carter's next novel.What concerns me the most about this book is the incredible buzz surrounding its release. I cannot imagine how reputable critics were willing to give this novel a favorable review.

I took many small sessions to finish this book. Lots of twists and turns. The development of the characters was wonderful. The story line seemed to be pretty simple at first and then just started to develop in so many different directions. It made me stop and think. Life is not black and white, but all shades of grey. The complexity of the relationships in our own lives and families is expressed here.How we view the past is from our own view-point. These main characters got to see the past through other's eyes.

The Emperor of Ocean Park is a book you will think about long after you are finished. I disagree with many reviewers that the book is too long. While Carter does not write the kind of prose that makes you read for the sake of it and his dialogue can seem stilted, there is so much being said within the story. The mystery is compelling, page turning stuff. And unlike other works there is nuance to the story, not a straight line but a journey to the truth.

It seemed to be ok for smaller transfers and non-media documents like spreadsheets and word docs. Took it back to the store and went back to my 1GB Sandisk USB drive.

Often files saved onto it get corrupted. I've used a lot of different brands of flash drive, but all have been 1-2GB, so I don't know if I just got a lemon, if all PNY drives are shoddy, or if no one can make a stable flash drive at that size.

She includes plenty of anecdotes from various families with children of various ages and temperaments. She recognizes that not everyone sleeps the same, or needs the same conditions to be able to sleep well. This is so validating for me personally who has two children that are sensitive, intense and irregular according to some of the characteristics she outlines. My kids never went to sleep on their own as babies, they never let me put them down \\"drowsy but awake\\" in a crib and they still need alot of snuggle time, etc. to settle down to sleep.

The author (who is bisexual, not Gay) has good intentions, but all too often, his ego and ghetto-fabulous lingo trip him up. For a guy who used to be a teacher, Mr. Setfrey's grammar leaves something to be desired. \\"Ebonics\\" or Black English doesn't have to sound ignorant! I didn't like his casual use of the word \\"homo\\", either. My biggest objection is to his comments about the Black women who have been attracted to him. Yes, those women were homophobic, but they didn't deserve to become the butt of crass jokes. Tearing other people down to build yourself up, that's not the answer."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY A MUST READ!!","review":"I was gifted this book by a relative of the author. Benn Setfrey thank you for the autographed copy. I am a female heterosexual christian. I found this book to be enlightening, thought-provoking, well written, and down right outstanding.

I bought two, and I never realized how much food was going down my drain until I started using them. Since we have septic, that was probably Really Bad. Anyway, these strainers catch everything, and the way they fit over the outside of the drain means that scraps don't slip down between the edge of the strainer like they do for the standard strainers that fit down in the drain. I've been using them for a few weeks now, and they have stayed really clean. Food particles do not get stuck in the holes like mesh strainers, and everything drops right out with a quick tap on the edge of the trash can. Just give it a quick wash every now and then to clean off food residue and you're good to go. Best value for the money since I bought my first Harmony remote."},{"rating":"1","title":"The profit margin is just to high.","review":"This item should be selling for 1/2 of what it being offered.

A clogged strainer slows down the water flow which is a problem when you're draining something such as a big pot of pasta.This is made of perforated stainless which is a world easier to clean -- just rinse or, if it gets really grungy, toss into the dishwasher. It's very thick, holds its shape well, and does not rust. Basically, the last strainer you'll need to buy! Costs more than a typical wire strainer, but works a LOT better. Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job","review":"My original strainer wouldn't drain fast enough just running water through it. I bought this one in the hopes that the drainage would improve. It works well and looks nice. My only concern is that it has a sharp point at the inner rim, from bent materials in the strainer. So I don't run my finger around the strainer, but it's fine with a dishcloth. It's not a deal breaker. The box says it fits large drains and garbage disposals from 2-1/2\\" dia. to 3-1/4\\" dia. It's also dishwasher safe so that's good news."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to keep clean","review":"Use this in the kitchen sink.

It catches all the food and is easy to clean. The mesh holes are not so small that food never gets out of it. The strainer doesn't get icky and moldy like other strainers. Sometimes food get stuck enough that doesn't come out with a shake, and I can get it out easily with a brush, but that take extra work so I throw it in the dishwasher. It comes out clean. I love how the strainer always looks new and clean, unlike other strainers which get moldy and rusty."},{"rating":"1","title":"More trouble, more work","review":"This rests inside your drain but it actually blocks the water flow and pools around its edges.

As for these two destinations, the book lacked essential information (like the frequency and cost of various public transportation options between towns).

Some of the stories are repetitive and can get boring at times. Some stories grab your attention but don't leave a everlasting expression. This is not a book that you would read more than once, unless you like repetitive stuff. I had to skip some stories because it was too boring. This is an okay read, not the best Erotica that people are raving about. There's are far better intelligent/creative Erotica books out there. This one is not one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mozart's Magical Fantasy","review":"Great way to introduce any child old enough to have a developed imagination to classical music. These stories are set to classical music. For example, Mozart's Magical Fantasy is basically the story of the Magic Flute only a contemporary girl narrates and is actually part of the story. The background has the music from the opera. It really captures the imagination and my kids want to hear it over and over again. They go to school talking about Princess Pamina and Prince Tamino. They make me wait in the driveway for the CD to finish to see how it ends (even though they've heard it 50 times. Vivaldi's tape is about an orphan girl and also very interesting.

It's true that as the 30s became the 40s his music lost sublety, becoming almost martial in its beat, but in earlier years he still stands with the best. This CD presents some of his best recordings from that period, beginning with \\"A media luz\\" from 1926, his first electric recording.A few track details.

Might as well read this...","review":"This book is a very easy breezy read (took me an evening at best). I liked the fact that the main character (Sarah) wasn't desperate for boyfriend (a typical chick lit theme). Sarah's problem ceneters more on not having a job and really not willing to settle too much when it comes finding one. She'll make do and pay her bills but she doesn't really compromise who she is and I found that to be very refreshing. I wouldn't say Sarah has the best set of priorities out there - she whine alot about the 12 on her metro card, not having and money, etc... but she goes out an awful lot for someone who is living lean! I was out of work for 6 months right after Sept. 11th so I could really identify with the whole job search aspect of this read. It wasn't heavy reading - rather enjoyable for an evening read or rainy day read. I wouldn't purchase it though..."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Awesome Read","review":"I read this book in 2 hours, I could not put it down. We have all been there, done that in terms of the job world. I empathized with the fact that Sarah did not want the administrative jobs.

After about 2 months It doesn't work any longer! I am very dissatisfied with these items. I purchased them to replace my OLD iron that is 20 years old. The only reason I bought a new one is because I wanted one that had automatic shut off. I guess I can't complain about it's cost as it's been awhile since I had to make a purchase. Needless to say, I am now using the OLD ONE! In my opinion, new technology SUCKS!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another iron...","review":"This is just another steam iron. I've had mine for almost two years and it has the problems that all steam irons have. It's no longer drip free, although for the first year it was. While it does produce an above average amount of steam, the shot of steam function has isn't limitless and I haven't been able to \\"vertically steam\\" any hanging garment. I drain the water compartment after every use, yet mysteriously it occasionally leaks. The retractble cord occasionally gets hung up. The small door to the water compartment is fragile and should be treated as such.On the plus side, the iron heats quickly, is stylish and easy to handle.That said, no I won't buy another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst iron I ever purchased","review":"I purchased this iron to replace a Rowenta iron that was vastly overrated. I liked the (Sunbeam's) retractable cord and the ease of filling it with water. That's where the praise ends. As far as the actually ironing, it's like pushing a mack truck over your garments. The sole plate does not glide smoothly at all (creating more wrinkles), and it overall does a very poor job at getting out wrinkles, even on hottest setting and utilizing the steam. Don't bother with this one, even if you get it at a good price. I'm replacing it after a couple of months of aggravation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died After Five Months","review":"I bought this iron about five months ago and it completely stopped working yesterday. I have no idea why it suddenly broke. I used it about four times a week and was not impressed. Even when it was working, the steam generated was not great. There are much better irons out there for the same price. The best thing about this iron was the retractable cord, but you had to manipulate that to get it to retract fully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Iron, couple of flaws.","review":"I actually do like the iron, I love the steam shot, but the spray needs to be redone, it never hits my clothes, it always sprays above and beyond my clothes onto the floor. I just don't use that feature. My problem is with the retractable cord, as a previous reviewer stated, you have to wrestle with the cord to get it to fully retract. Well, in doing so, mine broke. I have to hold the cord under my hand now when I'm ironing. Otherwise, it just shoots right back inside the iron. UGHHHH!! That drives me nuts. I guess, it doesn't really pay to try to get a little more fancy with your iron. I'm going back to the good old stand by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ditto 1st Review-->Christmas purchase dead already","review":"Bought it in December...has been leaking since the begining of this month...I'm actually here to find a away to get my money back when I felt compelled to leave a review.There are better ones out there...guess you can't buy quality irons for less than $50 bucks anymore :("},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of money","review":"This iron looks good, but it is really a terrible waste of money. It does not \\"iron\\". It wrinkles the clothing, making the item you are ironing even worse.

After intermittent use it started leaking like a sieve. Otherwise I did like the iron. So, like a fool I went out and bought the same iron again thinking this one was just defective. This time, besides leaking again, when I used the steam black water came out all over my clothes. And YES I always used bottled water. I do not iron very frequently but when I do it is usually dress clothes which makes it twice as bad. I will now look for an iron with many good reviews and purchase one of those no matter the cost. I'm never going to just choose one off the store shelf again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time or Money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Bought this the first week of December and thought it was great! Two weeks later the retractable cord mechanism broke. Not just broke as in it stopped retracting, but broke as in pieces of black and clear plastic started coming out of the cord opening.

I'm not really interested in the latter, hence the mere four stars. I only hoped the pages for second part (one long chapter) were devoted to the first! As Irwin says in the book, the rank of Oriental scholars in the West has more than their fair share of eccentrics; and it's sheer joy to read their biographies, though short. Sir Richard Burton is only briefly mentioned (for whom you've to refer to Rice's biography), but you'll meet the good Guillaume Postel and Edward Henry Palmer.

The quality of the yogurt is very good and the machine is very easy to use. The only issue I have with this product is the timer. First of all, the high-pitched, piercing noise that it makes when the time is up is akin to a fire alarm, and drives my cat up the wall. Second, if you want to cook the yogurt longer than 10 hours, you have to reset it. This is an issue when I am using it overnight, or when I need to leave the house but have to wait another two hours because my yogurt maker is shortly going to begin emitting an earth-shattering alert. I would still recommend purchasing this product because for this awesome price, I'm willing to put up with those issues, and maybe the more pricy options are no different.

The tops do not seal to the jars so yogurt can leak out at any time, the jars are TINY - what am I, a 3-yr old?, the jars are a pain to clean given their shape.3) The timer is awful, even reviewers that say good things about this maker say that the shrill beeping is gross.Stay away from this yogurt maker.

I've made one with a packaged yogurt starter and a few with yogurt from a previous batch. The Deni yogurt maker has done what it was designed to do. The jars that come with the unit are hard to fill and clean. I found a plastic container at Family Dollar that holds a quart and fits into this machine and I've been using this to make yogurt rather than the jars. I'm pleased with the Deni maker. It doesn't get too hot. The timer is approximate. When I set it for 8 hours, it went off at 7 and 1/2, which isn't that much of a big deal.

I boiled the milk, let it stand until room temperature, then mixed the yogurt culture and milk together with a whisk in a pitcher and added it equally to each indiviudal jar. I set it on 12 hours the first try and 10 on the second. I actually think the second was better. The yogurt is so creamy and fresh after putting in the refrigerator for a few hours.

If you follow the recipe and heat 1 quart of milk, and add the 1/2 cup of live culture yogurt, you are left with almost 3/4 cup that won't fit in the jars! The tiny jars are more like baby food jars, and not only do they not hold 6 ounces, the tiny opening and lip on the inside make them hard to eat out of and clean.

Sand casting was poor, there was a large defect in the outside, appears to be from extra sand / material in the mold. The biggest problem was when I went to fit it. There was excess material on one of the flanges, that required extensive grinding to get the two manifolds to fit together! Next, I could not get one of the inside studs to thread, and discovered more excess flashing in a cavity where a bolt should pass, preventing the bolt from making it to the head.

It is a rather sexy album with a deffinate grown-up feel as opposed to 'Footsteps' which was very pop and not a bad debut effort.The 80s influence is apparent and works well and the fact she has co-written a lot of the songs makes her connect well with each one. The songs arent preachy or overloaded with meaning but each one can stand on its own as an accomplished piece of music.

The physical beauty can be both overwhelming and subtle to nth degree of white or gray. But the people whose traditions have bound them to the land and those who choose to live here are not always described well.I think Gerri Brightwell made a good start. She caught the strength of those who have been raised here and their ability to survive. She describes cabin life with feeling and is not exaggerating the constant danger of living in the deep cold. She touched upon the interdependence of Alaskan families; in this story there are negative impacts, while I witness far more positive and necessary mutual support.So, as a start, it begins to bring an image of Alaska to the foreground.

I was impressed by how much detail he goes into for the treaties and time periods, although I was somewhat pressed to remember the names and personalities involved. It was a wonderful book to read, if you're interested in this material, and I am. The historical references, in particular, were helpful in understanding why some treaties have the wording that they do."},{"rating":"2","title":"A loving look into the true essence of being.","review":"Mary T.'s sharing on her experiences and knowledge of our spiritual lives is a way to reconnect to the essential truth of our being spirit in human form. It allows for some straightforward answers to concerns we all have about moving forward in our development. It gives me greater peace to have her visions of what is beyond this life. It fills me with gratitude for her guidance."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUPERFICIAL TREATMENT OF A PROVOCATIVE TOPIC...","review":"This is a quick, easy read of a provocative and timely topic, considering that baby boomers are aging rapidly. It is unfortunate, however, that the reader does not get to know much about the author or her alleged psychic gift. This has the effect of creating somewhat of a credibility gap between the reader and the author, making what the author has to say not particularly believable. Perhaps, if the author had given more information about herself and her gift, the accounts that she gives would ring more true. This would have made the book more effective. As it stands, the book, although somewhat thought provoking at times, lacks depth, and fails to fully capture the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for those looking for comfort as a suicide survivor","review":"I have not a doubt that Ms.Browne has a psychic gift but, I do feel that if you read a great many other books by different pychics you will be comforted and reassured that a loved one lost to suicide will be forgiven in the life hereafter.Ms. Browne takes a vague and different view that is not the case.Yet she does talk about a devine power of love and forgiveness that doesn't fit in with her thoughts on the victims of suicide.Some how I feel this area is not her expertise and that this particular book should be skipped by anyone looking fo reassurance that their loved one has been welcomed with open arms to the life hereafter. As I stated before I do indeed feel that Ms. Browne is gifted with the psychic ablility but, I think the comdemnation of suicide victims is contrary to everything else she writes."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"A Must Read for those who want to know what happens to our loved ones and what will happen to us when we \\"pass over\\", because we don't die."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO NO NO.

The picture of the author in his cab shows the NYC taxi fare starts at $1.10 and is 10 cents for add'l 1/9 mile.So the jokes are all old. Almost none of them are even remotely funny. The long ones are all written in a really outdated way.Here is a sampling of the short \\"jokes\\":\\"I was in a bathroom and saw on the wall 'Dyslexics of the world untie!\\"'and \\"Q: Did you hear about the restaurant on the moon?

It makes me think I should start compiling my own collection of stories, perhaps this books only redeeming value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero","review":"This is a collection of ethnic, sexual, blond, and just plain lame jokes. Inevitably, some of them are variations of the old ones. I don't really buy the author's story, but just in case he actually overheard those jokes in his cab, he should have forgotten them right there instead of wasting paper and offending just about anybody. There should be a more decent way to make a living.And to those of you who believe that ethnic jokes are harmless: you are living in a dream world. Those jokes perpetuate hatred, although indirectly.

No longer a place of jungle and tree, but still a place of mystery, misery, and sudden, unexpected, horror. Maybe Brazil is really only like that in the movies, but nevertheless. Brazil is a poignant film of love, loss, and a statement as bold and as powerful as that of Huxley or Bradbury. No less is the soundtrack a work of art, carefully crafted to linger in the listener's mind not as an annoyance, but as a gentle, lilting memory that takes one back always to the heyday of BRAZIL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Soundtrack","review":"Brazil is one of the all-time great movies. The soundtrack is a perfect compliment to the visual artistry in the movie. This CD is great, but it could have been just a tad better.

They were very well developed, people that you can easily relate to. We all havethings in our past that we are ashamed of, but being a Christian does not make you immune. I enjoy the author's writingstyle a great deal. She has a poetic way of writing.Sometimes, the past-present switch throughout the book got a little confusing. It was difficult, at times, to determine ifshe was referring to something now or in the past.The book was also a little wordy, which made it hard to follow the storyline.I also would have liked to see more on how Celia and Bruce resolved the ghosts of the past. It seemed to end a littleabruptly. I do agree with the reviewer who said that the author took the reader to the peaking point, then changed scenesfrom Celia's story to Bruce's.But overall, the book was very enjoyable and interesting to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better luck next time!","review":"Jamie Langston Turner has been one of my favorite authors for years, but this book was a major disappointment. While it starts out mildly enjoyable, it soon becomes almost painful to make it through to the nauseating ending.

Hopefully we can expect better from Ms. Turner in the future, more along the lines of her first books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walt Disney Treasures - Elfego Baca and The Swamp Fox - Legendary Heroes","review":"It was great to see some of the legendary old time shows. My older boys were more familiar with the Swamp Fox as the song had been on a Disney Music CD I had. We played it on long car trips and the tune was so catchy they would sing along. Now my youngest (by 7 years) was able to see it with me and he also thought the tune was catchy and would sing along as well. It really kept his interest.

This is not a good value for $35. Most full seasons of 25 episodes of most TV shows are in this same price range.Don't forget, Disney, you're talking TV shows here...ones that you're rerun on your own channels.

My children brought the episodes to school while the class was reading about General Marion and they enjoyed it.

Some princess....ANY PRINCESS.... MUST marry the Prince before Lady Larken's baby is born because she cannot marry until the Prince marries and she is starting to \\"show\\" her pregnancy.

The simple story of the search for a true princess is overshadowed by a pregnant girl friend, a mute king and an adult prince who eats dessert sitting on his mother's lap.

You'd think that, since Carol Burnett originated the role of Princess Winifred, she'd be concerned about sticking to the script.

I'm not sure if Ms. Burnett got bad advice or just believed that what she was doing was the right thing....but cuts galore..and weak performances (acting and vocally) tell the tale. I realize the last 2 television incarnations were cut as well...but this one made just no sense...and as much as I like Tracy Ullman - she is a bit long in the tooth to play Winifred to a camera.

I have to say that I was really disappointed when I realized some of the best gags, and a few songs were completely left out of this film version. Overall, though, this film captures most of the spirit and of the stage version and featured some good cast selections.

It spells out exactly what information you really should have before picking up the phone or sending out a resume, shows you how to keep yourself motivated and how to document your progress and research thoroughly.This is the 2nd book I've read to help make my job search more effective, and I'd say it's a perfect complement to Nick Corcodilos' Ask the Headhunter : Reinventing the Interview to Win the Job. The one place that this book falls down is the actual interview advice. While Get Hired Fast!'s interview advice is great to keep in mind, I think that Ask the Headhunter's \\"New Interview\\" is a much more effective way of taking control of an interview and demonstrating that you can do the job, leaving fewer questions in the interviewer's mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Concise and pratical","review":"Graham gives you the tools to do what needs to be done.

Tap The Hidden Job Market In 15 Days is a guide to using a direct-calling strategy to get a job quickly in the wake of dot-com failures, increased automization, and other twenty-first century obstacles that make earning a living more difficult than ever before. Chapters addressed how to break the old rules when they don't work, how to identify key contacts in target companies, how to follow through and nail the job, staying even keel in a face-to-face interview, how to keep a new job once one has it, why it is important to keep looking even when one has a job, and more.

However, it does not portray what is going on today. The author instructs people to pick 150 contacts within the local job market and contact all of them. Where am I going to get 150 contacts or job openings? There are only few jobs openings even in my big city that I would be interested to explore. Then, who am I going to contact? Many organizations do a wonderful job at hiding those human resource managers' names and other contact info. When I tried to find out, they were not giving out their names or their contact information. The internet has not been helpful in that regard either. Overall, the strategies described in this book are not bad at all. However, the times are now different from what they were in 2005 (the date of its publication). If you can, employ those strategies. However, you will find there is not much to employ.

The typos are innumerable, and the writing not especially coherent. There doesn't appear to be much that is new here, and it seems to me that a published demonstration of forensic sculpture should feature more than a budget plastic skull, which may or may not even be cast from an actual human specimen.

There was sooooooo many unanswered questions. The acting was poor, the script was lousy and the plot was terrible and totally unbelievable!! I was told this movie was supposed to hit the big screen but I guess it just wasn't good enough to make it there, and if you saw this movie, you would know why. And I tell you what, had I of seen this movie in the theater and paid $6.75 for it, I would of demanded my money back!! I guess every good actor has it's flop of a movie, and this was definitely Shemar Moore's.

One thing I really didn't like is that she gave away which house she belonged to.

Unfortunately, since it's a cuff and I had to pull it a bit to take it off (you have to open it a little to get it on and off and tighten it when you get it on so that it doesn't fall off but that's normal with cuff bracelets), it actually broke in half the first day that I wore it and was taking it off.

This is a show you don't want to miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"troyez","review":"Ever since I first heard \\"Blind Man in the Dark,\\" on the radio in 1998 I knew this Mule thing would be great. I knew Warren and Woody from the Allman Brothers and knew they were great, but when they stepped out with Gov't Mule it was like a breath of fresh air for me. This album was the first Mule album I bought (and wore out) and it rocked my musical foundations. It is a must buy in my opinoin. I have seen Mule three times now, met them once (before Woody died), and would kill to see them again - my point is that this album changed the musical landscape for me. Go and see the Mule live (if you haven't yet) and support the boys in person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warren is a huge talent, but this is not my cup of tea","review":"Warren Haynes shined in his 8 years in the Allman Brothers Band (particularly 1989-1994ish). He had a wonderful slide tone and a great voice that harmonized incredibly with Dickey Betts & Gregg Allman. He added incredible acoustic guitar at various times, as well as being another good songwriter for the band. His first solo album was also enjoyable (1993), if not great.This album, on the other hand just doesn't do it for me. It is entirely too dark and heavy & the songwriting isn't memorable. The vocals sound too angry for my taste and there are no harmony vocals on the record. I can see the attraction to the heavy/hard jams. I like jam bands, but I also like great melody & great songs. I feel that Warren is a natural talent who is made to play in more of an ensemble. He is also great in a country environment as can be heard on his recordings with David Allen Coe. I've been scratching my head about Gov't Mule since first hearing them in 1993."},{"rating":"1","title":"DARK, DARK ALBUM","review":"Even though I respect the players in this band a great deal individually, Gov't Mule leaves a lot to be desired in my mind.

Track after track on the first was interesting, fresh, conveying well their sought-after male emotions of frustration and (less) anger. But this last album: It's the kind of music that I'd be embarrassed for someone to hear coming out of my room. Tacky. Loved the first one, though. And looking forward to seeing the third on sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ughhh!","review":"I didn't care for this CD.

I regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After hearing of the mighty Gov't Mule for several years now, I finally decided to take the plunge. I am very disappointed. Perhaps I chose the wrong album to start with? Maybe only once or twice is some sort of tangible \\"groove\\" established on this album. The rest is off-beat guitar hooks that go on for way too long and a drummer who doesn't know when to stop playing fills."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed","review":"As far as bands in general go they are ok as a back-up band (I saw them on TV, backing up Bob Weir). But the music on this album is about as mediocre as it can get. At times it is downright annoying. Each song is more monotonous than the last. I'm glad I bought it used. At least I'm not out a full 18.00."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Yawn and a Shaking of the Head","review":"This is one of the most bland and boring blues/rock CDs I have ever heard. There's nothing here that hasn't been done better by a hundred other bands. Power trio? You've got to be kidding! There are way too many holes in the music. I was playing music by Cream, Hendrix, and Mountain back in 1970. I know what a power trio is. I just don't understand the fascination with this CD or this band. Pass this one by."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their best","review":"From reading other peoples reviews it is funny how everyone's taste is so different. I think this album is a masterpiece and their first completely bored me. They are three very talented people and Warren's very dark song writting is great.

Give a listen and you'll soon be satisfied. This album makes up for 99% of the garbage that was released and called rock and roll in the 90's. Like your music heavy?, Like it born with soul? If you do then its time to get behind the Mule. Warren, Matt and Woody lay it down like no others. You need this album...believe me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Donor Death","review":"I was glad I rented this one since I would have missed a great thriller otherwise. The acting, directing, story, sets, music were so good in fact I intend to purchase it. This is one of those sleepers you may have missed but are happy you find. Stowe and Quinn are great together and the rest the cast do fine jobs in their support roles.When a girl that was blinded by her cruel mother as a child is given her sight back as an adult, she starts a new life. But while her eyes are adjusting to the change she sees a murderer in her building. She then falls in love with the detective that doesn't believe her story. As he comes around to it, the case develops and we see how the murders tie together and we fear for more than just Stowe's character.

I thought the CD of the movie's music would have more singing, but there is only a bit of singing at the beginning and end.

While the book on Preparedness was a very useful, enlightening book, it was this one, One Small Boat, that has me hooked on her as an author.Her true accounts (another book I will read, One More Place at the Table) of what it is like to be a foster parent are inspiring. The traumas that are inflicted on some of these children are chilling, but this book provided a glimpse into what a patient loving foster parent can do to help them. It also can show what they can not do, no matter how much care they give. There is a frightening story of two children in her care who will need far more care than any foster parent can give.

I have done hours of research on all types of Bariatric surgery and this book is one of the least informative. Gastric Bypass is hown as the magic answer. Easy, simple, and the only way. In reality this is far from the truth. Gastric Bypass is a huge decision for a person to make, and one that should not be made unless the patient is adequately informed.Specifically the sections covering other surgical options (duodenal switch, gastric banding, etc.) are blatantly biased. While I realize this book is geared toward Gastric Bypass, that is no excuse to give false or incomplete information on other surgeries. Also, the sections on Gastric Bypass itself is very glossed over and makes it seem as though it will be a cure as opposed to a tool for weight loss.There are so many other informative books out there...this just isn't one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gastric Bypass Surgery","review":"It answered all my concerns and questions.

In a 12 step format, this would be one's Higheer Power.The incredibly backwards suggestion was that of surrounding one's self with binge food and carrying a food bag around. In Ayrveda medicine, it is suggested that one eat when hungry, but come on folks, it is nourishing food that the \\"caretaker\\" would want for the body. I have friends who are sugar addicts and they are responsible enought not to keep it around to tempt their dis-ease.Alcoholics do noot keep booze around to prove that if they have enough of it they will not drink it.

Some of this does not translate as well to the written word but most could have (as evidenced by other authors in the same genre).The writing is wordy and sometimes difficult to follow if you are reading this like most Dr. Who novels. (They usually are simplistic in vocabulary.) Cotton's use of the \\"journal format\\" of telling the story (ie Bram Stoker's Dracula) does not seem to work well for a Dr. Who novelization.

Barrett provides excellent cueing, she is always on rhythm, offers alternative moves by means of a colleague in the background, and maintains a cheerful, motivating flow of encouragement throughout. Some of her twisting moves will not please those with problem knees, but these are easily modified without sacrificing the essential purpose of these moves. Both this and \\"Barefoot Cardio\\" are superior to Barrett's \\"Slender Sculpt\\" and \\"Skinny Sculpt\\" in terms of flow and safety."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Backup Software","review":"Retrospect \\"Express\\", which comes with the 70 GB Rev drive, is anything but. Slowest backup software I have ever encountered. I am a computer geek and even I found the user interface to be obtuse and at times unfathomable. If you buy the drive, put money aside to buy a good backup software package."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pen skipped when writing","review":"I bought this pen to replace the exact same pen that I had and lost. This one skipped when I didn't hold it at one particular angle - my previous pen didn't. I think the nib is slightly bent - I'm really busy so I didn't take the time to return it and ask for an undamaged one - but I was very disappointed because I loved the pen I lost. I hardly use this one because it skips."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I've recently taken an interest in wanting to learn about overnight hiking trips, and as a requirement i need to learn about surviving in the wilds and being able to rescue myself. This book has been highly rated thus far so I decided to give it a try. I do not regret it! The color illustrations are extremely helpful to me, being a very visual learning person and artist. It doesn't overwork anything it teaches and just keeps things short, sweet and to the point. Very helpful. I haven;t finished reading the whole thing yet, but what i have read so far has been extremely helpful. I recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive reference book","review":"Understand that this book is exactly what the cover says it is. It's for surviving any climate in any situation.If you're looking to figure out how to survive a 7-day black-out at your house, this book would cover that. HOWEVER, understand that's not the intent here. This book is directed toward people who are trying to stay alive and stay reasonably healthy in the wilderness until a rescue team arrives. It's really for people who are trying to survive the most extreme situations.In contrast, most folks who experience \\"survival situations\\" in suburbia are trying to figure out how to keep the hot showers running, etc. The concept of this Survival Handbook is much more raw than that, and may not be useful to you if you're looking for how to stay fat and comfy with your DirecTV running."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must For Any Survivalist's Collection","review":"Interesting read. Good information.*Plant drawings should have been photographs of the real thing, would have been more useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great info, good read","review":"This book has a ton of great info, a lot of which I personally learned in the Army. There is so much that I didn't know or was no too familiar with also. If you do a lot of camping or backpacking, this book would come in handy. Just make sure you actually try and practice what you read. You don't want your first time to be the time that your life depends on your skill."},{"rating":"2","title":"sas survival handbook","review":"Purchased this book after reading other reviews. Very pleased that I did. The book is very well written and Illustrated. The pages are of a gloss finish,High quality.The information supplied in the book is invaluable and will always travel with me"},{"rating":"2","title":"binding","review":"Excellent book, complete with pics of plants, animals on glossy pages. Very exhaustive list. The only thing I'd say negative or if I could suggest an improvement is the BINDING. If it was in spiral or comb, it would have been a lot easier to keep the book flat open while you follow the instructions. You'd have to use both hands to open & read the book, a bit of an inconvenience but it shouldn't stop you from buying it, if at least you err on the side of caution, as I do because of hurricanes here on the east coast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reference book for pro's and Beginers","review":"Well written and easy to follow. I have been camping many times, but this puts things in a different perspective. Might be a life saver if you throw this in your BOB (but go ahead and read it first). I would pair this with a better reference book on plants to eat(with pics) and you should be set for any SHTF situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guidlines","review":"Excellent guidebook. Have the big one for my Bug Out Kit and the small version for my car. Great Techniques, simple explanations, and decent picture/captions to get you through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Been looking for a book like this for a long time and so far this is the most complete survival book, but still small enough to throw in my backpack for camping and hiking trips. Love it, lots of great info."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAS Survival Guide - SMALL pocket version","review":"Be Advised. IT IS A VERY SMALL BOOK and so is the print inside! Please Please Review the pictures before buying this version of this book.Although this small one may be easy to carry in a pocket or a pack during camping or Bug Out. For general everyday use and educational reading, the LARGER version of this book which AMAZON sells will be MUCH more enjoyable and useful. You'll be a lot happier!!!!I urge caution! Buy a magnifying glass along with this small book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Size does matter!","review":"Too bad this book isn't really \\"handbook\\" sized! It would be a great companion to any outdoor expedition if it weren't such a large book. However, the information inside is invaluable. Read it, memorize it, and read it again! It could literally save your life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small to read","review":"This book is tiny and too small to read in an emergency. The expense reflects the usefulness. I am surprised it isn't a bit bigger so at least you could read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good guide, but wanted more.","review":"I hope I never need this. Its a good size for having on hand. It covers most normal scenarios. However, it does not seem to cover surviving the aftermath of a nuclear blast. So, it did not cover everything I wanted. Its good to have around, but I'll still need something that covers surviving after a nuclear attack. (No, it didn't cover the Zombie Apocalypse either, but just watch \\"The Walking Dead\\" a few times and you'll have that covered.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy","review":"Good book but I should have paid attention to the dimensions because it is a pocket sized edition. Tiny font on small pages but it was my own fault. Still a great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mulligan","review":"I purchased the survival guide and I'm pleased with it. I didn't realize that it was pocket sized, and would have preferred to purchase the handbook first, pocket sized travel edition later."},{"rating":"2","title":"SAS Survival Guide","review":"A great book for someone who likes the outdoors and survival techniques. Compact enough for pocket/backpack. Many useful diagrams including plants, animal tracks, how to skin an animal, fire building and cooking, knots and ropes, map reading, traps, weapons, first aid, etc. Alot(!) of information in a small book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valuable and extremely tiny","review":"Expressed in terms of days added to your life-span divided by packing volume, this may be the second most valuable object you can own in an outdoor survival situation. Unless, like Burgess Meredith in that old episode of the Twilight Zone, you can't read small print without your eyeglasses, in which case you will have just succumbed to a new wave of natural selection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tiny lifesaver","review":"Great compilation of the larger version Survival Handbook. This is a pocket sized, but complete guide for outdoor survival. Covers same topics of the Handbook, for 1/3 the weight. It also has pictures and ilustrations for easier comprenhension, and comes with a superfast Content-searching-method."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything is covered.","review":"Wow. This book as all of the bases covered, and I mean all of them! Every concieveable situation is addressed in great detail. It's definitely a reference book vs a practical guide. This book is going to show you how to tie 3,756 kind of knots, which is awesome, but in reality, you probalby only need to know a few good ones and know them well.I would recommend. I'm glad I have it. I would buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pounds of Great Information","review":"The SAS guide is a hefty outdoor handbook, printed on quality paper, for almost anything you'd want to know about surviving in any climate. I finally learned the importance of compass declination to stay alive and how to find the north star using Orion's belt. If I visited any continent, I'd know what to eat and what not to--as well as which snakes and poison frogs would surely kill me. With this book in your pack you could jump out of a plane anywhere on earth and have a shot at survival. Even Thoreau would be impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Survival Handbook","review":"Nice reference book. This is one of the more advanced survival handbooks that I have read and in my opinion is a close runner up to the USAF Survival Handbook. It is a great addition to my reference library and worth the investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome resource","review":"I got this book as a resource for a survival skills class I'm teaching... it is very informative and gives good examples, recommended for any survival situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive, solid","review":"This book contains comprehensive and solid advice for survival for days with little resource. It would be nicer if the book distinguishes survival tips geographically, in topics like edible plants."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need to be prepared.","review":"With all that's going on in the world you need something to fall back on! This book is great to have with other emergency articles."},{"rating":"2","title":"...","review":"this is the best book ever. I had the old colon's gem pocket version but this one is better.the pocket one has it's place, But i highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ideas...not a lot of explanation","review":"I like the book, even if it is a little limited in the area of explanation. The author makes no effort to assure the reader of the techniques suggested or outlined. For much of the writing the author simply makes statements with no supporting text.This is a good \\"first\\" book on survival and primitive skills. You should go into it knowing that each idea presented by the author can be better understood through further readings of the work of other authors (ie-his extremely limited and incomplete section on Braintan Buckskin..same on flint knapping). This book is the epitome of a \\"general\\" hand book with very few specifics.My favorite section has been the \\"camp craft\\" projects. Very cool and useful knowledge, though I suspect that as with other areas of the book I will learn a lot more with another book covering only this topic.All that said, if you had one book to bring with you........you know the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for a REAL Survival Guide","review":"I was looking for a survival guide that is straight forward and tells you exactly what you need for all out survival, and what to do/tips in every situation. This little book (easily carried in a pocket or lightweight to fit in a pack) is exactly what I was looking for. Small enough to carry around but detailed still with pictures for plant life and simple and easy to follow wording. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for 72 hour pages or just camping","review":"I found the information online very helpful in understand the product. This is a great investment and really does not cost to much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the full size version as expected.","review":"Nowhere in the ad did it say it was miniature version. It is not what I expected. It is only the size of a very small book.Extremely dissappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have book","review":"I am a train survivalist active duty military. I have undergone seers training, hostage, pow, sniper, woodland survival etc in my time in the military. This manual is great. Its not the end all be all of survival books but its a great small reference guide to have in your emergency kit \\"just in case\\". For someone that doesn't know anything about living off the grid its a great reference guide for campers, hikers whatever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small","review":"This is a very small book that you can carry in yourget home bag, bail out bag, or camping gear.Full of information you would need if you werethrust into a survival situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift for my husband!","review":"I bought this for my husband-he loves it and carries it in his backpack when we go hiking. It is small enough to fit in his pocket, but is pretty thick :) It has been helpful to him."},{"rating":"2","title":"wealth of info","review":"It's fun just reading some of this book's fun survival facts to another person. It holds a wealth of information. Edible/poisonous plants, first aid care, shelter building, snare building, knot tying, signaling... there's a lot in here. Very useful guide, even for a beginner like myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"great little book","review":"The book has a lot of useful information. I've noticed a lot of it talks about stuff for certain areas of the world so it's not useful to us in America. If everything for other areas was taken out the book could be a lot shorter than it is. It's just the right size to put in a ziplock sandwich bag to keep it from getting wet in my survival bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product, Took A Month And A Half To Receive","review":"Love the product. It did take a month and a half to get to me though. I forgot I even bought it it took so long. All the info I expected and then some. Perfect size (very small, or compact). All in all I'm happy. I didn't need it right away anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"good read","review":"I bought this book mainly to work on honing some outdoor skills, especially identifying plants and acquiring water. I would recommend it for all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wealth of knowledge","review":"Simply put, this book contains nearly everything one needs to know in a survival situation. The rest is common sense. But if you don't already have that, you're probably not going to be doing much surviving. No book will teach you common sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pocket survival","review":"This is a small pocket guide but don't let its size give you the wrong impression as there is a lot of good knowledge here. The survival techniques for navigating locating safe food and shelter building all provide a foundation of knowledge that cansave your life in an unexpected situation. Buy a copy and take it with you whenever possible it could save your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for any prepper!","review":"Some people may say the SAS is dated, however, I found that everything is well informed and well presented.

I love this book chock full of information critical to survival, and what could be better than getting the info from an actual expert. I practice in my backyard all the time with my kids, in fact I'm going to purchase a few more of these book and hand them out to my relatives. this book is a must for every person living on this planet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Informative","review":"Great book, it is very informative and tells you in depth what to do and what not to do. It tells you what plants you can eat, and what ones you can't with color pictures and vivid descriptions. The only thing I wish it had was a waterproof coating (which it might, I haven't tried) because this is the kind of book you want to have with you at all times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is everything it appears to be, well written and informative.
