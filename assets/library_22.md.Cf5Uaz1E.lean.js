Janet may not have the range in her voice, but it suits the music she does, and this style of music brings out the best in her vocals. This album also contains 5 top 5 singles, and has won some american music awards.

Manhunter didn't stand a chance. I also thought the person who played as Hannibal was almost like he was in a school play. Anthony Hopkins if so much better as Hannibal. Also the guy who played as Francis Dolarhyde \\"red dragon\\" was too normal and sane. But Ray Feinnes was brilliant as the Red Dragon. This movie was also very corny like in the end when Will Graham jumped right through the glass window. There was a couple of good scenes but it still wasn't that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book instead","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this film. After reading the book, and several of the glowing recommendations at Amazon, I thought I would be in for a treat, but received a trick! The film dragged along for just shy of 2 hours, and missed vital elements of the book necessary for a true telling of the story. The main factors which led to the killer becoming the monster he was were completely omitted. Instead, we have poor acting, and less than believable location shots, interspersed with \\"dreamy\\" montages that do nothing to evolve the plot. Anyone who was \\"gripped\\" or \\"terrified\\" by any portrayals in this film must have extremely low thresholds for excitement or suspense. It was a yawn that did little justice to Thomas Harris' wonderful book! If you want the full experience, read Red Dragon, and leave the film in the pile of forgotten movies of the week."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT better than Silence....NOT even close","review":"This movie was seriously one of the worst 80's movies I've ever seen...Thomas Harris should be offended and embarrassed his name even appears in this pathetic adaptation of his book. Mann's horrendous use of equally horrendous music ruins a big part of the movie...the rest of the movie is ruined by the horrible acting, editing, and screen play. While the book was suspenful, scary, gory and amazing this movie does not even hold a flame to the original writing. The ending was by far the most offensive aspect...I mean who the hell sees the killer and instead of shooting decides to crash through the window??? This movie is too horrible to even laugh at...I was upset that I lost two hours of my life to this awful waste of film..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not close...","review":"I love Michael Mann, but this movie aged as well as \\"Bio-Dome\\". The whole mind-melding aspect of the plot was silly, as was daddy's explanation of said mind-melding in the cereal aisle. The Sleaze Reporter (tm) character was paint-by-numbers, and a good indication the movie wasn't to be taken seriously.And to the reviewer from Worcester, MA, a helpful hint. When referencing and abbreviating decades, the proper form is to put the apostrophe before the first number; e.g. \\"...'40s\\" or \\"...'50s\\". If you're going to be one of those internet goofballs who chastizes other people for spelling and grammar mistakes, you might want to be a bit more careful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain bad","review":"Don't even waste your time this movie is awful. I don't know what was wrong with Michael Mann when he wrote the script cause it's horrible and his direction on this movie is his worst and the look of the movie is plain ugly. Manhunter is nothing like the novel Red Dragon, those who say Manhunter is superior to Silence of the Lambs are insane. This movie is so bad it make's Ed Wood's films look like Oscar contenders. I didnt even want to give this...one star in my review cause it's not even that good. -5 stars suits it better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty boring","review":"I cannot believe all the hype I've read about this movie in various magazines, websites and books.It was not scary. It was not good, almost a waste of time.WAY too much blue light, why does Michael Mann always have that damn blue light turned on?The 80's music was weird but actually interesting.The book is so much better, that one I couldn;t put down. Brian Cox is good, and most of the acting is OK, but this was a turkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very overrated","review":"With all the buzz out there, I rented this film with some anticipation only to find that the \\"original\\" does not equate with higher quality. First of all, it lacks the writing, direction, and acting of both the \\"sequel\\", 'Silence of the Lambs', and the recent remake 'Red Dragon'. Neither this glorified movie-of-the-week nor the misfire, 'Hannibal', are worthy additions to the franchise."},{"rating":"1","title":"As usual...the book is better","review":"I pity anyone who watches this film without having read Red Dragon. This film works more as a Cliff's Notes adaptation to a brilliant novel. It seems as though the director wanted the Tiger scene so bad, he left out all explanation to the audiendce. I advise people to READ THE BOOK, and stay away from this hokey, BORING, movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't stand to watch 5 minutes of Miami Vice . . .","review":". . . so 120 minutes of Petersen's somber \\"acting\\" is even more unbearable. Mann ruined a terrific book by making it an MTV video. 2 stars for what is left of the story, 0 stars for the director and star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite awful.","review":"I'm not sure exactly what the people who like this movie see in it, but what I see is a blandly directed, ineptly acted thriller that features zero suspense. Anybody who says this is better than The Silence of the Lambs probably just doesn't like a film that has garnered much acclaim and attention. Manhunter is just a dull waste of time. For crying out loud, who would you choose: Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster, or Tom Noonan and William Petersen?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Believe the Hype","review":"I remember the Manhunter movie vaguely, so when this DVD came out, I was hesitant to buy it. I am a huge fan of \\"Silence...\\" and of all Thomas Harris's novels, but I remember the movie being somewhat uneventful. But after reading all the reviews, I figured it was worth another look. WRONG! Those who think this is a superior movie to \\"Silence\\" are just trying to either cash in on all the hype surrounding \\"Hannibal\\" or trying to seem fashionably elitist! Brian Cox is good as Lector, but none of the performances last in memory. Good cop drama, but not a thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disapointment","review":"Thankfully everyone had forgotten this turkey by the time Silence of the Lambs hit the big screen. Loosely based on the first of the series of books by Thomas Harris that showcase the character of Hannibal Lecter it is true to the book only in the names of the characters. The movie version ends prematurely with at least 200 pages of plot left to be told and it dwarfs the Manhuter's lead character to a Cobra-type Miami Vice type copper who is a good 15 years too young in the movie version. Red Dragon, the book that this movie pretends to be based on, is a work of art. Do yourself a favor and read Thomas Harris' best work and forget this movie was ever produced."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best flicks of all time....","review":"If you want to know and remember Anthony Hopkins in the role - which was great - then this is not the kind of film for you.However, if you are more entertained by a SUPERIOR plot and BETTER ACTING, then this is for you. The Silence of the Lambs cannot hold a candle to this movie. Petersen is INTENSE as the psycho stalker, Brian Cox EXCEPTIONAL as Hannibal Lector, Noonan EXCELLENT and (no one'e even mentioned) Joan Allen as the blind victim.... SUPERB.This movie had WAY MORE CLASS than Silence, and of course looking at the lovely Kim Greist never hurts. The soundtrack was excellent as well.Entirely excellent. Will have to get it on DVD someday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better novel adaptation","review":"I read the book \\"Red Dragon\\", many yeras ago, when I saw the movie (the recent one) I noticed that the novel was very \\"adapted\\" as a prequel for \\"silence of the lambs\\", I Found here in Amazon.com the first version \\"manhunter\\", and I was nicely surprised about an excellent novel adaptation and a very good thriller with a limited budget, I have to say the tooth fairy in manhunter is scarier than Ralph Fiennes in RD , the only complaint is the cable that pulls the cop who got shot at the end scenes, but Its a very well done thriller surpasing the new version. highly recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"What Jeff Shannon said...","review":"Believe it or not, this overlooked film directed by Michael Mann of \\"Miami Vice\\" fame is better than Silence of the Lambs. If you liked Silence then you will like this film as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite possibly the best thriller ever made.","review":"If there is ever going to be a poll on the best thriller ever written and the best movie thriller ever created, then Thomas Harris's \\"Red Dragon\\" is a sure winner in the book category. As for the movie category, Michael Mann's \\"Manhunter\\", the adaptation of the novel, would quite possibly take the grand prize. Both the book and the movie are far superior to the overfamed \\"Silence of the Lambs\\". Mann, a long-time specialist in creating atmospheric pictures, managed to make a true classic, and his skill of using the right music to magnify the ambience shows best in this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great film tragic presentation.","review":"I got the new limited edition 2 disc set of Manhunter and I have to say I have never been more disapointed with a DVD in my life. First of all the first disc that is supposed to be the theatrical cut of the film is not. Several important scenes and patches of dialouge have been removed, and unimportant scenes from the directors cut are added in out of context. And to make matters worse the cuts are made very crudely, sometimes cutting people off in midsentence.Then there is the director's cut on disc 2. Saddly this version was never remastered from the source print so the picture quality of the whole film is that of a deleted scene i.e. worse than VHS. Not to mention that several scenes appear to be taken from brodcast tv as several lines of profanity are crudely dubbed over.Take my advice if you are a fan of this movie stay away from this poorly produced DVD, as refusing to buy it might be the only way get Anchor Bay to correct this horrible problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy the Director's Cut","review":"The movie itself is decent entertainment. The second disc (the actual director's cut) is fuzzy. Imagine if you will transferring an SLP VHS to DVD.OK, now you have the idea of the quality of the 'special' second disc.Don't bother with it. Just purchase the regular release DVD. In which case, it would get ***."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After reading 'Red Dragon' by Thomas Harris, this movie was a huge disappointment. The actors, especially William Petersen as Will Graham, lack any strong personality. For whatever reason, the scriptwriters decided to change the script and eradicate several parts essential to the understanding of the story. The reason behind making up their own, somewhat bland and completely different ending to the twist in the book will remain a mystery to me. I may seem a little unfair, as after watching Silence Of The Lambs and reading Red Dragon, Manhunter had a huge reputation to live up to, but it failed dramatically. It's no wonder Dino De Laurentiis wants to make it again. Wait for that version - with the real Hannibal (Hopkins) we all know and love."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Style","review":"A very silly movie, all flash and no substance. Completely unmemorable, except as a footnote to the far more interesting Silence of the Lambs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slence of the Lambs Meets Miami Vice","review":"This story is about Hannibal Lector PRIOR to \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" and Agent Starly... The book (Red Dragon)is fantastic, delivering a riveting thrill ride... \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" (movie form) almost did it's book counter part justice... \\"ManHunter\\" does NOT... I don't read a lot... but this is one book \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" movie fans should read... The problem with \\"Manhunter\\" is that it looks like the cinematography of Miami Vice... They use second rate actors... It just lacks in set design and screen play while visual and sound is reminiscent of bad TV movies... Buy it if you have limited expectations... But don't blow your bucks on the Collector's Edition..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obsolete Film","review":"As others have suggested, Manhunter is simply an obsolete version of Red Dragon. The editing, acting, and film techniques are all noticeably outdated. Do yourself a favor and watch Red Dragon instead. It stars Anthony Hopkins and, unlike most remakes, is vastly better than the original upon which it's based."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This movie [stunk] beyond recognition, Silence Of The Lambs was done so much better than this ... The movie made no sense, it seemed like a bad Miami Vice that wouldn't end. This movie wasn't scary it was a boring cop investigation with guts and gore that was bore. You didn't even see killer \\"The Tooth fairy\\" kill any one in the entire picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"GLAD I ONLY RENTED IT","review":"I rented this DVD and I'm glad I didn't waste any money buying it. The first half of the movie is so boring and filled with the main character thinking out loud. All the interiors seem to be decorated by the same person with the exception of the \\"tooth fairy's\\" home and workplace. WHITE WALLS, WHITE FURNITURE, WHITE STAIRS, WHITE JAIL CELL, WHITE FLOORS. This movie picks up in the last half but not enough for me. Silence of the Lambs is a much better movie. I now understand why music is so important in a movie and how it adds so much to each scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Don't Waste Your Money","review":"Horrible screenplay, interpretation, and directing doesn't sound like good a description for a movie to watch. This movie is a mockery to the book Red Dragon, which was written by Thomas Harris. There is nothing that's good about this movie. All the actors don't fit their role and so on. The worst part is the person who plays Hannibal. Don't buy this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whats with all the 4 stars?","review":"I bought this movie without watching it because no place in town rented it, I have seen both Silence and Hannible and enjoyed them both.... All it is is Miami Vice on the big screen, the director should have stuck with the tv show..., they could have done so much no wonder it took so long from Silence to come out after manhunter no one wanted a movie to turn out as bad as this movie was, Silence is a basic re-make thats better, this movie was the worst movie i have ever seen"},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"I consider myself a Lectur (sp?) fan, and this movie was poor.

I was wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two and a half really, but not real impressed","review":"Maybe if I had seen this one first. But I didn't. So, Hannibal 'the Cannibal' Lecture(sic) will always be Anthony Hopkins. But, thats having just seen the firt two movies. Haven't read the books, don't want to read the... third one? Because my mom read it, and said it was pretty bad. Sorry"},{"rating":"2","title":"William Peterson is highly under-rated!!","review":"If you think, as I did, that Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal was over-the-top, and a caricature of a serial killer, then you too will LOVE \\"Manhunter.\\" This film's Hannibal was so subtle that the actor probably gave ppl the creeps on the subway for years. He is also under-rated...Brian Cox.Just see it, and see how much BETTER (not \\"nearly as good,\\" as the descr states) it is than \\"Silence.\\" And DO NOT EVER spend any money supporting the remake, which is such a joke that I am still laughing...That's my short version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Silence of the Lambs","review":"A precursor to Silence of the Lambs, this film is less Hollywood-ish, but much more chilling and realistic: the mental turmoil Peterson goes through, the serial killer's personality, Dennis Farina as the head FBi officer... all are down-to-earth and believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anchor Bay Strikes again","review":"I can't say it much better than those before me, but I would like to add- How or Why is Anchor Bay allowed to continue putting out poor product? I'm staying away from all things Anchor Bay until whatever licensing needs to occur before their \\"library\\" can be handled and produced on DVD with respect by another company. If anyone has to see their pressings please rent and do not buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know what movie everyone else is watching, but...","review":"Manhunter was a pretty poor film, in my opinion, nowhere even CLOSE to Silence of the Lambs. Regardless, the DVD is worse. The cinematography is beautiful, and the scenes are well shot, but the director's cut on DVD is atrocious. It looks like a 5th generation copy from a TV show, not the crystal-clear picture I'm used to on a DVD. I'm a director's-cut fanatic, and this is the WORST director's cut I've ever seen (it makes my ?th generation director's cut of Alien look GORGEOUS). To top it all off, the editing is choppy and uneven, with dialogue and music abruptly ending. And of course, the horribly-cheesy ending is still just as horribly cheesy. This is not a direct attack on the film itself, but the DVD production. I wouldn't pay $5 for this. Please, please, PLEASE, save your money! Or get the VHS tape. Just don't buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"God-Awful","review":"A pathetic mess. Full of MTV art-direction, cinematography, editing, and music. No character development, no suspense. A total hash of the far superior novel. Silly, shallow flick for people who find deeper meaning in rock videos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"It is pointless to think it is superior to Hannibal or even The Silence of the Lambs. Notwithstanding the superb cinematography from Dante Spinotti, the plot is weak, the Miami Vice looks are awfully 80's...and the soundtrack is utterly weird..it does not match the slow action! It is a pity that Mr. Lector hasn't received more credit.Also, the featurettes are not that interesting. After all, believe it or not, the DVD is worth the small booklet, that looks like a mini FBI file.Unless you are a movie collector like myself, maybe, you should consider spending your money with other DVDs like Hannibal or Silence of the Lambs. I advise you to browse Amazon for something more meaningful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspenseful, masterly directed, should be \\"Oscar Winner!\\".","review":"One of the absolutely best thrillers ever made. Puts \\"Silence of the lambs\\" miles away in the lane. Michael Manns typical camera shooting with flicks that reminds us of his classical Miami Vice episodes adds cult to this extremely well made movie. The most wanted movie in Sweden now."},{"rating":"2","title":"BURTS LOG","review":"Movie is excellent. Character development perfect, plot fantastic and all other aspects in the same vein."},{"rating":"1","title":"We were robbed!","review":"Ok, Back when this movie was released on DVD as the Limited Edition Director's cut, I was thrilled. I bought it and noticed that the director's cut was only a minute longer than the original.......ok........and just between you all and I, its not that big of a groundbreaking minute. And even worse, the liner notes with scenes from the movie showed the \\"Tooth Fairy\\" with a LOT of tatoos over his front chest and back (really cool!), and when I popped the DVD in, no tatoos. Which means, we were all robbed of the actual way the film was cut. Hold out everybody, maybe this will be like the Stargate DVD and the 5th time its released we will get what we want."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Toothfairy rules all","review":"Manhunter,Forgotten for so many years, is now back with a vengeance. One of my all time favorite films! I believe it to be superior to Silence of the Lambs in many ways: 1. The sound track rocks- this is the type of movie you crank up, especialy during the finale. 2. The characters are deeper- this movie is about the man who caught Hannibal Lecter. Graham (the investigator) has the ability to think like Serial Killers do(with great damage to his psyche.... Couldn't be more highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, better than Silence of the Lambs","review":"It may not be as \\"Hollywood\\" as Silence, but it is certainly a better movie. This is how a psychological thriller is supposed to be made. Good performances, especially by Petersen, Cox and Noonan make this film rise above the more popular Silence of the Lambs. Now Lambs is a very good movie and I did like the performances but the only area where its better than Manhunter is budget. Thats about it. If you want big budget over quality, Silence is better. If you want quality, Manhunter is better, although not hugely better. Both are fine films."},{"rating":"2","title":"A much better, more realistic, version of Hannibal Lecter.","review":"This is one of my favorite films. It is wonderfully tight and suspenseful, creating an unshakeable mood with a startling ending. Brian Cox, another wonderful British actor, plays Hannibal Lektor (spelled differently). His performance is much more accurate to the book. Consider this, would you, as a potential patient looking for a therapist, approach Hannibal Lecter as played by Anthony Hopkins, for his services? Brian Cox plays him as a genius full of ennui, who uses his talents as he sees fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, breathtaking...","review":"An excellent (though too short) adaptation of an excellent novel, Mann's film is definitely one of the best and most atmospheric movies of its kind - if not the best one.

First: the character back stories are not in Manhunter any more then is absolutely necessary and skip over points like why Francis Dollarhyde turned out the way he did. Second: For me the way Will Graham was portrayed and written here makes him seem more crazy and slightly less believable. And third: The way they handle the arrest of Hannibal Lecktor by Graham. In here its only mentioned in Red Dragon the confrontation is shown. I like the Hannibal Lecktor movies but would skip this version and just get Red Dragon or rent this one instead of buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry.","review":"Blame it on the Eighties, but I had a hard time taking this film seriously. From the hilarious hairdos (all of the men sport permed new-wave haircuts) to the post-modern interiors, this film reminds me of the 80's style that only exsisted on cable television. The Southern accents are embarrasing and the music is painful. Maybe I wanted too desperately to join the group of people who proclaim this film \\"superior to the Silence of the Lambs.\\" Unless they like it in a Plan 9 From Outer Space kind of way."},{"rating":"1","title":"THis movie stunk.......... PLease dont waist your money","review":"The only reason I wanted to see this movie was because of hannibal so I rented it and I thought it was borring.

It is of a very low quality and seems to be a remake of the original Red Dragon which was in my eyes one of the best of the series of movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now I know why it's not called Red Dragon","review":"This movie is based on the book Red Dragon by Thomas Harris (who wrote silence of the lambs, etc.). The book in my opinion is incredible. It's far better than silence of the lambs or hannibal. I couldn't put the book down once I started reading it. So I was really excited to see Manhunter to see how it compares. Well it sucked! I was wondering why the movie wasn't called the same as the book but now I see it must have been because the author objected. In summary, the director chose all the least interesting parts of the book to put in the movie and even substituted the book's great ending with a really mediocre \\"miami vice\\" style ending. Which I guess was to be expected since the director also did miami vice... Don't buy this dvd, you'll be selling it on ebay soon just like I am err sorry I meant to say \\"amazon actions\\".

Manhaunter is a terrible attempt at making a Hannibal Lecter movie, and it strays far from the tree that brought us The Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal. Brian Cox sounded simply too British for this part, while Sir Anthony Hopkins had just the right voice. The actors in Manhunter must have had medical issues. And Michael Mann, oh my God he's such a poor excuse for a director that he might have even been abused as a child to have created something this awful.But look on the bright side: The remake, Red Dragon, appears in theaters on October 4th, starring the one, the only Hannibal Lecter worth mentioning, Anthony Hopkins.

Michael Mann stuffs the film to the gills with cliches: Will Graham running frantically away from his first meeting with Lektor, Will banging his fist on things cursing the evil killer, and so on. It's distracting. The acting is equally choppy. William Peterson never managed to convey to me that thinking like a killer was draining. Oh sure, he dramatically pounds tables and broods over family photos of the victims, but he never looks like he lost even an hours' sleep during the whole film. The pathetic finale doesn't fit in logically with the rest of the movie, and looks like it's been chiefly designed to end the film in under 2 hours. The one good thing about the film was seeing \\"Mr. T\\" cereal in the background of a supermarket shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Silence and Hannibal","review":"Manhunter is a pretty good thriller and I found it a lot better than Silence of the Lambs, and MUCH better than Hannibal.

I contacted Bionaire customer service and was told they are no longer manufacturing the item, dont have any parts for it and therefore would not honor the enclosed warranty which covers parts and service for 5 years telling I should get the wheels from Amazon?!!! Bionaire is clearly a company I would not recommend buying anythinG from. They are probably dumping unsold redundant products and could care less about the suckers that buy them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution","review":"Be very careful with this product and do not leave it unattended. We purchased our Bionaire last December and, suddenly in the middle of February, it started smoking. It also made a terrible smell, which we luckily noticed right away and unplugged it.Also, please be aware that although this product comes with a 5 Year limited warranty, the shipping and handling costs exceed the price of the heater - i.e. it costs the same amount to send the item to the manufacturer for repair or replacement as it does to re-purchase the item. Because there is no guarantee Bionaire will honor the claim and make the repairs/replacements, the warrary is rendered effectively useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless Plastic garbage","review":"I was sent this device as a replacement when a Holmes heater I actually liked, the now-deleted HQH 306, began to malfunction on its low setting.This heater, in a cheesy plastic shell, is a useless little disaster.

The songs are a little longer, but the band has lost none of their humor, and nearly every one of the songs is instantly hummable. This was made during their golden early peropd, and while the record itself could be a bit longer (it could be tweice as long and I'd have no complaints), it packs the full range of the Dickies' songwriting style between the grooves. It's too bad that their excellence wasn't recognized before punk became more mainstream."},{"rating":"2","title":"God Bless The Dickies","review":"Fast and furious, yet accessible, a brilliant effort by a seminal group in any punk scene.

Joe and his band cover lots of ground here: There's brooding, yet melodic punk (\\"One More Time\\"), downbeat reggae dirges (\\"Fools In Love\\"), blissful pop perfection (\\"Is She Really Going Out With Him?\\"), raucous new wave stomps (\\"Got the Time\\"), and more.Emphasis on more, of course. \\"Throw It Away\\" is a love child between 50's style boogie-woogie and punk. \\"Sunday Papers\\" blends traditional pop/rock with a breezy reggae beat. \\"(Do The) Instant Mash\\" is danceable and fun. The title track is a sophisticated slice of new wave with a rather euphoric chorus.Everything else is rather good too. So why only 4 stars? Well, he got even better on later releases.

But shortly after their arrival, animated scarecrows start attacking the villagers, and the internal conflicts within the village are whipped up by an external force...A book that includes scenes in which the life of the village, and the individual failures of some villagers, is tied up with the presence of an unknown power (well, unknown until quite late in the book), I have to say that I found this book oddly uncompelling.Keith Topping and Martin Day have constructed a novel which, looking at its disparate elements, is one which I would have thought it likely I'd enjoy.

Though \\"Greetings from Hellville\\" is a very quick \\"read\\" and short, the stories themselves are haunting and memorable.The first is a kind of David Lynch/David Cronenberg type of story of a hitman who takes out his target before revealing he has no eyes, then going to a locker and re-inserting them. The next is a horrific tale of revenge against a white supremacist involving voodoo and black magic. The next is a surreal re-imagining of the Judeo-Christian myth of creation, and the final piece is of a man who cannot kill himself.All of the stories are brilliant and while \\"Greetings\\" is not Ott's best book (see \\"The Number\\" for that), it gives you a taste of his style and his enormous talent.

The new character introduced has attributes of another character from a previous episode. Everyone does not have to fall in love with Max.

Not only Max Allan Collins started it out fine and was actually on a roll, but he ended it just horribly.

A casual comment made over one morning's plastic breakfast spins him into a situation most of us could never imagine in our wildest - or worst - dreams.Author Smith has a real handle on the social setup of prison, which is fascinating in itself. The men inside are complete creations, and the reader is allowed to react to them however he or she chooses.

I was a little disappointed at Sasha, but we all have to go though many different phases in our lives until we come to a place where we feel comfortable with ourselves.

They must figure if Apple can get away with this BS on the iPod, they can, too.What does this mean to you? Somewhere between 300 - 600 recharges, YOU WILL HAVE TO THROW THE ENTIRE UNIT AWAY!!! At least with the iPod, you can pay Apple some ridiculous amount of money to replace the battery.But wait, the idiocy doesn't stop there: The earpiece is a tapered ear-gel: IT DOESN'T STAY IN YOUR EAR unless you hold it there with your hand, which defeats the whole concept of \\"hands-free\\".And, to top it off, the activation/de-activation sequence/ear-tones are confusing and goofy; half the time, the activation remained after I terminated a call, which quickly drained the adapter.WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's better to wait for next generation","review":"Well-built but it has terrible voice quality with severe echo.

I've had mine for several months now, and, unfortunately, my experience has been bad. Problems with this item:1) The batteries are usually dead when I reach for it. This is because the ON button is easily bumped turning it on when you don't want it on. Also, the charger times out so if you leave it in the docking station it will eventually be dead since the charger does not trickle :(2) The flashing lights and beep tones are too complicated. Just give me a toggle on/off switch not a push button #%$!@$3) It is cumbersome but I would have put up with this if problems #1 and #2 weren't present.4) Not enough volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work /Customer service horrible","review":"I was really excited about a wireless headset, so when I received it and it didn't work properly I was upset.

Then I tried the web page and emailed them about the problem. I explained to them that I had tried all of the listed troubleshooting suggestions on the web page and in the manual and it still did not work.

When I moved the adapter and headset to the same side of my body it was better but it still frequently disconnected. My wife also complained that the sound quality was poor when I was using the headset. On the good side it is very comfortable and fairly easy to use once I got used to it. It also took advantage of Nokia phones ability to answer and hangup calls from the headdset. The coolness factor is good.

I contacted their tech support (don't get me started), and got a lame \\"well there must be some other wireless devices interfering with it\\". I made sure there were none, I tried it in different locations, and came to the conclusion that it is just badly made. If the headset is more than a foot away from the base, you get crackling... what's the point? Besides that, the user interface is terrible, but I would put up with that if the sound quality were good.

Amazing Adventure, even though it has been digitally remastered looks as if you bought it on VHS. Charade is in better condition, but was also released 30 years after Amazing Adventure. His Girl Friday looks okay, but it is found in better quality in the Cary Grant Box Set available on this site.

The book is comprised of terrible unimaginative black-and-white images of many of Rome's most famous architectural wonders. The photos are composed well enough, but are basically straight-on shots with no attempt to communicate the personality of the buildings or their grandeur.

NEWSBOYS RULE!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition if you own Thrive!!","review":"This is a great CD but I suggest that you purchase Thrive along with it if you don't already own that. This is a great accompaniment to it. There were the odd couple of tracks that were a little disappointing, but the Newsboys always manage to produce great work. The remix that they did to some of their material is so drastic that it sounds nothing like the original and then some of them have just a little bit of a twist. Anyone who is a fan of songs like \\"Lord\\" and \\"It Is You\\" will be thrilled with the new renditions! Other good mentions go to \\"Fad of the Land\\", \\"Million Pieces\\", and \\"Thrive\\".

I personally think that they sort of ruined a few songs, especially \\"Joy\\", but otherwise it is a great CD. The only other main negative is that there are several songs with a large percentage of just instrumental. That is not what I want to hear, at least not in that quantity. If it wasn't for these negatives, this would most likely be a five star CD in my opinion. I definitely like this CD more than the CD \\"Thrive\\" (which has 6 of the original songs that were remixed on this CD) although \\"Thrive\\" is a pretty good CD too.

It has a few good remixes, and the techno thing is sure prominent, but techno's not my thing. I love the Newsboys, and the fact that the Newsboys themselves mixed some of these is pretty cool, but it's just not as good as their other stuff.

I highly recommend Newboys' album Adoration, which will leave you pouring your heart out to Christ!Press in to Jesus...worship Him...there is NO LIMIT to the intimacy you can have with Him.

This little book holds you lovingly in its grip from the first page to the last, through a journey of extraordinary relationships between people and their pets. You will laugh and cry and be amused and entertained throughout. Anyone who has loved or been loved by a family pet will recognize as familiar the range of emotions involved in this unique bond, and will be intrigued by the inexplicable behavior of animals in these true stories. With a light and whimsical style the author creates an abundance of visual images, and combined with some truly gripping stories, makes for fascinating reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"website screwed up","review":"I never received this product because Audible thinks it is in my library, but I can't download, and I can't buy it because it is in my library.

They add structure, dimension, and color to the reality of his world of Yoknapataphwa county. The wealth of imagery, metaphor and symbolism is there for those who want it just beneath the surface of an engaging, at times laugh out loud saga of a family of unforgettable characters within a community of equally memorable characters.Through this portal, one can enter Faulkner's universe, get a feel for his style and an appetite for his work to proceed with momentum to his more complex books.The size of the book itself, with the 3 novels in one cover, might intimidate some and steer them away. The weight of 3 novels together can be uncomfotable during exended reading. But the text offers the trilogy to be read in succession - the story compels one to do so, and draws one back to do so repeatedly.Great work from a great writer - a real treat and special component for the library of any reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite novel of all time--and I've read thousands...","review":"The header says it all.

The only real problem with this game is that it is way to easy I win with kent st. against Duke by like 50. you can adjust it a little to make it harder. When you do this the games are actually close and entertaining. You can create your own preseason schedule I like this a lot because you get to play the top ranked teams.

I own March Madness 2000, 2001 for the playstation, so i figured that March Madness 2002 for playstation 2 would be really great, but i was wrong. March Madness 2003 is so much better than March Madness 2002.I didn't care much for March Madness 2002 cause you could not play a season, so i was anxious to get March Madness 2003. I just got it recently, and when i started to play it the graphics were the best for a college basketball game that i have ever seen.

Some of their previous work seemed a little forced, but with these songs they appear to gel. I'll only focus on four of them. \\"Spirits In The Material World,\\" is a cutting testament to the shallow material things that many view as essential to their momentary contentment. The reggae feel enlivens the somber mood. \\"Everything She Does Is Magic,\\" is a spunky love song with a soaring bridge. \\"Invisible Sun,\\" here Sting is at his sardonic best. His matter of fact voice blended well with Copeland's strong percussion & Summer's echoing chords. This is one of the few anti-war anthems I have ever liked. \\"Omegaman,\\" is a good rocker with Andy Summer's standing out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Police at their most consistent","review":"Although I would say that Synchronicity contains the most accessible and well-crafted Police songs, this one has the most consistency. My favorite track is #8, One World (Not Three). It is entrhalling to listen to Stewart Copeland on this tune as he takes a simple reggae beat and then adds and removes tension throughout the song with his drum/hi-hat riffs and fills. You get the feeling that the band could play around with this beat for an hour and still make it sound interesting. The only real intricately constructed songs are tracks 2, 3, and 9; the rest of the album is basically a polyrhythmic jam session. Great stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still waiting for the One","review":"Four stars for the music, which holds up very well indeed, in addition to bringing back many fond memories from my youth.Two stars for the mediocre remastering, which sounds oh so very, very \\"digital\\", i.e., thin, harsh and tinny, though louder than the initial CD release. Wish they'd done this one in HDCD instead, like the King Crimson and Roxy Music remasters. Perhaps the SACD version offers a broader soundstage and more midrange and bass?One star for the lousy packaging, which picks up scuffs and fingerprints easily and grabs too tight a hold of the CD. (For an example of how to do digipak right, see King Crimson's digipack-ed release of \\"Thrack Attack\\".) I'd suggest waiting for the jewel case release of this one before purchasing.So, two stars overall. Maybe they'll get it right with the next remastering...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three good songs eight filler","review":"The album has a great title and and even better cover.

It's so pathetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well it's a bout time!","review":"I think after the first three silly-centered albums, The Police finally hit it big in most people's minds. It'd darker sound makes it more mysterious and conveniently enjoyable. The flashy single \\"Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic\\" immediately cedes into the dark, ghostlike tune of Invisible Sun. And Stewart Copeland finally can write adequate songs.

This is a very sluggish Dylan album, which is strange, considering he hadn't made a legitimate studio album in almost 4 years (Dylan's last official album was in 1970 with New Morning). He did do a soundtrack (which is good), but it really wasn't an official \\"album\\". You'd think he have more energy after the long rest, but alas, no. It just seems like he's going through the motions here. Most of the songs here are average at best, with The Band and Dylan sounding like \\"let's get this over with\\". Dylan went on a tour (recorded for the far superior album Before the Flood) shortly after this album. Reportedly, he had some of these songs on the playlist, but as the tour wore on, he dropped them. Except for the song On a Night Like This, this is just very, very bland. It's now awful like Self Portrait or Knocked Out Loaded, just bland, boring, and disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated","review":"This is certainly one of Dylan's more underrated albums, along with Nashville Skyline and New Morning. The Band are terrific and it's a great little set of songs as well. To be honest, there are a couple of songs here that don't do much for me, i.e. Dirge and You Angel You, but songs like Never Say Goodbye and Wedding Song (which end the album on a great note) make up for the occasional flat spot. Tough Mama and On A Night Like This are also terrific but best of all is Hazel, which features one of Bob's prettiest melodies (in fact, it kind of reminded me of an Elton John type of melody). Hazel would be in my top 5 Dylan songs except for the fact that Bob hits a couple of really awful notes (even for him) vocally on this one which I have to say kind of spoils it for me. Still a great listen though, highly recommended if you can't get enough of Dylan."},{"rating":"2","title":"the band is The Band","review":"This is another great Dylan album. I would catagorize it as medium level as it doesn't have any greatest hits except for Forever Young which was made famous in a different way by Rod Stewart. It's got some great driving stuff and a real twangy sound provided by The Band. In \\"Something There is About You\\" you can hear the rolling sound of Idiot Wind and get a sense of where Blood On the Tracks was born. These songs are concerned love songs hinting at a last attempt before it's over.Just remember, this album is a great stepping stone from the collection of greatest hits and legendary albums, to the next layer of Dylan's genius.The remaster sounds great. It's nice to be able to pick out the instruments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Miss This Album","review":"I originally bought this album in vinyl and haven't had a record player in many years. Recently purchased it in CD. I had forgotten how good the songs are on this album. And, like all Dylan songs, they are timeless. They are as relevant today as the day he wrote them.Most Dylan albums are well worth the money, but this is one of his best. Dylan plays with The Band, and all of the songs are excellent.Bob Dylan is not known for love songs, but this album has several excellent love songs. WEDDING SONG is arguably the strongest, most passionate love song ever written by anyone.By the way, if you have not seen Bob Dylan live recently, you are missing out. He has once again implemented a new, original style. I would classify it as a driving, hard, blues-rock; it is outstanding. See the Houston Chronicle review of the April 22, 2003 performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take it from an honest Dylan fan.","review":"Anyone giving a four star review to this is kidding themselves. Its a total dog's breakfast. I'm a Dylan fanatic. I love all but the bottom two or three albums of his catalogue, which I consider Planet Waves to be among. The song-writing is half-baked: the lyrics aren't profound, they're cobbled hurrily together. The Band just aren't tight. They're not playing together. Each song is like a drunken person stumbling: you keep thinking they're going to fall over, and they try really hard to hold themselves together but it doesn't really work. That's the truth about Planet Waves, like no-one else here'll tell you.doesn't do justice to the album's enduring track Forever Young."},{"rating":"2","title":"The game they play in heaven","review":"Definitely one of the greatest games of rugby ever. Even though I would have liked to have seen Australia win, this was still a great, edge of your seat game of rugby. I will remember this game for the rest of my life and now I own it I can re-live it over and over. My heart sank when Jonny Wilkinson kicked that winning field goal. The DVD quality is excellent so if you already own it on VHS i definitely recommend purchasing it on DVD. Congratulations to England, they deserved the win, afterall the whole team especially the forwards played really well, even though most of the points came from Jonny's boot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great (!!!)

I love all of the characters and the events are great. It's a shame that this film has not been given a DVD release. I mean Heavy Metal and Rock & Rule got their release, right. I've read in some sites that this movie was later purchased by a major studio and gutted. I want the original that I have, but on DVD.

What's even better are the voices by Billy Crystal, Gilda Radner, Harry Shearer and Michael Fremer as the team who supply numerous talent to all the TV crew of Z.O.O. and the animal atheletes themselves competing in similar Olympic sports like ours. All of this are what makes the TV film \\"Animalympics\\" a joy to watch for all children. The only thing that seperates the film from earning 5 stars is the dialogue and sound recorded which makes it a little hard to sound out, but it's not Dolby Stereo's fault. Hmmm, perhaps they should remaster it in THX. Lisberger Studios, 1979, Not Rated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Renee and Kit forever!","review":"As kids, we taped this off of HBO and regardless of the video quality, this became a family favorite.

I agree with Leonard Maltin, however, in the opinion that it could have been kept to under an hour."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANIMALYMPICS - VHS","review":"This is the third VHS tape of this show I have bought and I am disappointed. The tape was not recorded in the highest quality mode which stretches the tape and lowers resolution. It had already been played several times and after so many playings, the picture and sound quality is very poor. I'm still trying to find one that is either new or hasn't been played much.

This book is AWFUL. The book treates the depressed person as the \\"other\\". It is not supportive or encourageing. The entire book is about how their depression will hurt you and how their depression will ruin your life. It is all about the non-depressed person \\"protecting\\" themself. This book is not at all helpful for a couplke or family faceing depression togeter. The book What To Do When They Are Depressed is much better; much more supportive, and much less scarey.

I felt like Anne Sheffield was writing many parts of the book letting out her resentment to her mother, she was not objective and I think at some point it made me feel like a victim. Also I didn't like the tone of the book, it was like she has the absolute truth about the topics. Medications is not the only solution for depression and is not the main solution, my husband used meds to help him clear out his way, but the drugs made him unable to mantain a healthy life, he had night sweats, nightmares, sexual problems because of the medication. Now he is out of them, and was able to go back to have a happy life, drugs are not a solution they are only a band aid. My husband had to dig a lot, work and heal his past to be able to be happy and undepressed and free of drugs."},{"rating":"1","title":"somewhat hostile & divisive","review":"I found the book to be negative and in some circumstances, over-exaggerated. There are frequent uses of \\"many\\", and \\"most\\", and this book generally paints depressives as being difficult, demanding and fault finding. People can have ongoing problems with depression and not be selfish monsters. I think this book drives people apart and looks for blame. I even get the feeling that the author has a deep seated hostility for people suffering from depression.

I'm actually feeling blessed that she choose to leave. Lots of Christians say, read the Bible during times like this. This book has helped me to understand and believe what the Bible says. Because of this book, I can, for the first time, ACCEPT, deep in my spirit, that it wasn't all my fault.

Here she is much more passionate, powerful and compelling! As I always say, to know deeply Bethnia, it is just essential to listen her live. In \\"Ao vivo\\" she sings, among many others, several songs from the Roberto Carlos album, and most of them, especially \\"Fera ferida\\", \\"Costumes\\" and \\"Voc no sabe\\" become much more touching, just wonderful.

Giving the fact that the author is senior officer in the US army, I guess I expected some professionalism. I was very disappointed. Im not going to complain about the order of the greats on the list, because that is subjective. However, the write decided to include people on the list, that I do not think could successfully lead a herd of goats into battle, like Feidel Castro. Castro might have been a good leader, politician ect but I can not think of any major military contribution he brought to the world. There are other entries like this but I think you got the point.On the up side (there si a samll upside, thus the 2nd star) this book is entertaining.

Supertramp are, I believe, highly underrated, possibly because of their commercially-attuned, easy-on-the-ears music, but that's our loss. This band had much more talent than most of the bands that were new in 1977 (I can do without the Sex Pistols, thank you very much), and the songs on their 1974-1979 albums imply that living in an upper-class neighborhood like Cape Elizabeth, ME; Western Multnomah County, OR; or certain parts of Seattle/King County, WA isn't as great as it seems. I know this because when I lived in that type of neighborhood as part of a special program, my neighbors sided with authority figures against my fellow students and me because of the whole \\"nimby\\" (Not In My BackYard) attitude.

The band found its first Top 20 hit with \\"Give A Little Bit\\", which also brought the album to the Top 20. The rest of the album is flavoured with solid, intelligent songs like the title track and \\"From Now On\\". The closing track, \\"Fool's Overture\\", is a bit longish, using sampled radio and TV tracks througout - it's really about a 4 minute song with about 7 minutes of technological inserts. But it's also catchy, and set the stage for Supertramp's growing cynicism of modern society, a mindset that would grow on their next album, the hugely popular \\"Breakfast In America\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never a quiet moment","review":"First, let me say that the 2 stars are not for the musical contents of the CD. That would have been 5-plus stars of course.No, the 2 stars are for the terrible job the folks at A&M have done digitally remastering this album. Or should I say de-analogizing? The sound is much too harsh, and too loud. Just compare the first minute of \\"Give a little bit\\" with the original (LP or CD) release and you'll know what I mean.I had the entire remastered collection in my \\"save for later\\" basket, but decided to delete them all after listening to thisone. I'll stick to the more analog sounding (and still very defined) first releases.For the record: I listened to this CD on my Electrocompaniet EMC1 with 24/192 upsampling, with the Rogers E40a and a pair ofLS3A's with AB1 subwoofers."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Supertramp album","review":"Hardly a duff track on this record, which makes a welcome change from the band's other works.

The two gems are the well-known \\"Give A Little Bit,\\" one of those 70s songs where you start with just an acoustic guitar and add instruments with each subsequent verse (another prime example is \\"Lady\\" by Styx) and the lesser known title song. There are just so many little qualities to \\"Even in the Quietest Moments\\" that I just love, besides the great title (for which I have been trying to appropriate for the title of a novel for years): the synthesized bird chirping at the start, the initial interplay between Roger Hodgson's acoustic guitar and John Anthony Helliwell's wind instruments, the building vocal harmonies. I always think of this song as a sort of tonal poem that just sets a perfect little mood. No wonder I never bothered to flip the record over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid album by Supertramp","review":"If you have the stomach to stand the super-ultra-sugary (and sometimes annoying) vocals of this group, you will enjoy this album.

It turned me off the game. I played for about 2 hours and gave up. The controls are that frustrating. If you have patience, get this game, it is a really great story/concept.

The gaps in the grate are too wide and smaller clumps will go through and you will have to scoop the out if you don't wan't your kitties going in poop filled litter. Another drawback is that this needs huge amounts of litter, so you will end up going through a tub pretty quickly. If you fill it abut 1-2 inches from the bottom, some clumps stick to the bottom and will need to be scraped using a scoop.In the end you end up doing double the work you did before, first rolling it over and then scooping whats left in the filterate.Only if the grate had smaller gaps this would be a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOTAL waste of money","review":"We tried using this for 2 months before we gave up and threw it away.

The first few weeks were great. Rolled and worked just as described. Then one day my cat made loose stool and it just smeared all over the box and grates. I had to disasemble it and take it outside to completely hose it down and bleach it. That didnt stop, another semi loose stool and when i rolled the box it just got all over the sides. I now no longer roll it. I just scope as per usual and use the cat litter genie. Forget about the rolling unless you want to constantly take it apart to clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Idea Poorly Executed","review":"What seemed like a novel idea, to filter and catch do-do and clumped litter by rolling the whole box, turns out to be a bad idea. The moist portions of the litter cling to the sides and the filter grille, and the clumps won't go into the collection tray. The tray then fills up with unused litter, wasting it. The area available for the cat to actually use is small, even though the box is huge, because the 'working' section takes up over a third of the usable internal space. The fasteners are very flimsy and tricky to use. The side entry makes it awkward to place the unit in a recessed space. In fact, the Omega Paw is more work to use than a traditional litter box. So I have taken the guts out and am using it as a regular box until my replacement, a standard covered box, arrives and I can throw this Omega Paw in the dumpster.

As huge as this is, and I bought the large one because I have 2 cats, the inside litter area is very small. The filter takes up about 1/3 of the box. My cats hated it!!! I had to take the top off and the filter out so they would have some room to move. The bottom is fairly thin, too, and when I either lift it or move it to clean out the dirty litter it \\"bends\\". I also didn't like how it had to be rolled almost totally over in order to get the clumps out. I personally don't recommend it; it's gawdy and takes up far too much room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money and get a regular box!!","review":"This box absorbs odors after a week!! So for indoor use, it makes the house stink like dirty catbox. It's too much bother to scrub the box, and liners won't work with the box size or the rolling. The rollover action works well enough, but too many finer clumps are left behind to keep the litter fresh. I got rid of the box after two weeks of use.Get a regular catbox, liners, and use the new clumping litter with crystals--it works very well. Otherwise, plain crystals is the best for odor control."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Like many cat owners, I was in search of a better litter box. This was not what I expected. I purchased the large one since I have two loving cats. The large is not enough for both of them. If you are the type of person who does not check the litter every day, this is not the box for you. I found that when I check the box every other day, it wasn't sufficant. I was finding a box that gave me the freedom from cleaning each day. If you go away for a few days and have someone take care of your kittys, this would not be something you would want to come home to. Also, if you do not have it connected correctly, it spills every where. I went back to the traditional littler box since I have to check it everyday until I find one that suits my needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, poor implementation","review":"I saw this litter box online, and thought it sounded like a smart idea. However, it turns out to be less practical than I had hoped.1. The clips that attach the hood to the base are very poorly constructed, so each time I roll the box, litter pours out of the seams and all over the floor.2. The waste tray doesn't quite fit the space properly, so clumps will often roll into the space at the end, or underneath the tray. This means I have to re-roll to catch clumps on a second attempt.3. If you roll too soon after your cat has used the litter tray (and there's a wet clump in there) the clump will stick to the grill, requiring some unpleasant cleaning!4. It's quite small, so if you have a larger cat then it will be a tight squeeze. My orange tabbies do fit in there, but only just.Overall, I would not recommend this product. I now use it like a regular litter tray, just taking the lid off and scooping it, instead of trying to roll it. I find that it's less work that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible NARROW contraption...","review":"When our cat first started using this, I really liked the concept. Now, I realize the actual space inside for the cat is far too narrow for my cat. He sprays everything back up against the back corner and the clumping litter gets stuck on the grill and back wall and it is a real mess. Not all the used litter gets \\"thrown over\\" to the collection box, which covers half of the inside of the box, so you have to do it multiple times and I still have to use the scoop and then end up having litter spilled, as the opening is too small to manuever a scoop thru. we're going back to the top opening litterbox...less tracked litter too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Stars is Generous","review":"I am not that happy with this litter box. I only bought it because of the reviews it got here. I thought that since I had tendonitis it would do away with scooping and save the stress on my arm. Well...A lot of the litter sticks to the bottom, making it necessary to bang and bang hard on the bottom to free it, and some of it still sticks. And you can't see what's happening, since you have to keep the lid on. I have had to kneel down with a flashlight to see inside. Then, somehow the dirty litter gets stuck behind the receptacle and boy is that fun to remove.All this banging and kneeling and twisting is harder on my muscles than scooping! I am disappointed; this was a $40 outlay for a product that, once again, fails to live up to its claims."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This litter box was great for about a month. It seemed so easy - just flip it over and pull out the pan. BUT then when you have to physically clean it with Soap and water and it's a mess. TOO many parts.

I threw it out today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed execution of a great concept","review":"Great concept, but as others have pointed out, the execution is flawed. The item is huge but usable space for the cats is cramped so our two weren't very fond of it (and these aren't fussy cats). Unless you roll it several times a day, the scoop drawer overflows and spills litter all over as you pull it out, so you have to hold a garbage bag under it when emptying. The plastic fasteners holding the unit together were weak and easily slid into the unlocked position, so we narrowly avoided a few disasters until we learned to double check them each time we rolled it. We'd read numerous glowing reviews of this product and ended up being so disappointed that we went back to a conventional litter box after a few weeks. Less hassle for us, and the cats were happier. No wonder the price keeps dropping....

However, after owning it for almost a year I found that the product design is majorly flawed. The box is not one solid piece, it is two halves held together by plastic clips. While I had no problem with the clips I found that over time every time the box is rolled litter comes out the bottom where the two halves meet. The concept is great, but in order for this thing to actually work properly it should be one solid piece and not two halves. I found this to thing to be more trouble then it was worth because every time it was rolled to clean the box there was a pile of litter on the floor that then needed to be swept up.

Litter tends to leak out the sides when you roll it over. Sometimes, wet litter sticks to the bottom so you have to bang the bottom to get it to fall off. Next, if your cat's stool is a bit runny, and they don't bury it properly, it sticks to the sides and makes a big mess. It's difficult to scoop if you do find this situation before rolling because the entry hole is small. My larger cat tends to only step in half way so his stool is half on the floor.Although rolling most days is easier than scooping, it does go faster when you are in a hurry. If you have cats with perfect litter behavior and don't mind sweeping litter spillage, this may just be a good buy for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Kitty Litter Box Around","review":"I have reciently inharited two additional cats and was looking for an efficient way to clean their boxes.

I was very enthusiastic about the reviews, but underwhelmed by the performance. All said, I didn't find that the box's sorting of litter was good at all, and it wasted lots of clean litter in the process. Also, worth mentioning, the option to roll this large contraption is fine if you have the room for it, but if space is tight, rolling this big boy around may be more trouble than the alternative. I gave it a shot for a few months and then gave it to the Salvation Army."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still searching","review":"This litter box has a good idea but bad results. The clips on the side are cheap plastic, the folding barrier inside took quite a while to relax enough to fit into the rim grooves. The main complaint is that my cat is inconsiderate and will pee partially on the side or dig down until hitting the plastic before going. Those will not loosen enough to be tipped into the refuse drawer and so the lid has to be removed and the box cleaned like a regular one. It is really hard on the cheap plastic clips so I've now had to just leave the lid off and use it as a normal littler box (but a lot more expensive). If your cat goes only in the center and not down to the bottom then this will be terrific for you.

This helps contain the litter, and YOU DON\\"T HAVE TO SCOOP! okay, well maybe you might have to scoop once a week to get stray bits, but as long as you give the bottom of the box a good smack, it works like a miracle. And my cats are happy with a perpetually clean box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Self cleaning litter box","review":"Something of note that I hadn't thought of because I always use liners is would it come with them or would I need to get them. As it turns out if you keep your box deep so the moisture doesn't hit the bottom and empty at least every other day you won't have to clean it for two weeks or more as long as you continue to add more litter. Otherwise this thing is the BOMB for the price. Came fast. Great seller. Will purchase from them again if they have what I am after. The item was even double boxed to prevent the carriers from mashing or damaging the item. Kudos all the way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic product!","review":"I am a first time cat owner and it is very clean and economical. Always skittish of cat litter pans and scoops, I never bothered to want a cat until I had recently adopted a sick little stray kitten and wanted to find a clean way to dispose of nasty kitty litter. The kitten (only 6 weeks old) took to it very quickly and loves having fresh litter. This has to be the best purchase I have made so far on Amazon and certainly the most useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am replacing all my litterboxes with these","review":"And I have 8 cats! This is by far the best, easiest and cleanest litterbox ever. We have tried the electric 'automatic' litter boxes, but they were all very messy and hard to keep clean.The capacity of this litter box is perfect. It really takes advantage of clumping litter, and the cats like it.I plan on getting 2 more - I'm up to 4 of them now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Little Cat Box in the World","review":"I have found this cat box to be the best by far. It is extremely functional, convenient, easy to care for and the cats have had no problems using it except my 'old guy'. He has always been an outdoors cat but now in his old age he is in the enclosed sun room at night so occasionally needs to use the facilities at night. I think he just does not think as he goes in it just fine but does not turn around when he does his duty. Since he is a good size cat, his rear sticks out even in the large box so oft times part of the load is on the stoop.....Oh Well! the advantages far outweigh this little inconvenience ie. the ease of cleaning, virtually no odor as it is cleaned regularly and easily, enclosed so you don't have to see what it is, fits nicely in a corner etc, etc, etc. I am very pleased with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product","review":"This product is not perfect, but a great improvement over the open-tray. It prevents litter from being scattered over the floor, since it is self-contained. My cat did not want to use it at first, so I left the lid off for 2-3 days. Once she became accustomed to it, I placed the lid on and she used it with no problem. This product makes clean-up much easier. In fact, I was so pleased that I ordered another. I would recommend this product to any cat owner"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made","review":"It's great design and good idea. Simple to use and effective. I really loved it for the first few weeks but then the latch broke and the filter portion of the litter box was getting loose. Now, every time I roll the box, liter seeps out the sides and sometimes the filter/guard flips open and all the liter, not just clumped liter, ends up in the upper compartment/shelf.Like other reviewers have said, I think this would have been a great product if only the quality was better. Faulty latches and filters made this a big pain to use!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to clean","review":"As advertised, this is soooo easy to clean.

It's much harder to clean than an ordinary litter box - the screen gets clogged so easily. I'm going back to scooping - it's quicker and cleaner."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"Best litter box ever, its so easy and simple I even got one for my 68 yr old grandmother who has four cats and she loves it just as well, no more digging!"},{"rating":"2","title":"YES, BUY THIS PRODUCT !!!","review":"I adopted a large cat and a kitten from the Animal Shelter and the baby took to it without problem, the big cat will take a couple of more days but he's getting there.

They pee in one corner which causes a huge iceberg of clumped cat pee. The clumps get stuck in the grates and I have to scoop daily or the box becomes a 30 minute cleanup disaster. Scouping with my cats is flat out disgusting. I had to buy a metal scooper because my plastic one broke.Maybe my 2 cats are just filthy when it comes to the potty but we are switching back to clay with a cat bag. At least I won't have to tend to it daily and can let it go 5 -6 days between cleanings.

Unfortunately, it didn't. Yes it catches the big, loose clumps and poo in the pull-out tray, but it left the clumps that were stuck to the plastic. Also, one of my boys likes to pee against the wall, so when I rolled the box, the litter clumped to the sifting grates - a real pain to get off. All in all, I was spending just as long, if not longer, having to clean the litter box each day. After a month and a half of fighting this thing, I removed the sifting piece and dremeled off the bottom plastic clips that held the sifter in place. Now my kitties have just a regular jumbo litter box with a window to look out of (where the collection tray slid in) when they do their business. Easy litter box clean-up seems to be just too good to be true. Too bad, really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cat litter box","review":"It's huge and hard to rock without the top falling off.

Instead of dreading the cleaning of the cat box, it is *almost* fun, or at least not anywhere near as bad. I usually give it a couple thumps once I have it turned over, to break loose any clumps that might be stuck. Another tip, I use tidy cats litter, and I keept one of the larger buckets once it was empty. Now when I clean the box, I just dump the tray into that bucket and close the lid. No more nasty smell in the garbage, its all sealed up in the bucket!."},{"rating":"1","title":"good idea-poor design","review":"Hi, I have 1 cat who is 5 months old. I have this litter box. I like the roll feature but I have had my box lid come off while I was tilting it to side and litter went everywhere. Even with one cat, I have to clean the litter box several times a day, the area for the cat is just too small, the litter sifter and tray take up 1/2 the space. I do like not having to scoop the litter, but it would be easier if I had an traditional box. The clamps on side are cheaply made and you just have to be very very gentle with this box. Roll it very gently and hit the bottom slightly to loosen clumps. It does not have a filter to stop smells even with lid smells are a problem. It is hard to clean. You end up having to wipe out bottom and tray often, I would love to be able to use this box with a plastic liner but the lid will not stay on if you try to use with a liner. I am going to have to change to different litter box when my cat gets older and bigger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as expected","review":"I must say that I had my doubts about this one but I decided to give it a shot...

I would give the smaller one 5 stars. It was easy to snap together and works great. I decided to order the large size (from Amazon)for my large cat. The large size is very large (too large). The interior piece would not fit into the channel. If I didn't already have one, and knew it was suppose to pop into the bottom rim I would not of had the nerve to take a hammer to it and pound it into place. Also, because of its size, it takes a lot of room to roll over and it's awkward to roll back because there is nothing to grab. I won't buy the large one again. I hope they come out with a medium size. I gave it 4 stars because it does do what it is suppose to do and it's an ingenious way to clean a litter box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"I followed the instructions and tried multiple times, but I could not get this litter box to work the way it's supposed to.

Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great self cleaning litter box!","review":"I use to have the irobot litter box and loved it, but after a year it broke. Not wanting to spend that much cash on a box, this was a fair trade. Very easy to clean and takes little time. I have 4 cats so I have to clean more often. That's the price we pay for our beloved kitties."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many little flaws","review":"Bought this based on the glowing reviews, but it didn't work out. I used it with World's Best Cat Litter, which is a clumping litter but possibly too soft for this box. The urine-soaked litter would get caught in the trap and stay there, and since the box is in my bedroom closet, the urine smell would linger. Also, the area in which the cat does his business is really small, since half the box is taken up with the screened off compartment; when he started digging, he would throw litter out the front-facing door. The self-cleaning aspect was moot; sure, I collected a lot of waste in the little tray, but even after emptying it out I still had to dig around to get it clean. I traded this in a for Clevercat Top-Entry Box, which works much better in my closet (no litter getting thrown everywhere)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Product is a Bad Joke","review":"After scooping litter for my two cats for 16+ years, I was ecstatic to learn about this product. What a rude surprise - it's a bad joke: 1) Large urine clumps stick to the screen and must be removed manually; 2) Significant amounts of 'clean' litter end up in the tray. I'm back to scooping - and not very happy about this huge waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nearly purrrr-fect","review":"When I saw this product and then read the reviews, it seemed too good to be true. But it really works! Cleaning up after Baby is now pretty simple. Just make sure you use the clumping type of litter. The only thing, as other reviewers pointed out, is that the clips can be a bit finicky when putting the unit back together. Realize, of course, that while this box takes much of the unpleasantness out of litter box cleaning, it should be completely cleaned (as in removing the litter and taking it apart to wash) every couple of weeks or the problem of \\"items\\" sticking to the bottom will occur. Very glad I decided to make this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent box","review":"It works fine, but some litter does spill out when I tilt it.

Took the cover off to put the used litter from my cats' old box into it to test it out.5. Put it back together (with litter in it, I had to make sure the cover was well-seated in order for the locks to work easily).5. Voila! Worked as stated!!!!6. And this is most important of all: My two cats have used the box several times in the 16 hours since I set it up and I've rolled it over and emptied the tray ... wait for it ... because it's fun ... and ... easy ... and clean!7. My total dislike (amounting to years) of emptying my cats' litter box are over.8.

Easy fix: when the box is roll over simply tap the bottom and it will come off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well- best solution yet","review":"It works as described- sometimes leaks a little dust/litter when emptying because of the tilting (leaks out where top attaches to body). Over all I like it compared to a traditional litter box (no scooping). My cat is 12-13 pounds and has no issues using it. I places a carpet to avoid tracking- which would be an issue with ANY litter box. For me it's the easy daily cleaning- tilt left, tilt 90 degrees to right, tilt back and then pull out drawer. Done. My suggestion to the manufacturer would be to address the issue with the small leak of litter dust make inner screen attach better (it moves with force of litter when tilting to left). Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"great idea, but this product falls short","review":"The clamp seal that keeps the lid on is not secure enough to prevent bits of litter from escaping every time you flip it over. I use super clumping litter, but the action of rolling the container always breaks up the urine clumps - thus mixing it back in the the \\"clean\\" litter to go back into the container. Also, my cats don't seem to like it. I basically have resorted to scooping out the urine clumps which defeats the purpose of this container."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well made","review":"The design is a good idea and it worked well at first. However, the second time I totally emptied it to replace the litter, I could not get the tabs that hold it together fastened back tightly. As other people have noted, they are flimsy pieces of plastic. Unless the tabs are tight, the box leaks litter all over when it is turned on its side.I wish someone else made this design of better materials."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely LOVE it!","review":"This litter box is great. I have never had any problems with it and it's way too easy to put together. I hate scooping litter, so I opted for this box instead of other ones. It's very simple to use and works everytime. I did see allot of comments on here, saying that the product breaks, but I've had these kinds of litter boxes for years and have never once had any issues with them. So, all in all it's a great product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Experience","review":"It seemed like such a good idea in theory but has not worked out at all. I don't wish to go thru the hassle of returning it but would not recommend purchasing this cat box. When the box is rolled as instructed, the debris box fills up with cat sand and does not filter out the feces. Cat sand ends up on the floor and one ends up scooping the poo the old fashioned way. Very disappointing purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe this litterbox has potential?","review":"The concept for the litter box is great. I've had difficulty in using clumping kitty litter. It won't fit through the grids on the side, so I've been scooping it although the reason I purchased it was to quit scooping! Our kitty also is reluctant to go in the litter box, so I have placed the old one next to it so we won't have any accidents. In retrospect I should have spent more money and purchased a self-cleaning litter box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaking plasic tabs - is of no use after they break","review":"I've broken two of the plastic tabs that hold this together. I broke one and have been very careful since. Well, I just broke another one and was not using any excessive force. If the clips are broken then the whole system doesn't work. I used a zip tie on the first broken one and was still able to get into the container to fill it, wash, etc. Now I will have to snip off one of the zip ties to get into the container. There is no reason to buy this product if this problem is not fixed. If the tabs are fixed then this product works well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Box","review":"For the price this is a pretty decent litter box. It allows you to clean the box without scooping. I think it would have been helpful if they recommended the best clumping litter instead of one trying different ones until you get the right one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Box!!!","review":"I just purchased this Thursday got it the next day for free shipping. The box was very easy to put together takes less then 5 mins. Becareful of the clips they are a lil fragile but once they are locked in it is so easy to clean this litter box.

Save lots of time and really helps out with the gross factor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not pleased","review":"The primary reason I haven't liked this litter box is because it is hard to secure the lid to the bottom of the box. It is frustrating to have to close the sliders and if you don't the litter comes out on the floor when you turn it on it's side. Turning the litter box does get some clumps out but it's really easier just to clean it like a regular litter box for me.I read a review that said it \\"really works,\\" Not for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but could be better","review":"I like the product and the concept is very good. The design is lacking in stability. The locking tabs slide loose too easily and when rolling the unit it will spill litter on the floor. My solution was to put insulation tape in the joints and putting screws through the tabs. After that it works very well. I wouldn't really be any more difficult to clean as I take it outside and use the garden hose on it either way.I would recommend this product as an alternative to the more expensive fully automatic ones. The automatic ones are more convenient and keep the house smelling better and would be worth the cost difference if you can afford them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke within a week","review":"I absolutely loved this litter box, so much so that gave it a second try after the close tabs broke the first time I used it. After the same thing happened with the second box I was back to scooping again. Great design, but closing tabs are too flimsy and you cannot roll it without them. If not for that I would have given it a 5 stars.I had purchased these as a replacement for my LitterMaid automatic cleaning box. LitterMaid used to be really good when the rake was plastic, I had two that lasted for years. When they went metal rakes they never lasted more than 4 weeks before the motor would freeze up.If I was rich I would get one of the robot litter boxes."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIP OFF","review":"I was very disappointed with this purchase considering all the good reviews. I ordered the large cat box and I was surprised how small it was inside. My larger cat doesn't have room to turn around so he doesn't use it. The sifting equipment takes up quite a bit of space. My small regular kitty pan has more room than this thing.I used the World's Best Kitty Litter, but let me tell you, that stuff is not dustless and when you started turning this box and moving the litter to be sifted there is a ton of that corn dust in the air. I had to wear a dust mask. Also, it has come apart several times when I tilt it, leaving litter all over the floor.If it wasn't so freaking big I would send it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea - poor execution","review":"I am giving this product two stars because the idea behind the litter box is brilliant. Absolutely brilliant! The materials used to construct it, however, leave much to be desired. The plastic is cheap and the parts do not fit together as neatly as they should, thus it fails overall.It is unfortunate that the manufacturers can not be bothered to create a high quality product. As I said, the idea behind this litter box is great. It really is. And mine worked pretty well for almost a month before it started to fall apart.I would have no problem paying more for this item, if the construction were sound. Were it meant to last and be more integrated, I would be willing to pay twice as much. The convenience it potentially imparts is amazing. But unfortunately poor craftsmanship renders it useless. I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ends litter dust in the face!!!","review":"After having multiple cats for too many years to count, I am always on the lookout for a better litter box. The Omega Paw Self Cleaning box is terrific, and works precisely the way it is advertised. You must make sure that the tabs on the sides are locked, which is likely why others have had issues with \\"rolling\\" this box. Once it's connected, you're set to roll out the poop and pee, and never scoop litter again. I'm back for my third box, so that each of my cats can enjoy a private master bath. And by the way, no problem with the multiple cats, they all use the box and the scoopable litter together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Litter Box","review":"I've had this thing for a couple months now and love it. It's so much easier to clean than a regular box. Makes it so easy to clean it every day. I haven't had any problems with the litter spilling out or any of the parts breaking like others had indicated.I considered buying one of those automated systems but I'm glad I tried this instead.Also like one of the other reviewers mentioned picking up a couple boxes of those little scented baby diaper bags from the dollar store to use for the daily cleanings makes this a perfect system."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME...use binder clips if clips are missing","review":"We ordered two of these and I was skeptical at first. One was missing a clip as some of the reviews mentioned, but a binder clip worked as a great replacement.

It takes about 20 seconds to clean each one. Our cats are fussy and demand that we clean the boxes frequently, so these are perfect for us. The type of litter does matter, some clumping better than others. We use the Arm & Hammer clumping litter (multi-cat), and little to no clean letter gets stuck in the waste drawer. It's quick, litter efficient, and doesn't make a mess. It is hard to imagine it wearing out very easily since it is such a simple construction.

This box is easy to clean, although not perfect. It still takes some effort to roll the box on its side and some of the litter dust will leak through. Once in a while a clump of dirty litter will stick to the side of the box and needs to be knocked loose with a litter scoop; not a great problem when contrasted to using a scoop to entirely clean a box!

It will break soon, but the worst problem is that the hole in front is big, and when the cats cover up their mess the litter goes out of that hole all over the floor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!!","review":"This was such a worthwhile purchase.

Waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT BAD - BUT NOT WHAT IT IS ADVERTISED TO BE!","review":"I've had mine for a week and it ain't what its cracked up to be. Cannot get the top to fully lock down therefore I am unable to \\"Self clean\\". For a normal litterbox - which this is essentially is because of the problem - it is WAY overpriced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great For Fast Kitty Litter Clean Up!!!!!","review":"This product is great!!! You can use it so fast and then WOW your done!!!!!! One note though Don't move to fast when rolling the litter box over or a bunch of clean litter will get trapped in with the dirty litter. Overall a great product and saves lots of time if you've got more than one kitty!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great as I'd hoped","review":"I loved the idea of this litter box, and perhaps the smaller boxes work better, but the large size is more trouble than scooping ever was. Litter falls out from the seams when the box is rolled and gets all over the floor and the side and top of the box. The latches that secure the top to the bottom seem very fragile. My cat's clumps are sometimes too large to pull out of the hole where the collection scoop fits in, making it difficult or impossible to remove the clump in the way intended. Also, even though the box inself is very large, because of the design, the actual space for the cat to occupy is fairly small. I'm planning to take the top off and just use the base as a regular litter box. I don't recommend the large box for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than a small box, but with one BIG flaw","review":"The big flaw on this is that it is impossible to use with a litter box liner because the top snaps on with sliding pastic hinges that hook into the bottom portion. (And you have to use the hinges because the whole point of this box is to roll it upside down.) Without a litter liner, you are forced to hand clean any mess left inside once you dump the contents for a full clean (not so easy either).I suppose this box would be ok if you had a back yard and could simply hose it down, but if you live in a big city like I do, four stories up, this just adds a lot more to your work.I recommend Clever Cat top entry litter box instead. It's my other litter box, keeps the litter off the floor, uses a litter liner, and is cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!!!!","review":"I bought this with hope it would save time...it broke within a few months...it also has no door flap so odor comes out easily!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Litter box","review":"This litter box is an ingenius idea that works pretty well as advertised. It is smallish, even though I purchased the \\"large\\" size. If you have a cat that is a \\"heavy drinker\\" like mine, you need to really give the bottom a few good whacks to drop any clumps that might stick. Understand that the box looks big but it's really only half the size that it looks due to the sifting side. Once every couple of weeks you'll want to take it outside and hose it off inside and start fresh, but other than that, you just roll it over, smack the bottom a few times, then roll back and tilt to sift. Pull the drawer and empty. It's just that simple. I use the drawer after emptying, to pour in replacement litter about the same that came out to replenish and reach into the opening and distribute. This way you don't have to remove the top to add to the litter. Over all it's a great box and takes a minute or less to operate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cat litter box","review":"Not overly pleased with this product. Might be good for some cats but was not good for mine. Not that easy to use especially in a confined area. Also seemed like urine leaked outside the unit & messed up floor beneath it. One other problem the waste drawer doesn't stay fully closed when you are manipulating the unit - this causes a problem where you get some of the waste or litter spilling out of the drawer. Good concept - needs some refinements however."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more plastic liners","review":"I can not say enough about this litterbox. I really like the fact that you don't use pan liners with this. No more stinky bags and wasted litter.The only problem is one of the slide locks broke and I have to hold it tight when I roll the box. I saved one of the litter containers and lined it with a trash bag then dump the waste in it and take it to the dump. This litterbox is well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"I love this litter box! And my cats love it too. The only thing that would make it better was if it was a little bigger, and had a handle for rotating. I would still recommend this item. It makes cleaning the litter box very easy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Litter Box Out There!!!","review":"This is the best litter box I've ever used. There's no need for me to worry about my hands getting dirty or litter getting all over the place. You must use clumping litter or the box will not work. I bought two of them and I couldn't be happier!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this box has some problems even with proper use","review":"Concept is great, and yes this is relatively easy to use. However, after 8 months of use I see that:1. litter is wasted unless you roll it, pull out the drawer, and dump it back a few times 2. it is more effective to use a poop scoop because some small stuff is not removed, and 3. the usable space in the large size is only about 12\\" X 15\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Litter Box, Easy to Clean","review":"The litter box is covered so the cats like it, easy to clean, a little difficult to put back together until you get used to if it you take it apart. Only drawback is that you need a little space to actually use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great idea","review":"Love this clever box except the locks aren't very reliable. It leaked a little bit of litter a couple times when turning it on its side. Still, that's better than scooping! Make sure you have plenty of room for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best litterbox option, still some problems","review":"When I was first having trouble with this litterbox, I eventually realized that it was because everything was not completely snapped into place--specifically the fold-down part of the screen. This is very key and the box is lousy without taking the time to do this very thoroughly.Still, even after doing this, the box has its problems:1) Occasionally clumps are too big for the drawer so you have little choice but to try to pull it out while it smushes the clump against he inside of the box. Yuck.2) I still have litter leak through, maybe because the box is over a year old. Just have to keep a vacuum nearby.3) The box just seems cheaply made. The pieces that snap into place remind me of a cheap plastic toy model and I'm just waiting for one of them to break off.I foresee the basic design idea being used by a large company in the future and making a much more refined product, but for now, this is the best reasonably-priced litterbox you can get I think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Litter sticks to box sides","review":"I had to get a scooper and scrape the litter off of the side of the box to get it to go into the container in more than one place or bang on the outside to get it to release. The screen also collected small amounts of clumps on the other side and piled up. I did not like this product, returned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Litter Box Ever","review":"My sister gave me this box when we got a kitten. When she was explaining to me over the phone how to use it, it made no sense to me - I just couldn't picture it. She had to come over and demonstrate. I was amazed! This is so easy to use and such a great idea! I love that I don't have to come in contact with the solid waste. There are no smells and no dust. We still have to put a litter pad outside to catch the litter on his paws when he steps out, but otherwise no mess from it. We use the crystal litter with it, so I only have to change out the litter once a month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Enough for me","review":"It does what it says. Roll it over, roll it back. Poo goes into the tray.Two tips:1) Do not let it go too long. When the tray overflows and you try to remove it, poo gets squished all over everything.2) Do not use subpar clumping litter. I've got poo stuck to the bottom of the box nowFreebie:3) You household dog may eat the poo that is stuck to the bottom of the box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"This is a good catbox that eliminates 99% of manual scooping. Once in a while (every week) I still do manual scooping to catch the finer debris that the screen doesn't get. But overall I am really satisfied. I have 2 cats that have no problem using it and it is really easy to clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was very excited about this litter box based on the glowing reviews. Unfortunately, all the negative comments about this litter box are correct. Even with rolling slowly and tapping the side, all of the clumps would not make it over. There were clumps that got stuck behind and on the sides of the pullout shelf causing bad odors over time. Clean litter also went into the shelf causing a big mess when emptying it. The latches on the litter box are cheap and non sturdy. It defeats the whole purpose if I have to spend 5 minutes banging on the sides or scooping out the extra clumps that did not roll over. After about 3 weeks (I wanted it to work so badly) I gave up, removed the sifter and just use it as a regular litter box. The product was a great idea, just not executed well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Many Problems. Not Worth the Hassle.","review":"Clumps stick to the bottom, so you have to poke at it to loosen it, then roll it again. Litter leaks out the seams onto the floor. Loose stool plugs the grates. Takes a lot of floor space to roll and unroll. Heavy and awkward to roll around for the kids who were supposed to be the ones responsible for this duty. I'm going to trash this one and try a different kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate this.","review":"I really hated this product. It is huge, and I would not describe it as \\"self cleaning.\\" You have to roll it way over on one side to \\"clean\\" it, and because it is so large, that means you need a lot of space to do that. The lid did not properly snap down either, so the rolling . . . well you can imagine. I sent it back. Ick."},{"rating":"2","title":"I just love the Omega Paw","review":"I am the kind of cat owner that just hates to clean the litter boxes. I had purchased the Omega Paw rolling litter box ages ago but never set it up until I moved into my new house. I can't believe I waited so long. It has taken the drudge out of cleaning the litter box and believe it or not, it is almost fun. I realize there are some flaws with the plastic closures but I have remedied that by drilling holes on 3 sides and securing the top and bottom by using zip ties. They are easy to remove and replace when the need arises. By making sure the grooves are completely cleaned out before securing the top and bottom, any leaking of litter is greatly minimized. I too have used every litter box from automated to manual and none even come close to the cleanliness and ease of this litter box. I love it so much that I will be ordering one for my son and his 2 cats.One happy cat owner,Carla"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not automatic","review":"This is a case of misleading advertising. This is not a self-cleaning litter box. You actually have to roll the entire litter box which rolls the litter through a screen and into a drawer. Then you roll the litter box back upright and remove the drawer. I would rather take a litter shovel and do it by hand. I sent it back and got the electric rake litter box which is self-cleaning. Sorry my name is not Self-Cleaning and I am not the Self-Cleaner part the the product advertises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate Product Name Is Misleading","review":"This product, such as it is, may function adequately as an EASY-TO-CLEAN litter box. However, IT IS NOT SELF-CLEANING. A true self-cleaning litter box is one that does just what the name says: CLEANS ITSELF. While all litter boxes needs regular disinfection, there are litter boxes on the market that do the sifting for you -- without any action required on the part of a human. This one does not. There's even (at least) one that washes and disinfects itself. This unit does none of the above by itself. I have no opinion on the merits of the litter box itself. But I do object to the misleading name.

My experience was that the box was heavy and unwieldy to tip, that much clumping litter (top quality) still clung to the sides because my cat pees towards the walls, and that I had to use a scraper to clean the sides of the box anyway. Because the box design is restrictive, the scraping process and the tipping process resulted in more physical work and hassle than I'd faced when cleaning my old covered cat box. I ended up putting it in the trash two weeks later and I bought another conventional covered box from my pet store. My cat is medium sized and doesn't excrete abnormal amounts of urine and feces. I can't imagine what kind of cats the writers of the positive reviews might have..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disappointment","review":"I had hoped that the novelty of the clever design would make an onorous chore a little less \\"gross\\", but in all the time I tried it I was, variously, disappointed, annoyed and disgusted. The shell is of a plastic that isn't nearly strong enough for it's task, the little clasp/slides that attach the shells together are flimsy at best, and litter leaked everywhere even when I managed to get the clasp/slides firmly closed. I stopped rocking it after the third collapse and just used it as a regular hooded box.I also saw a cat expert say that cats find it to be a big \\"wrong\\" if they go into a space that has the scent of urine everywhere (especially above their heads). In the simple action of rolling it the previous scent spreads out all over it. So no, I do NOT recommend this to anyone. Maybe others managed to make it work, but mine went out to the curb after too many failures. And no, you can't return it if it's been used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst litter box EVER!!!","review":"Having my cat for several years and moving around constantly, I have been through many litter boxes and this by far is the absolute worst!

The latches on the side do not move easily to lock/unlock the top, the litter gets stuck in the grate and I have to spend a great deal of time cleaning it each day, as well as cleaning up the litter my cat easily pushes out of the box.

It falls apart very easily. If a latch comes unfastened while you are rolling it (which happens often) the litter comes out of the sides and leaves a mess.It is hard on my back and neck as well. I'm a healthy, young woman but the rolling, moving, and rolling back motion leaves my back and neck sore.I haven't had to wash it yet, but i can't fathom the nightmare that would be.Its more trouble then simply scooping out the litter.

I took a gamble and purchased Omega Paw, largely because of the good reviews and the price. I love it! I have two cats and one is always thirsty and leaves quite the mess in the litter box. The large size accommodates them both and I only have to change it twice a week. I gave it four stars because of two reasons:1. You probably need about a foot or so of space on each side of the box for the tilting, but other than that there's minimal maintenance; and2. The hooks to attach the lid can be somewhat cumbersome to attach.That said, I'd purchase it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, it's great!","review":"I just tried this for the first time and it worked great! There was very little learning curve, I did have to roll it twice because I didn't go quite far enough the first time, but it really did do just what it was advertised to do. I didn't have to do any manual scooping, yay! My cat took to the box right away, I haven't found any surprises around the house like she'll usually leave me if she's not a fan.

Why didn't I get this sooner!","review":"So I have tried lots of different litter boxes- I do love my Littermaid but lately they don't seem to be made the way they used to be and I am having to replace them onces a year..

I have three cats and keeping my litter box clean and free of smell is very important to me- Once a day I just roll it forward, and back all the way and roll back ( ya you have seen the video how it works ) I easily pull the drawer out and dump- Easy as can be! I tried this with crystal litter and still messy, so use whats suggested the clumping litter... I am so happy with this litter box-I have the green and brown version and it looks cool as well, not a eye sore like others- This is so reasonably priced- Super happy and let every cat owner I know how great this is! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than a motorized box!!!","review":"I've had the motorized auto-cleaning cat boxes before and this beats it by a long shot. I was surprised to see how this box works. Essentially you roll the box onto it's top and then roll it back down. All the 'goodies' find their way into the integrated scoop and bam, you're done! Simple design that works great, nothing to break or get jammed up. I bought one for my neighbors and my parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient, just needs simple modifications","review":"I bought this litter box after comparing many other self-scooping boxes. For the money, this one seems to be the best option. The design is simple, easy to use, and extremely functional and ergonomic. My only gripes are that sometimes \\"waste\\" will get stuck in the rounded edges, and can be very difficult to clean, but after lining the inside with waxed paper this was no longer an issue. My second gripe is that I wish there was something that could assist in rolling the box, since when filled with litter it can be quite heavy and difficult for my girlfriend to roll (she's tiny, about 90 lbs). Other than those two issues, which can easily be resolved with a few modifications (wax paper, buff up) we love this box. My cat likes to dig, whether it be his food or his litter, and a box like this will avoid any unnecessary messes that come from cats that love to dig.

I purchased the large one for $34.99 and it is a struggle to push the tabs that latch the top of it to the bottom. Even if I manage to do that the litter will seep out when I roll it onto it's top to clean it. As I said, it is a great concept and maybe if they work on the design it will make the process easier. Also, there is very little instruction that comes with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made - waste of money","review":"I agree with the other 1-star reviews. This box is so cheaply made that it defeats the purpose of what could have been a great idea. It's very difficult to align the flimsy plastic tabs so that they slide smoothly enough to lock the top of the box to the bottom. When you tilt the box to sift the litter - it spills out in the places where the flimsy tabs don't lock. It ends up being far messier to get rid of the waste than a regular sift and scoop box. And, as others mentioned, the opening is very small, so I'm getting a lot of spillage near the opening where the cats have a hard time entering/exiting. I also agree that it takes up a lot of space. And to call itself \\"self cleaning\\" is almost comical.This hunk of junk is, unfortunately, headed for the landfill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting design","review":"I bought this due to the ratings I had read here.

Roll it over tap bottom to dislodge stuck on clumps and roll it back over to normal position and empty the tray. Ten seconds and your done without the mess and the dust from normal cleaning process. Enclosed box also helps to keep litter from being thrown out. I have had no problems with the slide locks that hold the two halfs together but I do not open the box to add more litter just toss it in through the entry door. I also add a little deodorizer in the door before rolling as it will mix with the litter during cleaning.

You just have to make sure you use a good clumping litter, but it seems to be much easier for all concerned."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good value for the price","review":"I bought this to see if it would be more economical than the electric one I have. It is fairly easy to put together and does as it describes. You just roll it and then take the collection tray out and dispose of the waste. It is a bit cheaply made, all plastic, and can be a little difficult to close if the latches are not just right.

My major issue with this litter box is the way the top attaches to the bottom. The sliding retaining slides are way too flimsy and I broke one soon after purchasing the unit. Now I have to be careful when emptying the slide out tray so as not to spill litter all over the carpet because the top is no longer firmly attached to the bottom. Also it makes no sense that the entire right side of the box has no latches at all! Very poor design. This could be easily remedied by extending the lip on the right side of the unit and attaching two locking slides.

There are a few grains that get trapped between the tray and the top of the filter box, but that's definitely a non-issue for me. You should open the box and inspect perhaps once a week if you're squeamish, if not then once every time you change the litter will do. Furthermore, I strongly recommend filling the box with 3\\"-4\\" of cat litter in order to avoid the urine clumps from sticking to the bottom. Aside from being self-cleaning, the dome shape and the small opening prevents the cat litter from being tossed out by our fastidious little furry friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Story","review":"Upon receiving the litter box(the packing box is huge!), my wife declared that I was ripped off!.

Very easy to use, I haven't had any problems with it functioning correctly. With 4 cats using it sometimes the clumps stick to the bottom so I just pound lightly on the bottom and they come free. My first one worked out so good that I ordered a second one a few weeks later and one for my mom. I also showed it to my friend and she got hers last week and absolutely loves it. Definitely a product I would stand behind and recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"This product had the best reviews but the performance was not at all verygood. I found it very awkward to roll the litter box. You still have tobend down and tip the litter box all the way over to get the clumpsinto the pull out tray. And that's the clumps that aren't stuck in thelitter filter piece, which gets easily clogged and is not reallysomething I want to deal with cleaning. Besides not all clumps goinginto the tray, lots of unused litter ended up in the tray as well.Also, I bought the 'regular' size one and the filter piece goes almostright in the middle of the space so the usable cat space was verysmall. Needless to say I returned the litter box and was so glad tohave the old fashioned scoop litter box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, poor construction","review":"I love the way this litter box works, but the plastic tabs which connect the top to the bottom broke within the first week. I've had quite a few of these boxes over the years, and they have all lasted a long time. However, I'm afraid the manufacturing process of these has been changed and the quality has deteriorated. The two I've purchased most recently apparently have more flimsy tabs and both boxes have had the same failure. I will not be purchasing these boxes again, though the cleaning system is great. Such a disappointment as I was once a loyal customer of this brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, lousy execution","review":"After 7 years of using a Budda Dome, I had one of these for a year: the ability to roll clumped litter and cat droppings is awesome. And if your cat is a couch potato or it's on rohypnol 24/7 then this might be the single greatest advance in litterbox technology of the century. Sadly, may cat is an energetic and enthusiastic litter scratcher, and the design of this thing forces her to spray litter out its opening every time she uses it. So you end up constantly vacuuming near the entrance and the vicinity of the litter box (or in my case, the entire house because litter literally goes *everywhere*). In an attempt to remedy this, I put down two floor mats over the path to the litterbox. These then got encusted with fine gritty litter dust which led to my cat urinating on them and discoloring the bathroom tile underneath. I just bought a new Budda dome to replace this thing today.

It's so much cleaner than other setups I've had in the past (you never have to touch the litter at all!) and obviously much less expensive than the robotic kinds.That said, I've owned it for eight or nine months, turning it over to empty it every day, and it has now started to release litter from one of the seams when I empty it. I think that after so many months, the seam between the top and the bottom of the box have been stressed and open a little when I turn it upside down. Not a major issue at this point (it's a small sprinkle of the cat litter), but disappointing given how happy I'd been with it so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept, cheap everything else","review":"I have an adult male Maine Coon cat. He weighed in at 20 lbs last time we took him to the vet. Because he's so large, he obviously takes up the size of 2 maybe 3 cats at one time and consumes as much too. It's hard to find boxes (with lids) that have sizes like Large. It seemed like a great idea. My cat was really too big for the hole, but he managed. Then after one time of going in there, he refused to go back in until I cleaned it all out. I'm assuming the smell was too much. Then the plastic grate thing cracked, making it a normal litter box with annoying plastic pieces at the bottom you couldn't scoop around. Just a bad idea all around for a large cat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a self cleaning","review":"This litterbox is NOT a self cleaning (automatic) litterbox as advertised. Self cleaning means it cleans it itself. Not YOURself. You still have to roll the box over and hope it is all caught by the screen.

Worth every single penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cat pee everywhere!","review":"With all the surface area within the box, there is plenty of places for urine-soaked litter to be trapped, as well as urine to leak through the cracks. It smelled horrible of cat urine and we couldn't figure out why until pulling the top off of it. It would require a full cleaning of all of the surfaces of this box and its top to remain to be use-able, which completely defeats the purpose of it being an easy, \\"self-cleaning\\" contraption. Most reviews are likely from people who just bought this. I'm reviewing after a couple months of having it, and it was NOT a good purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!","review":"This product is so poorly designed, awkward and does not work like it says it would. The top is nearly impossible to secure. When you roll it the litter goes into the vented compartment and the waste sits in the bottom. It does not go into the scoop. This is the biggest waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry","review":"Sorry but my cat would have nothing to do with this litter box.

Far from the truth.. You have to roll it to clean it and that takes up a lot of space which wasn't very practical in my laundry room, I had to open the door and roll it part way in to the hall way. It doesn't hold very much litter and wasn't very suitable for multiple cats. It has to be cleaned EVERY day because it holds so little litter and it only sifts the litter for you in to a pull out drawer which often large clumps would not fit into it. In the long run what looked like a good idea turned out to be more trouble than it was worth. Mine ended up in the garage, if your in Phoenix I'll sell it to you cheap. If you have one cat and lots of space to roll it over and don't mind emptying the drawer and are dedicated to doing it every day 365 then this might work for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money","review":"You might as well buy a regular litterbox. This omega is actually messier than a regular litterbox. When you turn it, litter goes all over the floor. The box that collects the clumps gets full after 2 or 3 uses, depending on how much your cat goes. I have 4 cats and he box itself is too small for 3 of my cats to fit in. It has to be turned every single time your cat goes otherwise the clumps do not fit into the collection box. The grill gets sticky and gummy and has to be manually cleaned at least once a day. I used mine for about 5 days before I threw it in the dumpster out back. I didnt even offer to give it to anyone because it was worthless.

It's much smaller than their normal litter boxes so I assume they just prefer their old larger boxes. I at least tested the rolling waste removal feature and it's somewhat lame.

Additionally, a lot of cats (mine included) do not care for a lid as it makes the box retain more odor, so I had to leave the lid off.

The spaces in the grate are too large, more often then not pieces of my cats poop go through the grate instead of being caught by it. Also, despite the face that I got the \\"Large\\" box, the space inside for the cat to use is still quite small, as a result her poop often gets stuck to the side of it.

I'm already planning to get another for downstairs. I will never buy any other type of litter box again. I had been considering an automatic litter box, but now there's no need. This box is perfect. I have had no trouble with leaking litter, or with litter clumps sticking to the bottom. The key to prevent sticking, I believe, is to fill the box with enough litter and to clean it at least twice a day, if not more. And use a high-quality, low-dust litter which forms solid clumps.

First, the regular size is too small for any cat. A small or normal size cat does not have the room to bury his solid waste business. My cat didn't like the concept so he peed on my bed to let me know his disdain for the unit. Secondly, it's hard to see if there's any deposits and if you roll it without clumps and don't do it just right the litter tray fills with litter. I'm sure my rolling technique needs improving but the whole unit is going in the plastics recycle bin.

Some clamps don't reach the bin at all, even if are not stuck to anything. So you will have to clean the sand in a regular fashion anyway.For this price - it is an OK box.

The clumps all end up falling into the pull out tray. Then I tipped it back over and the clean litter came back out into the main area of the litter box. Pulled out the tray, dumped out the clumps and replaced it. Done! While it's not completely \\"self cleaning\\" like those that you plug in and everything gets raked up, the price is great and I don't have to scoop anymore which is wonderful!

With the Omega Paw box you simply roll it slowly onto it's top, smack the bottom to loosen any stuck on clumps and then roll it back onto its bottom. Then you pull out the tray containing the dirty litter and dispose of it. That's all there is to it, simple, quick and inexpensive.

It does not work for me. The Omega Paw Self Cleaning Litter Box is quite large and therefore requires a lot of room to roll it back and forth and also weighs more than I had anticipated (14 pounds jug of litter plus a few pounds of the box itself). My biggest problem though is that I have arthritis in my hands and getting the plastic top \\"locked\\" into place is very difficult and painful. It isn't an easy task for anyone to do. You need to remember that this action is not a one time thing;every time you change the litter you need to take it apart and then reassemble.

Firstly, it needs to be cleaned every 2-3 days due to a very small area for the cat to do his business. I just measured it at 18 X 10 where as the whole unit is monstrous. Just to clean it requires lots of contortions. I have to remove whatever's on top and then rearrange a large area to roll in in. Even when I do it every few days it still clogs my tray. Most times the waste tray will open during this procedure and litter/poop gets spilled. At least with a normal litter box, I can just scoop something without all the gyrations.Overall...I'd say it's a nice concept but it's made very cheaply and doesn't work as well as I had hoped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works very well","review":"Despite my best efforts to tighen the lid it still likes to leak a little litter on the floor.

If you're looking for ease in cleaning your cat litter box- resign yourself to the fact it needs to be cleaned daily and check out alternative litters like those made from wheat or corn!

I admit, for the first week it worked like a dream.Since then, it has been a nightmare. Everytime I flip it to clean the litter, litter leaks from the seams and makes large piles on my floor that have to be vacuumed up. This is in addition to the large amount of litter my cat kicks out of the opening. Worst of all, the scoop, which is supposed to fill with refuse only, is now filling with little and not collecting the refuse. I have opened it to try and fix it multiple times, resulting in more mess. The clips that hold the cover on are not sturdy and are difficult to move back and forth, adding to my irritating.For a product that is supposed to save me time and mess, it's doing the opposite.

When I dumped the litter there were dozens and dozens of little pieces still in the box.It was ok to turn over and turn back but it 1) requires space and 2) releases lots and lots of litter dust.Not a fan. We switched to Breeze with Feline Pine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed, gone back to scooping.","review":"I bought several of these litter boxes after reading the reviews. If they were well made, they would work well, but they are not. Litter gets in between the pieces making the edges not line up, and litter leaks out when the box is tilted. Also, the grate that separates the clumps from the litter comes unsnapped (and eventually breaks) making it useless. I clean these boxes the old way now- remove the lids and scoop. Great design idea, but they are just too flimsy and cheaply made to work as intended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dusty when tipped. Cat can't tip it over. Minimizes mess.","review":"When you go to tip it over, all the dust from the cat litter comes out of the opening and makes the air in the room all dusty. It would be better to manually scoop it because of that.I like that my cat cannot tip it over. It also keeps the mess in for the most part because of the enclosure. It a pain to take the top off though to clean the litter box. Also, when you tip it over it the filter gets blocked sometimes and a lot of clean litter gets thrown away. Some of the small pieces of cat poop get through the filter and don't get thrown away. Once again, you are better off just scooping manually. I just use it for my cat because it's enclosed which minimizes the mess. Also, it was only worth the money since I found it on sale at petco for $20."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cats love it too","review":"Best litter box ever. Fun for the cats, easy to switch them. So easy to dump and don't have to scoop. I would highly recommend this for any cat owner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Idea","review":"This is a great idea product. There is nothing else like this on the market anywhere. It is easy to use and IT WORKS!!Like everything, it could be improved. The tabs that hold the top and bottom together are rather weak or flimsy. I also added duct tape around the right edge of the top and bottom to avoid having litter migrate out of the box during the tipping over phase. Somehow the top and bottom locking together is not as good as it needs to be to avoid having small amounts of litter come through and end up on the floor. Otherwise, bravo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks litter. Doesn't work.","review":"I bought this locally and I'm planning on taking it back after a single use.The latches will not stay locked.Litter leaks out of the unit and gets all over the floor.The sliding drawer that catches clumps catches as much clean litter as it does waste.Getting fresh litter back into the open side of the box requires significant effort.I am not sure how this item has worked out for as many people as the reviews here indicate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great solution!","review":"I love this litter box. Before I had 2 boxes for 2 cats and scooped everyday. My back hurt, the area was messy, the scooper was messy, I wasted so much litter, need I go on??

So happy I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!","review":"I have 2 cats and I'm horribly lazy about the pain in the butt of cleaning the litter box. This makes it a synch! You just roll it over, roll it back, pop out the drawer and voila! You're done! No lugging heavy bags of litter around and you save money by using less litter! My cats took to it immediately. I haven't switched to a clumping litter yet, I'm still using the cheap wal-mart brand and it work well with it aside from most of the urine doesn't clump up enough so I'll probably switch litters in my next shopping trip.

The other two cats I could toilet-train, but I can't go litterbox free.As long as these are rolled daily, they are a breeze to clean.

But, when I watched the cheesy demo by the Paw self-cleaning litter box's inventor ([...]) I was intrigued. For the 30-some-odd dollars, I couldn't have asked for a better product! It took about 3 minutes to assemble and worked like (insert expletive) magic. My cat started using it right away and she loves it as much as I do (she had never used a covered box before, but took to the Omega with no problem). If I had to find a single criticism it is that smaller poopy bits tend to make it through the slats, and so don't always find their way to the disposal tray, but I guess that's why you're supposed to change all the litter each month. Other than that, no complaints. This product is everything it promises, with way less hassle and for much less coin than the slew of litter robots on the market. Simply brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Item","review":"I have two cats, plenty of room in large version. It is important not to over fill the pan or doesn't work properly.

But it is a huge improvement over the scoop... cleaner, faster, use less litter!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"This is great! No more scooping! I got the regular size for my 6lb kitten and my roommates 10lb kitten and it seems to work just fine.

So, I'm still waiting for someone to invent the perfect or at least, better litter box...this isn't it. Save your money and just buy an enclosed box (which we didn't have, so this is better in that sense)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Litter boxes-Omega","review":"I've had this type litter box for many years. This one here is disappointing because the plastic clips that hold the box together are not good. I already have 1 that broke. I'm always very carefull when putting the box back together after cleaning it and don't understand why it broke so easy. I glued it with crazy glue but of course it didn't hold. So I'm very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was expecting to love this litter box because it was recommended to me at a veterinarian's office. However, one of the sliding latches does not close and litter drips out when I turn the box over causing extra work vacumning up the littler. It is heavy and ackward for me to roll over. The best part is that the waste DOES fall into the internal box and it is easy to remove and throw away. That was what I was hoping for and got. Since I purchased it on line and threw away the shipping box, I have no idea how to deal with the manufacturer about a defective product. If it closed property, I would deal with the ackwardness of rolling it over. It would be very difficult to find a large box and ship it backc to the factory. Cost around $32. Any suggestions?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap construction and terrible customer service.","review":"I bought this box because of the price and the fact that so many people claimed that it was a good product. Before I purchased mine at petsmart, I inspected it for all of the clips, it was in perfect condition. As I left the store, an employee stopped me to say that it was the \\"best litterbox ever\\". I disagree. After two weeks, one of the clips broke, rendering it useless. I emailed the company, provided them my address and never received the clips that they promised. Two months later, I emailed about the clips, this time around they completely ignored my email. I emailed them again today but after five months of asking for the same thing, I'm over it.This box sucks. The company sucks even more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best litter box I've ever owned","review":"I was so close to buying another automated litter box when I came across someone touting the Omega Paw as \\"The worlds best litter box\\".I have used the box now for 3 weeks and I have to say that I whole heartedly agree that this is quite possibly the worlds best litter box.It takes 30 seconds to roll the box sideways, empty the tray, and voila! it's clean. The cats love it. There are no motors or anything that can malfunction like my old Littermaid. I can honestly say it's a pleasure to clean the litter box.Only reason I didn't give this a perfect 5/5 is that when you roll the box sideways,you sometimes get a little litter seep out of the box seams, which requires vacuuming. This is only a minor thing though. It's hard to believe that this box is so inexpensive. I would have gladly paid triple for this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works pretty good.","review":"I like this cat box. My house doesn't stink all the time anymore thanks to the enclosed box. It is so easy to clean that it gets attention more often too. The only down side is I need to get a scoop for the really small pieces of clumps. The really small clumps do fall through the vent/grate and end up still in the box. It's not really that big a deal so I am still happy with my purchase. If the vent/grate were more like a screen it may catch more of the small clumps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good But Not Perfect","review":"Works as described, removing most clumped material by simply rolling it over and removing the collection tray, but not the sturdiest construction.

But looks decent and saves a lot of time changing litter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Works with amazing ease. Cats love it. Easy daily cleaning.

The part of the box that is actually available for a cat is much smaller than what appears in the photos (even for the large box). There just isn't enough space for my cats to comfortably turn around and dig inside the litterbox.The top of the box has to be latched into the bottom part for the \\"self-cleaning\\" steps. This means that cleaning the litter box is not simple. Perhaps, if your litter clumps never sticks to the sides it might work.Anyway, I have ended up using only the bottom of the Omega box as a regular open litter box.

It works great. We have not noticed any litter box smells since we switched to this box.My husband was worried about litter seeping or escaping during the rolling process, but we have not had a problem with this.The only thing we've noticed is that the much larger urine clumps after a few days are too large to pull through the drawer - but that is more our fault for waiting too long.I love this litter box and would highly recommend it to anyone tired of regular litter boxes and scooping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and Easy. Cats Like it, too.","review":"Works well. One cat used to like to poop on (or sometimes over) the side of the old litter box, but not with this one, because it's enclosed.But this does take some real estate to roll it over.

Too little, and the floor gets all wet.The whole family likes it, including the cats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!

I admit, I was sometimes a little lazy with scooping the box, but this box is so easy to \\"scoop\\" that I don't mind and am able to keep up with it everyday.My only complaint is the locks to hold the lid and the bottom together are a little hard to slide into place, and they still allow some litter to seep through when you turn them over. But we keep our boxes in the basement so it isn't a big deal.Definitely get the large size if you don't have tiny cats...my cats are about 11 pounds and 14 pounds and they definitely appreciate the extra room to get in and out. They recommend one box for each cat plus an extra, but we don't really have room for another one of these and getting a traditional \\"scoop\\" box would defeat the purpose of the convenience of these.

I have found you really have to tilt the thing everyday (i have 2 cats) otherwise the build up is too gross and hard to get out in one nice pull of the drawer. It is easy and it was waaaay cheaper than an actually self cleaning box so I do like it a lot. The bottom is starting to get stuck on litter which I will have to hose out eventually but for the most part I am happy with this product. My cats went straight for it and loved it and now make a much smaller mess to sweep up later. Just remember you get what you pay for. This is a big cheap plastic contraption but remember that a little improvement in the ease of litter clean up is better than nothing.

The litter stuck to the bottom too much so I ended up having to take it apart and scrape off the bottom and remove the smaller chunks that fit through the screen every few days. The worst part was the litter that clumped to the screen. It had to be scraped and rinsed off which was a less than pleasant experience. After a couple weeks I was going to wash it out because it started to smell to much like cat pee but I just decided to throw it away instead, it was less work just to scoop the poop by hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great design, average construction.","review":"Like everyone who has a cat, I wanted a simple and clean alternative to the standard cat litter pan. I looked around, read the reviews, and decided to buy. I do not regret it one bit! This is a fantastic little device that's SOOOO convenient I'm shocked. At first we were using Arm & Hammer litter, but it created a lot of dust when we rolled it over to collect waste, and have since switched to \\"Feline Pine,\\" which works way better.The downsides:1: Not enough \\"floor space\\" (the grate system takes up half of the width of this thing).2: The clips are pretty flimsy (though I haven't had any issues with them yet).All in all though, a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Took getting used to","review":"But now I really like it a lot. I used a standard clumping litter in 2 of our 3 boxes at home. At first I was having an issue with large urine clumps being stuck to the side so they wouldn't dump into the little tray. Took me a few days to figure out rolling it completely over and tapping it on the bottom in a few places would knock it loose and solve the problem. I usually have to roll it more than once to get it completely empty, but it still beats the heck out of the scooping.In the 3rd I have the silica litter. That is really where this box shines. A quick roll over and back, dump the poo from the drawer and off you go! Unfortunately 2 stubborn cats cling to the clumping kind, so I will be tapping the bottom of the other 2 for sometime to come. But if your cat will switch to the silica kind, do it and get this box!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This box rocks!","review":"I set up the cat box two days ago. We have a Maine Coon (long-haired) big kitty. As soon as I put the clumping litter in, Zeus dove in and started exploring. I was worried at first because it seemed like there wasn't going to be that much room for him but he loved it. He immediately \\"christened\\" the box and has been using it faithfully ever since.Emptying it was a breeze and it saves so much litter - I am definitely impressed! It is so clean and I don't even have to worry about wearing gloves or anything!There hasn't been any smell whatsoever from the box! That is the main reason I wanted it and it has been so easy to empty.

I would not recomment this to anyone that is looking for a self cleaning box, I was using up an entire 20 pound bag of litter in less than 1 week, and still was not getting all the cat poop.

It literally takes me about 20 seconds to clean the box and I no longer have to see clumps or stains on the sides of the conventional box (my cat is, um, defective in many ways--a nice way to say that she's stupid).

I threw away three perfectly operational LitterMaid automatic cat boxes when I saw how well this worked, and then I ordered a second one of these.It works just like they say, and if you use FLUSHABLE litter, not only do you spare yourself the nastiness of having to bend over and chisel cat poop off the appliance/litter box (due to the great engineering of this catbox), you don't have to carry a ninety pound back of you know what out to the trash, making the trash collectors hate you when the bag breaks (because you carried the slide out drawer with huge handle to the toilet and flushed it).It now takes 30 seconds to clean my cat box, and is 98% less disgusting.

There are holder tabs, but the grate is not secure and that makes it not work properly.3) The top portion of the litter box does not \\"seal.\\" It's somewhat tight, but there is litter seeping from the seams everytime it's cleaned.

However, I haven't had such good luck with it in the month or so I've owned it so far.The problem is that once I've rolled it to the right to collect the clumps, a slight leftward roll/tap does not sufficiently send the clean litter back into the bin, but keeps it in the disposal tray. Perhaps it's because Feline Pine clumping litter is very lightweight relative to sand/silica/clay litter, but it's just not working at all. On top of that, any effort to gently tap the clean litter from the right side of the box ends up spilling litter out the front.I was really hoping this would be a life-changing product, but so far I'm disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product didn't hold up - poor customer service","review":"I am editing a previously glowing review on this item.

I contacted customer service, and they offered to replace the part, to which I agreed. I never got a reply. I contacted them again to follow up on it and, again, never got a reply. I finally contacted them a 3rd time, a little perturbed by this point and, once again, no reply. I wound up throwing it away when I moved because it was virtually useless (aside from incredibly messy) without a properly functioning grate.

Broken in less than 60 days, and I can't return it for a refund or exchange!!! Not right. The clicks are not strong enough.

I was really excited about this product, but after using it for 2 months I find that it's no good. My cat is not that big (11 lbs) yet the large box seemed too small for her. She would sometimes poop outside the box on the floor (disgusting!!) or have her body half outside of the box in order to cover her waste. Also, they should make the lid clear so you can see what's going on inside because there may be stains that get all over the sides if you flip the box when the cat has just gone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally found a cat box I can live with","review":"I have tried the automatic cleaning cat boxes. They seem like a waste of time to me, they either didnt clean properly or broke within months. This box is perfect for my needs. We have 4 cats and they all love it. We actually have one on each floor of the house, and they easy cleaning routine takes a couple of minutes tops. The only tiny problem I have with them is that if you overfill the litter you can dump a lot into the scoop with the waste. But its self correcting, since the excess littler gets pitched with the waste. People have complained about small amounts of litter making its way out of the box will tipping it. Yes it happens. I just taped the joint between top and bottom and now I only occasionally lose a little onto the floor through the scoop opening.Its cheap, so go ahead and try it, you wont be sorry and you will be back to order another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rolling Litter Box","review":"I really like the Omega Paw Litter Box. It's pretty easy to use and the best part is you don't have to scoop. I've bought 5 over the course of 8 years. The reason being - the plastic absorbs the odor and over time it becomes stinky (and also to upgrade to the larger sizes.) My last one I replaced after about 2 years. So that's not too bad. These litter boxes aren't too expensive so it's worth the replacement in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good in theory but not worth the mess!","review":"When I first received this cat box, I loved it for about 2 weeks.

Then the clips on the edges were sliding back, causing litter to leak on the floor when the unit was rolled over. In a few days those problems disappeared somehow. Maybe the plastic needed to be worked. For the last week, this litter igloo works very well. The kitty poop winds up in the narrow draw that fits well into the plastic tube newspaper bags we use for disposal. Our young cat adapted to a covered litter box very well. We remain impressed with this simple, but elegant device."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great time saver and no more scouping","review":"Best non electroic litter box ever, the only reason i did not give it 5 stars is that the clips on the side are quite hard to open and close and also are not very solid, i have improvised by using clips at the front and back to save any spillage but would definately recommend this, no smells, no unsightly litter clumps, easy to use and very easy to empty the used litter, all my 6 kitties love this, it gives them privacy and I bought the bigger ones, i bought 2 and they are big enough for the kitty to get in and turn around. Would definately recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"I thought this would make life easier...to have a dipping of the container and collect the clumps, but too much loose litter comes, too...and it is more awkward than just shoveling the clumps out of the cheaper box models.I wouldn't recommend this product. Too extravagant for what it provides."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best litter box ever!","review":"This was the best investment for a litter box. It is roomy for my two cats and it takes me about 30 seconds to clean it!!! There is no dust (if you have a dusty litter, which I do) and you do not get as dirty. I can clean the litter much more often because it is SO QUICK! I'm sure my cats appreciate that. :) Watch the video that another person posted to show you how it works (that's what sold me). Beware though, it is molded plastic, if you put it together right, it will work, but if it is not sealing tightly, you may need a little duct tape to seal the one edge. Which is NO BIG DEAL because it will be hidden once you put the top on. I like it with the tape because I know it will never come apart. Overall, this is a 5 out of 5 stars because it is so quick and EASY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great litter box","review":"I was skeptical about the workings of this litter box, but it works great.

I clean it almost every morning and it's so easy.The droppings are easy to dump in a bag and throw in the garbage. My cat took to it right away.Best part, it's so easy to keep clean that there is no smell at all in the room where we keep it.I add to the sand in the box every few days but haven't had to dump it all out and start over yet.I love not having to pick up the box or sift through the litter or anything.Just roll to the front, roll back and then pull out the tray, dump the remains in a bag and put the tray back. Done!I purchased the larger size based on other comments. I believe that was a smart choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy to have it sent to Chile","review":"I Bought the standard one first for my three cats. It was great, but soon I realized that the cats resented the shrinking of the size of the litter box (previous one had more interior space), they started to throw the litter out. Also, I had to clean it several times a day (VERY picky cats).I got the bigger one and problem solved. Period. I'm sending the standard size one to my mom, she has 2 cats, and I think the box will be enough for them. As for 3 cats, it's asking too much for the standard one.I Had them sent to Chile. Veeeery expensive management of the box, the delivery, customs, etc, but entirely worthy. I don't have to scoop anymore, I hated that. Easy to clean, no need to touch anything but the container... great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted a month before one of the tabs broke","review":"The design is great and it makes emptying the litter box a slightly easier chore. Unfortunately, one of the sliding tabs that holds the lid onto the base broke already. This makes it unusable because the litter leaks out when the box is rolled. I should be able to fix the tab but I'm disappointed that one of them broke already. If they had used a more durable material for the tabs, I'm sure this wouldn't have happened.

First of all, the latches on the sides that are supposed to hold the top on either didn't close all the way or completely came undone. Especially when I tilted the box per the instructions. Is a matter of fact, every time I did tilt the box to get the cat waste into the drawer, cat litter would leak out all over the place. Not only that, the dispenser drawer itself got filled with more litter than the waste which was left behind in the cat box. It wasn't supposed to work that way but it did.

However, after a few days I realized the negative things that concerned me.

So it's back to the litter box for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste. Of. Money.","review":"Seriously. I was woo'd by the idea of a less cumbersome litter box. The honest truth of the matter is that this is just a DIFFERENT solution to the same problem. I never found it to be that difficult to simply lift the lid off of the litter box. With this one, you need plenty of space to roll, tip, shake, roll back, tip again and then tip backwards to add more litter. No liner, means smelly...period...even on day one. If you have more than one cat...clumps can be big, this will defeat the purpose. Just get a normal litter box...you will be happier.On a side, Antik from Amazon's customer service was a star, so I do not have to feel jipped at the end of the day."},{"rating":"1","title":"great at first....","review":"I bought this litterbox in September of 2010 and began using it in October.At first it was amazing, no leaks, no issues, easy cleaning - AMAZING!BUT (and this is a huge one) less than one month after purchasaing it, one of he plastic snaps broke and thus we could no longer tip it to clean it (which is the whole point of the box).I was debating purchasing another one thinking maybe the one I got was faulty, but after seeing all the reviews about the snaps breaking, I won't waste my money (and neither should you).we have since removed the filter and used it as a \\"regular\\" litterbox.off to find something new now!do not bother buying this!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Happy","review":"We have two cats, one is 12, the other is less than a year and both can use without problems.

I believe these people were from the stores that are selling these boxes on their sites.Steer away from this litter box. I just lost $34 plus $20 you need to fill it for it's size.

The time it takes to turn the box on its side to shift the loose litter into the holding tray at the bottom in order for the larger clumps to fall into the pull out tray is time consuming and too much effort. It was much easier scooping it out in a regular litter box tray without the hassle. Also, the side clamps are not secure enough to keep litter from oozing out the sides onto the floor for additional clean up.

After scooping for 2 weeks I looked into other options and after reading the reviews, ordered the Omega. What a simple concept - and it's brilliant! So easy to do. Yes it's plastic and kinda cheap feeling, and you can tell the company is making bank on it, but it WORKS amazingly well. No more scooping, sifting, smelling stinky stink. It's a little heavy to turn over, but nothing spills out or anything, and it totally works like it says it will. At first I ordered the RA15 but i thought it was too small for 2 cats, so i bumped up to this one. Do yourself the best favor and order this litter box.

I personally use Healthy Pet Dust Free Fiber Cat Litter - it's natural, doesn't stink like World's Best Cat Litter like a previous reviewer said, and is flushable. Some cats don't like it at first, but if you sprinkle it with a little bit of Dr. Elsey's \\"Cat Attract\\" litter, it won't be a problem at all - the Cat Attract litter will also get your cat to use this box, as sometimes it can be a little intimidating at first.It's so simple to clean and easy to use once I got used to it (make sure that you give it a vigorous shaking motion back and forth when you're turning it over). Make sure you have at least 3 inches of litter in there, but 4 to 5 won't go amiss if you have industrial diggers. Anything over 5 is too much, although that may depend on the version of the box that you get.Overall, I am very, very happy with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like this kitty litter box","review":"I thought this was going to be a great litter box, however, I found out that it is not.

The box is very flimsy so it flexes when you roll it. The latches are a total joke. After a weeks use of rolling, leaking, banging on the bottom a latch came loose and spilled the litter all over. My cat decided to go in only one place so after about two uses there was a football size litter ball stuck to the bottom, welded to the grate or firmly molded in one corner. If the ball did come loose the drawer couldn't be opened with the ball in it.

Little chunks will get stuck. You'll have to sift through the chunks it leaves behind. You'll have to take it apart and sanitize it a couple times a month just so it doesn't get icky.

I had rolled it until it was laying on its top, and then rolled it back. It only picked up the poop, and not all of it. Clumps of urine were still in the box. I had to vacuum the floor afterwards. It ended up causing me more trouble than anything!

I didn't really have a good place to roll the box, and, as a result, usually managed to scatter litter on the floor during the roll. I used it for 3 weeks before I gave it away.Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box, Large, Green and Beige"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was hopeful that I would love this box, but I don't. You cannot use it with regular litter unless you want a dust storm in your face. I tried it with fresh step. You can't use it if your litter box is tucked in a corner because you need lots of room to roll it. If you need to pull it in order to roll it on it's top, it is very hard to keep the sliding locks from coming loose. There is more than a \\"little\\" bit of litter that escapes from the seams, requiring a clean-up each time it is rolled. I was using 2 conventional litter boxes and didn't get as much litter tracked as I did with just one roll. I gave it 2 stars because it is a neat idea, just not for me.A tip for first time users: Don't put too much litter in the bottom or you will have a tray of litter in addition to the waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have had my eye on this litter box for months. After reading so many positive reviews I finally decided to go for it. My cat seems to like it but she isn't really finicky about litter boxes. I don't like it nearly as much as she does, probably because her favorite place to pee is on the little shelf thing on the inside, above the grate. I discovered this when I rolled it to the side and a significant amount of urine dribbled out down the side of the box and onto the floor. I can't get her to stop peeing there so now I have an oddly shaped covered litter box without the extra functionality I paid for. I didn't really like the system to begin with either, but I didn't have a lot of time to perfect my rolling technique before my cat discovered her new favorite pee spot. As excited as I was about this product, I can't really recommend it. I'm glad it works so well for so many other people, but for me it was a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"LEAKS LITTER!!!","review":"For the life of me, I can't seem to clean this litter box without having litter spill everywhere on the floor! It is awful! I am going back to the old scoop the poop method! Save you money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinky box","review":"This box does NOT CONTROL ODORS. Right after completely cleaning the box, it would smell again the minute a cat used it once. I have had cats for almost twenty years now and am always in search of a better cat box, this isn't it. The opening is so low that if you put a little extra litter inside, the cats would send the litter flying out of it when they bury. If you put the right amount of litter in the box, the cats can't cover their poo properly and the box always stinks. Also, extra litter in the box always dumps into the cleaning tray when you clean the box. After weeks of my house smelling like a barn, or having piles of litter and poo thrown on my floor, I've given up on this one, it's in the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"My cats must love it because I now empty the litter box every day!

Anyway, I found this litter box very messy. Everytime I rotated it upside down to \\"filter\\" the litter, a handful of litter would always pour through the crack between the bottom part of the litter box and the top part and get all over the floor. I didn't mind this at first because I was just happy I didn't have to scoop the litter, but after a while I found this very annoying and inconvenient. It was enough of a spill that I had to bring the vacuum out to clean it up. If they did a better job of \\"sealing\\" the unit so it wouldn't spill, I would probably give this box a 4-star rating instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rolling Cleaning Litter Box","review":"When I finally got the time to set it up I did. My cat looked at first like she hated it, but now she uses it all the time. I was sick of getting litter everywhere and taking so much time to clean the litter box. Believe it or not a couple weeks later we had to drive to Texas with a car packed so tight its good we weren't claustrophobic. The cat and the dog were both along for the ride. I had this new litter box bungee corded to the seat so that she could use it. I couldn't believe it when I heard her using it, in a driving car! Now that we\`re in Texas she cannot go outside. She uses her litter box like a good kitty, and when it needs changed I just roll it over. What a great buy, saved money buying this instead of automatic.

I do wish that the spacing in the screen was a bit smaller and that the cats weren't able to push the scoop out. I don't think either are annoying enough to prevent me from purchasing another in the future.UPDATE 02/08/13I have replaced this box with two other boxes due to an issue with my cats kicking litter out of the entry opening. I left the rating because not everyone has cats that do this.

When the unit is rolled (to capture waste), the slide out trap, while collecting most (But not all), the soiled litter, also collects a good portion of unsoiled litter. Even after following the mfgs. directions exactly, I still find that I have to use a regular scoop to completely clean the box, It does control dust and odor, but all in all, this unit is pricey based on its performance. Better off with a (cheaper) covered litter-box and scoop in the regular fashion"},{"rating":"1","title":"I REALLY wanted to like this!!!","review":"After reading the reviews and weighing the pros and cons, I plunked down 35 bucks and bought this. Unfortunately what this doesn't take into consideration is, to put it politely, the viscosity of the poo you are dealing with. Our kittens ended up getting diarrhea and this thing was a nightmare. Also, without a liner, I just felt that I wasn't able to keep it clean. The smell was awful. I finally trashed it and went with a good old fashioned basic pan. At least I could feel confident that there wasn't poo trapped somewhere in the box. Sorry, this just isn't the kind of box for a neat freak!"},{"rating":"1","title":"In theory, works great, but poor quality","review":"I purchased this box a month ago and have found that when it stays together it works exactly as described - which would be a five star rating - however, as mentioned by another customer the tabs which hold the lid on and the sifting tray inside do not work properly. This means I roll it and the lid pops off; spilling litter everywhere...or the sifting tray slides around and more than just waste clumps end up in the pull-out drawer. To say this box has *increased* my time piddling around with the litter is an understatement. After purchase of this box I have spent more time sweeping up piles of used litter off the floor and around the box and reaching in and scooping what it improperly sifted. If this box were manufactured to stay together with ease then it would be fantastic. Unfortunately you risk getting a box that is poorly designed and could cause you to dump litter everywhere. I will be returning if possible and hope another box will be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised!","review":"This is a nice looking box and it works as advertised. We are now considering purchasing another one to replace our old one (we have three cats and need two litter boxes).

They love the priacy and we love the ease of cleaning the box each week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"Not the greatest experience. First off, I hate rolling the thing as excess litter just flies everywhere. Also you have to touch the box with your hands; not my cup of tea...and just like any box, it has to be cleaned several times per day. Rolling the thing doesn't work on urine; it just sticks to the bottom of the pan and you end up scraping it out anyway. A real mess maker; I ended up scooping it instead of rolling and eventually threw it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Box","review":"Great product, but a little difficult to roll over for cleaning. It isn't that the litter box is hard to move, it's just that you need a large area to 'roll' it in. Also, you have to buy the right kind of litter. At first I was told not to get the clumping litter, but I found out that the box smelled pretty bad right away. The clumping kind seems to work best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easier in some ways, harder in other ways than conventional box","review":"It's very cool to roll the box and just take out the pieces of clumping litter in the scooping tool. But after a while you realize that a lot of litter is stuck in the bottom of the box and you need to reach in and do a traditional scoop. However, it is very difficult to remove the lid with the flimsy plastic lid connectors that are almost impossible to use. So you try to reach in the hole to scoop out the litter, but that is very hard and very frustrating. The final straw was when the cats decided it was way easier to go poop just outside the box and scoop the litter out the hole to cover it. Big piles of poop and litter on the floor....made me decide to give up and get another \\"Clever Cat\\" litter box. Works great. No mess. But now I'm out $35 bucks. Hope I can find someone to give this to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased","review":"We have a 2-cat household (lots of poop), and we had a LitterMaid LM900 Mega Self-Cleaning Litter Box. I hated it -- huge mess, looked and smelled horrible, and the cats would get poop on every inch of it. So I decided to try the Omega Paw, and I am very glad we did. I'm very happy with it, because it does a good job containing and hiding the mess and smell, it is easy to use and clean, and basically it works as advertised. It does seep some cat litter out the side seams when you roll it to empty it, as others have noted, but its not a big deal because in my experience you have to sweep around a litter box regularly anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"This thing is perfect!","review":"I just cleaned this for the first time after buying it last week for my new kittens.

No more smell, no more digging for dried-up whatever. Cleaning litter is more like throwing in a load of wash than my usual kneeling, digging, bagging, sweeping. I also downsized from two litter boxes to one. That's even more time saved. Where are the bonbons?A couple of things though...This thing is big. I mean really big. And you do need floor space to roll it over. When I put it together, I needed pliers to make sure the plastic insert, when bent, fit into the lip of the bottom box. I suspect when it's not perfectly aligned the latches would be difficult to pull into the locked position or, if forced on an incomplete alignment, cause undue stress to the latches and/or have litter spill out.Now looking for clumpable AND flushable litter. Oh My. That would be the bomb."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works great! can use crystals too","review":"I was skeptical but once i got it i was sold. it works fantastically! low tech is sometimes the way to go. you can use crystal litter also, the action of shifting it to the right and the left through the screen acts as the raking needed for water waste, so all you are left to throw away is the solid waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Litter box cleaning made easy","review":"This is a really easy litter box to clean.

We also had to watch what we were doing while rolling. This is a huge hassle we already went back to our old litter box. In addition, we attempted to return the item the shipping was $35!!

My only issue is that when you do the first roll in the steps, litter somehow seeps through the crack that joins the top and bottom pieces, but I'm sure that can be easily fixed.

Several times they came loose and allowed the litter to seep through. When you roll it over, only the fecal matter and larger urine clumps go into the tray. Smaller clumps stay in the kitty litter.

Haven't had any litter leakage during the roll because since reading here that some people did, I always make sure the lid is fastened tight.

And I ordered it hoping the size was as the description makes you think. MISTAKE! I have a large (18lb.)cat. When it came out of the box, it looked like something for kittens. The entry hole is hardly usuable by larger cats. And when I saw the actual space for the litter/area for them to go, there's no way. More than half of the interior is the rolling and catcher. The spot for them to do thier business is around the size of a small or normal litter box. If it was designed with more room for the cats it would be great. But if you have a med/large+ size kitty, it's more efficient to go get a large plastic underbed storage box. At least that gives our bigger kitties a comfy and roomy place to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Changed my mind........(old review) Getting my second one...works great","review":"Loved this box at first (see following) but after awhile it began to fall apart.

My quest for the perfect litter box continues..(old review) This box requires the least amount of work of any box I have bought.

I can't see how that would be less work than scooping, even if my cat had wanted to use the thing. To be fair, he walked in it once to pee because for some reason he does that with his butt facing out, but he poos looking out and couldn't even turn around in there! This was supposed to be the larger one too!I'm putting it on craigslist for free, no one will even buy this piece of junk from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"I honestly don't know why this gets such great reviews. As stated by others, it leaks litter all over the floor when you roll it. Then, if you don't do it every day, the litter clumps can get too big and then get jammed in the pull-out tray (maybe that is a result of the cheap scoopable stuff I used?) Also, it doesn't hold very much litter and the sliding latches that hold the box closed are cheap and jam easy.Back to scooping for me until I can justify a robot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This item is lousy","review":"I bought this item near the end of 2007 thinking it would save on litter and be easier to maintain- wrong!

If your cat is large, don't get this.I was excited when I first bought it, untill I realized my cat was too big to comfortably go to the bathroom in it. Also the first time I went to roll the whole contraption over (that is how it cleans the litter) litter flew everywhere. I've had to take out all the special self cleaning parts on the inside just so my cat can fit, and it's more of a pain than any conventional scooping.If they included a door to keep the litter in and made it a bit bigger then I would consider buying again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great...if you wish to create a beach....","review":"If you wish to create a beach, this product works great. It is far easier to buy litter that clumps, remove the cover (which confined the space and works well if you have a very small cat) and scoop out the clumps yourself. This device is terrific at scattering litter through the rolling action over a wider surface that the cat does alone. Surfs up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea - but","review":"I bought this based on the high reviews - and the concept. It seems like this is what I needed. It was easy to put together. My kitties took a few days to get used to it - but did use it afer awhile so that was not the issue. It worked well the first few days - but basically stopped working after about a week. The poop and pee-balls didn't go into the tray and stayed in the main litter compartment. The little drawer-tray filled with clean litter intead. So I ended up removing the pieces and using it as a regular litter box. So . . . don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo for making this on the cheap! It used to be excellent.","review":"This is a fantastic idea. I bought one of these about 6 years ago, and it was the greatest litter box ever.Sadly, I bought a new one to replace it, and although the design is the same, the materials fail the design. I can only assume that the manufacturer cheapened their costs by using flimsy instead of rigid plastic. Unfortunately, cat litter and waste go all the place it's *not* supposed to now. It sneaks under the grill that used to catch it, and goes behind it where the clean litter should pass through, getting stuck unless you completely break down the box and reassemble. Then the rolling edge side gaps open and litter sifts down onto the floor.Unless they start making this out of rigid plastic again, instead of this flimsy flexy stuff, this product is currently a complete waste of time and money. Not to mention the frustration of the stink of hidden cat waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Great!!!","review":"I have multiple cats and regular litter boxes are such a mess to deal with-the constant cleaning, the odor, the scattered litter, etc. I decided to try the Omega and I love it!

Thanks Omega Paw for such a great product.2/23/10-My original Omega Paw is still working perfectly and such a dream to clean.

I bought a large box so that they would have more room as they grew. I loved the box at first, but then I began to see flies all over my room. I cleaned the box twice daily and could not figure out why there were flies constantly hovering in and over the litter box. When I removed the top, I noticed that fecal matter was stuck in the grates. I used premium clumping litter for long-haired cats that worked great before I bought the box, so the litter was not the problem. I grabbed a plastic knife and began to clean the grates and it happened again! Also, the box did not cover up the smell as much as I would have liked. I have replaced their litter box twice since the Omega Paw and have been dissatisfied with all the boxes I have purchased thus far. My quest continues!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the bomb","review":"With three cats in my arsenal of cats this box works best for me. I have tried all kinds of boxes even the expensive motor driven kind. This works best. just roll and empty. One of my cats likes to pee on the inside wall of the box which killed the Littermaid, and hampered cleaning with the various other boxes I've owned. This box deals with it better because it is a MANUAL operated box. The cats cannot physically pee on the grate that seperates the clumps from the clean litter. Just roll it over daily and empty the container. Nothing is perfect, but this comes close. A bargain compared to the Littermaid and other \\"high-tech\\" boxes in terms of cost and maintenance. Finally someone applied physics to a cat box. Give that person a raise!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lazy cat owner's dream","review":"We had an electric self-cleaning box before this one, but it shorted out after a couple weeks, and didn't work well to begin with. Then we ordered this box, and though it takes some getting used to, it's the best box we could hope for, at a reasonable price. Really easy to clean. Despite its high wall, the cats DO manage to kick some litter outside the box, but certainly a smaller amount than most litter boxes.I've found that crystal litter works very well to supplement this box for a lazy cat owner such as myself. It sifts through the box's grating as well as normal clumping litter, if not better, and you don't have to change it nearly as often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box","review":"I had one of these and the handle broke off the litter drawer.

This requires the all of the litter in the box (which is a whole standard jug of litter) to be changed out every week or two to avoid any bad smells."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably the worst product I have ever bought","review":"Don't do it. This kitty box is a great idea but extremely poorly executed. It spills litter all over the place when you rotate it (the clips don't hold the top on tight enough) and if you overfill it you end up with a scoop full of perfectly good litter that you have to dispose of. In addition, the box is small so cats generally will track more litter onto the floor than they would with smaller boxes. Even if you use a kitty rug, as suggested by some other readers, your bathroom will soon look like a disaster zone.Not worth the money or effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap build quality, doesn't work well","review":"I read many of the positive reviews on this site, but have to say, my experience was very different. The build quality of this litter box is not good; the pullout tray does not fit completely within the frame so when you roll the litter box, you'll often times get litter falling out through the crack. Additionally, the litter box does get quite dirty on the inside and needs to be opened and cleaned periodically which defeats the entire purpose in my mind since it is a bit of a pain to open with the various clips.If you do empty this EVERY DAY it may work ok (but honestly, if you empty a normal litter box every day it is less work than rolling this thing over, etc), but if you would prefer to only have to empty your litter box every few days, this is not the product for you.Colin"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a big fan.","review":"Bought this thinking that it would be easier for my daughter to complete her chore of cleaning the litter box daily, but we have found that the locks on the front and right side don't stay locked into place, and when we turn the box, litter spills out of the side every time. Additionally, the trap doesn't only catch waste, but also good, clean litter as well. The trap with the handle doesn't push all the way in and is a bit crooked, so the litter/wasted doesn't all make it into the trap and we have to repeat the cleaning process 2 or 3 times to get it all. I will likely try to exchange the box and see if mine was just defective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work as described.","review":"I was so excited about how easy this litter box would be to use/clean. I have two adult cats and have been using this litter box for about 2 weeks now - I'm so disappointed. The tilting action used to 'clean' the box works great with poop. It does not work with pee though. I don't think my cats are abnormal in their 'bathroom' habits. Whenever I go to do the tilt action (about twice a day) I notice that the pee spots stay stuck to the bottom or sides of the box. I end up cleaning it like a regular littler box every time."},{"rating":"1","title":"not an effective solution","review":"This is not an effective litter box. After reading the positive reviews, I thought I would give this product a try. However, The mechanism is flawed: if there is sufficient litter in the box, there is no way to just get the clumps into the scoop without getting a significant amount of litter inside the scoop as well. Just get a cheap box, and change the litter every day."},{"rating":"1","title":"It stinks","review":"Having no odor around the kitty litter box is a must for us, and this box fails miserably in this regard. We tip and dump the tray 3xday, but there are still a couple clumps left in the box, so you have to use a scoop anyway, and then after a week or so it begins to really smell because some clumps break up and end up in the small part of the litter box so you need to disassemble (and the clips are a pain) and at this point really it just seems easier and more hygienic to use the traditional style littler box with a scoop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy to Clean... If Only the Cat Would Use It!","review":"I love how easy to clean this litter box was. I say was because we used it for about 2 weeks and our cats constantly pooped/peed just outside of the opening even though their bodies were inside the box. This litter box is just too small and our cats are about 8 lbs apiece. Don't be fooled by the product dimensions. Close to half of the interior space is taken by the grate and scoop. It's really a fantastic idea but to get a usable litter space and also allow for the grate/scoop, this box would be enormous."},{"rating":"1","title":"cat litter box","review":"It does not work and is messy, leaks cat litter and does not get out all of the dirty litter, you have to go over with a scoop, not for multiple cats, poor design because the grate that sifts the litter does not get the smaller clumps, the box is very big and so you cannot have as many in the same spage. expensive for not working and now that I have tried it out, I cannot return it. If it works best with a certain kind of litter, then they should have recommended it. When you have as many cats as I do, you need good products, not one that waste your money. I would have paid more for a box that does what it is supposed to do - but to pay 2x what a regular box is and then have it be a waste, really is not very nice. I hope to discourage others from wasting their money.Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box, Pewter"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!!!","review":"Truly a great product and idea (and cheap)! I bought a large one for my two adorably chubby cats. The old litter box seemed to need to be cleaned every couple hours (big cats, big litter box deposits) but now I just roll the box in the morning before work and a couple times when I get home. It's super convenient. It also looks (inside and out) like a normal litter box so my cats had no problem getting used to the box. The only two things I don't love is that there is little storage in the tray so you may need to empty the tray after every cleaning but it's better than scooping. Buyers may benefit from buying a \\"litter locker\\" as well so you can take out the wastes weekly and you need to be careful that ALL the little tabs to close the box are shut or the litter spills out but if you make the mistake once you'll probably never do it again (I did, yuck!). Overall a great product, I did a lot of research to pick the best self cleaning litter box and I really think this is it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome litter box!","review":"I have two cats and had two litter boxes. I was tired of cleaning out each one with a scoop - especially when one cat decided to make it habit to urinate in the same spot and not cover it up, making it one, big, soggy mess. Got this new litterbox and loved it from the start. Sure, it seems a little bit lightweight, but that's good because you're literally picking the thing up and rolling it on the floor. I haven't had any issues with litter spillage from the sides and I put more litter in by simply tilting the entire box back slightly - no need to remove the top until I need to completely clean it. I've replaced both of those previous boxes with just this one and both cats love it, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not exactly \\"self-cleaning\\" but for $30 who's complaining","review":"This litterbox is a good buy for the price. Waaay cheaper than the automatic cleaners and much easier than traditional scooping. It works as described and my cat was very quick to jump in. My one issue is that about half the box it taken up by the cleaning grate so that my 3 month old kitten seems crowded inside, but he's using it and seems happy enough. It does take a couple of good smacks to get all the clumps to fall and if the clips let loose there will be a huge mess but overall a good design.One sidebar, I recently asked my brother to watch my cat for a weekend.

But it doesn't always get everything and it's difficult to get in there to scrape stuff off so it can make it into the drawer. A weekend away will result in a very full drawer, but also a few poops and scoopable litter lumps scattered in the litter. Plus, the latches on the outside of the box are hard to line up.

It wasn't quite the miracle machine that it set itself up to be, but it sure beat scooping every other day.Fast forward to 4 months later: despite carefully cleaning the product of the unavoidable stains that come hand in hand with cat waste (in hopes of maintaining the box's overall longevity), the internal plastic separator (the portion that helps you separate solid waste from the litter) eventually wore away the plastic holders inside the litter box itself, disabling the rolling functionality of the product.Fortunately, it doubles as a simple cat litter box if the interal parts break, so all is not lost. Just be warned that the lifespan on my product barely broke 4 months when servicing two kitties."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great litter box...worth the $","review":"We've had this litter box for about a year and we love it. It's nice and roomy inside for our large male cat & contains odor well. Cleaning is super easy once you get used to how far you have to roll the box. Removing and replacing the top portion is also easy, but just make sure you slide the locks in back into place. Usually we just have to roll it once to get all the clumps into the container. I was surprised at how well this thing works! This is a great alternative to more expensive litter boxes. The only thing to consider when purchasing this is that you do need to have space to roll this (not much, but you have to roll completely on its side). We keep ours under a counter and we do have to pull it out to do this, but it's very lightweight."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BUT A LITTLE INSIGHT","review":"It is great but this product would be even better with a fill line for litter put inside to know the preferred amount. I would also hope to see them recommend specific litter brands that work well with this product I use tidy cats and it does not work great because the urine clumps stick to the bottom so I will have to try a few different ones. They also had a customer photo with a door attached I recommend everyone doing that since the door is wide and a little low to the bottom or getting a nice size litter mat. It is easy to use and locks great so it wont open up on you. If you have multiple cats like myself I would watch the turns you make so that the draw does not get full and everything falls out or gets mushed on the inside as you are pulling the drawer out."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Self-Cleaning\\" function difficult to use and ineffective","review":"The pieces do not fit together snugly when assembled. The slide-out waste collection tray leaves gaps that litter falls from when rolling the box to clean. It is very heavy and awkward to roll and, although I tried to clean after first day of use, the wet litter stuck to the bottom of the box and did not fall into the collection tray. So I decided just to remove the lid and scoop the waste as I would for a normal covered box. However, the two pieces of the box do not fit together well, and after several times removing the top to clean the litter, the latches are virtually impossible to line up to get the lid firmly in place.

I spent more time taking this apart and wiping litter out of places that it shouldn't be.

It's used by 4 cats: older neutered male, young giant size 1/2 maine coon male, 3 legged female, and the kitten from heck. All adjusted to it quickly. I really like how easy it is to clean; and the lack of scattershot litter all over the floor is great. (Giant boy likes to see how far he can throw it.) 4 stars instead of 5 only because it's s a little rough from a manufacturing point of view. The material appears to be a lightweight thermoset plastic, the fastening clips don't look like they'll take much stress and the opening for the drawer is rough edged and looks like it was cut by hand with a saw. The design works very well, though.

I found this box to be anything but self-cleaning! The inner grate misses pieces and I was constantly scraping clumps from the sides. Also, it is clunky,so it won't fit in small spaces and need a lot of room to roll it for the \\"self cleaning\\" process, which shakes a lot of litter dust into the room and causes the collector tray to spill small amounts of litter onto the floor through a crack along the outer edge. No matter how far in I pushed the tray, I could not fully close the gap. It is also heavy so people with bad backs,the elderly and smaller children will find it impossible to use. I bought the larger box which is suppose to be for larger or multiple cats but the inside is still so small, if not cleaned constantly,the cat is stepping in their waste.

You do just as the instructions say and on its side roll it until it is upside down. Then roll it back to its original position.

They last a long time, and they're the easiest litter boxes to clean without a scoop, unless you like those horrible motorized ones.I had a problem with one of the fasteners that joins the top and bottom halves with the last one I bought and had to call Omega Paw for help. They sent me several replacement fasteners from Canada at no charge.I get the large size for my two indoor cats. Since it's so easy to clean I tend to do it more often, and my cats probably appreciate that. When it's cleaning time you just slowly roll it over onto it's top, then roll it back, remove the drawer, dump the \\"goods\\" in your diaper pail, tip it back the other way a bit to redistribute the litter, and you're done.I still wash my hands afterwards but at least I don't feel like I've been turd mining."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mess!!!!!","review":"I am beyond disappointed. If everything is working to specifications you are still going to be disappointed as it will not clean the litter box 100% per cleaning. If you are used to cleaning a litter box with a scoop and going until you cannot find any more lumps or clumps then you will not be happy with this. When you turn the box to the right and put it on its side going almost to the point of flipping it over you still cannot get all the clumps in the special catch all box. So when it rolled back you will find clumps,lumps and litter stuck to the grate the the litter was to fall through. Add to that the litter dust that goes \\"poof\\" when you roll it back over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, but...","review":"This box really isn't made very well.

Read negatives very carefully.","review":"I bought the small one. I bought the large one. Large did not work. contacted company. No response. Amazon sends a new one. Did not close , lock, what ever.

Omega answer your emails, because look what happens when you don't. Surprise! YOU LOSE BUSINESS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank Heaven","review":"I've had cats all my life, and this is the best litter box I've ever owned by leaps and bounds. It makes cleaning it so easy. My favorite litter to use with it is World's Best Cat Litter Multi-Cat, but Precious Cat Litter isn't bad either. My boyfriend likes that kind better because it clumps better. We got the regular size. We have two 6 month old kittens that share it. They seem to like it too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Saves Time and Your Back!","review":"This was definitely worth the money and a good deal. It doesn't eliminate having to actually clean your litter box thoroughly from time to time, but it sure does make life easier on a day to day basis! I have 2 cats and this size is perfect for them. Some litter clumps do get stuck in places and don't fall through the grated vent, but for the most part it's just flip and dump! I did notice that a particular kind of litter works better than others. I have tried many different types but it seems like Purina Tidy Cats Power Blend works the best. It's an awesome kitty litter whether you have this litter box or not!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"After reading all the rave reviews about this product I was hopeful that it was as good as it's reviews. The sifting mechanism takes up about 1/3 of the box. The latches are cheap and difficult to lock and unlock. I tried several different brands of litter and found that they all stuck to the bottom of the box requiring me to take it apart frequently. Litter spills out od the cracks as well. I eventually removed the sifting screen as it kept popping out and didn't function as stated anyway. I gave it 2 stars only because it's so large with the divider removed it's a better fit for a very large breed cat like my Siberian Forest cat. It's an interesting idea but it just doesn't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's time to stop scooping!","review":"This litter box is great. It takes all of 20 seconds to clean my cat's litter now and my hands are never exposed to any contaminated surfaces. I have used all kinds of scoopable litter with this box (clay, wheat, corn, crystals) and they all worked well. The only con is the size (I have a Russian Blue and she is about 12 lbs and the regular size box was MUCH too small so we upgraded to the large). This box would be great for someone who doesnt want to or is unable to scoop. When using the wheat litter, the box is extremely light and easy to roll. I disassemble and clean it about once a month (take outside and spray with hose, sun dry) and that's about it. I definitely reccomend this box. I can't believe I scooped my cats box for as long as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good alternative for traditonal box","review":"I have been using this box for a few months now and think it's a good alternative for a tradtional box. It is way more convienent and easier to clean. Sometimes, the litter gets stuck in the front and you have to scoop a little. We have also cleaned ours out with soap and water two times because the inside gets a little messy. We do have two cats though. It is plently large for both of them (which I was worried about) and they had no problem adjusting to it. Overall, I would recommend this box!"},{"rating":"2","title":"cleaning litter box made easy","review":"It's so easy to use. I hardly remember I have taken the time to clean the litterbox.

It works as stated, and I've had very little trouble over the years with it and my one very large (20 pound) cat. My only complaint is that the tabs holding the top to the bottom are plastic and eventually break off, which is why I needed to buy a new one (can't roll it once the tabs break). Even so, for the price I find it a great litter box for my cat and greatly prefer it to the old fashioned scooping method."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated Junk","review":"Like a few others, I purchased this item based upon rave reviews posted on Amazon.com and found it to be worthless. The construction is quite flimsy and one of the tabs that secures the top and bottom together broke the first week. Litter scatters everywhere from the seams, and the functionality is not remotely close to what is advertised. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND this product!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME. Simple genius.","review":"Amazing. One of the best things i bought in the past decade, and i buy a lot of stuff and never review.Pros:1. Cheaper than electric ones2. Sturdy, nice looking3. Cats love the privacy, adjusted right away no problem, both of them4. Easy to use, a 5 year old can do it (though not a cat, sadly...)5. Saves time, seconds to cleanConsNone so far, but poor review people here claim the clasps break. So handle without brutal violence, i guess. Also see below.Notes:-You need to have some space to roll it. So bathroom may not be a good place, but it looks fine in other places in the house due to its closed style.-Use GOOD clumping litter, not small and dusty, so it will work every time and not leak though seems as some one-star reviewers suggested it does. I have seen none of that. But i guess if i do i will simply put masking tape over the edges.So cool. Wish i got it years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great design!","review":"It works exactly like it says it does! It doesn't leak litter at the seams when you roll it (like I thought it might). No batteries, no power cords, no rakes or scoops, and no special liners to buy, just use any brand of clumping litter. Just keep in mind, when it says \\"self-cleaning\\", YOU are the \\"self\\", as you manually roll the box to get the used litter into the tray. My two indoor cats share the box, they used it right away and they didn't mind the new shape. (I used to use an igloo-style litter box, which didn't control odor well despite the charcoal-filtered vent.) There's no more odor problem because my kids (ages 8-12) LIKE to clean this litter box every day! And I'm not worried about them touching the dirty litter!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!!","review":"This litter box is great! We've had it now for about a week and already consider it one of the best purchases we've made.You can clean the litter 3 times a day in the same time it would take you to do it once with a regular litter box and scooper. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this litter box!","review":"Such a great product! Easy to assemble and easy to use! No more arguing about whose turn it is to clean the litter box.

It's also the least expensive. Like all cat boxes I sprayed it with silicone spray to prevent sticking prior to setting it up. I use whatever cat litter Costco has and it works. The biggest problem is that one of the cats will occasionally put their butt out the front to do their business but that's not the boxes fault. The lid is starting to crack from rolling the top on the cement, other than that it's a great box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Litter box for the money!!","review":"This is a great litter box for the money. Easy to use, does a good job. Make sure to have something to catch litter from around the opening as the cats exit. This thing is big so make sure you also have some space to roll it and get out all the unwanted bits."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest litter box ever","review":"My 12 year old daughter was always complaining about taking her turn to scoop for our five cats, as it was so icky and time consuming. Not any more. I first bought one large and one small litter box, just to try them out. All the cats started to use them within 48 hours. I also bought, at another reviewers recommendation, a bag of \\"the worlds best litter\\" to use in them. Expensive, but it lives up to its name and lasts ages. I wish I'd found out about these two products years ago. We haven't had any problems operating the litter boxes, or cleaning them, and it makes scooping so clean, quick and easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful product!","review":"This is a wonderful product and is so simple to use. It took me a minute to understand how to use it but basically when it's in front of you, you tip it all the way to the right, almost upside down, and all the the clumps fall into a long shaft. You pull it out (in the picture, it's the tan thing with a handle) and dump it, and put it back in.I purchased the regular and it was a little small for my Maine Coon but he uses it just fine. If you have a cat that's bigger than 15lbs or so, or is really fluffy, I would get the large instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best You'll Find for Under $100","review":"I will say that of all the litter boxes I've owned, this is the easiest to clean. It's not 100% foolproof, though. Some of the litter clumps stick to the bottom of the box, and therefore don't get transferred to the removal bin. Honestly, though, dealing with that is still a step up from the kinds of disgusting situations I've found myself in when trying to clean my previous litter boxes. Overall I'd say it's a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great in theory, not so good in reality","review":"Was really excited about this product at first, but it doesn't work very well. Some \\"treasures\\" were left behind in the box and others would get stuck in the grate without going into the tray. Litter would also spill on the floor during the turning process."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this litter box","review":"I absolutely love this litter box. I have two cats and I no longer have to scoop all the time. I simply roll this litter box over and the waste drops into a tray that I just pull out and empty in the trash. I don't have to deal with the dusty litter on a daily basis, like I used to. I am recommending this to all cat owners that I know. In fact, I am probably going to order an extra one in case anything ever happens to this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Concept good, but not worth it","review":"It does pick up some of the 'clumps' but does not keep it as clean as when you do it yourself. It is also pretty big and not really attractive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love","review":"The litter box is awesome - it's a \\"must have\\" especially if you have multiple cats.. The hood keeps the smell in for the most part, and it gets every last clump out of there with every dump.. Only complaint is that one of the sides isn't a perfect fit (however, with my luck, it's probably just this ONE box that ended up having that \\"faulty side\\").. When I dump it, it leaks a bit, so I have to clean that up every time - other than that, it's great.. It's a money saver as well, because I have found myself needing new litter less often, so - in the long run, it will be paying for itself!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"This box is good for making my cats enter and exit from one place so there isn't kitty litter everywhere, and it gives them some privacy - not that they care, but I do, but I just got so sick of rolling this thing over because it isn't the lightest thing, it doesn't catch everything so that means I have to keep rolling until it does and that's tiring, and the litter sometimes seeps out of the side, which is never fun. It's easier to just scoop the litter out with the shovel and call it a day."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Litter Box - Bar None","review":"When you have a cat, you have lots of options. When you have four cats, you need a box that is easy to clean and maintain because you have more than just one. After trying corner boxes, two electric boxes, and these, my husband and I have gotten rid of all others and kept just these very simple boxes. Roll it over, bang on the bottom, roll back, empty tray. That's it. No plastic bags or trays to replace, no icky scooping to do, no noisy motors getting stuck at 2 a.m., no tines getting soiled because the substance wasn't dry. Easy, effecient, and economical.If you have a big cat (one of mine is almost 17 pounds), get the large."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW, THIS REALLY WORKS!","review":"Often times the best solution IS the simplest one. I wasn't sure how this was going to work but since the other litter box I was considering cost hundreds (really!), I went ahead and tried this one first. I am SO glad I did! It really works great! And it arrived the next day! Unbelievable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"This is the best litter box ever. It is so easy to use and virtually hands free - no scooping needed! You literally roll it, pull out the drawer, and dump it in the trash - litter box changed in under 30 seconds. SO much cleaner and sanitary than typical boxes. I wish I'd gotten it years ago and never spent $150 on the self cleaning one that was more of a pain than it was worth and then ended up dying anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haven't had to scoop cat poop since I got this box...","review":"This litter box has been great for my very large, 22 lb cat. He can actually fit into the entire box now rather than having to hang his head out, like the Booda Dome he had before. It's easy to clean (simply rock the box all the way to the right), pull out the collection drawer, and empty. If assembled correctly (this is KEY), it separates the unclumped litter from the rest and holds that in a separate collection area while only the dirty portions fall into the collection drawer. I love this box, though it's a bit large, but it does the trick and my little guy has had no issues with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"omega paw litter box review","review":"The Omega Paw Self Cleaning Litter Box is a great product.

After I received this item, it didn't work properly. This box is made of poor quality of plastics. The most important part is the lock for the upper and lower part, however, is very easy to broken.Only after 2 weeks, this part was totally broken. And I have to order a scoop again to clean the litter by myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work","review":"I was excited to buy this litter box, but it simply does not work. I have tried several different types of cat litter and nothing helps. When the cats pee, the pee sticks to the back of the box and does not come loose by tipping the box. The poop usually does go through, but then you still have to take the top off and scoop the wet stuff out. It just did not work for me. I do not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"its great","review":"Super easy to clean. No more bending over and spending forever digging for \\"treasure\\". Also saves on litter.

It held up for 2 years before it finally broke down into just another litter box for us. The one complaint I have is that the clips that hold it together are plastic, and when the finally did break, it was when I was rolling the thing over to clean it. It doesn't take long to figure out what happened next. I had a lot of cat droppings on the floor. Like I said I still recommend this product because it lasted me over two years in working order, and I still use today without the top. I didn't buy another one though, because I have a MAine Coon, and even though the box is big, there isn't enough room for him in it. He always hung out of it with his grunting, pooping face. So, if you have a small to medium sized cat, it is a great product. Our smaller cat loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea but failed execution","review":"Maybe it's just my luck but the lead doesn't close correctly. Every time I turned it over to filter the clamped pieces some of the litter gets through. Great idea though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neat idea that does not work in practice","review":"It is possible that it may work for some cats.The mechanics of rolling this box to collect the clamped waste are actually quite clever.However, if your cats insist on using it near the edges, the waste will cling to the box itself and stay there no matter how much you roll the litter box. Then you are back to cleaning it the old fashioned way, except that 1/3rd of the box is wasted and this box isn't particularly convenient to open for daily scooping."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am in love with a cat box","review":"I have told all of my friends and family about this box. It is awesome. Never before has cleaning the cat box been stress-free and so quick! I really can't say enough great things about this box. Just 2 words... Must buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked like a charm, and then...","review":"If you had asked me what I thought of this box the first few weeks that I had it I would have sung you a song about how it is the best box that was ever created. However, after 2 months of use that is no longer the case. While my kitties love it, it has become an absolutely useless box in the \\"rolling\\" to clean capacity. The two problems that have caused us stop using this box are as follows, litter leaks out of the seams when it is rolled (which was not a problem in the beginning), and the plastic grate used to sift the dirty from the clean litter will not stay clipped to the bottom so there is no separation of dirty from clean litter. It was lovely while it lasted, but it should have lasted a whole lot longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"best of class","review":"best of class but needs bit of improvement. I read several reviews before purchase and they were largely right on. Design excellent but execution cheesy. Namely the four tab locks are too light and do not fit well. The tab locks can be improved by scraping excess plastic from the surrounding surfaces for a more secure fit. The makers should consider a higher end model with metal tabs and be more easily serviced. Also be sure and read the screen insert as to which side goes up. That was not clear or emphasized so my initial roll over was pretty messy until noted this instruction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never gets clean enough","review":"We got this box a few months ago. We had big hopes for it, but quickly noticed that the clumped litter often stuck to the bottom and sides of the box, so just turning over the box never got the litter clean enough. Also, when completely cleaning out the box (discarding all used liter, washing the plastic) it is such a pain to get around all the crannies. Using a simple box and scoop is more effective for us. I like the covered design, but the side compartment (to filter the litter after turning the box over) is too much unused space for our small bathroom. Will be looking for a simpler covered litter box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Less dust","review":"I love my cat, but there are several things that I dislike:1. Buying \\"sifting\\" litter liners2. The smell of cat droppings3. The dustThe dust is really what I dislike the most! Before the Omega Paw RA20, I would use the sifting litter liners to sift out the clumps. The problem is that the dust gets everywhere. I smell the dust in the air, on my clothes, and in my nose.With the Omega Paw RA20, I roll the box, take out the poop tray, throw the clumps in the trash can, put the poop tray back in, roll the box again, and put a heavy duty air purifier in front of the litter box entry for a few minutes. This keeps the smells and dust at bay.I also liked the price. The Omega Paw RA20 is several times cheaper than the electric litter boxes."},{"rating":"2","title":"great litter box","review":"Love this box. However, like another customer, I have problems with it. The problem stems from one of the fasteners on the side not \\"hooking\\". This means when I tilt the box I have to hold the lid on in this area and still get a little spillage of litter. It won't prohibit me from continuing to use the box, because it is soooo much better than scooping. There are 5 or 6 fasteners and the others snap in just fine but I have tried numerous times and this last one will not fasten. Haven't contacted the maker yet, but I will. Other than that, it works great, exactly like they describe it. I use the Arm and Hammer clumping litter and it works really well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great litterbox, but don't expect it to remove all the clumps!","review":"We just recently adopted 2 cats from the humane society and decided to order these for the cats. We obtained the large ones and certainly they are HUGE litterboxes. The ease of use was better than I expected and it really is just roll and roll back then empty.There is a downfall in that the filter that is put into the litterbox has slits that are fairly large so if you have litter which ends up being in smaller clumps it will go right through the filter. This means that you won't really get completely clean sifted litter but \\"relatively\\" clean litter. You are still going to have to sift through the litter to get every piece out.Not a horrible weakness but it's the reason why I only gave this litterbox a 4 out of 5. I would certainly recommend this product over the littermaid devices however."},{"rating":"1","title":"eww...","review":"hasn't anyone seen the episode of My Cat From Hell?! this litter box was serious criticized by cat behaviorist Jackson Galaxy. who (cat or otherwise) wants to be surrounded by their pee from top to bottom and side to side a few times daily?! personally, I think this is a disgusting idea.

I'm not looking forward to dealing with the clamps every week. One of our cats has odd pee and it makes the litter stick to the back of the box. I'm not sure how I'm going to manage scrapping the box everyday without taking the lid off. We'll see.

I had trouble with litter getting caught and clumping in the plastic grid thing and having the waste not being capture in the drawer like it was supposed to. I also had problems with litter sticking to the bottom of the box and not going into the drawer like it was supposed to. This box requires a lot of floor space in order to make it roll which I found inconvenient. Because of the sticking and clumping litter issues I had to disassemble this box several times a day (I have three cats) and clean the box which I know this box was not designed for that. It was designed to eliminated all the extra work in having a litter box, but this box actually created more work for me. So I ditched it and went back to an old fashioned litter box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes Litter Duty Easy","review":"It has a nice look to it, so far as litter boxes go.

Don't you think that the cat is breathing it? If your cat begins to have breathing problems - consider that lung damage has already happened and his/her lungs are clogged up with the litter dust.My black cat made me wake up to this problem. One day I saw him leaving the enclosed pan, and his black fur was all covered with white dust.

I love the product and once the pieces are put together you can see how clever the litter box is - you roll the product to the right and all the way over onto its top; the clean litter gets filtered into a special compartment, the waste goes in a handy scoop, and when you roll the litter box back over to the left you have clean litter for your cats, their litter in an esay-to-empty scoop, and you're done. It's simple and fast. The only complaint is that the thing is made of cheap plastic that still has lots of random little tags of plastic, the pieces don't quite fit together, and it doesn't feel sturdy.

Initially, I was pretty impressed with the product as it only required me to tip the box. No pooper scooper! Yet after using it for a while, I realized how dirty the product got from tipping it to empty out litter cakes and feces. Poop smears and clay litter smears were all along the side. I even think that because the scent of my cat's excretions were all over one side of the litter box, he sprayed inside the litter box on the other side of it. Let's not even mention the horrors of this litter box when my cat had loose stool. I have since taken out the sifting screen and tray and bought a litter scoop.

When I rolled the box much of the clean litter was being caught in the scoop. I thought maybe I had added to much litter so I took some out, with less litter everything was sticking to the sides and bottom of the box. Also when I rolled the box litter would come out at the seam where the top and bottom join. It turned out to be less work to just scoop than to deal with all this.

For the price of a few LitterMaid poo recepticles that are horribly overpriced, one can get this litterbox that'll last at least two years. It's quite simple to use and amazingly effective, just basically turn the box over and poof, all the poo and other wonderfulness that our feline friends create ends up in the removable 'scoop', which can then be dumped into a trashbag.

The result was a lot MORE litter on the floor. I was thinking about returning the product, but have instead been using it with just the cover (without the filter or scooper with the handle).

I am referring to the small metal tab, that supports the case cover when closed, located to the left and above the Axim device lock button, when your Axim is in the case. This poor fit causes the Axim to get squeezed a bit, at the point where the Axim microphone is. The case is not properly designed to ensure that this pinching or squeezing does not occur. The case also has no secure locking mechanism, to prevent the case from popping open if you should drop it.

Alas.While the pieces chosen show a good cross-section of Goldsmith's crativity, the execution is seriously lifeless. It is as if the compositions were left to saute' overnight in Symphony Sauce: the performances are plodding and pedestrian. I don't know who convinced Goldsmith to do it this way, but omitting the martial snare roll at the beginning of the Man from U.N.C.L.E. theme, or not adding at least an accordian to the Waltons theme, are just two examples of how Goldsmith's great work has been emasculated by, I suspect, some record exec's insight.

Since I went with all polk audio I know they are timbre matched and didn't have to worry about matching them with other manufacturers.These speakers are very easy to install and look great. I painted mine to match the wall and my wife didn't even notice they were there. Now that doesn't mean they are invisible, but we don't normally turn the lights on over the tv very often so in our case the speakers are very hard to notice. Polk Audio recommends using a spray paint to paint the speakers, but I was able to use normal interior latex paint without any problem"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this book. Not only did I find the characters completely unlikeable, but the situations they were involved in were also totally boring. I couldn't stand the main character and couldn't care less about what happened to her. This book dragged on forever and it wasn't worth finishing. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"I thought this would be fun reading but the pacing proved to be so excruciatingly slow that I had to put it down after three honest tries at resuscitating my interest. Doesn't the writer know anything about pacing? It seems like that would be one of the basics of craftsmanship!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A little too long, but exceptionally well written","review":"This book seemed to go on forever. Ciresi is an incredibly adept writer, but for some reason there just seemed to be too much of it. I found it very hard to be sympathetic to Lisa--her reckless and self-destructive behavior was just plain annoying by the end. However, it is an insightful glimpse at a 20-something during the 80's. The front cover copy is misleading though, as it makes the book sound as if it about Lisa and her overbearing mother. That is a part of the story, but not the most important part. Overall, and enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couln't get through it","review":"Be weary of this book. Although I found it to be well-written, the plot moved too slowly. I couldnt finish the book, I dont even think I got half way through it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexy and Full of Humor","review":"I truly loved this book. I must have read it (cover - to - cover) in less than 6 hours. This is certainly my idea of a great weekend. I found this wonderful tale of young Lisa Diodetto's life a bit too like looking in the mirror. God Forbid that we both be unmarried and without children at age 25. Her bold and brash changes serve as a wonderful vehicle for this crafty story. I read a review that said, \\"This is Jane Austen in New York at the end of the 20th century\\"... how true. I'm a faithful Austen girl - and I would certainly see glimpses of my \\"religion\\". It's a great book with loads of charm and humor. And, a bit naughty too... You just can't go wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass this one up","review":"This book was a major dissapointment. The review on the back stated that Rita Ciresi was a modern day Jane Austen. I have read all of Jane Austen's stories and this was nothing like it. This novel was devoid of all the charming wit and humor in Jane Austen's novel. The plot wandered, and the characters were unsympathetic; after all, who wants to read about a girl who's problem is she works-out too much and is too skinny?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Did Not Want This Book To End","review":"This story reminded me so much of people that I already know. I wanted the story to go on -- I wasn't ready to let go of the wonderful characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking Connection","review":"I did not connect with this book at all. The main character has so many flaws that I could not connect with her. Lisar has a history of doing drugs and sleeping around, and she constantly relapses.I did not buy into her relationship with Strauss. How can they love each other if they spend about 90% of the time arguing and bickering? I felt that Strauss deserved someone better than Lisar."},{"rating":"1","title":"The main character is so detestable, she ruins the novel","review":"Rita Ciresi's writing style cannot really be faulted. She writes with a witty, clear pen. However, what she creates amounts to 400 pages of wasted time. Lisa is a truly loathesome character. The reader is confronted with a young woman with no self-respect; she is someone who never feels sorry for her actions, but always feels sorry for herself when faced with the consequences. She is surrounded by stock characters--her stuffy lover, her gay cousin, her lesbian boss, her Italian mother.Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine writer","review":"I've read some of Rita Ciresi's other books, so her style wasn't a surprise. Her books offer a nice change of pace from the usual mindless cotton-candy fluff of the \\"chick lit\\" genre-- this is not your \\"shopaholic\\"-type book!(Incidently, my library's copy of the book featured a different cover- it could be called more \\"serious\\" I suppose)Yes, sometimes it was a bit plodding-- but life's like that sometimes, and that's what I like about Ciresi's style. She's a very fine writer, and I admire her work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"I did not put this book down! I stayed up late reading it, and really felt for Lisa and Strauss. I think Rita does a great job portraying italian-american families. I am an italian-american and we will do anything for our family. I think it is also great how Lisa doesn't just want to meet and hopefully marry another italian guy. She puts the religious issue aside and lets her love grow. I also like the work issues she faces. As every working girl in Corporate america knows this is how it is in a lot of places.I definitely reccomend this book. I am going out today to buy Blue Italian."},{"rating":"2","title":"well written. liked the book , didn't like the characters.","review":"First of all, this book was incredibly well written. I liked the author's style and how she'd spring things on the reader in an entertaining and haphazard way. It keeps you on your toes. I finished the book last nite and I'm not sure if I like the characters. I definitely do not like Strauss. His arrogance and bossiness would drive me up a wall. (Whenever he called her \\"Lisar\\" -- I would just cringe.) Lisa was okay. I found her incredibly selfish and a real pain in the derriere, yet I felt for her. But, I don't have to like the characters in order to like book. The author's style conveyed very well Lisa's love for Strauss and I was rooting for her all along. I'd reccomend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Wonderful book I did not want to put it down. I thought that the characters and relationships were very believable. Easy read and a good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not put this one down!","review":"Once I started this book, I could not put it down. I especially liked that no character and no relationship was perfect, making this that much more enjoyable. This book of love and romance totally riveted me because it was totally realistic. This book will leave you with a good feeling in your heart long after you have finished reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't know what to make of it","review":"This book is packaged as light and fun, but it's a long, slow read. It's not cohesive -- it reads like several short stories strung together. The book is supposed to be a romance, but the weakest relationship by far is between Lisa and Strauss, who won't even let him call her by his first name. When the story revolves around her family, it gets funny and readable and moves along fairly quickly. When it bogs down in her relationship with her boss, it's just boring. The ending felt abrupt and forced and was very disappointing. I know it's supposed to be a happily-ever-after for Lisa, but I just felt sorry for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"I could barely finish this book! How others can state otherwise is beyond me. The book is extremely slow and the characters are so dull you hate them half way through the book. The cover is completely misleading giving the impression of a light hearted fun read as it states \\"Lisa's mother wants her to get married so badly that anyone in pants will do\\" doesnt make sense at all since there was no character development between Lisa and her mom. By the end of the book I was skipping pages to see how it would FINALLY end! Skip this book, its one pages too many and very boring!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it!","review":"Just drags on slowly... I figured that there's no point in sitting there trying to understand what the author is trying to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it","review":"I absolutly love this book. At firt, when I began reading it I wasn't sure if I would like it because it's a bit confusing at first: there a lot of related memories mixed with the actual events but once you read the first 30 pages I assure you that you won't be able to put that book down. I like it so much that when I realizes that I just had 6 pages left before i finish it, I was disappointed! I didn't want it to end! I love how she decisbed her family. Even if i'm not from an italian-american family, I relate to Lisa - the heroin. I laugh when she talk about her mother. Lisa is kind like me: at 25, she's still not married! Has no children! Lives in a big city -new york in her case- Rarely goes to church! She has a job she hate but then all of sudden, she get a job at a pharmaceuticals company where she edits brochure and where she also write a novel. And then, she falls in love with her boss, a guy who is exactly her opposite. I cannot say more, go and read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Psuedo Feminist Just Wants to get Married and Pregnant","review":"the main character is a career gal, a sexually agressive (at least in her early years), trained liberal-arts-college feminist who can espouse the requisite lingo/literary figures/issues. yet, this supposed feminist chick's life is eclipsed by the fact that she spends the entire book trying to get herself a man. this is but one sense in which she is pathetic. she has ZERO friends other than a gay male cousin who she continually says \\"gets in her way\\" of her real goal in life - which one can only assume is to get a man.sure, the writing is compelling and you find yourself getting sucked in in spite of yourself..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Despised this book","review":"This is the first of Rita Ciresi's books I've read. I doubt I'll try any more.The worst thing about this book is 'Lisar' the main character - annoying, ignorant, self-involved, stupid, whiny, and dull. She seems to have no problem sleeping around with every guy she comes across, even having sexual fantasies about her own dead father, and then blames her boyfriend when he can't take her past. Nothing is ever her fault, only everyone else's. She has no friends whatsoever, except her gay male cousin, who is as vacuous, dull and stereotypical as she is. And for the entire book, all she does is complain - about her parents, her boyfriend, her life, her job, her boss, the dumb jock (that she still comes on to, even though she can't stand him) her size zero body etc. etc. Trite and boring!The second worst thing about this book are all the other characters - every one of them is such a cliche it's very difficult to swallow. Poor writing indeed.A huge disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty view of corporate life in the 80's by \\"Lisar\\"","review":"\\"Lisar\\" is a funny, witty, sad character with a lot of dimension. The idea of the 80's office with it's archaic technology and \\"new\\" philosophy of sexual harrassment was a wonderfully painted grey background to all of the colorful thoughts and beautifully written dialogue the author smoothly brush-stroked over this banal existence we all share of day-to-day corporate life. The contrast of her Italian mother and sister taking their spagetti-sauce stirring task so seriously, and the gay cousin throwing caution to the wind are masterfully written. This would be a great movie, and is very realistic. This is a great follow-up to Blue Italian. Can't wait to read more about Lisa in a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started good but got bored....","review":"When I started reading this book, I was pretty into it, but then I got REALLY bored. It just seemed to move too slowly for my taste. I got bored with the characters and decided to give up on it. Hopefully I will enjoy her other novel, although I'm not definite that I will purchase it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought this book was awful","review":"I don't know how others can rave about great character development, but I thought there was very little in this book. The writer could have delved in so much further and developed the mother/ daughter relationship that I found to be completely lacking. The front of the book spouted about \\"Lisa's mother wants her to get married so badly that anyone in pants will do,\\" however it didn't really seem to be about the mom at all. I am definitely one of those who have to finish a book once they have started it, so I blame myself for weeding through horrific writing just for the sake of finishing the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pink Slip not worth the time","review":"The plot about Lisa and Strauss, her boss, is somewhat fun, but the way he's written I found him dull and unemotional. The rest of the plots aren't worth the time - why she is losing weight, the sexual energy with the brother-in-law, lashing out at her mother - except the relationship with her cousin, Dodie.It would have made for a much more succinct story to have the relationship with Lisa and Strauss be parallel to her relationship with Dodie. It was drawn out in many places and too in-depth about extraneous issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Edible Ramen","review":"Let me start by saying that until now the only use I had for ramen noodles was possibly using them as packing material. I truly did not consider them food until now. I came into my kitchen following the smell of some really good oriental food cooking. When I entered the kitchen looking for the source of the delicious aroma I found my college age son munching on what appeared to be a instant noodle cup. Upon further investigation I found that the really good oriental flavor and aroma were coming out of that cup. I'm hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really like this pilaf","review":"I don't eat much packed food, but I saw a Dr. McDougall's tortilla soup in the health food section of Publix. The ingredients are all natural, vegan and are low in sodium and calories. I loved the tortilla soup, so I bought six packages, along with 6 packages of the chicken pilaf on Amazon. Although I prefer the tortilla soup, the pilaf is excellent for a dehydrated food product. I will probably eat Dr. McDougall's soups for lunch every day until I get burned out on them. The reviewer who gave this pilaf one star said that there were only about four bites in the meal, but I find it to be very filling. The container says that the soups and pilaf will serve 2, but this is really a meal for one. The whole container contains 260 calories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. McDougall's rice pilaf soup","review":"I've been eating this soup for several years and was pleasantly surprised to find it on Amazon.

However, this was a very big disappointment. The flavor was awful, not only bland, but it had some sort of off putting stench. Some sort of plastic trying to be meat smell. Second is the portion. There is a reason that this thing only has a small number of calories, it's because there are only like 4 bites of food in here. I'm much happier with a head of raw cauliflower.

The title means something like \\"White Reggae\\" and indeed there is a lot of reggae influence to be found on this disc. Along with the reggae the album pretty much goes in a bunch of different directions almost as if the band was struggling to find just what kind of sound that they wanted to put out there. Overall this is another strong album from the Police. A couple of huge hits came from this disc \\"Message In A Bottle\\" and \\"Walking On The Moon\\" and the non single tracks are all good as well.

Yes, everyone has heard \\"Message in a Bottle\\" numerous times I know. It's still a good tune and a fitting one to begin the album. The title song is also a rocker as are \\"Deathwish\\" and \\"It's Alright for You\\". In the latter, the rapid fire vocals by Sting really make the song. \\"Bring on the Night\\" and \\"Walking on the Moon\\" are of a slightly slower tempo and in keeping with \\"Be My Girl--Sally\\" from the previous album, there's a goofy, novelty-ish song in \\"On Any Other Day\\".

This CD is so good I can put it on and NEVER hit the \\"skip\\" button. Outstanding tracks include \\"Holy,\\" the lyrically evocative \\"Healed,\\" My Offering,\\" and a moving life-cycle song, \\"I Am\\" -- as well as an excellent cover of Peter Gabriel's \\"In Your Eyes.\\" Nichole is a word-crafter of depth and precision almost unmatched among Contemporary Christian Music artists. A stirring offering you will find youtself playing over and over -- well worth the $$."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply amazing","review":"Nichole is clearly showing herself to be one of the most talented female artists in the Christian music industry today... possibly in the music industry at large. This album showcases once again her unique, amazing talent at writing thought-provoking, inspiring, moving songs, and superb music to go with them. Lyrically she continues her legacy, writing such masterpeices as \\"I Am,\\" \\"Holy,\\" and \\"Even Then.\\" As for the content of the album, it takes a decidedly more worship-oriented approach. Not that all her albums aren't God-centered, but this one is most explicity so. The sound is just what we've come to expect from Nichole - a catchy, modern, well-crafted pop/contemporary sound centered on her awesome vocals and set to music that complements her rather than takes away. Nichole is a bright spot in CCM today, and this album has given me new hope for Christian music in general. It definitely should not be missed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Speechless","review":"You did it again, Nichole! Words fail to describe how utterly stunning this new CD is. The lyrics will have you crying and worshiping the first time you listen to it. Nichole Nordeman is a singer/songwriter second to none and, this is really hard for me to say, Nichole having been my #1 favorite since her first CD, \\"Wide Eyed\\", I think this is her best work ever. A true must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too fluffy","review":"Books are like best friends to me and this book would be more like an \\"acquaintance\\" rather than a \\"friend\\".

I didn't get that much out of it and would rather have spent my time on a book with more of a story with new characters to meet.

The best part is sharing the laughter with other women in your life(men won't get it).

This movie has no plot, terrible acting, among other things that make this movie terrible. It is honestly an unwatchable movie.

I can tell you they found mine!The result is a wonderful mix of old choruses along with songs made popular by contemporary artists on two CD's. Selections with a variety of tempos are arranged so that a fast, upbeat song follows slow selections. Many make smooth transitions using key changes for emphasis.The arrangements have a solid percussion beat accompanied by a strong horn section, piano, flute, and more, with no one instrument being overbearing - a delightful listening experience. As with the instruments, no one voice sticks out in the vocals making it easy to feel like you're a part of the praise team as you sing along. This collection of songs is also available in split track, if you desire the music only with which to sing either at church or for your own enjoyment.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous!","review":"Wonderful!

For the price, the Archos GMini 120 gave the largest hard drive capacity when compared to the iPod and the players from Dell and Samsung. I had no problems with the unit being recognized by Win XP, and I upgraded the unit's system software from v1.2 to v1.5 with no difficulty. The controls and menus are functional and logical although the buttons are slightly hard. My player runs 8.5 hours on a full charge, but I get occasional error messages during the last half-hour of use when playing WMA music files (it says there is something wrong with the file). The included ear buds are good, but I prefer my Sony ear buds which give a richer sound. Fit and finish is adequate. The hard drive inside is extremely quiet.

However, instead of the hard drive being the source of the problem, the display was getting very garbled and sometimes even completely reversed. I tried tech support before returning it, just to get an idea of how good their support is in case I wanted to exchange it for another Gmini, but I haven't heard back from them in over a week.

The later idea is cheap captialism and razorblade marketing and simply moronic. If the player has all these capabilities, why not sell it all-in-the-box ready to go?

The fact that MusicMatch Jukebox sucks means nothing to me because I don't and haven't been able to sync with it, instead I use it as other users do and pretend its a hard drive.The biggest downfall has to be the battery which for me last only about 4 or 5 hours. The fact that I can't replace it just makes me sad and there's hardly any point to hooking it up to my car because out of 3 possible bars of battery, it will quickly go to 1 bar and very soon just stop playing.But really above all, its small, you can show pictures to your friends, you can have people ask you if its a Zune, and no one knows really what it is so they won't steal it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Archos Products and Support Is Horrible","review":"1.

Don't get me wrong she has an excellent voice! It is very refreshing to find someone as sweet and humble as she is, bringing joy to those who hear her.

Another thing is, they've already dubbed her to become the next Celine Dion. I disagree AT THIS POINT because, Celine Dion belts out the high notes and leaves a person on the edge of their seat. That is if they have a pulse. Thins young girl dosen't. When she goes to hit high notes she cowars from them. Acting as though they were her enemy. Out of all of this, I can say something good. One word, POTENTIAL. She's got it but it needs developement. I would say she needs vocal lessons.

The songwriting on this is extremely brilliant and janet's voice has a lot of power. And if you think that's all you're wrong. Janet ENTERTAINS with her awesome music videos of songs from this CD and her rhythm nation tour. See clips on youtube to get an idea when deciding whether to buy this and you'll be converted into a janet fan for life. 17 years after this album and janet is still going strong despite controversy.

And Madonna? lol please. the only thing they have in commen is that their both female. It's madonna who tried to go the R&B route with Bedtime Stories. trying to get some of that janet audience. And of course failed. Janet has shown she's the best time after time. And RN1814 stands is just another example of her greatness.Not michael not madonna not mariah can do what janet does. She's one of a kind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tells how Janet tries to raise social awareness.","review":"This CD is revolutionary. Not only does it include great songs like \\"Escapade\\" and \\"Miss You Much,\\" but also short interludes that state her opinions about the things that were wrong with the world in 1989, and are still wrong today. Things like a shooting at a playground and the homeless and hunger problems. She tries to tell us that all of us need to work together for the problems to find a solution. She's right."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pure Classic.","review":"This is the album that made me a Janet fan. I love this album with all my heart and soul.

I listen to this album religiously and I also listen to all Janet albums religiously. I love Janet. This album is a beautiful record. I love the whole concept of this album and all that it stands for. Did you know that the \\"Black & White\\" cover means something? It means that races should unify as one. I love every song on this album because they all have a special place in my heart and they bring back beautiful memories. I have been listening to this album for years and I am still not tired of it.

In particular, \\"The ghostly Ruins of Marlborough\\". I spent the better half of a hot summer day walking, climbing and exploring the \\"the Ruins of Rome\\". Nearby North Lake provided a place to cool down before dinner. If you explore the back roads when you travel this gives you some interesting spots to stop. I would have liked it if there were better maps of the locations in the book but overall it made for several interesting days.

This album is his second for GRP and it's classic JARREAU. His unique welding of soul, funk, pop and jazz is always pefectly balanced.This C.D is full of strong songs \\"LIFE IS\\" is the smoothest piece of funk ever as good anything GEORGE CLINTON OR J.B could muster, hectic agitated arrangement make it impossible to sit still to.OASIS is where he really shines it's quite simply will become a formidable jazz standard for all afficionadosit's even more impressive as this song was co written by the great man himself.RANDOM ACT OF LOVE sets up the c.d perfectly it's an optimistic mid tempo groove which is addictive after the first listen about the pleasure of giving and if our AL keeps on giving like this his fans will remain loyal and wholly satisfied as I've been for the past 20 years. Pamper yourself and buy it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All you got is all we need","review":"Al's last album started with a fresh wind, featuring a few fantastic songs in the beginning, just to loose breath after song No. 4. Although I believe myself to be one of his greatest fans, I wouldn't have bought the album for it's songs No. 5 to No. 10.This new CD is different: it's saucy, funky and laid back, presenting old Al in the way we've come to know him as (or maybe better: changing to) the world's most famous Jazz/R&B singer in the world interpreting songs of a high composing level.Dear Al, when you come to Germany next time: please bring along some of these songs - and, please, a keyboard player who is also able to play some of your classic standards like 'Your Song', 'After all' or 'Teach me tonight'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disillusion","review":"This is not a good example of the great music from AlJarreau we know for many years.Really disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"looking for a song","review":"The song is \\"Girls Know How To\\" and it's from the soundtrack to the movie \\"Night Shift.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i expected","review":"I just want people to know that this is not the Al Jarreau of \\"breakin away\\".

Then of course, he became a comic strip hero who was quite popular until the FLASH GORDON comic strip with superior illustrative art started competing.Universal did well with Buck, though the serial didn't have the appeal of the Flash Gordon serials. It's not as imaginative, but it is a good action serial. Buster Crabbe shows a little of the calmer nature of the hero, compared to Flash Gordon's impetuousness.If you don't have any of them, get especially FLASH GORDON: SPACE SOLDIERS and FLASH GORDON CONQUERS THE UNIVERSE first, but then be sure to get BUCK ROGERS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buck Rogers, an enjoyable serial","review":"Although an enjoyable serial, its special effects didn't quite equal thoseof the Lydecker brothers of Republic Pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buster Crabbe is Great, The Serial is Bad","review":"I love Buster Crabbe and Flash Gordon is a terrifc serial. Buck Rogers however... in fairness Buster give it the college try but the production values are bargain basement and the story line is grade school level. Did I enjoy it, yes but only for the fun of watching Buster. There are a couple of decent story elements - the \\"transporter\\" idea, which was copied 30 years later by Star Trek and and Anti Gravity belts - good touches, but too little too late.

Ever have a rainy Saturday with not too much on your agenda? Sit back and enjoy this old reel: it will bring back fond memories and even stir the imagination of those too young to remember anything so simplistic yet so utterly fascinating. The gadgets, the hero, the archvillan, the antagonists et. al. are all contained. If you enjoyed the Flash Gordon Trilogy, this version of Buck Rogers must be part of your collection.

I had to go to the end credits to find out which character she was. I was expecting the beautiful woman from the cover of her \\"Minx\\" album. Instead, from 1977 I got a sort of chubby teenager playing \\"Mad\\", a punk girl with a carot crewcut. Not interesting.It is a very ambitious movie, and perhaps it should earn points for that.

A great opener, great special effects.Then a mysterious death in 1996, which Smilla, a loner, begins to investigate. At times, scenes resembled the X-FILES, as mysterious killers and conspiracists and prehistoric worms brought to life all enter the picture.But most of it is like a self-absorbed Ingmar Bergman film. Long boring scenes emphasizing how depressed and alienated all the characters are. I didn't much care for any of them, and it was tough putting up with their dreary lives.I taped this off the Independent Film Channel, and forced myself to watch it over two days, just to see how it all turned out. I was too bored to see it all on the same day.Film made me glad I don't live in Denmark."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mixed bag","review":"An odd mix of genres, starting off as an internal psychological drama (cf. \\"Insomnia\\") and shading into science fiction/conspiracy thriller. The main appeal of this movie is trying to figure out what kind of movie it is.Julia Ormand is supposed to be playing a primeval, almost feral woman who's constantly at odds with modern civilization. Instead she looks and acts so delicate that she's more like a pouty supermodel. When she finally shuts up her father's whiny mistress, it's a catfight, not the act of someone capable of serious violence.The wintry photography is actually the best part of it, and gives a strong sense of place. Too bad it wasn't in the service of a better story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I came across this movie on late night television by accident and when I saw who was in it I set my VCR to record. I was pleased I did. I now have the DVD. It was the second movie I saw Gabriel Byrne in and I am now a confirmed supporter. Julia Ormond is a treasure and after seeing her with Harrison Ford in Sabrina she can do no wrong. The small boy in this movie should have received a carton of oscars for his effort. Greenland scenery is superb"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"For any Gabriel Bryne fan or Julia Ormond fan this is a must-see. The love story is beautiful and touching. The chemistry between the two is great!! The scene in the car between the two of them was really good!I loved the whole mystery of the movie and romance. The acting was very well done. It was great to see Vanessa Redgrave and I wished to see more of her.Gabriel Bryne was wonderful in this film. His soft, vulnerability, but strong character was perfect to Smilla's more thorny character. He really helped make her softer in the end. I can only wish to see more of Gabriel Bryne in these kind of roles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Certainly offbeat, but quite flat","review":"Thriller about some nonsense involving a meteor and Greenland Eskimos. The female lead has one speed: flat. Absolutely no heat between her and her alleged costar boyfriend. The little boy has a good part, but barely speaks. The plot is silliness. I was tired of Julia Ormond's non-stop anger about 20 minutes into this two hour film. Why didnt she just move back to Greenland if she was so angry about being taken from it? Good riddance! Watch if you have nothing else to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sense of Filmmaking","review":"You definitely have not seen a film like this. After getting spoon fed junk for so many years, it was nice to watch a mystery and actually use my brain for once. The script constantly surprised me, and Ormond is terrific. This is the level of film that the James Bond series should be at now, instead of \\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\"-type fluff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great acting, character development , scenery & music.","review":"Julia Ormond is amazing again in another very different incarnation of herself as Smilla the incredibly prickly ice princess. Wow! Everyone in the supporting cast is superb. Gabriel Byrne who usually plays cynical and tough does a nice job as a gentle, vunerable foil for Ormond's character. Smilla's character and the plot beautifully & slowly evolve(European style)but Ormond makes it feel like the movie is going to be over too soon and we'll have to leave the strange ice lady in her alien(to us) worlds of wintery Copenhagen and frigid Greenland. The whole first 3/4ths of the film is wonderful on every level--drama, mystery, psychology and romance. The last 1/4th of the movie is as if the writers or the director couldn't handle both action and drama/psychology at the same time. But who cares when most of this film has such outstanding acting, directing, scenery, atmosphere and an incredible musical score."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"It's good to reunited with a hard-to-find classic.

On the back of the Auryn, it's supposed to say 'Do what you wish' (Atreyu didn't notice this because he can't read) so Bastian was supposed to wish even w/out a bird trying to pursuade him.

First one is no doubt a masterpiece but second one is quite a failure. This is based on the second half of the story and has more important message than the first half where the first movie is based. According to the book Bastian is so charmed by fantasy world and keep making wish he forgets even who he is and how to get back to the world he belongs. This movie however is following similar steps to the first one (what is the difference between \\"nothing and emptyness\\"?) forgetting what has to be done. Artrayu this series is closer to the book I think. Second one is more forgettable than the third which has tried original story. Because it is better to read a book. But Neverending Story has more future if the directors shed the effort to start from scratch. Let Miyazaki do the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst sequel EVER","review":"Ive loved the original Neverending Story since childhood.

However, i did enjoy this movie. Yes the cast has been totally re-cast bar the bookseller (which was proberly his only movies). Jonathan Brandis plays Bastian this time round. A very talented actor who has now sadly passed away (2003). During this movie shows he could have done the first one too. Its like a totally different story than the first, which indeed is what its ment to be. The whole feeling is crazier than the first which was mainly in a world just like ours. I think the first was based on earth before time whereas the second is based on earth after time as passed. Anyway, this movie i enjoyed very much but don't go watching expecting the first cause its not ment to be.

This movie, however, is not a good continuation, and does not stay true to the book in the slightest (where the first movie was astoundingly faithful.) It seems the directors decided to pick out their favorite plot devices from the tale and throw them together in an odd mishmash of a film. The movie loses all of it's magic because of the forced, unbelievable motivations of the characters and *horrible* acting on all parts (even the adults are terrible.) Falkor in particular sounds like an idiot. The plot is weak at best, nonexistant at worse. Again, I stress that if you want a good tale, pick up the book instead. This movie is not even worth a rental, much less a purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"NeverEnding Story","review":"I appreciate your doing business with me.

Lewis will feel compelled to see. The second movie has no chivalry, no mystery no romance, and I wish my children had not seen it, to interfere and dilute the powerful feelings and lessons of the first. The allegory of the first is far superior to the second. I understand the third is even worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever!","review":"I admit I was overjoyed when I heard of a sequel being made because there was more to the book than the first movie, but my enthusiasm took a nosedive when I saw this movie. The child actors could not act, and basically in a nut shell, the whole movie seemed to lack heart and imagination. (Ironically enough) If you're a true fan of the first movie and the book, STAY AWAY. If you're into those cheap Disney sequels that are churned out just to make money, this movie is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have left well enough alone.","review":"Even if you were able to tolerate the first one after reading the (fabulous) book, the fact that you could even make it through this one is beyond amazing. I walked out of the theater when Neverending II was first released, but thought that maybe it might just be my snobbish teenage mind - only to find out while giving this a second shot on DVD that is was as horrid as I remembered. If sequels must be made, at least *try* to find someone who looks like the orginal screen play characters. The acting is poor to say the least, the story patchy. They desperately tried to capture the magic of the book and the parts of the story line that were left out of the first movie. They failed. If you must watch a film version of this otherwise fantastic story, go with the 1st film. In this case, first times a charm.

Unfortunately, this sequel does it no justice. Mediocre acting and unimpressive (although elaborate) special effects don't do anything to add to the cliched and poorly construed plot.

I loved it as a kid and ordered it for my kids to watch. The sound quality was very poor. The first 5 minutes of the movie we had to turn the TV (65\\" ViZio LCD) up to 100 just to barely hear it! We usually watch movies at 19-23 on the volume. For the rest of the movie we had to turn it up for certain scenes and down for others. It was frustrating.

He was to quite. On this movie, the Bastian is way better and the story is also way better, just like in the book, the second half was better than the first. Xyidea (sorry if I mispelled it) is a much better enemy than the nothing or the wold. She actully is one of hose enmy who befriends the main character and tricks him, and almost persuades him to do things bad, when he doesnt even realize he is doing it. So if you want a better, but more complicated (not for adults , but more complicated than the first was for younger children) then this is the one, Is much better than the first, but I love both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother!","review":"Well, I loved the first one and so when the sequel came out I can to get it!

Sensbach has written an engaging and erudite synthesis of Moravian attitudes toward slavery. The writing style hides Sensbach's grip on the complexities of the literature concerning slavery and racism in the early United States. His use the words and lives of individual Moravian slaves brings to light the voices of those who normally would have been voiceless during the colonial and revolutionary periods. His analysis is not one-sided; he brings to light all the facets of Moravian cultural life and how those religious and social institutions impacted the Moravian debate on the institution of slavery. The Moravians may then be likely viewed as a model for understanding the ambiguity of attitudes toward slaves during the colonial period and early Republic. Sensbach's writing is beautiful and easily conveys a masterful understanding of the period.

What the film is trying to point out is the idea Israel should not exist incites anti Semetic action by groups around the world.I wish the film makers would have made this idea more clear.

For quite a while, I've been looking for a thermal carafe to keep the liquid hot while I sat and read the Sunday paper. While I have zero complaint about the functionality of the press, calling it a \\"thermal\\" press is a misnomer. I believe that a thermal press should, at the very least, keep liquids hot until you've drunk your first cup. Sadly, no such luck here. I'll be going back to my glass carafe over a tea light until I find something better. >sigh<UPDATE: I'm an idiot. I should have read the part where it says \\"fill with hot water first.\\" Now, I fill it with hot water while the water is boiling and then dump it. And voila - it works, really well.

My brother has a glass Bodum version that he likes alot. I decided to get this one because: 1) filter is one piece instead of 3 piece making it easier to clean (and I believe that it allows you to use a somewhat finer ground coffee because it is seems tighter)2) don't have to replace glass beaker - the glass beakers can break (although they are easily replaceable - I don't want to deal with hassle and expense)3) I like the sleek look of it this pot - the handle has a very nice smooth feel and finishOn the con side you can't \\"see\\" your coffee as you press through it - but I can live with that."},{"rating":"1","title":"redundant","review":"this seems like a bad idea if you like french press pot coffee. The whole point is to get the brew away from the grinds once it is ready. The best way to do that is to immediately transfer what you aren't drinking to a thermos or insulated carafe. Leaving the brew in contact with the grinds is not a good idea. On top of that a plastic plunger?? Yes, the glass carafes on the classic Bodum models sometimes break, as one reviewer pointed out, but this happens less as one gets used to it and at the price, still cheaper than any other method of brewing and a far superior product results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best French Press","review":"This was my third friench press that I had purchased in the last year.

Your coffee will taste like PLASTIC!!!","review":"Do not buy this french press. I cannot for the life of me figure out how this press has gotten such highly rated reviews. The plunger mechanism and filter are made of plastic. When you add hot water to plastic and let it steep for 4 - 5 minutes, it makes the coffee you've brewed taste overwhelmingly like plastic(Not to mention the BPA). Now I'm in no way a fanatical coffee enthusiast with an overly sophisiticated pallete, but I do know what plastic tastes like, especially when it's the only flavor in my coffee. This press should be discontinued, but until that time, do not waste your money or your taste buds."},{"rating":"2","title":"makes great coffee","review":"As a Peace Corps Volunteer I used this coffee press every day (at least once a day) for almost 2 years, and have since passed it on to a friend.

This press is very high quality, light weight and quite beautiful. It makes two large or three regular-size mugs, and keeps the coffee hot. The only potential issue you might have is with the \\"thermal\\" part. It only keeps the coffee hot for a couple hours, so you can't make it in the morning and drink it throughout the whole day. That works fine for us, but if you're looking for a thermal carafe that keeps your drink hot for hours on end, you should probably buy something that does just that job. But for two people who get up at different times, or to put on the table with brunch or dessert, it is quite pretty and works really well. And if you're like me and always breaking your glass carafe, it's also VERY cost effective!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bodum Stainless Steel Thermal Press","review":"A definite MUST-HAVE if you are into coffee. I am a certified barista and this will give you a great cup of coffee as compared to most commercially-prepared coffees sold by the coffee-shop chains especially if the barista in question doesn't know what they are doing which is quite often.Better to make the investment in something like this as opposed to the glass coffee-press although this will not KEEP the coffee HOT indefinitely as per other reviewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pouring is a pain","review":"I got this because I broke a glass press pot on our granite countertop. This one does not break; that is the good news. My problem with this one is that when I pour, I get perhaps 2/3's of the coffee out. Then it stops or pours out very slowly. I tip it back upright, swirl it around, pour again. I repeat that process several times in order to get most of the coffee out. That, as they say, is a pain. I plan on moving back to the glass beaker form and being a little more careful."},{"rating":"2","title":"snazzy little coffee press","review":"I have always enjoyed pressed coffee more than drip.Having also owned a glass press (and broken many of them) this is a welcome product.

Unfortunately, my order was already shipped when a review was posted regarding the plastic parts on the plunger. My Bodum glass French presses have all-stainless steel plunger assemblies, and it never occurred to me that the Bodum stainless steel pot would be any different. Although I did not use the pot, another thing that I didn't like was that the bottom of the 8-cup pot was a smaller diameter than the top, which gave me the feeling that the pot would tip over if accidentally bumped.

Then I realized that a small crack had developed inside near the spout, which allowed water/coffee to get in the hollow space between the two stainless steel walls. Since there is no way to completely drain the liquid out, it has become putrid. Every time I've been pouring coffee recently, a small amount of this nasty-tasting stuff has been pouring out along with it. Not only am I disgusted, but it makes me wonder about the quality/composition of the so-called \\"stainless steel\\", if it can crack/erode so easily. For the price and apparent quality, I really expected it to last longer than the 3 years I've had it. It's always been hand-washed (even though it says it is dishwasher safe) and generally well cared for.

Bodum didn't know either, but informed me that there isn't a warranty on the pots for this amount of time.Although it is stainless steel, my pot broke in a very very short time.

The only reason I didn't give it a fifth star, is that the dvd does not have any extras that you expect from a dvd. It would have been nice to see, different languages, outtakes, commentaries and biogrphies of the actors, and commentaries and biographies of the real family that this series is roughly based on by Earl Hamner. But I still highly recommend this dvd for quality TV watching. Lets hope that when they release season two, they will inclde more extras."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Series, Highly Recommended","review":"Goodnight John-Boy, Goodnight Mary Ellen.

I owned the first episode DVD and enjoyed it. Now for this DVD I love it! The Episodes are at least interesting even though some don't meet my interest. But their the odd one or two. Some of them are Alarming!! For instance when the school is set on fire and well i ain't gonna ruin it for ya. Just thought i'd say that you should buy this Dvd. And also i wish or at least hope that VHQ or Blockbuster get dvd's like this available to rent. I'm tired of the same stuff on their dvd tv show selections. Maybe they don't care...I don't know. Anyways buy this dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"great content but problems with product","review":"We love the program itself. Great family entertainment. However, the set had 2 disk 3's and no disk 1. So we didn't have the first 6 episodes. When we contacted Amazon, they said that they can't replace the disk or even the set.

You want the time spent in front of the television to be productive for them not destructive. The Walton's is one series you can allow children of any age to watch. It is packed with family values. Mom and dad love each other, the children (seven in all) love their parents, Grand ma and Grand pa live with the family and everyone shows them respect. Each individual understands that they must make sacrifices for the good of the family (series takes place during the great depression). Every episode has a positive lesson to teach.

It now has to be thrown away because it is no longer safe to play with. My kids are by no means hard on toys and it has stayed in one location since Christmas. I thought that paying almost $100 for this toy signified a nicer, wooden product that could be packed away and given to grand kids one day, what a joke!

The high chair was a piece of cake to assemble with the holes placed in the correct location. The doors on this bed had holes placed in the opposite direction of what they should have been. Directions were also written very poorly. The finish on the wood was also not very good and uneven. It is not a $50.00 toy. I would never recommend this item to any friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Cute but not Perfect","review":"This crib did take me a little while to assemble!My daughter loves it and I love that it has that handy little cupboard underneath for all of her baby gear. The mobile is actually my biggest issue. You have to hand-thread the stars and hearts onto the mobile and make sure that you are not making the strings too long so that it hits the crib as it cycles around. The plastic clamp to keep the mobile suspended over the crib broke when I was tightening it - so I ended up having to glue it onto the frame.Overall: okay quality but really cute"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"This was a beautiful crip for my daughter. I really like it and so does she. Unfortunately the kids tried to climb into it and there is a small crack in the wood but almost unnoticable.

I got it for my daughter for x-mas and it's already falling apart. The screws don't screw tight, they just spin in the holes.

If you do buy the product, when you put it together, use wood glue from the beginning this way it won't fall apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceeded our expectations","review":"This product exceeded our expectations. It was easy to assemble and made of quality durable wood materials. The crib itself is exceptional. The bedding is nice except the blanket is pretty skimpy. We used the storage area for diapers, blankets and cloths. Our 2 year old loves it. It is perfect size for her to use. We looked everywhere for a crib and this one is by far the best we found and very reasonably priced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes a 4 year old deliriously happy","review":"This was given as a gift to my 4 year old baby doll obsessed daughter and she is in LOVE with it. It took my very handy husband more than 30 minutes to put it together (may have been because she was trying to \\"help\\") and it seems durable enough for the price.

After putting it together I realized it would not stay that way with any child using it. I took the entire cribs apart and using toothpicks and wood glue began to assemble it back together.

Called the company and the parts were shipped and to us in a couple of days. Direction for putting together are pictures. Can be a bit confusing with which way certain pieces are to be facing. Much easier to put together with two people. Backing looks cheap, so not as cute from behind if turning and moving with the wheels. Blanket and pillow are not useful. Very thin. That said, once put together, is very sturdy. Looks adorable and kids love it. Fits a larger doll or two small dolls. Would purchase again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute w/ little hassle","review":"This crib is very cute when assembled. Looks just like photo above. Very realistic to regular baby cribs.The assembly of this was a little challenging at times however, not bad. The mobile is too big and the strings dangle down too far and get stuck on the railing which doesn't allow the mobile to work properly. Since this was our daughters favorite part, my husband cut all the strings shorter and it helped but its still difficult for our daughter to get baby in and out without hitting the mobile strings or bumping and rubbing the mobile against the paint on the crib which will eventually lead to scratching it up. I would recommend not even putting the mobile on to save you future headaches.All in all, this is a great purchase for imaginative play and hours of fun, our daughter LOVES it!! The mobile is the only trouble.

Sufficiently uncovering the nuances of African American women's roles in the struggle for suffrage would be possible only for a highly-trained historian. Unfortunately, Terborg-Penn writes not as an objective historian, but as a woman with strong, personal opinions on her subject.

The story was sad in parts but I particularly liked the manner in which he portrayed the characters in his story, so that you can visually picture them. I didn't read this book straight away as sometimes, a second book from the same author is disappointing. This story is much lighter, along the vein of the 'Sopranos'. Mafia family, good guy and bad guy, until you begin to realise that perhaps the roles should be reversed. Good dialogue, some very funny scenes and moments when you will sit and chuckle to yourself. Thoroughly enjoyed this book even more than the last, and will definitely buy another by this author.

Sometimes Panorama 3 makes errors in it's final results and you would need to do it over again to search for a better result. There later versions of Panorama Maker are out, but for $19.99, Panorama Maker 3 is a steal if your on a budget or starting out in creative Photography. Personaly as a Photographer I'm on a tight budget and if I don't need to get the latest version to do a satisfactory job, then why do so. Panorama Maker 3 is simple enough to figure out, while Panorama Maker 5 and Photoshop are difficult to use if you don't know the software.

I love the several funky numbers such as He Is! The ballads are fabulous! I love that one song where she tells this young girl to get her act together. Few Broadway singers can step off that stage and make a phenomenal album like Heather did. She gives some R&B female artists Faith Evans, Monica, Alicia Keys, and some others a run for their money here! Such fabulous vocals on every song! She even has a song now on the Diary of A Mad Black Woman soundtrack, so she's not finished yet.

If you are lover of music then you will have to add this CD to your collection. Don't miss out on this great CD! The lyrics speak truth and music touches all in [reach]. This cd represents what music should be and something that has not been heard in music industry in a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of a Kind","review":"Heather Headley caught my eye one night while I was watching BET. Her video for I Wish I Wasn't was on and I was stunned by her beautiful voice and elegant image. I love the cd and the whole vibe from it. I must say that I am a slow tempo type person that is why the slow jams are my favorite. I Wish I Wasn't, Full Time, Four Words from Heartbreak, and If It Wasn't for Your Love are my favorites. I also love Why Should I cry. The CD is great and Ms. Headley is awesome. I can't wait for the next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"He Is\\" - Very hot song....otherwise than that...\\"","review":"Okay I really enjoyed Heather Headley's single He Is, and that is pretty much it. I must give this artist credit, the woman can \\"Sang\\" but the production is nothing special and none of her songs have any caughty elements. It's only twelve tracks on it and half of them are on the morbid overdramtic side. In all fairness if you like this style of music you may find this disc to be appealing. Bottom line it's just not making it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Friends and family?","review":"I bought this CD because of the wonderful rewievs. They must be written by friends and family.

I went to Google, typed in \\"Heather Hadley\\", hit Enter and found... nothing! With the exception of one or two web sites referring to he experience in the Lion King, there was nothing about this most amazing artist! There are at least four tracks on this CD that are down right top-10 material. The rest of the tracks, while perhaps not destined for top-10, are simply delightful to listen to. She reminds me of a cleaned-up version of Meshell N'degeocello with much the same funky rhythm but without all the explicit lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"hometown heather","review":"this cd is nice... straight r&b by a very talented young lady. a young lady who is a good person beyond her musical abilities. knowing this woman personally, i can say that i appreciate the maturity of this album cause it represents who she is and always has been as a person. eventhough she has been on broadway and has high accolades from the world, she is still a very humble, down-to-earth person and this shows through her music. a very mature r&b album that i think can be enjoyed by young and old alike...my favorite track is track #4 \\"if i wasn't\\"... jimmy jam and terry lewis wrote a beautiful song which captures the strength of heather's voice...enjoy it for yourself... i know i will...

This CD has earned one of the top spots in my CD collection. I will certainly be looking for Heather's next release."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's Very Unique!!!","review":"Heather Headley's cd is very nice. My cousin and I describe it as grown up music; but not old.Heather is in a class by herself - not with India.Arie or Jill Scott, but they might come to mind.But don't get it twisted this cd is a must have for chill out music like KEM.I wish her more accolades for this piece of music.

This CD is okay, doesn't really make me cringe or anything, but I don't listen to it. The songs aren't that great, and the woman doesn't sing with much emotion or soul - prolly cause she didn't write the stuff and don't really feel it. That's my take anyway. Nothing special here other than a superficially sweet voice.If you want to listen to a soulful female that writes her own stuff - don't buy this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmmm...","review":"I bought the album expecting more classic tunes like \\"I Wish...\\", the reality was very different. A very mixed bag for the most part, she has a lovely voice but there were too may producers and too many experiments going on throughout the album. Really liked the D'Influence tracks, I'm a big fan of their music from back in the day. I still don't know what the direction is for Heather, but I would like to. Maybe next time it will become clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Am So Disappointed.....","review":"I really don't know what to say. Heather Headley is so overrated. I still can't force myself to listen to this cd twice. With all the hype, and the radio promotion, you would think that it would be satisfactory. If there hadn't been so much hype, it might have been tolerable. If you want something worthy of your money, pick up Vivian Green's \\"A Love Story\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Her album is all singles","review":"I wish I wasn't is her only good song on this album. He is isn't even that good of a song. It's okay. The rest of the album sucks. This is an example of an album where an artist puts out a good single knowing they could suck you into it.I wouldn't reccommend this album to anyone, unless they just want it for the singles. And for that, you could download the songs for 99 cents ea. on the internet.Overall, it's a bad album.There's nothing more to really say about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Puerto Rico's Best Bird Guide","review":"This guide is fantastic! It is well organized, easy to use, full of concise, carefully planned information, and absolutely the best bird book I've ever seen. The photos are extremely well done and very helpful. The descriptions are outstanding: accurate, thorough, and interesting. I have many bird-watchers and long time Audubon members staying here at Villas Margarita, not far from the Caribbean National Forest. They all rave about this book and the fine job Mark Oberle did on it. It is worth every penny! Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good Guide","review":"This guide to Puerto Rico's birds is really quite strong and useful, especially when combined with the information on the included CD (which is well organized in both English and Spanish.) Who wouldn't love to just sit at their computer all day and listen to birdsong, at least when they can't be out in the mountains or mangroves of PR?? I found the photographs quite satisfactory for ID purposes (not something to be taken lightly) and the narrative information is very useful.Just one nit to pick: why is the peregrine falcon described as \\"a small hawk\\"?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book for birds of Puerto Rico","review":"15 of us recently spent a week in Puerto Rico and most of us had this book. We found it the best of only two available books. The photographs are good and the information on where to find the birds was very helpful. In most cases there is only one picture of each bird, so identification of juvies and females can be a bit difficult. The other book (sorry, can't remember the name) is out of date, but has color plates (drawings) that show more varieties. For me, an intermediate birder, the book was just right."},{"rating":"2","title":"They work","review":"They came unpackaged and with chinese writing on them.

These did not look like brand-new batteries. Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Passages of India","review":"Unlike India for much of the year, this read can be a bit on the dry side. My only real gripe is Gilmour's failure to adequately address the motivations of those who chose to spend the better part of their lives (often shortened by the decision, at that) in a distant and mostly inhospitable land. The money was good, and undoubtedly the sense of adventure alluring, but there had to be more to it than that. If there were, Gilmour doesn't venture to tell us. Nonetheless, if you are interested in the daily routines and functions of the never-to-be-repeated Indian Civil Service, I doubt that there's a better treatment available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting perspectives on the Raj","review":"This is an account of the Indian Civil Service under the Raj. It provides a mixture of structural analysis and anecdotal accounts of specific individuals. The author makes a good case that the Civilians in the service were hard working and genuinely interested in providing a good and just administration. They were notably incorruptible. They served as a tiny, isolated elite in a vast sub-continent.The seeds of their fall were always present. They wanted to help India and to raise an educated forward-looking Indian middle class. But how could that class, raised to respect justice and democracy, not ultimately reject its mentors?The book is occasionally slow, but generally moves along well and carries it weight."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like this book at all","review":"I found this book to be poorly written, inadequately edited, and virtually impossible to use alone. Chapter three details making a bow and arrow using modern tools and deer sinew. There's no explanation of how to get deer sinew if you don't have the tools to hunt deer. I'm sure there's information in here. . .the chapter on making fire looked like it may be useful if you're willing to drag through the amateur writing. Overall, however, I found the book to be a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good reading","review":"Don't waste your money. The author just rambles on and on.

I'm still looking for that perfect wilderness living book, where the authors don't expect their reader to live quite so radically, but this is a great addition to the bookshelf of the dedicated survivalist.Now, someone write a great survival book that takes into account the fact that we can GLEAN all sorts of tools, utensils, etc., from stuff already existing, and that we DON'T have to reinvent the wheel to live off the land!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This book is a great book for learning primitive skills, I also recommend the second book."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the real deal...all of this stuff works!","review":"I started with the pamphlets, about primitive fire , tanning hides, and \\"Makin Meat\\",they published long before this book. It may not be perfect instruction, but the McPhersons have actually done each skill until they had a repeatable process. How many people do you know who can start a fire by friction...How about three different methods? I tought these skills to myself and later to my two boys who are now grown men with a good grasp on these principles. This is no armchair stuff...it's do it until you get it, kind of stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily the best book on the subject","review":"Hands down this is the best survival book anywhere. The difference between this book and the majority of survival skills books is that most books will talk about why you should make a waterproof shelter and discuss the building of a waterproof shelter, but they won't tell you EXACTLY HOW to build it. If you read this book, you will be able to tan buckskin, construct baskets, make primitive pots, make effective and simple bows, make cordage, construct semi-permanent shelters, flintknapp basic tools, start fires from natural materials and much more.This book is not about \\"surviving,\\" rather it's about \\"thriving\\" in a wilderness situation. The McPhersons have written the best and easiest to read book you can find anywhere.We liked this book so much we made it the book of the month at RFS Online for August 1999."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, Great step by step, Great buy","review":"Being a female hunting and fishing guide, I come across alot of wannabes in the field.. this book is exceptional.

This was their first album, a stripped down version of their later sound with just a jazz piano, a Brazilian rhythm section, and some wonderful voices. Mendes was a jazz musician when he conceived of this album, and it makes no concession to rock and roll other than a cover of \\"Daytripper.\\" It's firmly rooted in the pop tradition right down to the cool album cover, in which the musicians wear suits and ties in a jungle setting.Special favorites are \\"The Joker,\\" a sultry version of Henry Mancini's \\"Slow Hot Wind\\" and the driving \\"Berimbau\\" which starts strong and only picks up the pace. This album is like a cool breath of fresh air. You'll never get tired of listening to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexy, sophisticated seduction!","review":"This album is one of my top three favourite albums of all time! It combines the fabulous fun of Mas Que Nada with the sultry sexiness of A Slow Hot Wind and the passionate pathos of The Joker (is me)! If you have to buy one Bossa Nova record this is the one. All songs are excellent but apart from the aforementioned three check out the swinging Daytripper - amazingly enough Sergio and the Gang's cover is BETTER than the Beatles original. Rio in 1966 must have been one hell of a town!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Title","review":"If you are looking for a book with insight as to actual response and mitigation for Disasters this is not your book. Dr. Hartman is well versed in City and Regional Planning (with a degree from Harvard) and years of real experience in this area. Dr. Hartman is also an accomplished author, including some other works that have provoked controversy. However, the title of this book is a little misleading. This is more of an examination of the social-political issues surrounding the Katrina event in New Orleans, with a decidedly singular point of view. If you are interested in the debate regarding social justice it will be worth the read.

The kind of timbral subtlety that you get in that music is absent here.There is an excitement to some of the sonatas with their tangles and swirls of notes. There is a nice, atmospheric feel to \\"Perduto in una città d'Acque\\" and \\"Anamorfosi\\" is practically quaint. Lacking is the risky sense of adventure and tension which informs so much of Sciarrino's other work. I just don't think the man has much to say with the piano.I suppose the composer likes the way that Damerini plays, since he has written a number of these pieces for the pianist. I find his tone strident and lacking depth. He can sound plenty loud and fast but so can a jackhammer.If you are interested in Sciarrino, I'd say look elsewhere first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caught on FIRE last night!!","review":"Ok, so the tv is 11 years old and I did not buy it on Amazon..

The included CD contains tracks which are a nice addition to a casual listening library, and also assist a guitarist in emulating the expression that Williams conveys with each piece. In the sheet music, the tabulature that accompanies the classical notation is also quite useful. The book is peppered with anecdotes from Williams' career, providing additional insight into the circumstances and motivation behind each piece. These are helpful in understanding Williams' mind-set and intent for each piece.The only major criticism I have of the item actually concerns its binding. Most guitarists will want the sheet music to lie open flat on a bench or music stand. However, when I first opened the book fully to make it lie flat, several of the pages of sheet music came loose. Obviously, I can still play the music, but the book itself now lacks a certain visual appeal."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"This book helped me to finally learn the elusive \\"Classical Gas\\".

The key point that Shulman misses (and in fact I can find no mention of in his book) is that the issuance of a patent gives a TEMPORARY monopoly. From Shulman's exposition, one would think that the patenting process gives some kind of permanent hold on some idea. In fact, quite the opposite is true. Issuance of a patent REQUIRES that the full details of the invention be published, and at the end of the term of the patent (now 17 years), the rights to said idea enter the public domain. Increased restrictions on patenting will, in fact, take us back to the old days of trade secrets, notebooks written in code, and will actually IMPEDE the advance of technology.

It is both simplistic and complicated. The very style from which she writes reflects the combining of opposites and the power and imminent strength behind doing just that. If you believe that strong women should NOT use feminine sexuality to their advantage then you have bought into all of the propaganda that has been used to CONTROL women for the last few thousand years. If you believe that true femininity is an innate strength and a power stronger than any other, then you will just love the way this author lays it all out on the line for practical application amidst life's little roadblocks.

Any woman who dares to empower herself should read this. The notion of the Princessa is nicely presented over the contexual framework of the Prince but not watered down. This literary jewel stands on its own merits. The format of the book utilizes the notion of strategy, tactics and weapons as central themes ( chapters ) while subsuming critical ideas and actions within those themes; certainly not a soft focus. The notes,and selected bibliography included suggests a scholarly focus, and lends credibility, and validity to the publication.

Despite the title and sales pitch, there is NO ... that is ZERO ... useful information.The vagueness and uselessness is occasionally livened up by total idiocy. For example, the author admires some of the worst dirtbags in history. The author also has some other bizarre ideas, for example the notion that Jacqueline Kennedy stayed slim by pigging out.The author works in a publishing company.

A great book to read before tackling the much more complex presentations of the \\"heavyweight\\" communications books such as Sklar and Proakis. An excellent senior level or first year graduate text, though some professors would probably not prefer its simplified presentation at the graduate level.

Daddy, look at that big ugly alligator...","review":"\\"Daddy, look at that big ugly alligator.\\", \\"That reminds me, I gotta call your moma tonight.\\" THIS MOVIE IS FUNNY!!!The first thing I noticed about SMOKEY and the BANDIT 2 was the quality of the digital transfer to DVD. It is done so well, I felt like I was watching a movie made a year ago(aside the old cars and clothes).I'm 36 and this movie brought back tons of memories. \\"Son, why isn't your gun loaded?\\", \\"It's too heavy when I put bullets in it, Daddy.\\" This movie is full of hilarious one liners. I found myself to be in a great mood after watching this movie. There's a semi-sentimental tone that is, at times alittle cheesy but still, touching and not too overboard.Everyone is fantastic in this movie. Even the gas station attendant is brilliantly funny. I really can't think of one negative thing to say about SB2.It's as good, if not better than, the first BANDIT. I give it 2 thumbs up and a MUST SEE for anyone who loves to laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame ! killed the spirit of the bandit.","review":"Sorry Folks but...They strayed from the formula and paid the price! This was lame! i loved sb1,it rocked,it was fast paced and exciting, the characters were bigger than life, the music had a theme and rhythm and the cars were loud and fast. In SB2 They didnt want to make this film ,it shows. The cars were slow,action was dull. Bo and Frog had no chemistry, even as actors! The story boring- The cars even looked weird. The music had no feel. Jokes were old, and the bandit portrayed as a \\"has been\\" and not liked very much! Even Cletus seemed like he was a puppet. No heart in this one! Some films shouldnt have a number2 or sequel. They should have rolled the dice and went to Boston for Chowder. They slowed the chase and killed the spirit of the bandit. The only highlight was that Sally Field looks amazingly beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"West Bound and WAY Down","review":"Burt Reynolds and director Hal Needham should have ended their stunt-filled collaboration after \\"Hooper.\\" Instead, they churned out \\"Smokey and the Bandit II\\" (1980) - a mostly joyless sequel to the high-spirited original.

Needham stages a lavish demolition-derby climax, but only Gleason appears to be having fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"ALRIGHT I GUESS","review":"The first movie is much better this was alright not as bad as the third one they made, Its kind of stale from the first one this time instead of beer they are transporting a pregnant elephant. the music is pretty good but they can never redo the first one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very kewl and gr8!","review":"This is a very good movie!

It details several MIB encounters w/the ultimately hilarious account the very last in the book. There are so many lies made public on the matter not only by the government but other promoters as well. You have to do your research and read several different authors. I purchased two MIB books. I had a lot of laughs out of this one. It is very entertaining reading. Just to point out--- I heard on talk radio that one ET survived Roswell and went on to live w/a single high ranking officer; that ET loved strawberry ice cream. However autopsy results showed ET did not share the same biological make up as humans. He had no blood, no reproductive organs, no stomach..... You cannot believe everything you read.

You were very fortunate because there was a local band, like none other, who absolutely dominated the scene. They were a band called \\"Spitkiss\\". One of the greatest treats I had growing up a teenager in the bay area a that time was seeing this band perform live on multiple occasions. Their live shows and their stage presence were so e \\"Violence is Golden\\" was their second and final full length album. Their first full length album was called \\"Not for Human Consumption\\". Both albums are phenomenal and I highly recommended anyone who is into these music genres to purchase these albums. Their first album is extremely rare to find so if you find it feel blessed as only a few TLFs out there still own it. Since their second album is easy to purchase through Amazon you have no excuse not to hear them.

Relatively light at about six ounces. And t is, used reasonably, sturdy.The arrangement of the legs is unique. On is fixed with the other two movable. The legs must be fully spread if you want the tripod to be stable. For some reason, the manufacturer decided on four extendable sections. You can - if you are careful to fully spread the legs - use the tripod with the legs at each of their intermediate positions. I tested it with a Canon S%, which weighs just shy of a pound, and lighter cameras. With the legs fully spread, the VS55 provides a very stable and sturdy camera platform.For the price, you can't beat this little hummer.

It is not built to be worn by a toddler, it isn't an easy on/off thing - how are they gonna go to the bathroom? No tail, basically just a thin brown cloth body suit thing with a cheesy face mask (with no eyeholes, designed to be worn above the eyes).Save your money and draw a mask on cardboard and put your kid in a brown sweatsuit - that's be more durable, and realistic, than what I received."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early \\"chick lit\\"","review":"I enjoyed the book. I think it has a \\"mature chick lit\\" theme. I do find the comments in the reviews, about how now Charleen would be given Prozac and sent on her way, both insulting and untrue. It is insulting from the standpoint that most competent doctors do not believe medication treats social issues and existential angst. I find it untrue in that Charleen does not appear depressed or anxious; she seems to be redefining herself after her life has been turned upside down, and it takes going back to where she started to find out how far she has come, and how strong and independent she is now. The twists and turns weren't hard to figure out, but didn't seem forced or contrived. I enjoyed the novel.

It was not any sort of continuation of MZB's Avalon stories, nor were most of them connected to Avalon's legend in any way.

This is generally regarded as the very first one. I haven't seen it personally, but it looks great. Arrive promptly and in tact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stylish Early Horror","review":"Definitely one for the aficionado of quality horror films rather than the casual viewer. As a movie from the early-thirties, one has to accept the nature of early 'talkies' in order to appreciate its qualities. Within this context, it's entertaining and often very beautiful, with creative camera angles and elaborate sets (many left over from Dracula). A young couple, about to be married, arrive in Haiti (why they chose to come to Haiti is any body's guess) and are invited by a landed aristocrat to hold their wedding in his mansion. The nobleman, however, has designs on the young bride and, in his desperation, turns to a sugar plantation owner (played by Lugosi) named 'Murder' (not exactly subtle) for help. Murder's 'muscle' who accompany him, like the workforce at his plantation, are all 'Zombies', so it's not hard to guess how Murder will help the aristocrat impose his will on the girl. But Murder has also taken a liking to the young woman..."},{"rating":"1","title":"its missing something","review":"ok i love white zombie and all however this copy from this exact company isnt good at all ,, teh sound is off and alot softer ,, the drums int eh begginign should thump really loud.

White Zombie has never looked better. The special features are also excellent. No criticisms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of atmosphere","review":"A classic movie made on a shoestring. Lugosi is in one of his most chilling portrayals. There is no sympathy generated for Murder LeGrande, the character he portrays. The character is cold and unreal, and Lugosi plays it to the hilt. There is a scene where Lugosi picks up a glass of wine where his hand completely surrounds the top of the glass like a huge spider!Even though it's not a movie made with a big budget (or maybe because of that fact) the film has great atmosphere. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"White Zombie-The First Zombie Film?","review":"Arguably the FIRST \\"Zombie\\" film, WHITE ZOMBIE is an unheralded classic. Bela Lugosi turns in one of his most menacing & effective performances in this film as the malevolent Murder Legendre. It's too bad that Lugosi's legacy is forever linked to DRACULA when he gave an equally compelling performance in this classic.The zombies looked very menacing for its time. And this movie follows the legend of the zombie more closely than later on incantations made popular by George Romero's classic NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1968). The next closest interpretation of the zombie legend was probably Jacques Tourneur's masterpiece I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE (1943) but that's another story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great satire of french society","review":"This movie is packaged as a silly insight into french society during the 1970s, but it does more than that. It offers a critique of the assumptions that society relied upon to treat women in the manner they did. In doing so, the movie uses a light hearted script and excellent cast to weave the tale of a poor housewife who is not taken seriously by anyone, but her son and one time lover. The movie reveals how she fights these assumptions and is able to overcome the low expectations people place upon her. But it does not do it too seriously and still makes its point. All in all, a very good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat Emptor","review":"This copy did not contain \\"Making of..\\" which does exist on the local library's copy.

But things are about to change when strike action hits the factory and Madame Pujol steps up to take charge of the ailing umbrella business. She finds an unlikely ally in the communist mayor Babin played by the excellent Gerard Depardieu.This gentle, intelligent comedy has a lightness of being and the period detail works beautifully throughout as does the highly accomplished cast who work well together with Deneuve shining brightly among them.If you are looking for a french farce with feeling, look no further.

I checked on Amazon and found it for rent. We streamed it to our laptop and watched it on our flatscreen TV with an HDMI hook-up. The beginning started out blurry but it cleared almost immediately and was so clear that it was possible to read the very small credits at the end of the film. The film streamed seamlessly, although we never tried to pause and resume it. The story was very enjoyable. Catherine Deneuve was gorgeous, as usual and the French subtitles were reasonably easy to read.

This author has all the facts, knows how to write, has picked a new, interesting venue; the adventures of a game warden. But the writing is without flavor. What this book lacks are the answers to two questions: What is it like? - and - What does it mean? What is it like to be in \\"Bear country?\\" Where is the love or regard for the animals being killed? What is important and personal about doing the game warden's job? There is little introspection from the hero. The prose just goes on and on; facts and more facts, characters and more characters - without \\"juice\\" and without real life.

Within a mere 124 pages, the author explains in detail the processes by which any would-be Alchemist may create herbal elixers. The process is simple and can be learned quickly and inexpensively. Mastering the Great Art that is Alchemy, however, takes significantly longer (I myself have been practicing for many years and still have not touched its surface). Frater Albertus does not, thankfully, fall into a deep and penatrating discussion of each elixer and its properties(of which there would be thousands), but rather explains how to create them and leaves the aspiring Alchemist to practice, study, ponder and create. In doing so, he insures that those who would like to venture into the Great Art have the capacity to learn it for themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic outline of a fascinating art.","review":"I saw this in a bookstore and, knowing little of alchemy, bought it.

As usual, Nance has documented the storyline with his vast aviation knowledge and, in this book, that is plenty scary. Just an absolutely wonderful, exciting, action packed read. I highly recommend this to all your readers who like adventure. It is definitely thought-provoking and unfortunately plausible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great adventure","review":"See storyline above.John J Nance's newest novel is not only suspenseful but invigorating and downright addicting. This is one of his best adventures to date. Character driven non-stop suspense will keep you from putting this one down (I know that's a cliché but this book proves it). A well rounded thriller from an author one soon expects to see on the bestseller lists.If you've ever flown, this will hit home.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much for subtlety","review":"In his zest to make the airline in this book as detestable as possible, Nance has fashioned a company that is so universally infuriating that he destroys any believeability in this novel. I fly relatively often and have seen poor airline behavior, but the consistency of the antipathy towards passengers and between employees that Nance describes is just ridiculous and completely uncredible. This novel would have been less heavy handed in its approach to the airline, then it would have been less humorous and more foreboding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but ultimately choppy and wooden","review":"Interesting premise, but Nance unfortunately writes his characters as black or white - either poor victims or outrageously mean and nasty airline employees, and neither rings true. The novel almost reads like a parable masquerading as an act of fiction, but the dialog is so choppy and repeats so often (if you had a nickel for everytime a character says \\"Sorry?\\" in response to another character you'd probably equal Nance's royalties from this book) that this novel ultimately lands with a thud. If you don't mind overlooking such flaws then go ahead and enjoy yourself, but I really expected a lot more. I actually thought the first chapter was pretty well written, which is why I bought this in an airport, but as soon as I dug into it I realized the rest of the novel from a stylistic perspective quickly goes downhill. Plot is interesting though."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Comedy?","review":"The reviewer who said that the only way this could be made into a movie was if it were a comedy featuring Leslie Nielsen hit the nail on the head.This incredibly silly book goes from bad to worse with cartoon villains who are so over the top I busted out laughing during moments of what were supposed to be high tension.I still can't decide who was funnier, the evil stewardess from hell or the looney doctor who tries to comandeer the airplane...but then again, if you appreciate high comedy, the moronic pilot was right up there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating!","review":"Jack Finney's short stories on time and the characters that occupy it are a fascinating pleasure. Savor each one as the gift that it is, and take the journey through time. I couldn't put it down - and think of it often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe just not for me","review":"I thought the short stories would be fun, but it really wasn't for me. Not many of the stories were that good and was hoping for more stories with time travel (not the case). Seems there were about 20 short stories in the book and I only thought about 5 of them were great, the rest were average and I just skimmed through them."},{"rating":"2","title":"good stuff","review":"Honestly the weakest song on this is sweetheart like you and even then its not a bad song, I mean a sweetheart like YOU being here? What the hell am I doing here? But this album rocks especially the SACD- hybrid version. Seems like the most beutiful girl to ever crawl across cut glass to make a deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Infidels","review":"Infidels is a good album but not his best. It was produced as a collobartion between Mark Knopfler and Dylan. Then one would have expected it to be a tremendus recording. It is not bad by any means but not amazing by any means which is a shame. If one compares this would a classic like Highway 61 Revisited, it feels a bit flat. Still Dylan is an accomplished lyricist and writes several great tracks. For instance, one track that I particularly like is License to Kill. The book-let is a drab and to be frank it is atrocious. The drawing on the back looks shoddy and must have been drawn by a friend since otherwise Dylan should ask for his money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"One record sounds like a reworked cover for George Harrison's song","review":"Listening to I and I on Dylan's 1983 original columbia album I hear the same tune as george harrison's song I me mine composed back in 1969 for the Get back project as heard on anthology 3 album. This proves to me the superior standing of each Beatle for the second half of the 20th century. The Beatles always credited their covers whether it was the sherelles or elvis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely underrated","review":"Yes, it's a shame about all the reported omissions from this album. Still, rather than focus on what it could have been, people should appreciate \\"Infidels\\" for what it is: It's Bob Dylan's best work during the past two decades. If there's ever been a more evocative song than \\"Jokerman,\\" I'm not aware of it. The guitar work thoughout is exceptional, especially on \\"Man of Peace.\\" \\"Sweetheart Like You\\" is heartbreaking, \\"Union Sundown\\" is clever in its pointedness (and ever on-the-mark, almost 20 years and one NAFTA agreement later). \\"Don't Fall Apart on Me Tonight,\\" as the closing song, is a sweet and hopeful cleanser to all the doubt and anger that carries every other song before it. No, not every track belongs on a \\"greatest hits\\" collection -- but I would argue that \\"Infidels\\" is filler-free, and that it's stood the test of time. \\"Infidels\\" is perfectly fair answer to the question: What's the most underrated album of all-time?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Going Strong","review":"Bob Dylan is the song writer with chameleon DNA. In this enigmatic collection one song stands out in light of his musical/spiritual (?) conversion from Judaism and later back to it. His support of the State of Israel in \\"Neighborhood Bully\\" is quite heart warming. Way to go Bobby Zimmerman!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated","review":"I like this album a lot. It's not perfect, but who cares? There's good stuff on this album, and lots of it. Jokerman and Sweetheart Like You are widely considered to be the high points of the album, and you won't hear any argument from me; the pro-Israel Neighborhood Bully (all-too-obvious lyrics aside, it's a rockin' tune); I And I and especially Don't Fall Apart On Me Tonight (the latter being my second-favorite on the album, behind Jokerman) are lesser-known, but might end up on your Dylan favorites list sometimes. Union Sundown; License to Kill and Man of Peace are fillers, but can be ignored, and Bob's voice is arguably at its peak. Shame nobody thought of adding Blind Willie McTell, Dylan's best song of the '80's, because that would've made this album even better."},{"rating":"1","title":"let's be honest","review":"wow - reading the reviews here it strikes me that the forum is populated only by Dylan obsessives. To me this is a musically average album with the odd beautiful song among many - well - just average compositions.Sweetheart Like You is beautiful but don't songs like Union Sundown sound as clumsy as any eighties songs with contemporary political messages?Why can't dylan lovers simply acknowlegde he did good bad and average work and this is decidedly in the middle to latter category."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it just for I and I","review":"Thats right one song makes the album. I am telling you now there is no more mature love song recorded by anybody anywhere. I will also say that \\"License to Kill\\" is a raw and straight forward look at the world, you wont be the same afterward. \\"Joker Man\\" is the first track and you will know you are in for something great from there. If you can get the unrealsed stuff that should have been on this album you get a better view of what Bob had in mind, but this album will be remembered as great long after you and I are gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"They can't all be classics.","review":"The first time I heard a track from the album was when a friend played \\"Don't Fall Apart on Me Tonight\\" on acoustic guitar. I fell in love with the mood set by the song and bought the CD (after many previous Dylan purchases) believing the song would be joined by others of similar emotive quality. Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the album. I appreciate that Dylan was making social observations on other tracks (although many were too subtle for this mid-twenties fan) but the songs do not contain the folk starkness of his early albums nor the burning rock melodies of other work. Someone has to note that this album lacks the stripped-down honesty and the ear-cathing riffs that make Dylan special. Most reading this review will be looking for compliments for the album, but (especially newer fans) I recommend picking a different album. Try the Live '66 concert and the Free Wheeling Bob Dylan for intimate performances)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who Is This Jokerman ?","review":"Mark Knoffler returned on this 1983 album 4 years after playing on on Dylan's first Gospel album, Slow Train Coming.For me the best are first rate and the rest not memorable.What Jokerman is all about is unclear to me, but it just flows with the Dylan wordplay and excellent production standards, I just love it.Sweetheart Like You is a slower number which goes down well with me, License To Kill is another winner and finally I And I, Dylan puts in another class performance.In 1984 I saw an outdoor Dylan concert at Wembley Stadium in London, Santana was the main support act, Van Morrison and Eric Clapton made cameo appearances.If he is the Jokerman, he normally has the last laugh !"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great album, could have been one of his greatest","review":"If anyone from Columbia Records is reading this PLEASE listen! You recently re-mixed and re-released Street Legal. With Infidels, you have *much* better material to work with, and the chance to release one of BD's greatest albums. Here's all you need to do:1) Re-mix the album so that Jokerman (one of his greatest songs ever), Sweetheart, I and I, etc. have better sound quality than the original release2) Add the amazing songs that were inexplicably left off the original release: Foot of Pride, Blind Willie McTell, Someone's Got a Hold of My Heart, and Lord Protect My Child3) I also understand there was a great song he did a great song called \\"Julius and Ethel\\" about the Rosenbergs -- let's hear it!4) Release the album, then sit back and read the outstanding critical reviews, and watch the sales go through the roof!Please, drop me a line if you have any questions..."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Dylan's most underrated albums...","review":"You will never see Infidels listed among Dylan's classics which is a shame. Lyrically and vocally this is one of Dylan's hardest hitting albums. Jokerman, License to Kill, Man of Peace, Neighborhood Bully and Union Sundown all take aim at corrosive social problems. Unlike many political protest songs, the songs on Infidels are just as relevant now as when they were written. Sweetheart Like You and I and I are among Dylan's best ballads.So why only four stars? Well, frankly the overproduction takes a lot of the bite out of Neighborhood Bully, Man of Peace and Union Sundown. But, pretty much every album ever released has flaws. So if you like Dylan, but do not have this album, get it now. If you are a neophyte, get Blood on the Tracks, Blonde on Blonde, Highway 61 or any of his masterpieces. Then purchase Infidels, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good place to start","review":"This is a painfully average Dylan album. If you're new or fairly new to the great man, this is no place to start. There's one great song - Jokerman. Aside from that there are are 2 or 3 others that are worth listening to a few times: Sweetheart Like You, License to Kill and Don't Fall Apart On Me Tonight. The rest is mediocre and second rate. If you're already familiar with a dozen of his classic and near-classic albums and want to fill in the gaps, then you should look into it. Non-essential Bob, this one. If you're looking for an introduction to 80s Bob, start with the much superior (but short of classic) No Mercy from 1989."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopeless TV...or maybe its just my set","review":"Bought this TV after a great many days of pondering and reviewing various brands and styles. Put my bet on Sony's name and all the good praise given to this model.Exactly one year after I bought it, the problems started outta nowhere. I switched on the TV one fine morning to find the entire screen having a purple haze and pink diagonal lines. Sent it for repair. Though they repaired it, but I think it lost the sharpness/clarity. THen the next problem started where the TV blacks out every minute or so. Sent it again for repair. They fixed it, but now the purple haze is back again. The TV has been out for about 2 months now and Im living on a loaner. Seriously planning to buy another one. Would never buy a Sony Wega again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I recently bought this TV, and 2 days later I'm returning it","review":"This TV has a very good picture for regular TV, and composite inputs. But, I did not buy it to watch regular cable TV, or to watch old VHS tapes. I bought this TV because I wanted a pretty high end, normal TV with component inputs to play my Xbox on.I was very displeased to find that when using component inputs and playing the Xbox, numerous wave-like distortion lines appeared over the picture, but when I removed the component cables from the TV, they dissapeared. After having browsed through some online forums, I found that many people have had compatability issues with Sony TV's and the Xbox. If you plan on using the Xbox with component inputs (or maybe even composite) stay away from this TV, because it will end up dissapointing you as far as picture quality is concerned. The audio of a TV is trivial to me, because I usually mute the TV sound when I'm using my surround system (which is often)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent flat-screen TV","review":"Having read a number of glowing reviews, I was not disappointed by my new Sony Wega - this TV is awesome. I compared a number of 27\\" flat screen TVs from Toshiba, Panasonic, Philips, Samsung, & Sony. Of the five, I found the Sony to have the clearest and most vibrant picture. Also, only the Sony and the Samsung have the 16:9 picture modes to display widescreen films with the highest resolution. Digital cable (thru composite video input) looks significantly sharper and more brighter than my old TV and DVDs w/ component video input look stellar. I also have PS2 and games look awesome on the Wega."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect book for homeschooling","review":"After looking at a lot of geology books that throw questionable \\"theories\\" as established truth, I discovered this book and was blessed to see that it states the actual facts known about geology as well as the limitations to what we really know. This book is from the Christian based perspective, and allows the reader to draw their own conclusions based on the actual facts known about geological formations and historical data rather than the fanciful imaginings of scientists who change the \\"facts\\" they claim are established every couple of years. It is refreshing to see scientific principles used in this study of geology instead of opinion.The book is set up with 8 chapters, with lots of pictures and examples, perfect for children to learn all about geology and the formation of rocks based on scientific truth rather than the fiction that is taught in public schools today as fact. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Science, as hobbled by religion","review":"If you are looking for \\"bias-free\\" textbooks, start by being honest about your own bias.

Both cds deserve 5 stars by the way.Chico Canta was originally to be called Chico Canta Calabar, with a cover which showed the word Calabar scrawled in freshly dripping paint on a wall, but this would have run foul of the censorship then imposed by the military dictatorship in Brasil, and the cover image and title were changed to what you see here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique","review":"My daughter collects bouncy balls.

But every time I log on to Amazon.com she has a new album out. Javier Solis was bigger than Selena and he also died while on top and not even his death was exploited like Selena's.

I'm a fan of her rancheras, none of which ever make it to these new releases. Which is a shame, because there was more to Selena than cumbias and all these pop remixes. I think the complaints about there being so many \\"new\\" albums without any actual new songs are justifiable. And I don't believe that anyone who has given this CD 5 stars was a fan when she was alive. You would think she was bigger than Elvis by reading some of these reviews. Selena came to Tucson for a concert back in '94 and only about a hundred people showed up.

Interesting factoids about Nell's jewelry, furniture, etc.Yeah, right. A bit dry."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my $18.95 back","review":"Amazon needs to update its rating system to include minus stars for books like this. How this stinker ever got published is a mystery to me. Walker cobbles his narrative together from a handful of secondary sources (Bruce Catton, D. S. Freeman, Gregory Urwin), has apparently never heard of the \\"Official Records\\" or regimental histories or \\"Gettysburg Magazine\\", spends 11 pages in a confused and and mostly wrong retelling of his \\"subject\\", and sets up this chapter with 125 pages of an irrelevant (and often wrong) summary of Lee's command of the Army of Northern Virginia. He knows just about nothing of the Civil War and detracts, rather than adds to the literature of the conflict. As a retired Army officer and professional historian I symbolically throw my hands skywards in dispair."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Joke","review":"This is the absolute worst book I've ever read. Not just the worst Civil War book, the worst book, period. The author devotes 11 measley pages to the actual engagement referred to in the title. The editing is so sloppy, every few pages are typos. The maps offered in the book are useless. No orientations to North, no scales, lacking in all detail. The most upsetting thing is the lack of documentation. It was almost as if this guy saw the movie and used that as the outline of his book. He offered very little in the way of proof to any of his assertations. The worst thing is, this guy was an officer in the Army. As an officer myself, I'm extremely disappointed in my peer. Do not waste your time with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Plumbed Knight","review":"The Plumbed Knight. Yes, you read it correctly! Although I am certain that COL Walker wrote \\"plumed\\", the editor hired by the publisher was apparently not familiar with the subject (How can an editor not be familiar with the subject? This is the publishing business, isn't it?) and therefore changed \\"plumed\\" to \\"plumbed\\". Twice. Or perhaps the word processing software did it, and nobody caught it. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading","review":"This subject is in need of serious study but Walker doesn't provide it. Nothing at Gettysburg makes any sense if \\"Picket's Charge\\" is all that Lee could think to do on the third day. The CSA cavalry is usually dismissed because of Stuart's trip around the east side of the Army of the Potomac. Given Lee's lack of documentation for his decisions it is easy to miss the long move that Stuart made to get east of the battle where Pleasonton sent Custer in to stop him. Had Custer not aggressively pitched in and kept Stuart out of the main battle, the end might have been much different.Walker however does not provide good sources for his judgements. For example, no citation is offered for research into the Official Records of the Rebellion. Citation of Ambrose's modern-biased version of Custer's battles indicates that even that source wasn't fully understood."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Civil War","review":"This item was sourced then cancelled and re-ordered.

She was sincerely nice, and I was honored to meet this person who survived such an unbelievable ordeal. However, when I read the book, I felt disappointed (as an editor) by the writing and lack of editing. A powerful story that could have become a huge success as a book was instead relegated to mediocrity due to no editorial direction. I had seen so many reviews of the book prior to BEA; if only the publisher had put as much effort into the book itself as it did into the marketing plan. If you are a quick reader and a backpacker, I still recommend reading the book for the power of Amy's experience. The story gets lost in the middle, however, and the details of her recovery in the hospital are too, too much, while the details of her private life get glossed over and leave the reader confused."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could benefit from another edit...","review":"While we can all agree that \\"Angels in the Wilderness\\" is the tale of the author's heroic tenacity and the equally heroic response of strangers and friends alike, I cannot agree that it is an interesting read.I too was hooked from the first page. Unfortunately, after the third page, the author leaves her hook (the fall and stunning injury) and instead concentrates on her life history and personal philosophy. This goes on far too long, forcing me to continually fight to keep reading. My interest only resurfaced with chapter 17 and the beginning of Amy's rescue.There is hope. Honestly, there is a very good story here. If the author were to work with an editor to trim the fat from this amazing tale, it could become a story for any reader. As is, it may appeal only to diehard solo hikers and those who know Amy personally.Meanwhile, I look forward to the next edition and continue to pull for Amy's continued recovery.Keep fighting Amy:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"for hardcore fans only","review":"This video is really just a poorly filmed interview with Abbie in some deserted building. It is of little interest, and not very informative. For a harcore Abbie fan it is of some small importance because it is the first interview he held after he came out of hiding.

There is no explanation about how she manages to hook the Harvard Law guy -- in real life he'd run fast from this girl. She appears to be unlikeable and self-absorbed; guess what, author, only pretty and hot gets you nowhere.No romance here.

The picture looks great, but the picture for this type of TV's future looks dim. LCD flat screen sets and Plasma sets are taking over the market. LCD and Plasma sets are priced out of range for the average person so I don't get the overnight transition and logic to force you to buy them.

I recommend this set to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book!","review":"This book is a fabulous treasury of traditional patterns with its colorful pictures. All techniques are covered in detail with drawn illustrations. This is, however, by no means a pattern book for a beginner. To construct a certain mitten, the techniques and patterns must be picked out from different parts of the book and put together. On the practical side, the binding of the book could be better; mine is already falling apart and loosing pages after a couple of weeks of use. Nevertheless, I'm very satisfied with the purchase, and will make many of the mittens in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book!","review":"I just recently learned how rewarding it is to make mittens, and this was the first book that I bought to fuel my obsession. The charts are clear, and there are so many wonderful photographs that it reminds me of an art book. Usually, I am not a fan of reading the history behind things (yeah, that makes me a little shallow but there you go) but the author of this book did such a wonderful job of briefly describing what I can only assume is a rich history behind the role that mittens play in the culture of Latvia.Although I would be hesitant to say this is a wonderful beginner's book, I consider myself a beginner at not only mittens but fair isle/color work and this book has proved to be an invaluable reference since she takes the time to write out directions for some of the mittens (so you don't have to rely specifically on the graphs).Lastly, I have learned many new techniques and feel as though this book has not only helped my \\"mitten making\\" but has increased my skill as a knitter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Colorful patterns and going back into print!","review":"Latvian mittens are colorful and have patterns a bit like Fairisle or Norwegian style color knitting. They often have fringed or scalloped edges.This book has many color photos of amazing patterns to knit. This edition is out of print and a new one is being published, with an expanded set of patterns and photos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Latvian Mittens for the experienced knitter","review":"This is not an expensive coffee table production that will impress with it's arty photography. This paperback impresses with the excellent research of patterns and their cultural traditions. Colour photographs give a good idea of possible colour combinations. The designs are presented in form of graphs rather than written description, which makes the following of a pattern totally easy. It is a very good and comprehensive collection of the mittens of Latvia."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"This book is a huge disappointment. Great photographs suggest there will be patterns for them. But many have only partial patterns with graphs for the body but not the cuff of a mitten. Photos are labeled with graph numbers that don't even exist in the book. It may all be fine for very experienced knitters who can design their own patterns and are only looking for a jumping off point, but anyone expecting complete knitting patterns had best look somewhere else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Latvian Mittens","review":"This is an excellent book which I'd been coveting for some time. Its well written and the instructions are clear although I don't really see the point of the book being written half in english and half in Lativian. The charts are also excellent and let you make up your own combination of patterns. If you've got vision problems, or like to be able to knit without having the chart pressed to your nose then it would be better to enlarge the charts. Its a very inspiring book and everyone I know will be getting mittens for their Christmas this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book No Where To Be Seen","review":"I also have been waiting for my Latvian Mittens book since Nov. 19 /06.

It's packed to the brim with illustrations, patterns and full colour photos of different Latvian mittens. It also contains detailed and helpful techniques, with illustrations to make it even more understandable.This is the book for new knitters as well as experienced knitters, for those that like following a pattern and those who want inspiration to make their own.This is the best book of knitting patterns I've got in my shelf!(And if you're not sure; this book is in English.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful ethnic mittens with a little history","review":"I was originally intrigued by the cover while looking for some ethnic mittens to knit. This book certainly delivers, having some wonderful examples of a variety of mittens with a plethora of color plate examples and ample-sized charts to follow. In addition, the book offers an interesting look into the four regions of Latvia and the variations found within those regions for mitten designs and colors. The patterns are easily followed as well as the techniques and meanings of each of the regional patterns.

I went looking for it at a local bookstore after discovering it here on amazon and reading the great reviews - we are both lovers of Tollkien's works. My first reaction was - 'gee, its tiny' - being only slightly bigger than a pocket size book. Then I looked more closely. A hardcover, yes, but nothing spectacular in quality. The pictures are sweet, light and airy, but I expected more. And as for the verse - I also expected there to be more. It is well written, but very brief. Four brief lines of verse on each right-hand page, while the page on the left was an illustration. I didn't stand there and count lines of text, but since there are maybe 24 pages in the book total, that would make it 12 pages of text or 48 short lines of verse in the whole book. It could have been printed on one or two pages and still been surrounded by lovely illustrations.It's just not worth the money in my book - no pun intended."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say, I'm a fan","review":"I came across this book only recently and prior to that never knew it existed.

It was nothing short of fantastic. As their final encore, they played a twenty-minute piece that made their previous explorations into sonic terror sound like nursery rhymes. This is it.\\"My Father My King\\" starts off quietly and unassumingly enough, but builds into a frenzy of guitar-based melodic chaos within the first five minutes. The next couple of minutes bring it all back down to let you catch your breath before Glasgow's kings of sonic martial arts give you another swift kick to the ears.Despite there only being one track, this is perhaps my favorite Mogwai release to date.

I love her new identity and the R & B direction that she went with her career.However, this concert is one of the worst I have seen. She barely sings to her songs, just adds styling in while her background singers belt it out. And the few times she actually sings her songs, you are almost relieved for her and for the fans that paid to see the concert. She rambles on and on in between songs and although she truly seems to love her fans and want to involve them, she does not reward them with well sung music.All that being said, it was watchable, but then again, a train wreck is possible too."},{"rating":"2","title":"it was interesting","review":"I am not happy, the dvd's are skipping in two diffeent dvd players.

The earthy, yet non-corporeal timbres will delight the ears of the Enya, Lisa Gerrald, Arvo Part and even the Aphex Twin lover. Furthermore, as the album touches on quartertone harmony along with several nods toward ancient music, the serious musician walks away fulfilled.

This book is about a \\"white man\\" who was raised by Indians, but whose blood grand father was a very wealthy man in England, and a woman whom once belonged to a prestigious family, but who in recent years had befallen near poverish conditions.

Music carries emotion, and if it embarrasing to love emotion - then I guess I will never understand. This music does make you feel, the guitar work is absolutely superb. It goes effortlessly from soft acoustic to metal.But the best part of it is the way the singer captures your feelings by the way he interprets each piece in it's own way, and with a fantastic voice. My favorite songe by far is \\"Your Evil Soul\\". It is a slowly building, fascinating song.At the end, it hits you with heavy bass, drums, and a crying out in desperation by the singer. \\"I will suck the elixir - from your fingertips - until my head starts caving in - my mouth will overflow - with your Evil Soul - and I'll be convulsing for days in this hole.\\" Wild lyrics - I loved the whole thing !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good album","review":"This album when I first listened to it took me on kind of a roller coaster.

While the cd can easily become a favorite of the dashboard and starting line crowd, it also will appeal to people who try to distance themselves from those bands. the tide, sunsets and carcrashes, and all hail the heartbreaker stand out. i'd also suggest buying this CD before the most recent release (one fell swoop); i wasn't as impressed with the new songs, even after multiple listens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great debut album!","review":"I purchased the Spill Canvas' most recent album right away when I preview listened to it at a Hot Topic clothing store. I was estatic when I heard that they had a CD beofore that and bought it right away from amazon.com I couldn't have been happier.Track 3, the tide, is flawless. The best song of theirs to date and is worth buying the album just for this song. It is brilliantly emotional. The chorus has the best lyrics to a song I've heard in a time. Track 11 is another great one!If you liked thier second CD, do yourself a favor and pick up The Spill Canvas' first album, it's mainly accoustic but that's what makes it soo f'n great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Born-again Hogan, sort of?","review":"I had never seen this movie, but I always enjoy a good supernatural comedy. Unfortunately, this movie is neither. Hogan, who also wrote the screenplay, is just not funny here, nor is he believeable as Terry Dean, the sterotypical crook with the heart of gold. What the movie quickly becomes is a 98 minute sermon based on the theology of \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" and \\"Highway To Heaven\\", the latter of which is given a brief nod early in the movie. I suppose if you are of the religious stripe that gobbles up this sort of thing, but I just felt like I was being beaten over the head with all the pseudo-christian references. There have been those who tout this shallow, wandering mess as a great film for the kids.

I verified the correct item was ordered at the web site and had to return the item, which was done by Amazon at no charge. Thankfully, the local auto parts store had the correct item in stock to complete the repair on the same day. It appears the wrong product was packaged in the box by the vendor.

Great collabo with Beyonce. Excuse Me Miss with Pharell is pretty tight but nothing can compare with Poppin Tags! This is the best damn song on the cd!

I mean a double album by Jay-Z (one of the greatest ever) is a great idea. 90% of the songs are really hot and you can just about bump it all the way through. I think that this album can appeal to all groups of rap fans. For the true thugs, there are some tight street songs like \\"Meet The Parents\\". Or for the ladies there's \\"03 Bonnie & Clyde\\". Almost every hip-hop fan has got to love \\"A Dream\\". This song is a true story about a dream Jigga had. Biggie's verse in this song was originally on his classic track \\"Juicy\\".I perosnally feel that Disc 2 is much more gangsta (and better) then Disc 1. Also, Jay-Z reveals that MOP has been hired and joins Roc-A-Fella Records in their song \\"U Don't Know Remix\\". I believe that this version of the song is better than the original that appeared on The Blueprint. This is an album that will probably get 4-4.5 Mics from The Source, but I still reccomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Blueprint 2:The Gift & The Curse","review":"Jay-Hova is back wit a double CD which doesn't disappoint.

Jay-Z needs to check himself and the yes men who told him that this double cd was worth putting out. No matter what is said you will hear the entire double cd on the radio and everyone will be saying how great it is.

He is a great rapper. But this effort is pathetic. There isn't one track that is memorable in any way. He falls way off here. He rips off everyone from Tupac to Biggie. He relies on guest appearances. The beats are lame. The album is way too long and drags big time. Nas's new album, God's Son, is far superior. Nas truly has proved he is a better rapper than Jay Z.

He is still bragging about how much head he got. No originality at all. Well, Atleast I am a little happy, it seems that alot of industry folks and hip hop fans agree with me on this peice of garbage, unlike Blueprint 1, which I thought was highly over-rated.

Jay-Z should now retire from the game as this was the worst album released since Bel-Biv-Devoe decided to come back again.Jay-Z comes out on the Blueprint 2 showing everyone that he knows how to steal beats, and copy other peoples lyrics. Sadly, that is the only thing he succeeds at with this album.I was the owner of this CD for about 10 minutes before I sold it back to the CD store for $6.If you're looking for a real rap album then I suggest going to pick up 2pac - Better Dayz"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jay Z has no originality, flow or substance","review":"It is ABSOLUTELY incomprehensible to me how a so-called rapper can steal, with apparently no shame whatsoever, the lyrics, beats and vocals of another rapper that VERY vocally had beef with him.

Particularly insulting is \\"Jiggle-man's\\" statement before one of the particularly bad tracks that now he understands how Pac felt when he wrote \\"Me Against the World.\\" The thought that Gay-Z could even approximate the depth of thought found in \\"Me Against the World\\" is laughable.

But since Vol.3, the quality of his music has gone down hill horribly, relying on putting teeth marks on the penises of dead legends(2Pac and the Notorious B.I.G) and putting out TRL and 106 & Park tailored junk.

His egos tell him that he has to follow in the footsteps of Biggie and Tupac. By releasing a double CD album, he thought he would leave a legacy - he didn't.

This poor excuse for a double CD doesn't have enough good tracks for one CD. Fo real. Its insulting that Jayz thinks Can compare The Blueprint 2 to Tupacs All Eyez on me. Jay Z is pop garbage. His lyrics are meaningless, his beatz half azzed. Nice try Jay.This CD barely deserves one star"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jay-Z, Please don't abuse your talent.","review":"Jay-Z is busting out albums like Usher can bust out dance moves. But at least Usher is good at dancing and always has a new move everytime. Jay-Z is getting to repetitive and the whole albums formed around Bonnie & Clyde. Go check out his other albums before you decide to buy this one. He also doesn't have the emphasis and will to get through every song. Seems like this album is just an answer to God's Son by Nas."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT.","review":"LOVE THE 2003 BONNIE AND CLYDE SONG.

His whole style is bit off of three people. His creator Jaz-0 (yeah, i know, the name), and the great Biggie and Pac. I wont lie. Reasonable Doubt, and the Blueprint were pretty good albums, especially RD, but this album sounds like he put it together in a day. First off?,There are no real 'stand out track's' on this album, its all typical Hova filler and why are you biting Pac for your lead single?, you arent and never will be Pac. And Lenny Kravitz?? Does anyone still like him? And going after Nas again? damn, you will never be better than him, the only reason you went at him was to help your dieing career, which, after listening to this double lp, didnt work."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.5 stars","review":"His sequel to \\"Blueprint\\" and his about 7th solo project is one of his better works. I would definitely recommend this one. It coulda been another 5 star classic if he put it into one 70-75 minute cd and left some of the filler tracks off but I'd still give it 4.5 stars. It has some classics on here and unlike him (usually) he heavily features a lot of rappers on this one. the best tracks are:DISC 1#1 (f/ Faith Evans and a reused Notorious B.I.G. verse)#3 - (f/ greats: Rakim & Dr. Dre (uses his beat from 2001 album track #2)#5 (f/ Neptunes - a classic and a great song to smoke out to)Disc 2#1#3 (a classic remix to the same titled song on \\"Blueprint\\" this time he grabs M.O.P to get in the mix)#4 (tells a good story)#7 (classic - get's on Nas too!)#10 (a classic remake featuring a lot of the artists from the R-O-C)#12 & #13 are hot tooShawn Carter -- b. 12/4/69 - Marcy, Brooklyn, NYP.S. - check all my reviews"},{"rating":"1","title":"booooooooooo","review":"(...) commercial rapper. reasonable doubt and vol 2 were the only good albums he can put out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been great.","review":"The Blueprint was a great album and to follow that up is hard. Jay-Z rushed the Blueprint 2. The songs didn't seem as personal or creative. The duets are the only reason to buy the disc. The remixs arn't bad either. The 2 disc should've been a 1 disc.

Jay-z was aight back in the day. Eversince the Nas vs Jayz beef, its been downhill. And downhill fast. Anyone who thinks this is better than Gods Son (especially a 12 year old) need to go back and do some research. Gods Son has half the songs that the blueprint 2 has. But the blueprint 2 has half as many listenable songs compared to Gods Son. So make your own conclusion........."},{"rating":"2","title":"STOP HATING ON JAY","review":"Enough disliking Jay-Z because Nas edged him in their battle,a battle that according to Jay's track \\"The Blueprint2\\" is not even over, it is merely beginning. This album is stuffed with insighful and gangsta lyrics while also incorporating hot beats and catchy choruses. Even the haters cannot deny Jay's talent. And even though his insecurities push him to rip others' music sometimes, we should all appreciate how great this double album really is. Jay-Z is among rap's elite, and this disc proves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"blue print 2 the gift the curse","review":"this cd is garbage. nuff said. lyrical skill is garbage talks about nothing, same stuff all the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jay-Z a.k.a Photocopy Machine","review":"Ppl call him the King Of New York for being a Xerox copy of his 'mentors' Biggie and Jaz-0.

I can actually listen to the curse as a regular cd wit out skipping around unlike the gift where the only good songs 1,3,5,and 8. While the second disc mostly every song is good. I'd say an alrite try on behalf of Jay. The first Blueprint is a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Response to Samuel Weissman","review":"The comment from Biggie that was used in \\"A Dream\\" (\\"blow up like the World Trade\\") referred to another explosion that happened in the World Trade Center in 1993. However, the term, \\"World Trade\\", is blocked out so as to not offend people whose family and friends died in the other World Trade Center explosion in 2001.This album is pretty subpar; some hot songs (\\"Meet the Parents\\"), a lot of weak songs (\\"F**k All Nite\\", \\"2 Many H**s\\"). Should have been one disc instead of two. The Black Album is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST ALBUM EVER !!","review":"If any rap fans out there want to know what a commerciallyStraight-Wack album is, this is the one you need to take note of. Now I'm a Jay-Z fan No doubt, but come on now how are you going to CREATE! the BLUEPRINT, which was the best rap album OF THE YEAR. It was so good I bought the UNPLUG version also, But this GARBAGE BP2 is striaght WACK Jay is trying to get paid off this album and he will cause after what he did on the first one we got ALL hyped and gased and thought he was going to get busy again ... Hell nahh he ran out of lyrics on this one, if you don't beleive me just listen to 'EXCUSE ME MISS' & ' HOVI BABY' my god it's wack ........Reminds me of that Garbage Noreaga brought out for his 2nd album"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well at least he tried","review":"I just coped the Blueprint 2 a couple of days ago thinking that this is defenitely gonna be an amazing double cd album like All Eyez on Me. Blueprint 1 was amazing no doubt but, Blueprint 2 is a waste of time. There's not enough Jay-z, a lot of the songs are featuring people and, Jay's raps are the same as ever. He must've had 1000 lines in which he used \\"jigga\\" to rhyme with. Disc 2 is better than Disc 1 but still its not worth the time or the money. If you really wanna get a Jay-Z album your best of with blueprint 1, reasonable doubt or vol.2"},{"rating":"1","title":"What are all these people smoking???","review":"This without a doubt is probably the worst rap album of 2002. What are these people smoking? Dope lyrics?!? You guys have to be joking. If you want to hear dope lyrics go get Nas' Stillmatic and God's Son which annihilated Jigga and definitely put an end to the so-called beef. Then get the Eminem Show and Talib Kweli's Quality. It seems like good rap albums today are scarce. Hip Hop died when bling bling was born. White people use to fear rap when it use to stand for something. Now they just laugh at it and dance along with these materialistic cat in the hat rappers."},{"rating":"1","title":"25 Tracks-4 Worth Playing","review":"I blindly bought this album w/o listening to it first-needless to say, that was [$$] I could've spent elsewhere. Of all the tracks, the only ones worth playing are the tracks with featured artist. '03 Bonnie & Clyde is a bad attempt at Jay-Z trying to gain from Tupac's fame. I can't believe he had Tupac in the video like they were friends-Tupac ate him up lyrically and despised him as a person. Jay Z needs to stop saying he's better than B.I.G. and that he's the greatest of all time. Jay-you can't compare with Outkast, Scareface, or Pac-you're barely keeping Nas from making you look stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jay-Z fan Lost","review":"This is the worst album I've heard all year, and I'm pretty sure that he's playing this can't be the real Blueprint 2 I've heard all this nose about.

I was looking forward to this album for him to reddeem himself after all these albums of stealing other peoples lyrics. I figured maybe Jay would change for the bette rand make his own music. I was dead wrong. Not only did he use everyone elses rhymes, but he used 2PACS SONG. What the heck is he thinking?! 2Pac hates you Jay Z. He never liked you, why would you think about taking his song! You lost so much respect from virtually everyone.* The only reason I took time to write a review for this horrible album is so no one else makes the horrible mistake of purchasing it. This whole album is other peoples songs, I suggest you go get the real versions of all these songs. Jay...give it up man. Its clear you cant make up your own ideas and only use people that hated you songs to have hits. Give it up Jay.* One more thing Jay, if you ever see 2pac, I suggest you run, Fast.Dont buy it.- Kevan"},{"rating":"1","title":"Retirement is a good idea","review":"Yo, if this is what Jay has to offer from now on, the it's about time to hit the door. I remember the Jay-Z I used to love...the hungry Jay, whose rhymes were quick, intellectual, and clever. His first album personifies pure talent. Classy and suave but not blatantly \\"bling\\". Add some years and a couple mil, and this is what you get...half-baked raps that probably had Jigga yawning in the booth. And why two discs? Sounds like ole boy was running out of things to say. I used to dig Lenny Kravitz until I peeped Guns and Roses. Bet they came up with the idea to collaborate while in Spa, drinking Cris and scoping models. If this record was cut in half, I would have given it an extra star!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is the shhhhhhhh","review":"Jay Z has pretty much made another great rap CD, isnt that a big shocker. Although the CD is one of the most diverse in styles all on one album that ive ever heard. From tracks like Hovi baby which is good hip hop, to a rock song with Lenny Kravitz, in Guns and Roses, to his song with beyonce, remaking Pac's Bonnie and Clyde. Anybody that truly likes rap should get this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jay is slippin'","review":"Ok..Reasonable Doubt was the classic. Part 2 was nice, 3 was ok..Dynasty was horrible. Blueprint was ok..and now this. Worst than Dynasty. Tracks were childish and horrible. Ill be selling mine used soon, but this is not worth the money spent. Very bad, and wouldnt recomend to anyone.

It has a pretty wide variety of tracks, and many featured artists. I dont think that it is as good as some of his old stuff, but I do think it is better than the Blueprint. Featured artists include MOP, the Neptunes, Dre, and Twista. Some of the songs have really awesome beats, my favorite being 'Nigga Please' with Young Chris and the Neptunes. Overall, not too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too overated","review":"i wasn't at all happy with the new Jay-Z, except for a couple of songs like Poppin' Tags and The Watcher 2, which were both really good and those alone gave this record it's 2-star rating. i thought that Jay tried way too damn hard to fuel his own ego and try to create his own genre or rap, if that's what he was trying to do, because if that's not what he did then i don't know what the hell he's doing."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST","review":"Ego aside, Jay-z is ONE of the greatest rap lyricists to date.You can't judge him by the singles you here.You have to LISTEN to the entire work.His use of play on words is dynamic."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointed","review":"what happened to the days when i could pop in a jay-z cd (reasonable doubt, or in my lifetime vol. 1) and enjoy the entire cd? i have trouble getting through the first track on the blueprint 2. the whole album sounds like a sample from all different genres of music. what audience is he trying to appeal to? jay-z, go back to your old school beats and lyrics. instead of buying the blueprint 2, check out Tupac Better Dayz. that album is off the hook! better dayz is the first album i've thoroughly enjoyed in years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blueprint 2: The Ultimate curse","review":"After the near-classic Blueprint you would expect jay to sit at the top of the rap game(right under Nas and Kweli), but no, he had to go and mess it all up with this piece of dung.

But I feel that releasing an album every year has taken it's toll. this album is in one word 'Poor'. in particular the second CD (the curse) has absolutely no good tracks on it. even the bonus traks just don't help the albums cause. But on the other hand disc1 (the gift) is slightly better, especially the 'the watcher2' with Dre, rakim & truth hurts! that is a true Jay-Z track, it's is reminicent of 'can I get a...' on the Hard knock life album. the 'bonnie & clide' track with beyonce is catchy but far too comercial for a rap album. jay-z seems to be trying to emulate Biggie in this album, and in doing so ruins what makes Jay-Z great. It seems that Jay-Z is far too concerned about earning some money for Roca-fella than making a true rap album for his fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub-standard jigga material","review":"Overall, I'm pretty disappointed with this record, after coming off the stellar Blueprint, I was expecting and classic but was surprised when this album didn't meet my expectations. The album seems very rushed and packed with alot of filler songs. Don't get me wrong, there are a couple hot tracks and would have been better if they released it as a single CD. I would not recommend buying this and instead pick up the new Talib Kwele Quality or Tupac Better Dayz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jay-Z comes up WAY short!","review":"I'm not normally the type to write online reviews, but I want to forewarn everyone out there to stay away from this CD. Jay-Z is one of my favorite artists, and Blueprint (Volume 1) was absolutely fantastic. Blueprint 2, however, leaves you skipping through tracks looking for SOMETHING to hold on to. The rhymes are weak, the production is shoddy, and there's really nothing original or appealing about either one of the two CD's. Jay-Z should have spent some time putting thought in to his next move, because this makes him look like an amateur hoping to ride on the coattails of his previous album's success. Stay away -- it's not worth the [money]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jay-z has fallen off!","review":"Last year I heard the orginial blueprint. It was an excellent album: good lyrics, tight beats and signature hooks that made him jay-z, but now jay-z has fallen off! He doesn't rhyme anymore, his beats are not as good and his songs are corny.

I think im going to have to sleep on his next album because This is just bad, I could of rated it lower but i did like some song from it. overal the thing im sayin is save your because its not worth it. I recommend you to get the nas album GOD's SON. To me, it waay better and you wont have to listening to jay-z trying to beat nas(which he wont). But if your a DIE HARD jay-z fan then get it if your not then dont get it because it will make you hate him."},{"rating":"2","title":"not a classic, but still pretty good","review":"A lot of people have been hatn' on Jigga cause they say the Blueprint 2 is wack. Even Jay himself attempted to fix the problem with the new blueprint 2.1. The truth, as many people already know is that the album has too many filler tracks. However, despite the fillers, there are enough good songs on the double CD to make a dope Jay-Z album. Personally, I liked about half of the songs on the album and just made a new CD with just the songs I liked...So I recommed you get the album...Its not his best work, but still better than most of his other work.

Same ole, same...can we hear something a little deeper than how much money you have? Not to mention the recycled material. The song features B.I.G. It uses a verse from juicy. Not to mention how he butchers 2-pac's beat from \\"Me & My Girlfiend\\" and tried to spice it up with a not needed spanish guitar...Lets not forget how 2pac HATED Jay-Z why would you want to sample a beat from a legend who coulnd't stand you?

Let there music ride in peace. There are some burners on the CD. MOP never lets you down. Lenny did his thing, but he overshadowed jay-z. Get it right, this is not The Blueprint 2.

Every cd he has put out since his first two have been totally wack and I don't understand how anyone can like that stuff.

I don't understand why Jay Z, would copy Tupac's work when Tupac would have beat the sh:t out of him for doing so if he was still living.

Most of the songs on the album are good and \\"Poppin Tags\\" and \\"Guns and Roses\\" are OFF THE HOOK!

He must have a problem with his originality, because after quoting Biggie on nearly every song on his last album, now he starts doing that with the other dead poet...

Where the bluprint 1 was more personal this is bravado of skill, flow, and lyrics. This is a bragging jay-z on the album but a very truthful one i dont think anyone can disagree that he is very very talented.My fav tracks are Meet the parents, The Bounce, the watcher, Blueprint 2 (a very truthful and factual attack at another great lyricst nas), Poppin tags , Diamonds are forver, Guns and roses hot callbo wth lenny krazit and u dont kno the remix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jigga Does It Again","review":"Deviating a bit from the pattern of Blueprint 1, Jay-Z triumphantly returns to his rightful place at the top of the rap world with the release of Blueprint 2: The Gift and the Curse.

I thought the Amazon review by Dalton Higgins was totally right, he should of known not to make a double cd, especially in such a short time, no artist has ever made a classic 2 cd album.

I'm disappointed that only a few songs on the Double CD are worth playing in my car on a daily basis.. Unfortunatly he will sell a lot of units because he is Jay-Z, but he will have alot of disappointed fans..

You can easily tell this double CD was written in two months, which is sad. He should spend time listening to his old material, especially REASONABLE DOUBT, which I feel was his only \\"GREAT\\" album. I disagree with MUSIC FAN, there have been several classic double cds in hip hop history. How so easily you forget Biggie's Life After Death and 2Pac's All Eyez On Me. Those double cds were classics that changed Hip hop forever, Jay-Z falls far from those superior quality rap artists.And not to make it a Nas-Jay beef but you should take a look at Nas' God's Son. Many say it is a slow moving and boring album but i believe it is a different side of Nas that has deep lyrical meaning, something that Jay-Z never shows. It's true his lyrical content is mundane and boring, always about money, hoes and clothes. Jay-Z is not considered Rap King in my book...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is the originality gone?","review":"My only qualms with this album is the fact that just about every song has several samples from other artists. The songs themselves are good. I didn't expect something of such low quality from a man like Jay-Z. I have all his albums, but after this one, I think my confidence in him has slided a little.

Tracks such as \\"Gunz & Roses\\" w/ Lenny Kravitz, \\"Excuse Me Miss,\\" & \\"A Dream\\" with Biggie were great.

The Black Album was decent stuff (Change Clothes, Allure, Encore and 99 Problems (the latter two being the biggest highlights).But this one's a mess. I remember Excuse Me Miss, B&C; '03 Bonnie & Clyde and that's IT.I hated Jay-Z after this album.

I found myself many times hearing the same old song about the opposite sex. I was also disappointed by the beatmakers for the album. Just Blaze is always a pleaser, but Timbaland I would expect more from. The Neptunes are getting a little to artsy with their selections for beats lately as is, but c'mon fellas.

This album is plagued with cliches, samples, and the use of other artists lines & hooks. However some will give this album rave reviews just because it is Jay Z, although this is by far one of his worst albums to date. Material from the late Biggie Smalls appears on several songs and Jay Z flaunts it as if it is his own. Lyrical content is seldomly removed from the same I have this and I have that. This is a sad day in Hip Hop when one who is considered to be at the top of his game puts out a double CD with watered down content and exploits the game that he claims to be so credible in.

Despite their differences, they remain friends, even after Cusack steals Spader's girlfriend from him.The movie tries to examine issues of power and corruption. Unfortunately, the plot is so stale and obvious that it fails to add anything new to this arena. Spader and Cusack are fine, but Imogen Stubbs, as the woman they both love, is terrible. She's a Brit playing an American, but her accent creeps in far too often, which is a huge distraction. I'm a big fan of John Cusack, but this movie is definitely one of his lesser accomplishments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just so we don't get what we deserve...","review":"A gripping tale of friendship and deceit.

Andrews, however, this book was the exception. I liked the rest of the series but not this one. The other girls in the series were believable but Cat's story was too crazy. I just didn't like it. This could have been a nice end to this series but it's content is not suitable for unmature teens."},{"rating":"1","title":"blech","review":"You know that an author's books have gone from wonderful to the pits when you check them out from the libary, but STILL have absolutely no desire to even pick them up to skim though them.V. C. Andrews is officially off my reading list."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book was the worst","review":"i've read all her books but this series was the absolute worst. i think the team of writers should go back to v c andrews' old writing style. i really enjoyed her old books like flowers in the attic and melody. basically all the books before the orphans and wildflowers series were the best.please publish and write better and longer books of more substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, not great...","review":"Cat was the first okay book in the series, but maybe it's just because she is so pathetic. She was molested by the father that adopted her and her whole twisted past begins to unravel like a cheap sweater from K-Mart. Her mother is actually her sister, however, it's not because they are from Alabama. It's because their mother became pregnant with Cat after having an affair. The older sister adopted Cat to save the family from disgrace. The book is sad in a way the others aren't, but it's poorly written and the characterization wasn't very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"This book is about Cat, a troubled teenager, sharing her story of incest and other abuses to a group of other troubled teenagers. Cat is whiny and unbelievable, as are the rest of the girls in her group. The book closes with an aura of hopelessness: the world is a terrible place and it's never going to get any better.I used to like V.C. Andrews' books, but either I've outgrown them or the new ghostwriter doesn't match up to Andrews' original style. This book is targeted towards teens but the subject matter isn't appropriate. I believe teenagers can handle difficult issues like incest in mature ways, but this book seems to almost glorify it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cat Comes out of Her Shell","review":"Cat did the right thing to lay all of her cards on the table with the girls and Dr. Marlowe. All things have to come out. It was awful of Geraldine to isolate Cat as well as abuse her physically and verbally. Cat deserves to have friends. What helps her is that she is willing to give people a chance. It was shocking that Howard assaults Cat after she trusts him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dried Flowers","review":"Sadly this is the worst series in the VCAndrews collection. The story dragged on and I lost interest in the first 3 chapters. I agree with the other customer that the ghost writer should either be replaced or return to the original writing style. The Flowers in the Attic series & the Heaven series were the best and will always remain among my favorite books. The single star is a single star too many for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a book that Ms. Andrews would be proud of.","review":"I have read all of the V. C. Andrews books, and this series is, by far, the worst. The recent V.C. Andrews books continue to disappoint me. Where I once looked forward to the next book in one of her series, I now find myself merely drawn to them to prove that \\"this one will not be up to par\\" either! I'm surprised that the family would want to lend the name V.C. Andrews to these books. I'm sure Ms. Andrews would not be proud of any of them. As for the mini-series---get rid of them, and get back to the types of books that Ms. Andrews became noted for!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD Studio Pro 2","review":"DVD Studio Pro 2 does not work.

I cannot see how it is helpful or how it even fits into a mother/daughter help category; it seems to be Nancy Friday's personal tale of how her mother failed her and she is trying to explain why everybody else Must Also be Screwed Up and Unhappy. How is this book constructive and helpful? Not for me. Try something else, really."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've read better...","review":"This book was written for women, as such men will come away feeling that women are \\"really screwed up\\" about thier mothers, and while it does attempt to explain certian things, you do get the feeling that the author wants somebody to blame for the things that have gone wrong in her life... One wonders what her mother though on reading it, if she ever has.Personally I think \\"Our Mother's Daughters\\" by Judith Arcana (published by The Women's Press) is a far better book, a far better read for men too, especially if you want to understand the woman your mother is, rather than the woman you would have her be.I love my mother, I read her copies of both books, her mother is now dead, it took her a lifetime to deal with the pain, don't waste yours doing the same.

It's especially great for women who have trouble with their mothers specifically when dealing with guilt, fear, and anger, to name a few emotions. You'll find yourself reading passages over and over again. The words on the pages literally jump right out at you and grab hold of your heart. It's definitely something that must be read more than once. Once you pick it up, you won't want to put it down! Flawless! It surely helped me turn my life around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very subjective view","review":"Whilst this book does raise some interesting issues it keeps coming back to the author's sexual disfunction, all of which is the result of the mother! The author has selected professionals to back up her view rather than giving a more objective picture of her past and therefore our pasts. Problems with sexuality are so prolific in the US that I can see why so many women rave about this book. However for those of us who are not screwed up about sex chose another book. It is also a great shame that after goodness knows how many years and how many books this lady has still not dealt with her issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Opening the window to a girl's soul","review":"This book is a must read for every young adolescent girl who find themseleves torn between their quest for individuality and their desire to retain a symbiotic nature with their mother. Friday answers several important questions regarding the development of young woman's sexuality, and the conflicts and misguided messages she faces in trying to grow up as a free thinking, independent women. Much to my surprise, Friday showed me the tremendous influence my parents had in shaping my life, especially my mother. This book is a definite keeper and one you will surely discover brings light to so many unanswered questions."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Mother... My Opinion??","review":"It took me a while to get into this book... there were several occasions where I tempted to give up on it.I'm glad I stuck with it though.Those of you with a difficult mother/daughter relationship will probably benefit from reading this book. I know I did. Even though the author isn't a mother (which does bother me a little), I feel that her theories make sense.The version I have of this book is quite old and was published in 1977(I picked it up in a used bookstore). I'm not sure what type of editing has been done on newer versions but I'm sure the main message will be the same.My Mother My Self would benefit women who would like a deeper understanding of their relationship with their own mother, and also their daughters. Men might like to read this to understand the complex dynamics of these relationships."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Very Powerful!","review":"This is an excellent book! Really essential for women whom have trouble with their mothers when dealing with anger, fear and other mixed emotions. You will catch yourself reading some of the passages over and over and over again. This book touches your heart and doesn't let go. I have read this book several times and each and every time I do get something different out of it. This is an excellent self-development book and I highly recommend it to everyone...men and women alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated!","review":"Upon re-reading this book after many years, I found that unconditionally embracing what were once Friday's unique perspectives on our relationships, especially with our mothers, is as bad as buying into society's bill of goods as to who we are and who we're supposed to be as women. There was a time when these ideas were on the mark, but for any person who questions what they read and are told by the \\"experts,\\" this book can be disturbing in its rigidity.

I expected to work through a stretching routine with a real person. An antimated person demonstrates each stretch briefly with recommendations and advice. But at no time (that I ever found on there, do you just work smoothly through a routine of stretches. And how many people own a low table they can lie on for some of this stuff?

The phrase \\"antisemitic\\" has come to mean anything critical in any way of Jews or Israel, a phenomena which has come to hurt the moral standing of Jews in general, as people see criticism of the apartheid State of Israel condemned as \\"anti-semitic\\", and revolt against the obvious injustice of that label.Facts are facts, and Ford presents an ironclad case for his positions.

For the next two years, Ford gave the Protocols wide circulation in his newspaper, the Dearborn Independent.\\"Ford therefore saw material that he believed to be credible, and did the equivalent of pressing the \\"Send\\" key. His \\"Send\\" key unfortunately consisted of the Dearborn Independent, so he ended up putting his name on material that later damaged his reputation.If anybody wants to read this material, it is available for free online (e.g. at white supremacist Web sites) and there is no need to buy the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very educational and informative","review":"I have nothing against Jews, so quit with all the anti-semantic bs... When a historical statement is made that is fact, it is not anti-semantic, or racist. It is fact, no matter how bad \\"it makes you you look\\". A stereotype derived from an opinion, can be labeled such. But AS gets thrown around at any negative mention of \\"the Jew\\". History is history, so what's wrong with telling it. Jews have no problem reminding the world of \\"the holocaust\\" on practically a weekly basis, via our news, literature, and movies.And it's through this constant reminder to remain victims in the worlds eyes, that brings me to my last point...

From high detail designing to fun and simple projects Kenny shows how easy it all is. With the help of some talented sculptors, potters, and some nice photo work the pieces come together with ease. Though this book reads easy and provides decent instruction of the broad scope of ceramics, the basics are not taught here in detail. If you are just getting into any form of ceramics, it will take some practice to achieve some of the sculpted and pottery wheel pieces. But this book is really helpful in triggering ideas.

The melodies and hooks almost seem hidden at first and the album is all over the place. But I refused to give up as Erykah simply would not release any old junk. This album is pure class my favourites are Love of My Life (Worldwide), Back In The Day, Danger and I Want You (an unlistenable 10.50 minutes long at first, now it's an absolute joy). Plus here in the UK we get 2 bonus tracks Love of My Life (original) and Hollywood.To all the reviewers who were unsure....in the words of Erykah on Mama's Gun 'y'all just listen...'"},{"rating":"2","title":"A CD FOR TRUE BADU FANS!","review":"I was really uncertain about how I would feel about Erykah slipping a little mainstream, but after I bought her CD I totally changed my mind. This is a CD for TRUE Badu fans. After seeing her perform \\"Danger\\" in concert, I only wished I could have heard it one more time. And if you listen to all of the songs shes was featured in (with D'Angelo, The Roots, Guru, and others) you will hear parts of those lyrics put right into her new CD.It wasn't what I expected but much much better. It goes away from Baduism & Mama's Gun and brings Erykah into a much more 'chill' environment. With artists like Angie Stone and Queen Latifah rapping it up with Erykah, how can you really say no?This is just great. A fan for about 7 years now, I can say that I she's only getting better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very solid","review":"If you are a Badu fan, then you know what to expect. There are no hidden punches in this short (under 60 minutes and only 8 songs + two interludes) cd. What it lacks in quantity, it may make up in quality. I dare say this is more political than the previous Badu releases. And this is a good thing. Worldwide Underground is able to combine conscious melodies and rhythmic messages (best exemplified by track 6, \\"Grind\\" featuring the hip hop dynamic duo - Dead Prez). Tracks 2 and 4 are quintessential Eryka Badu. The only concern is the length. It is almost as if this is half of a cd (and/or it leaves you wanting more . . . like 5 songs more). Still, a very solid effort. Given the lack of good music currently available, this is a strong addition to your cd catalog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Too Shabby","review":"When I first bought this CD and popped it into my CD player, I was a little disappointed. I did not think that it measured up to \\"Mama's Gun\\" (probably my favorite CD). It seemed to lack that funky vibe that usually accompanies her work. Don't get me wrong, \\"Worldwide Underground\\" is still one of the best albums this year. E Badu still dropped some tight tracks with sick beats, but I couldn't get into it like I was able to with her previous albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music or Noise?","review":"I love Erykah Badu, but Worldwide Underground will in all likelihood go down (hopefully) as the worst CD this consummate artist ever released. In a word -- it pretty much sucks!Hopefully, Erykah hasn't blown up to the point that she believes we'll buy her music -- no matter what. Can you tell I'm really, really disappointed in this release? So, save your money and borrow a copy from another unfortunate soul who spent hard-earned money if you want to \\"listen\\" to Worldwide Underground."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 good song doesn't make a good CD","review":"What happened to the rich quality of Erykah's voice? Seems she bumbles along a lot on the new CD and doesn't ever explore her whole vocal range. The only good song was Danger, where she belts out her lyrics over a very nice track. It's hard to believe that we've gone from beautiful songs like \\"see you next lifetime\\" to what we have on this album. Maybe she's experiencing writers block?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Badu","review":"This is an absolutely pityful CD by an artist I love. There are mabye two cuts that are \\"worthy\\" the rest are what I would call \\"fillers\\".

I don't hear what they did."},{"rating":"1","title":"If ya going to do a long song...","review":"I love Badu first of all, but this album is good if you are under as much influence as erikah was. Issac Hayes and the jammers back then had long songs but it wasn't just an idea. It was fleshed out. This is underground? No Nina Cherry is underground, black rock and roll is underground. This album is garbage. I wished she pushed herself out of this neo soul idea and created a sound. When she did the rock thing at the end of I Want You, I got excited. But it faded. What she was about to do but cut off was underground. SHe was about to bring Hendrix, Grace Jones, Mayfield, Miles, Mingus and Bad Brains back, but she punked out. Oh well, I'll wait til someone is brave enough to be different."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed buyer","review":"When Erykah said she was having a bad case of writer's block while doing this album, she wasn't kidding. Every song was like an intro that lasted 3-4 minutes. There were hardly any verses, just hooks, every track sounds like the previous, like the whole cd is just one long song.

Ms. Badu stays tru to her innovative style musically and lyrically. So far each album she brings is truely new and by now we should all know that from her the unexpected is expected. She has mixed it up a little. My fav is Danger and Bump It. This is a stylish mix and most of ALL an AUTHENTIC SOUND."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just An Appetizer","review":"First of all, in reading some of the other reviews it seems like most folks aren't grasping that 'WorldWide Underground' is only an EP. Hence the short length (8 tracks) and low price.Creatively it's a bit of a departure for Ms. Wright but make no bones about it, 'WU' is unmistakably a Badu joint. Besides, if I have to hear the overexposed Ashanti or the charisma-less Lumidee one more time, I'm going to eat my computer. Anything from Erykah is a breath of fresh air, luckily this time around that breath contains moments of pure brilliance.I was tempted, at first, to say \\"Danger\\" may be her best song ever. Well, that may not be accurate but you ain't never heard anything like this from her before. And after bumping it several times, I couldn't think of any artist who could even pull \\"Danger\\" off.'WorldWide' underground is a very tasty appetizer until the next proper Erykah album. Heck, I'd say at the least it's enough to hold us over for a week until the new OutKast album drops."},{"rating":"2","title":"Erykah gets more and more creative","review":"This is a project that will only be appreciated by people who are not searching for \\"radio-friendly\\" music. Many folks liked her first album the best. I personally like Mama's Gun the best. This new CD sounds like an underground mix-tape and is quite clever. It is a very enjoyable listen. I like that she is willing try different concepts and expand her horizons. I wish the album were longer.I'm going to make a bold statement:This album will probably be enjoyed by people who are sophisticated music listeners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Erykah rocks my world","review":"I have to whole-heartedly agree with \\"jazzyone.\\" It's unfortunate that there are people who don't \\"get\\" this album... but maybe they'll listen to it years from now, and hear how dope it is when they're ready to hear it.Erykah is brilliant... this album is brand new, it's retro, it's collaborative (Zap Mama, Latifah, Mahamadia [sp?], etc.). It's friggin' brilliant. I was lucky enough to catch her \\"Underground\\" tour at the House of Blues in LA and it was one of the best shows I've ever seen... Erykah keeps music alive, along with a few others, like Meshell Ndegeocello, Radiohead, Ben Harper, etc... thank goodness!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE IT!!!","review":"If you're looking for another Mama's Gun or Baduizm, this ain't it. Sometimes you just have to grow with an artist - wait and see where they're going to take you next. A lot of folks don't seem to have the patience for that and expect everything to sound the same. Imagine how boring and typical Erykah's music would be if all of her albums sounded the same - like a lot of mainstream music.I love everything that she's done on this album. She's stretching on this record and you can hear it in her lyrics and vocal arrangements. Her voice is getting stronger and she's taking risks and trying new things with her instrument. I love that about her. This album definitely has an old school sound to it. Some of it reminds me of Chaka Kahn, particularly \\"I Want You.\\" And I don't know what that was at the end of track 4, but I hope to hear some more of it in the near future.So go git it and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"WORLDWIDE UNDERGROUND VISIT BY ME","review":"IT WAS GREAT I LOVED THE ALBUMIS A MUST-HAVE.ALL THE TRACKS AREGREAT IN ALL HONESTLY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great as or Better than Baduism","review":"Excellent cd!

I've heard her several times live in Dallas and she is fantastic in person, she brings an edge to her soulful songs when she's live. Being of the caucasion persuasion, which is to say im tan with a white primer, I dont always agree with Ms. Badu's, uh let's say Afro Centric views, but I respect her opinions and I love her talent. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Quality EP","review":"For Badu this album isn't a hit but the stand out tracks are absolutely that, STAND OUT!

Pick up this Ep if you ahve some extra cash or if you a true Badu fan you will truly love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"She Still Got It","review":"Even though she should have written a couple of more songs, it's still no. 1 in my book.

She has her own style of creativity."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT IS THIS MESS??????","review":"Ever since the dreaded \\"Badu Live\\" CD, Erykah Badu has drifted into mainstream, commercialistic garbage, releasing songs that sound nothing like, or similar to those on her ground-breaking debut, \\"Baduizm.\\" She further drifts into R&B oblivion with her latest release of \\"Worldwide Underground.\\" After what I sampled from a friend, refusing to buy it after hearing the monotonous \\"Mama's Gun,\\" I was very disappointed! Even my friend can't get with this one, and he's as big a Badu fan as I am, or was. \\"Danger\\" and \\"Bump It\\", the only ear-catching songs here can't even save this CD from musical ennui. Erykah repeats hooks way too many times, songs linger on forever and the beats are so lifeless they need a defibrillator to revive them. EB dropped the ball on this one, and if she doesn't hurry and return to the down-home soulful, funk flava that permeated \\"Baduizm\\", I'm gonna have to stop listening to her...BUT, uhhm, I'm kinda doin that now. Better luck next time, Erykah!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's weak and wack","review":"Recycled previous hits, not really saying much in A 10 minute song, crooning like a nomade in the jungle.

She is such a creative, talented person who seems to put alot of time and energy into her work; this CD does not reflect any these attributes. It seems as if she just threw all of the songs together as a quickly as possible.

Her first two albums are still in my top ten of all time. What drew me to her was not only her groove, but her stylistic ingenuity and thoughtful lyrics. This new album, overall, has neither. The entire thing is essentially filler, as if she was just recording a live jam that really was not going very well. It does have a groove, but it just gets boring even after the first song. This just never happened with her other albums. The few highlights on this album are danger, think twice and ,yes, I like the remix of love of my life, primarily due to the fact that bahamadia is a goddess in her own right. Erykah, please make something meaningful next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Heart Is Hurting!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"from utter disappointment no doubt! I have to truly be the biggest Badu fan on earth but this album really just didn't do it for me! I really, really tried to like this Cd but it just didn't work for me. I don't understand how she can come with her previous 3 and then something like this! I just knew after \\"Love Of My Life\\" her fans were in for something really special.

When I got the album I was sorely disappointed--the version on \\"Mama's Gun\\" was completely different than the version on the radio. I grew to like the album version, but it didn't compare to the hit version. Fast forward a few years, and I was so looking forward to having her smash from earlier this year \\"Love Of My Life\\" on this album, and when I saw that it was one of the tracks I was thrilled. However, upon hearing the album I realize that the version included here is a completely different sounding song. C'mon Erykah, sure you may be trippy, alternative, and everything else, but how about being nice to your fans for once? It ain't all about you, y'know.I guess I'll have to wait for an Erykah Badu greatest hits to own the correct versions (or hit versions) of her singles. Boo."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want a refund!","review":"I read some previews about this cd and to my amazement ....people were right! This cd was such a disappointment for me...There is next to none of lyrics mostly instruments and her chanting.

Woo was not one of my favorites, although it's a catchy little tune. I'm sick, sick, SICK of love of my life reprise, overdub, remix, all that .... over and over and over ... truly sick of it!!!!

They forget to mention that Santa Anna was a brutal dictator and later captured without a shred of military insignia, and had to be identified by his own men.Just another example of Revisionist's history.If you want to know what more likely happened at the Alamo, I suggest you read, Walter Lords book, \\"A Time to Stand\\". By far the best literature on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Eye Witness.

I buy it.But TWO of them? Two, loner-nutty-people who felt like killing during those 48 hours in Dallas?I've seen the live tv killing of LHO. I watched the WTC attacks live on tv. Each time, the shiver up the spine came from the \\"second\\" hit; JFK, horror, surprise! First Tower, an accident? Bad pilot?But when Ruby shot Oswald,and when the second plane hit, one knew there was a conspiracy.This is not a narrative of theories or a history of the complex layering of forces on that day;it's oftentimes wordy; but, it's a close-up view of the character who slipped into history with his gunshot, and disappeared from history without a convincing exit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs to be remastered, hopefully in Blu-ray.","review":"One of my favorite oldie movies, this disk is too dated and needs ehanced re-coloring and much crisper quality.

While his topic is interesting, Mr. Jones does not pull it off, and that is evident after about 50 pages of reading. There's enough of a story here to keep you reading, but it ultimately fails in the same manner a \\"blockbuster\\" summer movie fails: it doesn't live up to its premise and ultimately makes no sense. You want the main character to succeed, to learn something, but by the story's end, you are left unsatisfied and agitated that the author didn't reflect further on how real people would act under such situations and provide some sense of insight into the difficulty of having to raise two children immediatley after the death of their mother."},{"rating":"2","title":"VIVID PORTRAYALS","review":"Throughout the book, Sue McGhee paints such extremely vivid portrayals of her characters that I was transported into the story.

Instead, Johnson delves into the history and practice of alchemy throughout the ages, and provides what is probably the clearest examination yet of the practice and purpose of this arcane art. Johnson knows his stuff, and explores the psychological transmutations that result in the practitioners as well as the more well-known physical ones.

The ring holder holds the ring in a vertical position. This is personal preference, but I think the ring would look better angled. 2. The wood is so heavily shellacked that it almost appears that it's not wood at all.

However, that being said, you will need some basic math skills to be able to understand and apply the concepts in this book. If you are unfamilar with linear algebra, you should probably start with studying up on your math skills first. With the basic math skills, this book does a great job of introducing the basics to almost every major topic you'll see in 3D computer graphics programming. The book doesn't go into great detail at times, but the simplicity of this book is the winning ingredient that allows beginners to grasp the basics before moving on to indepth research in paticular topics of 3D graphics that interest them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Right idea....wrong implementation","review":"Watt attempts a very good thing in this book: he essays to summarize the main concepts in 3-D graphics in a concise and easy-to-understand way.

(e.g: for people doing graduate studies in computer graphics) As for me, my first encounter with computer graphics in this book made me hate the topic so much. The book makes you feel that graphics involve so much mathematics, especially analytic geometry.

Delightful-","review":"Paul Mazursky and Richard Dreyfuss, with the help of Raul Julia and Sonia Braga, have turned out a real charmer, a comedy which, throughout its length, keeps an audience in good humor. Oh, there are a couple of serious asides, lasting no more than a few minutes, which provide the rationale for the continuing action, but these are not to be taken as any kind of reality. Dreyfuss turns in an engaging performance as the actor playing a real dictator, Raul Julia is fine as the Man Behind the Throne, Sonia Braga is more than adequate for the role as Courtesan to the Ruler,, and, Jonathan Winters does a good bit as a bluff retired American, who turns out to be something more. For no particular reason, Sammy Davis, Jr. does two songs in inimitable fashion, while Dick Cavet, doing an interview with the Dictator, adeptly plays Dick Cavett doing an interview with a Dictator. All in all, a film to lift the spirits of the whole family."},{"rating":"2","title":"funny and fun to watch","review":"This is a light, fun movie, filmed in a beautiful old city in Brazil. great actors, just delightful!

I think Dreyfuss is a truly unrated actor of both drama (Mr. Holland's Opus) and comedy (this flick, What About Bob?, etc.). As for Raul Julia his talent was barely being exploited before his untimely death.Get this flick...it is awesome...and funny...especially when they store the dictator's body in the freezer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Rainy Day Flick!","review":"Richard Dreyfuss is comedically great as the NY actor who is 'pressed' into service to perform as the licentious, drunk, vertically challenged dictator of a small latin country after said dictator dies from over indulging in booze, particulary his concoction of choice, the 'Puna'. Raul Julia is hilarious as the government man behind the scenes, the greedy and sadisitic real ruler of Parador who runs the country into the ground with his backroom cronies. And Sonia Braga, always beautiful and seductive, as the dictator's girlfriend who is a true woman of the people, as she secretly helps Dreyfuss learn the ropes and change Parador for the better.

In a noisy area I use the speaker phone, put it to my ear to hear it.When you slide up, sometimes (very often) the display light doesn't turn off, just dims out which causes the battery die quicker.So many things to say; mp3 player useless, navigation useless, functions useless, you can't use certain songs for ring tones, etc..I can tell you at least one excuse for each feature you have in mind. I was hoping to find a firmware update to fix the problems but no luck.I strongly suggest you stick with Nokia phones or at least stay away from Samsung.By the way, Cingular is not lowest dropped call network.

Bluetooth is great, and the Samsung PC Suite (free download from Samsung) lets you edit your contacts, upload ringtones, and just about anything else you want to do.

Interface is intuitive and functions are easy to figure out. Speakerphone sound quality is only marginal.The main selling point of the phone is its sliding and its thinness.

I am not a rookie when it comes to candy-bar style phones, and my Nokia made it through 18 months of the exact same treatment with no damage to the screen whatsoever.

I have previously had a Nokia and a Sony-Erickson, which did the basics, but this phone has a lot of nice features. The slider feature is very nice and helps prevent keys from being pushed without the need to lock them. The camera does 1280 x 1024 pictures (1.3 megapixel) which is more than enough for a photo printer doing 5 x 7s. It also does video (at 15 frames per second which is 1/2 of regular video). The mp3 player is simple enough, works with the phone closed and can read from either the built in memory or a micro-SD card which can be inserted in the side. The only downside to the music player is that the audio files are limited to 128 kbps (which sounds fine) and the file names need to be no longer than 32 characters. Given the choice, I would certainly buy this phone again (especially since it was free with a [...]mail-in rebate)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I hated this phone.

It seems no one will stand behind this product. Mine looked great and felt like a great set until I washed them the first time, then I saw rust as well. I cannot get a hold of Hampton and Target won't work with it's customers at all. I am particularly upset since I bought 4 sets!!!!! I will no longer be shopping at Target or buy Hampton/Cambridge products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rust after first wash","review":"Like most of the users on the site, I too am having issues with rust.

Dissapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rust stains after 2 weeks","review":"I bought a set from the local Target and I saw rust spots after two weeks. I don't use lemon detergent and wash them by hand. This is clearly an inferior product.

Well about 2 weeks after the wedding we noticed that they were spotty, and soon after realized that the spots were turning to rust. This rust only got worse after every wash, either by had or dishwasher. This set is definitely not worth the higher price it goes for. We were very very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Errosion strikes!","review":"I have ALWAYS loved and trusted cambrige and hampton Silversmith. But this time I am totally disapointed. I no sooner got this set and began using it, and it was hard to get the food off of it. Then it says that its dishwasher safe. But you should not use any detergents that contain lemon. I did as directed. I have only have this set for about a month and a half and its already eroding........makes me very upset. I will NEVER buy another Hampton Silversmith product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"RUSTED WRECK","review":"After only a few weeks of use rust marks appeared on our silverware as well. Now after 1 year I am embarassed to use the set. In this day and age why would anyone want to handwash their silverware? And besides, the warranty says \\"diswasher safe\\". We have not used detergent with \\"lemon added\\" at all plus our 23 year old silverware was washed the very same way and looks like new in comparison. I think Hampton Silversmiths makes totally inferior products. Too bad Target is not standing behind what they sell!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fraudulent labeling ?","review":"My wife purchased 3 sets of this flatware at a local Target store, and we too experienced problems with rust. I remembered from a college class 20 years ago that stainless steel is non-magnetic, while ordinary steel will stick to a magnet. So I tested the flatware with a magnet, and sure enough it *is* magnetic. I'm pretty sure that means that, despite the labeling, it is not stainless steel. We haven't yet complained to Target, but we surely will. (I just found out about the problem tonight, and I did a Google search on \\"hampton target stainless\\", which brought me to this site and all the bad reviews.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great flatware at a bargain price","review":"I purchased this flatware set originally a few years back and love it. For the price, you can't beat it. The brushed stainless steal finish and classic styling are what you'd expect from a much more expensive line. I've run it through the dishwasher for years and it still looks great. Why pay more?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"I actually was prompted to write a review by the 2 negative reviews that were posted. I've owned this set for several years and was just popping in to buy a second set. I haven't had any problems with rust and wash both by hand and in the dishwasher. It's a beautiful set with an almost antique look and a great heft. Definitely a great deal for the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rusted before they even got out of the package!","review":"Registered at Target for our wedding. They refuse to return them due to we did not have our gift reciept. In fact they threatened to call the police if I did not take the product and leave the store.

Stuck with a \\"brand new\\" set that I wouldn't give to my worst enemy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stainless Steel?","review":"I ordered this product before. And was impressed with it until in less than a month it began to rust. I don't understand why it comes out of the dishwasher spotted stained with rust if it is stainless steel? I scrub and scrub and it does work but the very next time I wash it, it stains worse than before. I've noticed recently people don't put very much quality into their products as they used to. My mother has a stainless steel silverware set she got at her wedding 50 years ago that she uses daily and it has never rusted or stained."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sharp Edges","review":"Unfortunately, I had to discard this product because a few of the spoons had sharp edges that cut the corners of my mouth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great flatware and super service.","review":"Received flatware quickly.

Unlike others, I have not placed them in the dishwasher because the instructions that came with the item clearly recommend against doing this. I have had no problem when hand washing. I also plan to buy another set. If you don't mind hand washing your silverware, it is a beautiful and expensive looking set for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"mine rusted too","review":"My set rusted as well very, very quickly. I gave my old set to charity the same day I bought this set and within a week, I had rust on these dispite following the instructions very carefully. <br />I tried to resolve the issue with Target but they would not return/exchange these with out the original packaging. I got the same basic responce from the makers of the product. <br />Unfortunately for me, I didn't read the reviews that listed all of the others whose items rusted as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spotting on the Silverware","review":"After owning this silverware for about 3 months and washing them in my dishwasher on a regular basis, it looks like there is coating coming off or something like that. There are spots on the silverware that look like a coating is coming off or rust (I cannot tell). Anyhow, I do not feel that this should be happening in such a short period of time. I had purchased 2 sets of this silverware and now I will have to invest in more to replace these. This is not a good product that holds up. I would not recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"These are nice and sturdy, wont bend or break, and look great the day you take them out of the box. Never ever put them in a dishwasher and never use soap to wash them. I got 5 sets because we thought we finally found daily use flat wear that would last forever. Problem is they rust!!!!!!!!!! And it can happen in as little as one week after using them. I am extreamly disappointed in this item. Now i have to throw them away and start all over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Detergent not a problem, water maybe?","review":"I was thinking it may have to do with the water more than the detergent. I never paid attention to the lemon in the dishwasher detergents. In fact, I just checked and that is what we have been using! I am on Long Island and have had the set for at least 2 years using them every day. I've seen the occasional \\"rust-looking\\" spot which comes off by buffing it with a green pad. They have also gotten a few scratches, probably from throwing them in the dish washer against the other utensils. All in all they still look close to new!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect everyday flatware.","review":"I bought a set of this flatware at a store a few years ago and loved it. I decided I wanted to add to my existing set and buy another one. I looked everywhere and found a set at Pier 1 but they wanted something like $60. I don't know why I didn't look on Amazon first. This is the perfect everyday flatware. It is virtually indestructible because it is \\"forged\\" which, for those of you who might not know, means \\"all one piece\\" of stainless steel so there is no handle to break. The stainless steel is very sturdy and, even if I leave a piece in the sink for hours, it does not rust. And you can't beat that price with free shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable Boots","review":"These are the most comfortable shoes right out of the box I have ever purchased. They fit well and have the look and feel of very high quality. I would definitely give them five stars except that I had a very hard time getting them sized right, and had to return them at my own expense from two different sellers before I got the right ones. This is because Doc Martens are in UK sizes and even when you think you are getting the right size you may not be. I would make a phone call to the seller or send an email before ordering just to make sure before ordering or you may end up spending a lot more money on returns."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works, but is pricey","review":"I bought this to use w/ a Netgear WG302 v2. The most important thing to know in advance is that it does NOT come w/ a cable to attach to the wireless access point. Netgear recommends using any of its own branded antenna cables, and this is what I did. I am using the 5m cable (ACC 10314-03) and it works.However, I found that the WG302 with this antenna has provides less coverage for my 2 story colonial house than a Netgear WPN802 v1. I set the WPN802 into repeater mode and use the WG302 with this antenna as the access point. This arrangement works for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does it matter why one goes to war?","review":"This is the story of a young man who was in the front lines with an embedded video journalist. The young man is charismatic. He seems levelheaded. That's why they'd made him a sergeant. Then he's seriously wounded on his right side. The journalist embeds himself in the young man's civilian life thereafter. The contrast of who this person is startling between him in uniform on a battlefield, and him in civilian cloths in a department store looking at the video games. While at times the movie was moving \\"tediously\\", as another reviewer rightly mentions, what's most startling to me is his explanation why he joined the marines: to kill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hell and Back Again","review":"This docudrama follows Sgt. Nathan Harris after receiving an injury fighting in Afghanistan. Now he must deal with his healing and PTSD. The film captures what life is like for a soldier in battle and afterwards. It doesn't glorify it, but shows the truth of what it is like to be a soldier. Although slow at times, this film is worth viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"This movie was so frustrating. I felt like there were major plots that were totally ignored. It seemed like he had some PTSD which was not even addressed. I also wondered how he got off the pain meds since it did appear to be addicted. I was very uncomfortable with him playing with the guns. I don't see how a wife could just sit next to him 'playing' with guns.

Despite its relative stickiness, it has a lot going for it. Clean-up is a breeze. It comes with a little stainless steel scourer that makes quick work out any residue without much elbow grease. It can go in a very hot oven and even under the broiler without fear and it goes in the dishwasher. Another advantage is that, unlike Teflon, it allows you to develop a fond, the darkened bits left on a pan that, when dissolved, add a lot of flavor to sauces.The downside has more to do with the construction of the pan than its Cybernox interior. It has a stainless-clad aluminum disk on the bottom that isn't quite large enough. So you have to use a smallish flame on a gas stove to prevent scorching in the corners. In my opinion, the ideal pan would fuse Cybernox on to an All-Clad-type pan with an aluminum core that covers the whole base and goes up the sides."},{"rating":"1","title":"OEM fit, OEM problems","review":"While this tank works just as good as the original, it shares the same faults as well.Driving on rough roads likely will cause the tank to pop out of it's mount, and if you are lucky, that is all that happens.

Now, she just barely has on any clothes (i.e. the video for this song) and she's made a really bad image for herself. Sorry, but she does not respect herself.

The single includes \\"Loverboy\\" (with Cameo) and the remix of it featuring Da Brat, Ludacris, Twenty 2, and Cameo. The song has a good beat to it. Mariah hits all the high notes perfectly and as always, she has her sexy coos in the background."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another stool for the masses to consume","review":"Mariah Carey showed that her talent was no longer with her with her most recent joke entitled \\"Loverboy\\" (Awfully generic wouldn't you say) which is simply the song Candy being copied and adding Mariahs childish whining and amatuerish rappers. For someone who was so incredibly high up in the music world with such amazing music from 1990-1995 she has become nothing but a burnt out cinder of her former self. She will never come close to real talent like Celine Dion, Oleta Adams, Madonna or even Nelly Furtado. .. Her talent is truly wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mariah is losing it...fast!","review":"Mariah Carey doesn't even sing anymore!

I purchased the 6 station Niles to replace it. This unit has some physical weight, there is nothing tinny about it. The knobs and switches have a smooth yet positive feel. The attachments for the speaker wire are really the best part for me. You can remove the attachment blocks for each speaker, attach the wires (screw clamps) and then slide the blocks into the back of the unit. This is extremely helpful if your stereo is in a tight location as mine is. Also, the size of the wire openings is large enough to accommodate heavier gauge speaker wire. Finally, I am very happy being able to adjust the speaker volumes in different locations from the stereo. I have two sets outside and they have to be turned up higher, yet I don't want to blast out people inside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cross talk on Niles 6 speaker switch","review":"I bought the Niles 6 speaker selector on Amazon 6 months ago to replace my 6 speaker Monster switch that died on me. First, I couldn't beleive how small the connectors were! it was almost impossible to wire compared to the Monster Switch, but I thought ok, this is higher end equipment so once its done I'll be ok. After meticulously wiring all six speakers I noticed that I had cross talk, that is, when a speaker wasn't selected you could hear a noticeable sound from each spearker even though the volume control was off and the speaker unswitched. That to me was unacceptable. I played with it and couldn't fix it so I am replacing it with another Monster. I had heard mixed reveiws on Niles products and now I get it, they are not detail oriented."},{"rating":"2","title":"Niles SSVC6 Speaker Selector w Volume Control","review":"This was just what I was looking for.

Well it is true the film didn't compare to the originals but, the film was still enjoyable and keep my interest.

This movie does have that feel of the old movies in it, which I was glad it did. It was nicely filmed and the plot was nicely done.I'm not a huge fan of Shia, and the crystal skull logic was a tad off.. The myth about the skulls wasn't about aliens and it being their actual heads, the real crystal skulls in the world are that of human shapes.But.. rumor has it an Indy 5 is coming and will be the actual final movie of the series.

The Indiana Jones franchise is taken almost totally out of context here and regurgitated as an ill conceived cold war era/sci-fi version of tomb raider.This movie should never have been made.

The old Indy films all had marvelous location shoots and made the movie that much better. For such a big budget movie, it just looked cheap. As for the story, the fridge, and the aliens, well that just comes down to personal taste. For me the movie just didn't work. And a lack of a truly great Indy Villain didn't help either; the bad guys never once seemed threatening.After the Star Wars prequels and now Indy 4, George Lucas has proven that he is not to be trusted with his own creations anymore. Please, no more sequels or special editions to your old works. They are fine in their original states and need no continuation of story - walk away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is giving this movie 5 stars?","review":"Why? If you're a big fan of the first three, and have managed to not see this stinker then please, I beg you, hold on to the memories you cherished and don't let greed ruin a great trilogy for you. Hopefully Crystal Skull will end up being universally ignored like Terminator 3 and we can all collectively pretend like it never happened. This movie was beyond bad and added absolutely nothing to the ground work that was previously laid. It's a real shame... Save yourself, look away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Indy Has Jumped The Shark","review":"Ouch.... this was painful to sit through.I wanted to like it, I really did. The original RotLA was intense and exhilirating, with a great plot and storyline. I thought the last one released, where Indy's dad (Sean Connery) participates, was getting a bit hokey, but this last one was hopefully really the last one.Shia LeBouf as a 50s tough? SnortThis film was actually an exercise in how much really lousy CGI the studio could cram into its time frame. The entire thing was so patently unbelievable and cornball that any attempt at suspending disbelief was simply out of the question. For this we waited so long?No more please. Indy has jumped the shark and the sun is setting. This is what happens when people make movies only for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars out of 4","review":"The Bottom Line:Indiana Jones 4 hits the wrong notes from the start (kids driving while listening to rock music? In this franchise?) and never fixes itself; as a fan of the first three I found myself sinking into my seat, realizing with dawning horror that the movie kept finding ways to get worse--terrible CGI, an awful performance by Cate Blanchett, completely wasting John Hurt--and when it was over I couldn't believe that I had enjoyed National Treasure 2 more than an Indiana Jones movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried so hard to like this...","review":"Well, the movie settles it. George Lucas: NEVER bring back Han Solo! Ruining one childhood hero is enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"STOP MAKING MOVIES GEORGE LUCAS","review":"From the brainless script to the zombie-like performances of Harrison Ford and Karen Allen (Allen, in particular, acts like she's eaten a fistful of Ambien before each take, simply grinning behind vacant eyes...), to the CGI gophers and the fact that Indiana Jones doesn't do anything but walk around observing other people doing things for most of the movie, this was a complete failure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining effort, but not quite up to the first three","review":"This Indiana Jones effort is, in many ways, like Godfather III. It is an excellent movie but somehow seems to fall a bit short of its predecessors. There are some great moments to enjoy, like Shia LeBeouf's entrance looking like a young Marlon Brando on a motorcycle. Very 50's, indeed! If I could put my finger on one thing it would be the story line. The first three films in this series seemed to use a lot more of the globe in their stories. The entry is less diverse. Production values are excellent. It is an excellent film. However, for repeat viewing we will likely favor Raiders of the Last Ark, Last Crusade, Temple of Doom, and Crystal Skull in that order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"The movie was OK, certainly not as good as the others. However the biggest problem is if your Blue Ray player/TV connects together using Component cables you will only see 480i. Paramount has apparently disabled the HD output unless an HDMI cable is used. Recommend you buy the standard DVD if your setup needs Component cables. I have never seen this issue on any other disks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like getting kicked in the stomach.","review":"I have only thought of walking out of a movie a few times, and this was one of them. I felt like I was kicked in a very sensitive area with a very large boot ala Simpson's style. South Park's Trey and Parker had it dead on when they aired their response to Indy 4. There were so many things wrong with this movie, and I feel as if it makes Temple of Doom look oscar worthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh yuck","review":"A good friend of mine bought himself a Blue Ray player and a big old TV and then, as you do bought a couple of movies to watch and invited some friends over. I was the only person that went along for the show and about 20 minutes into this film I began to squirm.Sequels get a bad rap, but this was unnecessarily bad. If you want to watch an Indiana Jones movie got and buy a copy of Raiders of the Lost Arc and sit back and enjoy it, this is not even close to being in the same class. What you get instead is Harrison Ford trying his best to work with a bad script, a horrible plot in a movie that lacks suspense, joy, excitement or clarity. Blanchett's horrible Russian accent immediately confirmed that nobody who made this movie gave a damn about its outcome - it was just a pay day.That will teach him to buy movies without reading reviews first.

Ford appears in most scenes with the look and sound that he is on his last legs and it is such an effort to continue.The Direction by Speilberg is his worse yet, the movie just does not gell.I was amazed how much we are ment to believe, that the Russians were everywhere in the 50's and took over anywhere in the U.S. at will.The best part of the Movie for me was the opening shot with Elvis singing Hound Dog over the cars racing in the desert. This is a case of money not well spent, the only saving grace in this Movie was Ray Winston's solid preformance, sorry I can't say that about the rest of the cast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"Quite simply, this is a crummy movie -- a wholly unworthy successor to its three predecessors. If it didn't feature the Indiana Jones character (or, rather, a pale facsimile thereof) no one would bother seeing it or giving it more than three stars (to be charitable). The gaping plot holes, shoddy dialogue, overuse of CGI, and over-the-top-unbelievable action sequences have been amply covered by other reviewers, so I won't rehash them here. I'll just respond to those who claim that it's \\"only entertainment\\" that the movie doesn't even work on that level. \\"The Mummy\\" is a fun, entertaining movie; \\"Crystal Skull\\" is a plodding exhumation of a franchise that should have ended with \\"Last Crusade.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone please tell George Lucas to retire already","review":"As a fan since I was little of the original Indiana and Star Wars trilogy, I knew I had to at some point watch this movie but I waited till it came out on video because while it was in theaters I wasn't hearing many great things about it.Yeah, someone needs to help George Lucas understand that he should not be in the Production business much less ever write a script or (gulp) Direct. I think Spielberg did what he could with it as a Director but what I cannot stand is the horrible and completely out of date writing.The movie made a lot of money, but if Police Academy 12 had a marketing budget like this movie, I'm sure it would do well also.I think this movie was terrible and I really hope they do not make another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time and money","review":"Like just about everyone else on planet earth, I loved the first three Indiana Jones movies. So, like just about everyone else on the planet, I was seriously jazzed for the new one. MY LORD, IT SUCKED. Ford is walking through his scenes, there's no thrill, no adrenaline, lame CG, unbelievable nuclear blast scenes, unbelievable scenes where multiple Russians are spraying full auto fire at our heroes and no one's ever hit, etc etc. It's just not exciting--period. Unforgiveable...Spielberg, you signed off on this? People, be warned--it's BAD. And it's a damn shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a pitiful attempt by Spielberg and Lucas","review":"You can not even blame Harrison Ford's age for this disaster. The blame lies directly with Spielberg and Lucas for this pathetic attempt. From the flying fridge to the monkey rescue, this movie is worse than the last installment of The Mummy series. Poor effects and horrible script. I saw it opening weekend and twenty minutes into it I was looking at my watch and counting the minutes.However, I do hope they release another one because the current pattern dictates that the next one should be a classic. Raiders was, Temple of Doom was painful, Last Crusade was fantastic, and Crystal Skull was trash. If the pattern continues, the next one should be worth checking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"mindless comic book action","review":"i waited for almost 20 years for another jones adventure and they give usa mindless piece of comic book action like the pirates of the carribeanmovies. harrison ford is way to old to be playing the lead anymore. pleasespare me from any glowing reviews that this movie was worth watching.don't waste your time buying this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter travesty of a movie that wouldnt be worth buying even if it had $50 note inside the front cover.","review":"Poorly thought out movie with even worse execution.

A rather odd one, but I have heard the theory before for several different civilizations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Indianna Jones","review":"I can sum up this movie in 5 words, what was the director thinking? What really made this movie unbearable and just absolutly ridiculous was the the script! The mysterious crystal skull plot from the begining I felt was stupid, from the moment I saw it in the theater. And the way it lead to Aliens was just plain si-fi foolishness. I don't want to make too big a deal over it, but that's not the traditional Indiana Jones theme. I'm sure if you all remember they were no other wordly creatures in any of the movies. This was one was a real mockery of Indiana Jones.

My least favorite was the Temple of Doom, and it still is. So if you are ok with this movie better better than Temple, but not as good as the other two, then go for it.Otherwise, there are some major logic jumps that you have to just take and some wooden acting done my Shia Lebof as well as his mother (forgot her real name).This series they should have just left alone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My expectations were low, but even then.","review":"Indiana Jones movies are supposed to be a little silly.

The Last Crusade dealt with the Holy Grail, you bet, heavily based in magic and myth. The Crystal Skull...aliens?!?! Come on! I admit, the film gave the series an ending, but Shia LaBeouf's character was hollow and totally unbelievable. Indy was named after the dog, so Shia's name is \\"Mutt\\".

I'm a big fan of the original trilogy, and I watch those movies over and over again and never get tired of them. This movie doesn't even remotely compare to the original trilogy. I personally don't believe it should be a part of the Indiana Jones franchise. To me, it just seems like a poorly plotted out piece of fan fiction. I didn't find myself caring for the story or any of the new characters at all, although it was the ending that really killed it for me.

In this case, its the horrible story (thanks to George Lucas) and the stiff performance by Harrison Ford that dooms this movie. Neither one of these guys has done anything worthwhile in over a decade. Steven Speilberg doesn't do much better with his unimaginitive direction.

The story and script were terrible (aliens? Definitely killed this franchise). I feel bad that such a caliber actress like Cate Blanchett has a film like this on her resume. Shia LaBeouf is an over-rated actor who was a bore to watch on the screen. Harrison Ford just came off as an aging actor trying to hold on to his glory days. Time to move on from Indiana. While the older films were great, this one was nothing but a let down and it just goes to show that it's sometimes best to let things stay in the past where they belong. I guess since Steven Spielberg and George Lucas knew that they had an audience that would come to the movie regardless of what the story is they decided to just make a film with a flimsy script and add in a horrible character (LaBeouf)."},{"rating":"1","title":"the wost movie i have ever seen","review":"it was tarruble so bad in fact that i hope the derecters die choking on there own blood"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should've ended with the Last Crusade","review":"All the years Lucas had to come up with a good Indy Movie and this is the best he can do?

It had much of the spirit of Indiana Jones, but fell short of excellence.As a stand alone movie this one would be great, but we have to compare it to the original trilogy. It would have ben near impossible to match the greatness held by the others; for one Harrison ford is 20 years removed from the last movie. I understand the whole extraterrestrial aspect is troubling to some as it doesn't fall in line with the others,but I would argue its not that far from temple of doom where the human sacrifice remains alive despite having his heart removed.To sum up: This is a must see for the Indy fans out there, but don't expect it to occupy that same spot in your heart like the other three"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Spielberg movie","review":"This movie was poor for several reasons: getting geriatric harrison ford to star in this flick, bad continuity and just plain boring/totally unrealistic scenes.Examples: as indy is in the train and the young guy rides next to it on his motorcycle, and presto, all of a sudden they are sitting in a restaurant?! i mean, even a beginner director would not make a cut like that.in the chase scene through the university the bad guys windshield is destroyed by a statue's head, 2 seconds later the car is undamaged.The car chase scene in the jungle. First of all, this scene was way to long, and no, jungles do not have nice smooth roadways through them (in the scene two cars are even parallel to each other. wow, a 2 lane jungle highway)this was a sloppy, careless production mr. spielberg. as if just produced to make you a couple extra million for your kids or something. if this is all you are willing to produce from now on, save us the disappointments and go retire."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT COMPLETELY HORRIBLE, BUT LACKS THE MAGIC OF THE TRILOGY!","review":"Well, we knew they were going to do it, every other movie icon from the past 30 years has done it, so why not Indiana Jones?

It hasn't been a total loss as I did enjoy Rocky Balboa and the new Die Hard films, Rambo only had one good film to begin with, but Indiana Jones had a good run until this new feature film.The film is certainly watchable, but it's so over the top, it's more of a self parody, than a sequel. It just doesn't have the magic of the first three films. This is one time where \\"bigger is better\\" does not apply. I'm glad I found this in a bargain bin, because I'm sure I won't watch it very often.

Instead, I plodded my way to the silly end in this plastic film devoid of character or anything more engaging than the D-typical action fare by way of plot. Plastic best describes it. Cardboard characters lacking story, history, or engaging personality. A plot so surface that I couldn't even be bothered to conjecture what might come next - essential activity for suspense. A set that seemed plastic with effects that were uninspiring as well. At the end of this film I cared a great deal more for the two hours I willfully wasted on it than the five measly dollars down the tubes.

I really wanted to like this movie since I still have fond memories of seeing the first three in the theaters as a kid. This one, with it's over the top plot, bad acting by Cate Blanchett, and low marks on the believability scale, just doesn't fit in with the other three Jones movies. It just could have been so much better. No wonder Harrison Ford held off on making this one for so long. He wanted to be old enough so the memory of it probably wouldn't last too long.Maybe my son will like it someday since it's really a kid's movie.

Plus we are now supposed to believe that ants can eat people. It's not even a good Saturday Morning Cartoon. The original Indiana Jones movies were B-movies dressed up as A movies, and this is a B-movie dressed up as a D movie. Pitiful end to a high-caliber adventure series.

So Indy is back with a new side kick, who changes sides more than he changes underwear and is not 1% as likeable as Sallah from Raiders and Crusade. It's great to see Ford back in the fedora but this story was small when you consider it may be the last time we see this past centuries greatest film adventure hero. Mutt as Tarzan, annoying yes, and Spielberg saying he wanted to go back to basics with this one, as little CGI as possible, and the firts scene of the movie is a CG gopher, nice Steven, nice.It was just bad, I'll stick with the original 3, exactly as i have done with the Star Wars films, the original spark is gone and we are left with lead lined refrigerators."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go Greif","review":"I give this movie 2 stars due to its amalzying true protrayal of KGB agents.

The few references to the past movies was fun but the reveal at the end is well to add to just about every other review both pro and amateur...sucked (freakin aliens!?). This resembles so much of the really bad B-Movie knock-offs of Indiana Jones in the 80's just with a massively bloated budget. Don't bother with this Star Wars Prequel/War of the Worlds type garbage; download it and stick it to them like they stuck it to Indiana."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Skull Never Had a Brain","review":"The only thing missing from the plot of this movie is the kitchen sink. Rather than plot, and letting Harrison Ford have his usual sardonic romp, the writers and producers went through their \\"to do\\" lists from previous Indiana Jones movies and threw all that stuff in without regard to whether it moved the plot along, or was even entertaining. The result is a movie bloated with \\"stuff\\" and peopled actors who are going through the motions and counting the minutes until the camera finally runs out of film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dismal, disappointing disaster","review":"After waiting so long to make this movie, you'd think that they would have had time to come up with a great idea and a great script. But apparently they spent the past 20 years looking for the worst idea and worst script they could find. This movie was made to make money. No real effort was put into it to make it live up to the previous movies. They knew that people would shell out money to see it regardless of whether it was good or bad. So why bother making it good? My advice? Don't give these people money for being too lazy to make a good Indiana Jones movie. Skip it. Don't even rent it, just pretend it never happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Indiana Jones and the temple of bad scripts","review":"What a mess this movie was. Good to see Indy again but you can tell from the start that Lucas had approval over this script after rumors he threw out so many better scripts out the window (Frank Durapont anyone?).Indy surviving nuclear blasts, Rodents coming up from the ground and grinning at the camera, Shia LaBouf swinging from vines in a jungle with Monkeys and hardly any Marion. She barely has anything to say.Then you get the ending which comes out of a different movie.Suspending Disbelief is one thing but you gotta check your brain and taste at the door for this one.Lets hope they don't make any spinoffs with Indy's kid."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE INDIAN JONES MOVIES YOU DREADED TO SEE.....","review":"....is now on DVD.The most disheartening thing is to watch Harrison Ford amble so stiffly through the production. His responses are slow pivots. There is no tension or suspense to speak of.The Phantom Menace aside, this is the greatest validation for the The Beatles never having attempted a reunion.You can't go home again.(Unless you own the Ruby Red slippers, which - ironically - Spielberg does. Oh well, I guess he forgot to click his heels three times.....)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me?","review":"I have been an Indy fan since the first movie. That absolutely ends with this movie. This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen come out of the Lucas camp. Yes, even worse than Star Wars: Phantom Menace. They waited so long to come out with another title in this killer series, and when they do, it is junk. I can't even imagine what they were thinking when they came up with some of this worthless material (the nuclear fridge, the killer ants, vine swinging with the monkeys, etc, etc, etc.) This movie represents 122 minutes of my life that I will never get back. As far as I am concerned, there are only 3 movies in the Indiana Jones series, and this one definitely isn't one of them. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ug... Terrible","review":"I have never been more disappointed, that a movie I wanted to like so much, was just so terrible. This couldn't have been worse. South Parks spoof on this film was dead on..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to watch...","review":"Indiana Jones 4 was painful to watch- surving a nuclear blast in a refrigerator? the car chase scene in the jungle? aliens? seriously this was just pathetic and I was better off never seeing this movie, I wish I could un-watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Here's the thing... When you think Indiana Jones, you think quality action film. This was not quality by any means.1st of all, how can Indy's father of died? At the end of The Last Crusade, he drank from the Holy Grail so he's supposed to have eternal life. Instead of killing him off, just leave him out altogether.Then, ALIENS?! Are you serious?! This is an archeologist, not a UFO researcher. Just terrible. I saw it in the theater and really felt like I was ripped off. It's not even worth renting, much less buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"South Park had it right","review":"Indiana Jones gets raped by his creators. Story was dull, action was repetitive, and the ending was a) predictable and b) non-sensical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low bit rate for a 2008 transfer","review":"For enthusiasts, the bit rate of this DVD stays around or below 5 Mbit/s most of the time. Compression artifacts such as mosquito noise and block noise can be seen often. For an anamorphic 2.31:1 movie transferred in 2008, that's below standards, considering the running time is only 122 mins and there aren't many extras. (I do not intend to review the movie here).They must be doing this to sell blu-ray discs, what a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"almost as bad as the holocaust","review":"People condemn Lucas for this atrocity, but Spielberg can also be condemned. His nostalgia got the better of him, so we have three (THREE) references to Marcus Brody and one to Indy's dad, along with a very unnecessary Marion Ravenwood return and the predictable Indy jokes about getting old. This was their chance to do something new with Indy. Lucas and Spiel blew it, serving us a feast of rotten tidbits we'd eaten too many times before: the evil bad guy, the car chases, the big huge guy indy has to fight at some point, the ancient relic that hold ancient powers.How can two legends of film armed with hundreds of millions of dollars, a legion of crew members, one of America's most beloved characters and nineteen years in which to do it accomplish what will go down as one of Hollywood's most embarrassing films?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Calm Down Haters!","review":"All the people that hate Crystal Skull for its silly unrealistic nonsense, loved the first three for their silly unrealistic nonsense. You say waterfall scene, I'll raise you Indy being taken over by an evil Hindu god, you say fridge scene, I'll raise you 900 year old knights. The point of Indy is not to be a gritty realistic thing. In that case we would have just seen him dieing of some degenerative disease. Now would that have been more fun? I think not. Four stars: because it made me smile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than Temple of Doom","review":"To be honest this was one of the worst sequels I've ever seen. It was a true letdown because I've been a fan of Indy since I can remember. Raiders was fantastic, Temple was so-so, and Last Crusade was perfect. But this, this was pretty sucky. One thing I just couldn't get over was the aliens. Aliens shouldn't be in Indiana Jones. I think George Lucas got his franchises mixed up. Second is Indy having a son. Don't get me wrong I thought Shia Lebeouf was great, but his character was unnecessary. Now I did like Indy taking on Commies, that was one of the few good things about it. Harrison Ford really let me down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ending to the Indian Jones Movies","review":"Bought this movie to complete my Indiana Jones trilogy. I loved all the movies and enjoyed this one as well. Great ending to a great movie epics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another fun romp through Indyland!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Let's face it, nothin will ever match \\"Raiders\\" but this is a far cry better than \\"Temple of Doom\\" which I apsolutely hated. It was fun to see Karen Allen again and I think she has aged very gracefully - doesn't look as though she's paid a dozen visits to a plastic surgeon. I admit that I found the whole ET storyline a little far fetched but I still had a great time watching this film. I also really enjoyed all the little bits which paid homage to the past films."},{"rating":"1","title":"George Lucas Needs to STOP!!!!!","review":"Wow, leave it to George Lucas to ruin a franchise. The only 2 good ideas he's ever had Star Wars and Indiana Jones, have been completely ruined by him. KOTCS is full of cheesy affects (I hate those Monkeys),and horrible dialogue.The only terrific thing in this movie is Harrison Ford. The man, the legend is back and manages to salvage this CGI mess.Seriously, why so much CGI??? Take a lesson from movies like The Dark Knight and just use old fashion film making.If there will be a 5th, I'm all for it, but keep Lucas out."},{"rating":"1","title":"No exageration when I say this is THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN","review":"Seriously, Robocop 3 is a masterpiece compared to this trash. The plot is razor thin and the dialogue is at the level of crap one has come to expect from George Lucas. This confirms that George Lucas is a hack. Easily the worst of the three Indiana Jones movies. Don't waste your time with this. A more appropriate title for this would have been \\"The Quest For More Money\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie is medicore. This is more of a review of Amazon.","review":"Bought it new from amazon, received a used-resealed copy with a old price sticker on it. Disc also had fingerprints all over it. Normally I love Amazon, but this was unacceptable. I didn't buy it from a 3rd party either, it was straight from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"RAIDERS OF THE LOST ART","review":"BELIEVE ALL THE NEGATIVES FOR THIS ABOMINATION AND BETRAYAL OF THE INDY SERIES. MONEY IS THE ONE TRUE GOD FOR THESE FILMAKERS AND THEIR ONLY JUSTIFICATION FOR TURNING OUT THIS TRAIN WRECK. THEY COULD NOT LEAVE WELL ENOUGH ALONE AND JUST HAD TO DESTROY WHAT WAS A LEGENDARY LEGACY OF FUN AND ADVENTURE. EVERYTHING ABOUT THE PRODUCTION REEKS...STORY, SCRIPT, ACTING, STUNTS, EFFECTS...etc. NO THOUGHT, NO ORIGINALITY, NO INSPIRATION, NO MAGIC...NO RESPECT FOR THE ART OF FILM THEY ONCE ELEVATED.

It is full of bumbling attempts at humor and/or action that just constantly left me thinking, \\"Why aren't they (the heroes) dead yet?\\"Though one of my favorite actors, Harrison Ford's career is probably over as of this movie. Sad, considering that he did a pretty decent job with a thoroughly crappy script, crappy directing, crappy production.The idea of bringing aliens into the Indiana Jones legacy didn't bother me one bit; I actually thought that was one of the better points of the movie. Just the fact that the whole thing reminded me a lot more of the Keystone Kops than anything else... Like Indiana Jones meets Ishtar... SO LAME. If you haven't seen this yet, don't bother. It has all the worst points of Temple of Doom, cubed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crystal Skull Price ?","review":"I have not seen this movie and thought about buying it ? What is with this movie being 4 to 5 dollars more than a normal new release ? Is George Lucas worried about gas prices or the economy ?

Are they trying to make up for the computer made Star Wars movie that flopped ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waited 19 Years for This Nonsense?!","review":"Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was a COMPLETE ripoff.This is the best they could do after 19 years between films?If you haven't seen the movie yet...don't waste your $.Wait for the original trilogy to come out on blu-ray.If anyone gave this move 4 or 5 stars, they need to be on medication!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"145 IDIOTS AND COUONTINGS","review":"How the heck could 145 people, and counting, like anything about this extremely stupid and ridiculous movie. It's was bad the whole way through, and the aliens? WTF, is all I got done saying. I just couldn't get over the fact the I couldn't believe how old Harrison Ford looked. Thankfully, I saw a bootlegged version, so I didn't sink any money into the pockets of anyone associated with this Hollywood garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"19 years well worth it!!!!","review":"I was only 4 years old when the last Indiana Jones movie came out, and since then I have loved watching every minute of the first three. Watching this, knowing critics did not like it, I was still so excited.The movie has some parts that do seem outdated with some of the technologies available they were still doing basic filming, but then again, that's what made IJ great so many years ago. The story reunites Marion Ravenwood with long lost lover, Indy Jones. What a great pair. Shia LaBeouf actually does a great job, obviously being the next in line for the indy movies.All in all, pretty solid story. Russians trying to control the world...with mind power...from aliens... I can see why some people panned this movie so hard, but watching it is good ole fun. For past Indiana Jones fans, this is just another chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"aliens in indiana","review":"Why did they have to have aliens in this series. There are hundreds of great unsolved mysteries of the world that could have made a better story. Southparks portrayal of this movie best describes this movie. Beware Indiana Jones fans. Don't taint your eyes"},{"rating":"1","title":"An inferior sequel.","review":"This movie truly represents the low quality movies that are coming out today. I love all the Indiana Jones movies and even once inspired me to become an archaeologist. However this movie like Lucas Star War pre-trilogy shows how Hollywood heavily depends on CGI versus a good story. There is no great suspense or surprises that catch the viewer off guard such Marian surviving in Raiders of the Lost Ark nor the great sense of danger shown in the rail carts in the Temple of Doom. While I was wanted to watch another Indiana Jones, but I learned a painful lesson. Somethings are not worth revisiting with new sequels, modern remakes, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kingdom of the Crystal Crap","review":"I wish I could give a better rating to such an anticpated movie. Indiana Jones 4 looked good in the previews, and the characters and action stand out very well. This time, Indy is fighting the Russians during the Cold War, and this works well, nothing bad.Unfortunately, with this story, it became too goofy, and seemed slapped together after almost twenty years since part three. Some of the action sequences are bad (fighting evil CGI ants-please), and without telling you the ending (which really ruined the movie for me), I think Indy 4 falls short of the standards in the first three films.I am looking forward to a part 5 and then they need to call it quits. Harrison Ford is almost 69 years old at the time of this review, so finishing part 5 will hopefully come sooner, rather than later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Expectations, No Disappointment","review":"I'd like to ask George Lucas and Steven Spielberg why...why did they make and release this piece of crap? They certainly don't need the cash, and they just as certainly weren't under the impression that they had an Oscar-winning classic on their hands. This movie sucks on multiple levels. It sucks as a story because...there's no story. It sucks as a thriller because...you got it, no thrills. It sucks as a sequel because it smells so bad it calls the whole franchise into question. Plus, the special effects were mediocre and unnecessary. George and Steven knew they had a stink-bomb and they knew it long before the wrap party. I just thought they had a scrap more integrity than this, that they wouldn't unleash this dog and sic it on their loyal fans. That's what I get for expecting any degree of integrity from anyone in Hollywood."},{"rating":"1","title":"All good things must come to an end","review":"Unfortunately, the Indy franchise was well past that best-when-used-by date before this movie was released. As much as I've love the Jones character, played by Harrison Ford, it was a different character than the one played by a now, much older, Ford. I'm not sure whether his heart simply wasn't in it or if script was so bad it never gave him a chance, but the suspension of belief to watch this movie just wasn't possible. The supporting cast just didn't make for me either. Karen Allen was in it for the money and the her storyline was simply weak. And the LaBeouf character was there as eye candy for the younger set who, presumably, find him to be a star. As far as the script goes without giving any spoilers away, it was ridiculous. Apparently, the director, Spielberg, had a few spare alien CGI characters laying around from Close Encounters that he needed to use.All in all, a major, if not totally unexpected, waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny as the previous ones. Most of the stunts have been done before.","review":"This movie is not as funny as the previous ones.Most of the stunts have been done before.Special effects in some scenes look fake. For example, the scene where the ants attack the guy.It has references to aliens at the end. I believe aliens is more suitable in Star Wars."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Last Crusade should have been the last crusade","review":"The story of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is dull, forced, and awkward. If you are \\"lucky enough\\" to see the special features, you will even hear Steven Speilberg himself admit that he was done with Indiana Jones after the third movie (Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade)---There's a reason why Indy rode off into the sunset at the end of that movie. Spielberg was forced by George Lucas to make this fourth movie, which feels like it was written on the fly.As for Harrison Ford's performance: He looks okay, but Indy appears tired and the action scenes are almost painful to watch. Plus, the special effects are overdone.Don't bother. Save your money. Skip this one. I was really disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie I've seen this year","review":"I would have given this movie no stars if I could have. The script is awful. The action sequences lack spontaneity. The effects and backgrounds are too obviously generated by CGI. The crystal skull itself is cheesey looking, like a big plastic case filled with crumpled cellophane. Marion and Indy meet again and there's absolutely no chemistry left between them. Even the lighting and sound are amateurish. A big disappointment from Spielberg, Lucas, Ford, especially given that they had sworn off making another sequel for \\"the right script.\\" THIS was the right script?? Dreck."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Temple of Doom\\" is a 5 Star Classic Compared to this Turkey!!!","review":"Just fifteen minutes into this film I realized how bad it was-Ford acting stiffly when his stunt double or CGI twin isn't running around like a cartoon character; ugly, visually obnoxious looking color photography in dim lighting; bad acting straight from a Ed Woods film."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disapointment!","review":"This movie sucked. All that time waiting for the script and the rewrites for this piece of garbage.Should have been called Raiders of the lost plot or Indiana Jones and the lazy director. George Lucas is by far the worst director in the world. What a waste of $7. Would have given it no stars if that was an option."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's","review":"not to love about this \\"classic\\" series. I like Harrison Ford a lot, he is a competent actor and the story is fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Enough to Dazzle","review":"I've watched this movie three times now, and appreciate it a bit more each time, but can't see myself giving it 5 stars; it simply isn't as good as the first film, which is deserving of the 5 star tag. However, this newest installment of the Indiana Jones series has much to offer. I think Harrison Ford does great in his 60's. He leaves nothing in the bag in terms of energy and attitude. I absolutely love the library scene, as it's probably one of the most entertaining sequences in the whole series. Cate Blanchett is spectacular in her role, and really gives this movie a boost with her accent and hard edge. Karen Allen doesn't carry that same flare and energy that she had in Raiders as Marion Ravenwood, but at least it's not distracting. This film is signature action as it should be in this legendary series. This movie proves that even an aging Indy still has it. And remember.....\\"If you're going to be a great archaeologist, you gotta get out of the library!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is horrible!","review":"If there's anyone out there who actually enjoyed watching this flick, I'd be amazed. What a shame they destroyed the final segment to an awesome franchise with this stinker. I'd rate it a 3 out of 10. It's worth it to watch just because it's Indiana Jones, but DON'T buy it; rent it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best, but, not the worst either","review":"This movie was fun. The 1st movie in the series is still the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"A FUN, ENTERTAINING FILM!","review":"Hey, I liked it. I can say all the negative stuff but it was good to see the man in the hat back up on the big screen again. I've watched this movie 3-5 five times since i got the dvd and i thoroughly enjoy it. It's got aspects of all the movies wrapped up in one. Heck, it even mentions an event from the Young Indiana Jone's TV show. It also brings more depth into the character of Indiana Jones and the whole meaning of his life.I can say, though, that he only uses his whip three times (twice is in the very beginning, and once at the end to toss to mac)which is the least he ever used it in any of the other ones. Some more whip swinging and snapping and booby traps would have added more to the feature. But I still enjoyed it nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indy's Back!","review":"A return to the Saturday matinee thrills of yesteryear, with Harrison Ford in terrific form and some memorable set-pieces courtesy of director Steven Spielberg. Despite a slow midsection, \\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\" (2008) is a more satisfying adventure than \\"Temple of Doom.\\" Ford manages to hold the film together, but why do producers shove nonentities such as Shia LaBeouf down our throats? Luckily, there is Cate Blanchett's villainy, Ray Winstone's comic relief and Karen Allen's spirited reappearance as Marion Ravenswood. The formula still works and a fourth sequel would be welcome - minus LaBeouf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left the Biblical themes behind for tired old typical one.","review":"Without giving away the end i will just say you are better off passing on this movie. Indy has always been my fav movie charecter but this movie ruined the memory.I even thought George Lucas was brilliant for his historic films. Seeing this i realized what a 1 trick Pony he really is.I wanted to give it 1 star. I have waved all my friends/family away. There is a reason the movie is already in the Budget Bin for a new release. It gets 2 stars for nostalgia only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Indiana Jones, too much of a good thing","review":"Unfortunately, there is way too much of an effort of this film to get laughs. The sarcasm is over the top. The film, apparently, was directed at a much younger audience, who care more about fast-paced action than a intricate plot.The special effects were way overboard and took away from any real storyline and/or dialogue. Entertaining, perhaps, but in my opinion this series has come to a screeching hault."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think this is my last Lucas/Spielberg film... ever.","review":"Yes, it's a very bold statement to never want to see a Lucas or Spielberg film again. But all of the negative commentary you've heard about the movie was true. Miracle refrigerators that save Indy from nuclear testing, Lebeauf swinging in the trees with the monkeys, crystal skulls that look like they were purchased from a local costume shop, and of course... ALIENS. And let's not forget that all the \\"special\\" effects look like nothing more than CGI on a soundstage. At the very least, the first three are classic, epic films. If you love the first three, please don't see this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Fn killed my memory of Indiana Jones BASTARDS!!!!","review":"I was pretty dissapointed with this movie. So many things just did not add up or seemed slapped together. Like after umpteen yrs later Marion shows up and in like 1 day falls in love with Indie? What the heck? And to heck with Shia Laboufe (don't care about spelling his name). His acting just plain sucks. I don't understand why he shows up in big movies like this and Transformers? For some reason he just ruins movies for me. I understand that you have to accept some unbeleivable stuff to enjoy a movie like this but for some reason this just seemed one far fetched scene after another. Mutt swinging from vine to vine and heading off the cars...come on. I'm glad to see Indie again but really saddened that this is how I have to remember him. I was happier before."},{"rating":"1","title":"END FOR INDY","review":"Wow, you know when Speilberg misses he really misses. Im in my thirties so I grew up on Indiana Jones and I was really jazzed that they were making a new one...uh until I saw the finished product that is. Harrison Ford, geritol love him, does his very best, and frankly he is by far and away the best thing about this movie. Let me state right off, I am no fan of Shia LaBouef, I just dont get his popularity at all, and he is totally miscast in this film, and lord, Cate Blachette is just as bad, that accent is hilarious. Really, I cant state strongly enough how disappointed I was in this film, if it had not been for my love of Harrison Ford, I would have given it one star. Hopefully, this is the last Indy, it's just a shame it had to end on such a lackluster film..Professor Jones deserved better, hellz I deserved better..really I want my money back..hummm..wonder who I contact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aliens? Seriously??","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this film. Mind readers and aliens belong on a Stargate sequel, not Indiana Jones, but that's exactly what happens here. There is some good action, some decent humor, but the plot is absolute garbage. For me, I'm going to pretend that this Indiana Jones movie never existed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Indiana Jones should have accepted tenure and wrote books for the rest of his career","review":"Aside from the major impossiblities that have been pointed out a thousand times (surviving in the fridge, Tarzan swing, and the list goes on..), my problem with the story is that introducing aliens goes completely away from what I thought the 'Indy universe' was all about. Indy was always searching for religious relics, whether it was the ark, the holy grail, or the stones. They weren't all Christian relics, but they were religious in nature. Introducing the alien element just takes a sudden turn into another world. I think that I could have given this a 3 star rating if the aliens had been some kind of Gods instead. At least would have kept with the spirit of protecting religious relics. Lucas seems to have fallen in love with CGI and forgot who his characters are.I'm going to have to side with Trey Parker and Matt Stone...Lucas and Spielberg raped Indiana Jones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Speilberg lost his touch.","review":"What a terrible movie. I know that some movies are meant to be entertaining but this was a ridiculous movie. I liked Temple of Doom way better. The plot of this movie was horrible, see monkey scene to know what I mean.

In fact, it does not even seem like a Steven Spielberg movie at all. Not exciting, and none of the non-stop action of earlier movies. Moreover, the characters were not engaging, with the possible exception of Shia LaBoeuf, who was as engaging as possible for the part he had. The talented Cate Blanchett should have said no to the ridiculous part they gave her, which was reminiscent of Boris and Natasha from Rocky & Bullwinkle. I didn't care about Karen Allen's character, and Indy just looked tired. The plot was drivel. Aliens? Puh-lease! The only thing that earned this movie two stars was the gorgeous visual impact. The costumes and sets were lush and authentic-looking for their era. It was a beautiful visual treat. Aside from that, I really didn't care for or about this movie at all. I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Jones is Back!","review":"Indiana Jones' thrilling return to the big screen was well worth the wait. \\"Crystal Skull\\" packs all the classic feel and action of a good ol' Indy flick with the added talent & charm of Transformer's Shia LaBeouf as well as slick CGI effects. However those CGI effects don't take the place of traditional stunt work where the film shines with its action scenes. Also present is plenty of comedic moments aided by Harrison Ford's one-liners and Shia LaBeouf's usual fun performance. Pack it up with splendid storytelling that unfolds the puzzle of a plot and John Williams epic score, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is a winner. I had my doubts that this film could pull it off after so many years and an aged Harrison Ford but there's something about Indiana Jones that's timeless."},{"rating":"1","title":"No merchandise received","review":"I ordered this video from Videos For Less through Amazon.com, paid for it in full but have never received anything.

Personally, I'm just gonna try and forget that I ever saw this movie and imagine a better set of adventures for a movie hero that deserved better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"AGH!","review":"This is like watching an accompanying movie for a Disney ride or something, its seems really shoddy. Best example is the scene where Marion and Indy start sinking in quicksand. Just watch that awful scene, even if it was in an older Indy movie it would have at least looked better. Is it the lousy LEGO sets? The bright cheery color scape (where the EPIC shadowing go?) could be a problem as well maybe? Or the fact the movie is one CGI gag after another, THIS IS NOT STAR WARS. TRY TRY TRY TRY to make it somewhat believable, a slow thoughtful pace doesn't hurt either, and oldschool un-ridiculous flesh and blood stunts are nothing to be ashamed of, and a semi serious attempt at story wouldn't have hurt either. This was like a terrible big budget sitcom, only you know the budget didn't make it any better. Go You Tube the Indy Tribute movie made by those two kids on VHS tape over a span of 13 years or more, from when they were little to 20 something, its far more stunning than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Movie","review":"I have never had the desire to actually leave the theater while watching a movie until this one. Horrible acting, plot and special effects. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an Indy movie!","review":"I have to echo the same sentiments as others here. I have been a lifelong fan of both Indiana Jones and Harrison Ford, but this movie made my insides hurt.I think Harrison did GREAT as Indy - his age didn't bother me one bit. Shia did a good job as well. Everything else, though, was awful. Aside from the acting, plot and CGI garbage that was all too prominent, the number one issue for me was that Indy never saves the day.In every other movie Indy met and overcame insurmountable odds. It is what makes Indiana Jones... well.. Indiana Jones! Whether fist fighting a camp of Nazis, a mine full of Thuggee cultists or fighting a tank on horseback, Indy always managed to beat the odds with wit or grit or being just plain too stubborn to quit.In Crystal Skull this just never happens. In fact, Indy is saved by others more than he rescues them! Indy is supposed to be an adventure *hero* - what happened to that???Shame on Lucas and Spielberg both for tarnishing the Indy name!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies I have ever seen.","review":"I rented this after hearing the bad reviews, and I'm glad I didn't waste the money to see this in a theater.This film is, without a doubt, one of the worst movies I have ever seen.The special effects are terrible, the script is awful, and this is absolutely the worst performance I have ever seen from Harrison Ford. He seems tired and bored throughout the entire film, and his supporting cast is no better.I wouldn't watch this again unless I was being paid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"I absolutely loved this movie. I thought Harrison Ford reprised his role as Indiana Jones perfectly. Shia was excellent as his son and Marion was great too. Some have thought the story line a little far fetched but I would remind them that all of Indie's stories haven't exactly been realistic. This movie fits right in with its predecessors and is a lot of fun. I hope they make more."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOW LAME CAN YOU GET???","review":"Its not a one star movie but it is LAME. I cannot believe how these creative giants, Spielberg and Lucas would ever put there seal on this let alone Create it. It is campy, almost a spoof on the whole series, with everyone just walking through the parts. The ridiculousness of the plot, the villians, the character interactions all combine to create the conclulsion this movie was made only for money. My question is why. The monster mogals have far more than they can ever spend so why tarnish their reputations. It did promote Spielbergs belief on Aliens, but he could have picked a far more intelligent vehicle. Oh well, let me just close by saying this was not even worth renting, a waste of TIME a very precious commodity indeed.

I just don't understand the negativity. This is Indiana Jones. Unlike the others in the series, this film takes place in the 50's, which the filmmakers felt it should reflect the Sci-Fi films of that era, much like what they did with the other three and with the serials of the 30's.In a series where thousands of years old boobie traps still work, surviving a plane crash with just a dingy, still being alive after having your heart ripped out, driving and crashing into a deep crater and walking out like nothing, as well as the countless other things that force you to expand your belief more than people realize, this film fits in just fine.I honestly believe that anyone who can say anything bad about this film just doesn't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Indy Noooooooooo!","review":"Its all about the money.

Now 20 years ago that might of been a good thing. But since the Phantom Menace, he must think the general movie going audience's are retards. I was insulted to no end watching this movie, sure it had some fun moments, but fun moments do not a good movie make. The whole thing was predictable, and the parts that were not were just terrible. I still love Harrison Ford and I still love the first 3 films, but there's something that happens to a artist when they're not hungry anymore. They lose that passion that made their early stuff so fun. Spielberg and Lucas are not hungry anymore and this film is another example. I will always cherish their early work. There is no soul here, just a bunch of people who know that if you put \\"Indiana Jones\\" in the title it's gonna make a lot of cold cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this Indiana Jones or E.T.?","review":"This movie was a waste of my time and money. I'm a Indiana Jones fan but this movie was idiotic. I would like to know what Spielberg's big fixation is with space aliens.

I have had lightning storms, blown transformers, and many other outages. This product protected my Sony TV, Sony receiver, Panasonic Blu-Ray player and my 360 with no problem. I did get the HTS 1000 as a gift for Christmas, so I will be upgrading...but I have no problem doing that with another Monster product. It's not that I don't believe the other reviewers...it's just that I feel that the good products need to be balanced out from the 1-star reviews they are given.

And I'm sure I didn't even pay half of what I did for this Monster one.

Certain outlets had to have the plug jostled and delicately balanced inside in order for them to work. Finally, I began hearing a strange crunch sound when I jostled the plugs, and I knew it was the end. This is not audiophile quality equipment, and shouldn't be thought of as such. That being said, I have had noise and surge protectors made for musicians that have toasted after a few years. So who's to say what is what in that regard. I probably wouldn't buy another one, but you can bet I will try to return the one I have for an exchange.

The other day my wife plugged in a small space heater and it the power went out for our tv. I guess that should be expected since it was probably more amperage than the strip was designed for. The problem is that the reset button will not reset it. This is annoying because even the $8 strip I got from Walmart will reset when it trips.

I find myself wondering if their not having been included made the difference in someone's deciding whether to give it that wide theatrical release.Another purely personal opinion: I found Vera Farmiga less interesting than Nick and the actress playing the young woman with whom he'd been in love. Most of that actress's role wound up in the \\"deleted scenes.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Quid Pro Quo","review":"The storyline is so original and the characters are played brilliantly by Vera Famiga and Nick Stahl.

It's a rare that a person in a wheelchair can be honestly portrayed as neither bitter nor heroic. Even rarer is a woman who enters his life for her own reasons. There's not so much a twist ending as a gradual unfolding of where each of them is coming from. It's slightly like the 1996 \\"Crash\\" but more literal.

The characters are acted in such a way as to make you care about what happens to them.It's looely based on the books. The movie ends in a way I won't spoil.

Clint Eastwood does well in a role that is out of character for him - someone who has to follow orders to the T. The only downside to the movie is the dated special effects. But the music which is used when we first see the 'Firefox' makes up for it by giving the plane a menacing character.A final word to Warner Bros - judging by the quality - or lack of it - released on DVD from the same period, I cannot see why you guys have not launched a DVD.

There are so many people who feel they need to psycho-analyze every little thing about a flick. If everything was so real, it wouldn't make much of a movie. And please don't listen to Leonard Maltin (as if anything this critic had to say had any value). I say, just sit down, shutup, and relax. This is classic Eastwood, and fun to watch.

The character development was nice, but not as good as in the book. The action is good, but some of the speical effects were (even for 1982 standards) so-so. The pan- and-scan does not do justice at all, and the planes look terribly out of proportion. The takeoffs that we see (off of both \\"runways\\") are poor at the end.If you've read the book, don't watch the movie. If you've seen the movie, read the book.

It was part parody - part horror and if you are willing to just have fun, it was very clever I thought. Another reviewer said the characters were one dimensional. I thought just the opposite. I thought they were evil, conflicted, good, innocent and purposeful. I didn't expect much from this movie, but was very pleasantly surprised. And Bruce Campbell. He had a pretty small part, but lets face it...This guy is great. He can take any role and have fun with it and let the audience have fun with him.

He then focuses on a litany of topics unrelated to time management: \\"staying comfortable on your flight,\\" \\"use pictures, graphs and charts to enhance your presentation,\\" \\"ten ways to avoid killing a sale.\\"Oh, and he even mistold an anecdote on Calvin Coolidge.

He contradicts himself too much. Makes you wonder if anyone ever proofed the book BEFORE it went to press.Also, this book is a bit old now .... but the subject is still relevant. I hope that a new T.M. for Dummies comes out again... but with a different author..... oh, and the only reason I gave this 2 stars was for the cheatsheet at the beginning of the book.

All the nuances, colorful personalities, and superstitions that occur every day at racetracks around the world are spoofed here in a fun and extremely entertaining fashion that will make this a classic. The comedy itself is delivered flawlessly by an all star cast including Richard Dreyfuss and Terri Garr.

How is it that I discovered this on HBO in the early '90's and consider it one of the more amusing movies I've seen? I don't get it. There are so many endearing characters and amusing scenes that this movie is one to be viewed whenever you need a little grin, or if you are about to play the ponies yourself.If there is a criticism of this movie, it's that the love angle between Garr and Dreyfus never really comes alive. This is in contrast to every other relationship in the movie- everyone plays their parts to the hilt, and the movie just \\"sings\\".In some ways I am glad almost nobody has seen this; when I recommend it, I know I am going to get a favorable report.Warning: If you have a bad habit of over-quoting movies (as I do!)... beware.

Richard Dreyfuss is great as the \\"can't lose\\" cabbie who has a really good day at the track. Jennifer Tilly cracked me up as the ditzy brunette who doesn't know which way is up. Robbie Coltrane is also hilarious as he gets a change of attitude when Jay Trotter has his good day. The character of Trotter is very facsinating. It's someone we can relate to. He's always been a born loser, then something comes along to change his life. Along the way, he gains friends and admiration. He's an everyday everyman.

Even if their songs had an \\"80's\\" feel to them, they were always guitar rock at their core. Not anymore. With the departure of Don Barnes, and the arrival of Max Carl on Keyboards, their trademark sound was gone. Gone was Barnes's strong guitar and vocals. In was Carl's cheesy, even wimpy, keyboards. I'll give him his due, he is not a bad singer, but he has no edge, no attitude. Simply put, he is not a rocker. Jeff Carlisi and Donnie Van Zant are the only reason this gets 2 stars. Otherwise, it's a 1 star effort. They just didn't sound like 38 Special anymore. They became a pop band. Ronnie was rolling in his grave over this one. How could his brother be a part of something like this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooooooring!","review":"Don't waste your money.

The cast of characters is continually shuffled around in a landscape that is equal parts real and unreal. (Cairo itself IS a major character in the story.) The results are very entertaining, albeit very dark. The Father of Cats, in particular, is a particularly chilling villian. I read this book for a week, and each night I would read it in bed, before I fell asleep.

Then, once he said what he had to say, he started drfting into roles that he walked through. They singularly lacked inspiration, originality, or energy. This is one of those mediocre films: while they tried to spice it up with the multiple role playing, most of the jokes in this - not to forget the entire plot - fall pretty flat. To make up for the lack of a spark, it just gets more vulger and outlandish.Not recommended, except for devotees."},{"rating":"2","title":"A super plus for Eddie and African Americans","review":"Hard to believe I'm the only one who commented on this film.

He goes to America to find a wife and does so but not without trails and tribulations=antics.One of the funniest scenes is when he goes into a bar to look for a wife.

Quite well, he gets the girl, gets employee of the month and kicks the greazy headed Soul Glo King to the curb.Seriously this is Eddie's best movie. This flick is a laugh a minute.

You owe it to comedy to own this movie.Oh, and I noticed that one person copied that fake aritcle online into a post about how Zamunda is a real place.

I don't scour these pots and pans or use very rough cleaning pads, but the Teflon-wannabe coating on the pieces themselves certainly explains the great deal I got on this set at JCPenney Home Store. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money to get a nicer brand. You'll end up buying new ones before too long anyway when this one rusts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battery Aid","review":"There are several different kinds of batteries that have all been either long-lasting, or just short on the wallet.

The colors come out flat and grayish. There is also visible cross-hatching. The software allows you to make adjustments to brightness and contrast, etc., but the interface is clunky and you can't see how your adjustments have affected the photo until you scan it. I cannot recommend this product for people who are primarily intersted in scanning photos.Also, the scanner I purchased (by mail) came with some fogging and dust on the inside of the glass and HP customer \\"service\\" is a hellish experience (which is only available on weekdays and limited hours on Saturdays)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was a 5 star printer now 1 star is too much","review":"I've used the 2175 all-in-one for 4 years with complete satisfaction.

After a lot of headaches, a through testing of the printer for about 10 hours, searching on the web for answers, I finally found what I needed to hear. You can replace the defective drivers of this printer with the HP Deskjet 990c when you set up this printer. If you bought this printer for maybe copying and printing, you can just install the 990c's drivers on XP and skip the SOFTWARE THAT HP FORCES YOU TO INSTALL. Anyway, good printer for the money, but HP really tried to screw their customers with bad drivers (I would assume a bad executive trying to squeeze more sales), and they're going to pay for it in sales of other printers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great when it works!","review":"For the moment I am ready to put this out for the garbage guy.

The romance between Lady and Tramp is so sweet without being overdone. As for the songs, they are not up there with other Disney songs (Circle of Life, Whole New World, etc.) but are certainly memorable--especially \\"He's a Tramp\\" sung by the incomparable Peggy Lee.

I cannot even think of it without becoming overwhelmed by emotion. I can actually steel myself against DUMBO's Baby Mine, but no matter how I coach myself (\\"It's just paint on plastic, for Pete's sake!\\") I am swayed by Disney's band of geniuses.

Those beloved actors of 1955, put the soul in their diction. Those of now, they recite as if they are reading a book. In short, that for those that we had liked to hear it in same spanish of 50's, the movie has lost all its charm. Why Disney have had to change the original dubbing?

The themes of loyalty, rejection, and the question of \\"freedom\\" are subject matter Disney had never dealt with before. The writing, animation art, and music come together to create a leisurly, entertaining film that builds to a highly dramatic conclusion. The only quibble with the film is the shoddy sound mixing job. Often, the music track is so loud that it obscures the vocal singing and dialogue--and at times, entire lines of dialogue are missing. Shame on THX!! The picture, however, is magnificent. If it weren't for the sound, I'd give this 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"This is one of the best movies ever made. I don't know how many times I've watched it.

After several attempts with that disc and one exchange later, I am currently without Lady and the Tramp. I have no problems with any other disc, except the newly released Howl's Moving Castle...also a Disney two disc special. I've encountered the same problem with that set.

Sophie Katz, a sassy mystery writer, becomes the target of a killer who is using her book as a means to determine how she will die. With the help of her unconventional friends (a sex toy shop owner, the ditzy-but sweet-Mary Ann, and a fashionable gay hairstyist with a quick wit), she must find the killer before the killer finds her.Of course, her new, sexy Russian boyfriend might be the prime suspect. Kind of puts a damper on Sophie's sex life.Kyra's debut novel is told in an entertaining, unique and absolutely fun way! Sophie is hip, strong and will have you cheering her on. This book is must read for any fan of the chick lit genre!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fun read","review":"This is a book that is fun to curl up with, and is hard to put down. The characters are all people that you would love to spend time with, and Sophie Katz, the protaganist is the best thing to come down the pike since Stephanie Plum. She is sassy, witty and utterly delightful...and to top it off Davis writes some killer dialogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun & Unpredictable","review":"Although Sophie writes murder mysteries for a living, she sucks at solving real crimes. She's also prone to lying, frequently irrational and stubborn. In other words, I could easily believe meeting her on the street one day. Her friends are crazy, the plot is fun and the ending is totally unpredictable. I loved this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fast, fun, interesting","review":"This is another book that I really wanted to read when it first came out, but I was too cheap to buy it. The Kindle and Nook stores recently had the entire series on sale, so I went ahead and bought the series to date at the discounted prices. It was well worth the purchase.In this book, Sophie Katz is a mystery writer who finds herself in dangerous, and sometimes deadly, situations from one of her novels. In an effort to put an end to the craziness, since her life may depend on it, Katz enlists her group of colorful friends to help crack the case.This book was a fun, fast paced read from beginning to end, with interesting, and hilarious characters. I like Kyra Davis' writing style, her characters, and her stories. I am looking forward to reading the other books in the series.Note: Originally posted on Goodreads.com [...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sex, Murder And A Double Latte","review":"I enjoyed the descriptive nature of the characters which made the story come alive.

When i got it i placed my current book i was reading by James Patterson(MARY MARY)down to read this one. The story started out very boring and from there it lost me. I think the author was try to hard to make this character hip and exciting. She failed. I read a lot of books and this was a fast disappointment. Sorry but the Lattes were more exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME","review":"This book was absolutely terrible. If you like mysteries, don't read this! Being a James Patterson fan, I thought this one would be a new and engaging because it would have a feminine side to it. The cover looked witty, but definitely deceptive. There were too many coincidences and plot was too impossible. It wasn't even funny because it sounded as though the author tried too hard being witty. Don't bother wasting your money or your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"great summer read","review":"This book is a great summer read.

I couldn't put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty, charming, and funny","review":"This book was clever and well-put-together. The characters were both fun and funny, with a lot of real-life dialog and interesting habits. The heroine was personable, witty, and charming. In short, a very fun (if quick) read, a story about just what the title implies as a mystery writer's life begins to imitate her art and friends and aquaintances begin to die mysteriously around her. Are the murders and suspicious circumstances linked? The author must think like her own fictional detective to stay one step ahead of a threatening and frightening game that someone is playing with her. Lots of twists and turns abound, with an occasional pit stop at Starbucks to reload on a thick, creamy Frappuccino. A very cute, fun afternoon read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sex, Murder and The Look for Less!","review":"Hey, I'm watching an episode of this author's appearance on the Style channel show, The Look for Less!

Well, I personally DO believe in judging the book by the cover and I'm liking it. I don't normally read Murder Mysteries, but this one seems cute, quick and cunning. I hope I like it. Four stars leaves the mystery... will she earn the 5th one? Uh, Amazon Barrista! Can I get one Sex, Murder and a Double Latte, make that 2 double lattes!?

Ms. Purkiss has some interesting insights into the history of fairy lore, but her book loses them in a mish-mash of affectation and Paglia-would-beism. Too bad. In one chapter Purkiss tries to take a photo in a \\"Fairy Store\\". The shop owner objects, \\"I won't let you take pictures! You'll just use them to open your own shop.' In vain I said that I had no intention of opening a fairy shop; in vain I flourished academic credentials. 'Anyone could say that!' she spat.\\" Ms.Purkiss goes on to judge the \\"lady's\\" (arch condescension) values as \\"commercial.\\" Hmm. (contact her literary agent for more info.)

She has the ability to bring civilizations, long dead, to life through her words. Imagine that you are the ruler of a specific region of a country and that you receive a letter from your king, who lives several hundred miles away, which states that the noise made by the Hippopotami who inhabit your marsh are keeping him awake at night. What a ridiculous notion! Yet Seqenenra Tao must deal with a king who is just this irrational. Add to this mixture the fact that the king is a foriegner, a Setui or Hyksos as we know them today, and that in Seqenenra Tao flows the blood of the rightful pharoahic line of Egypt and The Hippopotamus Marsh, Gedge's masterful tale of revolt in Ancient Egypt, is begins. Truly, I couldn't put this book down until I finished it and I am finding the same thing to be true of the Oasis, which I am reading now. These characters are so well developed that the reader invests much in their lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Drama and pathos","review":"This book is a must for any Egpyptophile. Thoroughly researched, in this book Pauline Gedge brings to life the architechs of the the New Kingdom. Starting with the historically documented demand of Aposis to silence the loud hippotami at Thebes, the story moves rapidly into into the series of events that lead to rebellion of the native Egyptians against the foreign opressors of the Hyksos dynasty. There is the high drama of Sequenenere Tao hacked to death by the Hyksos on the battle field as his mummy testifies to when discovered in modern times and the pathos of the homecoming of his body to his family in Weset (Thebes). I can't wait for Volume 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"A return to the past","review":"Pauline Gedge's books are like time machines that transport the reader back to a very exciting time in History. You can feel, taste and hear the very sounds of ancient Egypt as no other (or very few)authors have been able to achieve in other books. Her characters are real people but the dialogue never lapses into a \\"B Movie\\" mentality. I eagerly await the next installment of this historic based family in the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops","review":"Oops, sorry, I meant that review for The Oasis, which is the 2nd book in the trilogy.

Kamose as interesting, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hippopotamus Marsh","review":"I bought this book, but when I began reading it, I wished that I had not. I found it uninteresting and hard to follow. I am very interested in ancient Egypt, and some of the information in this book was rather intriguing. I may not have enjoyed the book because I am too young for it, but if you are a teenager, read it, don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flashback","review":"Good movie!

Gotta love Dennis Hopper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie to go back to","review":"This came out when I was 3, and Mom and I still have the laserdisc version of it. This movie is a great showing about how things have changed, if what Mom says about the 60's and 70's is true. Either way, it's a very fun movie. I feel the urge to watch it at least once a year. Keifer Sutherland plays a \\"me generation\\" FBI agent who is sent to take an ex-yippie, played by Dennis Hopper, to a prison where he can serve his sentence for disconnecting Spiro Agnew's train car. The cop and the ex-yippie end up having to flee for their lives and depend on each other for their survival, even if they drive each other crazy. In the end, the cop decides to let the ex-yippie run away. The sort of twist at the very end is nice, and I smile and chuckle thinking about it. I highly recommend it to anyone born in the late 80's who feels like they should have been in college in the 60's."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bitter innovative comedy!","review":"Two opposites gazes.

And then a funny chain of smart and laughable events will fill the screen.Highly inspired and intelligent comedy that presents to Dennis Hopper as he wolud have got out from Easy rider twenty years later.A tour de force comedy with many, many highlights.

I listen to the audio version more than read it (i have more time to listen than read), and it is a very snappy story with a suspenseful plot. The teenage private eye PC Hawke and his companion Mac(kensie) are in Monoco and are on the trail of a murderer when someone in their hotel is killed. With the help of the chief inspector's beautiful redhead daughter Juliette (who although blind makes up for it with her other senses, primarily smell (trust me, it makes sense), and her brains) they track down this vicious killer. It has the right amount of scary scenes and suspense without being gory. The pace and dialogue is very good, and will keep an adult riveted as well (at least it did for me)Such a shame Mr Zindel (the author) died before publishing the last few manuscripts from this series. Every single one of the PC Hawke mysteries is a winner in my opinion!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SO/SO","review":"first of all i'm a big fan of Richard Pryor,REdd Foxx,Eddie Murphy&Della Reese.but the script is weak and lacks structure.i expected to be at the movie house everyday and be loving this but it was ironicly not very funny except for an exchange between Red Foxx&DElla Reese."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Cast, Terrible Script","review":"This could have been an all-time classic but the script is just awful.

This film shows us the comedic talent of both these men, and to have stars like Eddie Murphy, Danny Aiello, and Della Reese is delicious icing on the cake.Pryor as Sugar Ray and Murphey as Quick try to keep a vicious mobster from taking over their business. As you might think, they turn the tables on the bad buys!Jasmine Guy stands out particularly as the mobster's girlfriend, and so does Della Resse as the hard-fighting madam with a heart of gold.Thank-you, Eddie Murphy, for getting all these wonderful comedic talents together for us and prosperity!

Eddie Murphy is, if nothing else, a smart comedian and observer of people. What he's made here appears to be a movie he first dreamed up when he was 11 years old and heard about the history of Harlem. The problem is, it's got exactly that level of sophistication, too. It could, in fact, be very enjoyable for boys aged 10-13, given the crude humor, simple plot, and overly aggressive interaction of the characters.

Maybe Eddie was not ready to direct yet. Maybe the stars outshined each other--too much equals too little. Now remember, there are some really good scenes in this one: Arsenio the crybaby gangster out for revenge; the mafia bag man who gets ripped off by the sexy prostitute; the stuttering boxing champ. This is a very funny movie--don't get me wrong--but it tries to do too much and doesn't exactly achieve it. Boomerang and Coming to America KNEW what they were alll about, then went out and did it. This one misses just a little bit, but is still worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Foxx, Pryor, and Murphy...What More Could You Ask For?","review":"Harlem Nights is such an overlooked film in the comedy genre. There are so many hilarious exchanges in this film, especially between Redd Foxx and Della Reese. Richard Pryor actually plays the straight man in this and does a pretty admirable job. Eddie Murphy plays his son Quick, who is a hot headed gambler. The supporting cast is really what sets this film apart from others. Arsenio Hall plays the brother of slain character Tommy Smalls and is immensely effective in his brief appearance. Danny Aiello plays the crooked cop Phil Cantone so smugly that you want to reach through the screen and smash his face. But Redd Foxx and Della Reese steal the show with their hilarious banter about each others weight and eyesight. It is apparently clear that of these three generations of comic heavyweights, Redd Foxx is the undisputed champion. This is a fine addition to any dvd collection and as good as it gets in the comic genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"HARLEM NIGHTS","review":"This has become a classic movie in my collection; all-star cast, funny, and yet meaningful; If you like movies about the prohibition and gangs era, this is for you..Very intertaining.."},{"rating":"2","title":"good old classic","review":"always pleased with DVD's we buy from Amazon, have never had a problem with used or new.

So, he hires his family, friends and his 2 comedy influences Redd Foxx and Richard Pryor.They spent millions of dollars on wardrobe for this movie and about 5 minutes on the script. It's like they just made it up as they went along. They wanted to look good but left out the funny.

It represents a childish attempt to denigrate the premier icon of American history -- George Washington, portraying him as a bestial monster, eating the flesh of children. The concept is depraved, the writing is poor and the result is embarrassing for the entire crew of this production. Oh, and they managed to get in a shot at George Bush as well at the end. If you're going to make a political statement via drama, then at least do a presentable job of it.

Those of you who love this series, don't reject what I say about this episode just because it is negative.As for The Washingtonians, several years ago I read the short story upon which this episode is based. It was, flatly, one of the worst things I've ever read. It tried very hard to be creepy and funny at the same time, but in the end it was just a bad idea filtered through the expressive powers of a talentless (hack) writer.Now, as for the \\"Why?\\" in my title: Why, for the love of all that is good and right--why would they think that a movie based on a poorly conveived and poorly written short story could be anything other than unwatchable?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I got cover for you","review":"Read previous review that said got the item without the lid.

This has to be the WORST quality video cassette I have ever had; with the exception of other tapes that were so cheap that any VCR will eat them in the first few seconds. The production is crap, the editing is crap, and Lazar is far from convincing. Consider yourself lucky if you even get any sound coming out of this tape. I did...maybe 33 percent of the time. Word to the wise: Not every video has to be made with expensive equipment with DVD quality picture and sound, but isn't the whole idea to actually get the information across to the viewer!

This is the only RPG I've ever played where ten hours of gameplay really IS ten hours of gameplay. So much work is put into the battles; tweaking your spells and stragegies to unlock combination(fusion) spells, or contacting the demons in the midst of battle to negotiate for items, money, and information. Ridiculously challenging bosses are the main problems in this game, but the amount of work you put into fighting them (and the really damn-cool story and story-sequences) make it worth your considerable effort. A must-buy for gamers looking for something macabre and new, but definately not for the faint of heart and courage."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy classic","review":"This is were Persona started to become Shin Megmi Tensai You have to check it out, It's well worth what you pay for it.

It takes place in a more realistic world with more of an evil like atmosphere. The graphics are pretty cool too, not as well as FF series but is great though.

I got this because I figured this was my only chance to get it. Plus I can say this game is in a league of its own like the rest of the Shin Megami Tensei series. I think of it as the dark brother of Final Fantasy series. Where Final Fantasy is mostly cheerful and light I think of this series as dark and foreboding with some contrast. Plus you can negotiate with demons which you can't do in Final Fantasy. I can recommend to Goth's, Megamists and people who want something different in their games."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish I played the older games too.","review":"This game is aweasome.

It may not be like the Final Fantasy series (which are my favourites) but I think I'll play this game for long. The disappointing fact is, Persona 2: Eternal Punishment is only the second half of part 2. There was Persona 1 then Persona 2: Innocent Sin.

Thankies."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it.","review":"Persona 2: Eternal Punishment is the only game of the whole series of Persona I could find. Though, There is no need to play the older series before. What I really like in this game are the music, the story and the characters. I think that the battle system is quite annoying. And it's kinda hard to gain the EXPs, also. This game is not an original RPG where dragons and swords rule the world, it takes place in the present time, so be ware if you didn't. There are stores, sushi bar, clinic, CDs store, parks, just like what you've seen in this world. But it's not that simple, mystic stuff can be found in this game also, rumors, fortune tellings, demons, and personas. You can say that this is the world where facts and fictions go together. The voice actings are easy to listen and understand, also matches each character's personality and looks (although the joker guy's is quite comic relief). If you enjoy serious, creepy and unique stories, get this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Return Of Megami Tensei","review":"Megami Tensei, or Persona, as it's known in the States comes back with Persona 2: Eternal Punishment...and it was well worth the wait. Eternal Punishment (one half of Persona 2, along with Innocent Sin) improves on nearly every aspect of the first Persona. There is an improved fighting engine, more persona to master, and the real gem of the game, the Contact System, has been greatly expanded upon. This feature, unique to the Megami Tensei series, allows you to avoid battles at times, instead opting to CONVERSE with your opponents...a novel concept indeed. Everything is done better in Eternal Punishment than in the original, and it will offer RPG fans a refreshing taste of something new and different in the genre.

I bought the Versus books strategy guide instead, and it didn't tell you about the final battles, keeping them secret for you to find out.

My loathing for this film knows no bounds. It's perhaps the most un-worthy film to ever be awarded the \\"Best Picture\\" Oscar, beating out much better candidates like \\"The Right Stuff\\" and \\"The Big Chill\\" that were nominated that year. As I was watching it, I kept saying to myself \\"When does this get better?\\" It never did, not once over its achingly long 131 minute running time. My former co-worker called this \\"the movie where the mother and daughter talk on the telephone all the time.\\" Which it is. Throw in some infidelity and an incurable disease, and that summarizes this piece of nonsense on celluloid. Avoid this movie at all costs.A few months back, I actually tried to watch this on TV, to see if my opinion had changed over the years. Well, it did. I hated this movie even more. I didn't think that was possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreary, depressing, pointless","review":"I have never understood what people see in this movie.

Wow, what an incredible waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Can't Come to Terms with How Bad \\"Terms of Endearment\\" Is!","review":"I found this movie long and an extremely boring waste of time. Shirley MacLaine played Aurora, an abnoxious [person] who can't seen to find a boyfriend. Meanwhile, her daughter Emma, played by Debra Winger, is dying of cancer. One hour of this movie is taken up with Aurora's love affair, and the other is spent on Emma's problems with cancer. (just goes to show you that the director thought that Aurora's sexlife is more important than the death of her daughter). I heard so many reviews that this movie was \\"astounding and breathtaking.\\" The only astounding thing about this movie was how long it took to finish.This movie is a new enductee of my hall of fame for being one of the WORST films of all time. I wish that there was a choice of putting zero stars up for this movie, because, frankly, it was just that bad. I would never wish on my worst enemy to have to watch this ... of a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE REAL WORLD","review":"I watched this film quite some time ago, when it first came out on video. And I looooooooved it. The actors are no bomb shells, but real people living real lives, juggling problems a lot of people are dealing with these days. The movie is funny (think about Shirley and Jack going for a ride in his Corvette... or Debra giving her flame a photo to remember her by - showing her pregnant and not made up at all...), sad (\\"cancer\\" says it all...). Sure, the characters are somewhat overdrawn, but that's what it takes to get the audience going. Like I stated before - I loved the movie and still consider it one of the best films I have ever seen. Watch it and make up your own mind. Don't be turned off when other reviews describe Debra as being so slobby, they were happy to see her die... She wasn't meant to look like a barbie doll and I am glad, she didn't.

This is an all in one movie, funny, maddening, sad, touching. I can't imagine anyone not liking it, unless your a man. Having someone close to me die of cancer made it all the more real and heartbreaking. The relationship between mother and daughter is so real. This movie is a must if you want a good cry and laugh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I seem to prefer Brooks' TV work better...","review":"I really had a problem with this movie when it was released in 1983, and I still do. While I like James L. Brooks' TV work (\\"Mary Tyler Moore Show\\", \\"The Simpsons\\") I don't seem to love all his movies.When \\"Terms\\" first came out, it was praised as being SO moving and SO funny and SO real, you'll just die as fast as Debra Winger (and her subsequent career)... Well, that was just typical early-80s hyperbole, but this movie is about as real and as poignant as an episode of \\"Little House on the Prairie\\"--- and about as funny.I suppose it's harmless enough, but there is nothing-- NOTHING-- superlative about it. (I will be in the minority here, I realize)."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated and overacted","review":"I missed this movie when it first came out and now I just can't understand what the hype is about. Aside from Debra Winger's excellent performance and uncanny resemblance to the lovely and talented Zooey Deschanel, it was difficult to see what the point was.

It's not a bad film, but it's not a very good one, either. Very slow-moving, with only Jack N. to liven up the proceedings. Debra Winger's character was so annoying i was glad when she finally croaked. Shirley McLaine was OK, but not deserving of a Best Actress award. And Best Picture? I don't think so.

There is not one bad song throughout the entire cd. It is one of those albums that you can listen to over and over again and never get tired of it....now that's what I call a great record.For those of you who have never heard of Oingo Boingo, I would say they are a band that makes music that is almost impossible to describe. Their music is truly unique and is completely different from anything you've ever heard. Although there are a lot of bands that have their own sound, Oingo Boingo adds to their sound diversity by including the use of wind instruments. So I'll make an attempt and say Oingo Boingo is punk meets pop meets new wave meets brass meets weird, and that's about as close as I can get. So give them a listen, you won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review on cassette, not what's on the cassette","review":"Awesome condition.

Why use the year 2070 as a starting point if you are not going to have the imagination to envision a world different from today? Time travel is a stretch, but done right it can be very entertaining.

There is no real chemistry between Raft and Sydney with too much time spent on the beginning of their affair. The music leaves a lot to be desired especially the main song and the scene where Raft enters the gangster\`s hide out. It was totally out of place and rediculous.

Your music library should have some Steppenwolf in it--but this one ain't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why rate your own stuff????","review":"This book fell short of my expectations. I'm not so sure about this author. She is just another person claiming these stupid powers. Which, in the end is really nothing more then figment of her imagination. Consistent with the blib blab... This book was more then blah! I'm sure this lady must have a screw loose. I guess for the few bucks this book would cost you and the time involved, I'd recommend spending that else where. Paranormal books are great.. This one stinks. Remember user reviews are everything... I kind of want my money back...FYI- rip off..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Different Printed Version than Picture","review":"The book I received was different than the one pictured. It was printed by a small press, is very small, and isn't a of good quality. Normally a different cover and size wouldn't be such a big deal but this was a gift an it didn't look very thoughtful to give such a poorly made version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing and That's a Fact","review":"I was overcome with dissapointment after this staple to the lily b. collection. The first book was fun, interesting, and witty. This sequel I found dreary, tiring, and couldn't wait for it to end. With obvious foreshadowing you find yourself thinking how self centered the protagonist is. There were so many other great characters to marvel on, and yet Kimmel chose to center the story around a gum chewing, bad tempered, and dull male character. I love romantic comedies, but this one: a no go."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHY DID I WAIT SO LONG TO GET THIS BOOK!","review":"I just got this book from Amazon and I am very satisfied indeed. I waited too long to get it, not realizing that it was huge and heavy, like a text book in school, well worth it's price, and that it had Tchaikovsky's works completely documented, even the posthumous ones, ... and that this would make life easier for a complete fan of his, such as moi. Now I can properly look up the work I am interested in, with the proper title so as to inquire whether the music store can get it for me, since it has not been easy just to get a particular Tchaikovsky piece online.This book also has the very beginning of each musical piece, the score that is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly careful & outdated scholarship; good for the beginner","review":"A collection of essays on the ancient world, from Minoan Crete to the decline of the Roman Empire and the rise of Christianity. Finley is a careful writer and an even more careful scholar; he doesn't make rash conclusions about points of historical controversy. And there's much solid historical fact to learn in this slim collection: about slaves and freemen and the status of women in Rome, Plato and democracy in Athens, Diocletian the autocrat, and so on. However, there are obviously good reasons not to read a book whose scholarship is thirty-five old (26, where it was revised in 1977). And then, Finley is often simply too careful not to make pronouncements: many chapters end on questions, such as why cynicism as a philosophy became popular, or how Crete was related to classical Greek culture, without any answers. Not too satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"sometimes being broke makes you fall astray","review":"it's the best of the black market, the hounds of the underground.'Nuff said"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ballad of Dorothy Parker","review":"Like many of her witty pals at the Algonquin roundtable, Parker is relatively unknown to the general public today. Unlike her contemporaries (and friends) Fitzgerald and Hemingway, she never wrote a novel to insure her immortality. This is sad, but somehow appropriate, because as Meade's excellent biography illustratrates, Dorothy didn't want to live unitl next week, let alone forever. Fortunately, Meade has captured all of the spirit (and most of the quips) of this depressed, funny and above all, complex woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exceptionally well written biography","review":"I was expecting a kiss-up job with a few interesting factoids, and got an exceptionally well-researched, balanced portrait of Parker. This is one of those books so crammed with interesting anecdotes that it's best read in small doses (to be savored a bit before picking it up again). In other words, this is a great bathroom book.Meade's book shows Parker and her friends (and hangers-on), warts and all. And don't worry, there's no tedious feminist agenda (hidden or otherwise). It made me like a few people LESS (including Dotty), but stoked my fascination with the times and the people. Along the way, it deliciously roasts the \\"limousine liberals\\" and fellow travelers of the era.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"Work that is tip-top and about time, too. It's interesting that Meade is nearly able to mask the dog-like labor that has gone into this product with a magnificent matter-of-factness. Very Mrs. Parker; hoorah in every sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"The light and the dark sides of a literary legend","review":"Meade's book, obviously the result of years of research, takes the reader behind the public image of Dorothy Parker as just the rapier wit of the Algonquin Round Table to show us the complexity of her life. The joy and the tears are both well presented. This is a great read, even for those who are not familiar with Parker. A remarkable book about a remarkable woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book, wish I hadn't read it","review":"The book is well written and quite good. But if you are a Dorothy Parker fan, think hard before reading it. The first half is wonderful, and full of the glamour, misery, and craziness that one might expect based on her writing. I wish I'd not read the second half. We all grow up. While melodrama, alcoholism, instability, and erractic romances are attractive and fascinating when one is young, beautiful, and successful, they are less so later in life. I am not criticizing Parker, nor the author, who I believe does an excellent, well researched job. But, in hindsight, I think I would have preferred to live with my fantasy Parker."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great biography","review":"this book is a great read and very imformative. it helped me with my project immensely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excruitiatingly Repetitious","review":"I had heard Dorothy Parker was a creative wit, but I found this bio to be about 200 pages too long, with little evidence of her writing. As Dorothy would say, \\"What Fresh Hell is This?!\\" As for Dorothy - didn't see much in the way of her 'talent', but as a person, she was a very negative, mean-spirited, self-absorbed, promiscuous drunk who sponged off anyone she could her entire life. What a pathetic existance. And poor Alan Campbell who was her devoted husband. It's a wonder all her excesses didn't do her in before her 77 years. I have 150 MORE pages to slug through. I will finish it but prefer to read about people who make positive contributions to humanity, not suck dry what they can from others."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],H={key:0},B={key:1};function M(a,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",C,[(o(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(o(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(o(),i("span",B,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",H,"See more"))],8,N)):b("",!0)])}const L=d(O,[["render",M],["__scopeId","data-v-21956dae"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/22.md","filePath":"library/22.md"}'),W={name:"library/22.md"},P=Object.assign(W,{setup(a){return(e,n)=>(o(),i("div",null,[v(L)]))}});export{j as __pageData,P as default};
