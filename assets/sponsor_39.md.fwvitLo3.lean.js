I didn't waste a whole 98 minutes of my life, as one of the reviewers here did, but I wasted 30, then I had to turn it off. Luckily it was just a netflix movie -- I can only imagine having to sit through this at the full cinema price, or having purchased it on DVD for $25. The reviewer that said that people were leaving the cinema in droves is accurate. Don't waste your money. I would have given this 0 stars, if I could have. This is now my worst movie in recent memory (though it does have a good cast whose talents were wasted in this turkey), now supplanting The Happening, another one that you don't want to see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Just a bunch of big name actors sitting in front of the camera talking to it with different colored backgrounds.

While the footprint of this case is much larger than that of the plastic case, there is less room for the saw's cord. As the other reviewer noted, this case is nearly a cube. The cord has to be kinked sharply to one side so that the case can close, and this will cause the cord to short eventually. (I had the same problem with my Bosch reciprocating saw's case.) The case I got was also poorly made. The lid was not aligned and the latches were loose.

One squeeze to the plastic tweezers, and they broke, and I don't mean some sort of really hard squeeze. Took it back to the store to swap it out. The girl at the customer service counter saw the box, and said \\"did the tweezers break?, We've had a lot of those.\\" I went to the shelf to get a replacement, the first box I opened was already broken. The next two broke on the first squeeze. I walked down the isle, and my daughter now has the original Operation game, which works fine.

While it is not the hardest album this past year, it is a nice change from the glut of metalcore bands that are out there when they all start running together and sounding the same. I love heavy, but heavy is not always good. With all that said, I can easily say that this album stands as my favorite album by Candiria seeing as how we get to hear the overall vocal dexterity at hand (aside from the death metal growls). Candiria is an amazing band, and while they have simplified their sound slightly, I do not see anything wrong with it. The songs still pack plenty enough punch to piss off your neighbors, yet they also add beauty and melody, something that had been lacking in previous albums. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened to this band?","review":"this band was great for about an album and a half, then turned to total commercial crap. buy surrealistic madness and then pretend they broke up b/c after the first album they are absolute crap.

Every album they have made has been different. The First one, \\"Surrealistic Madness\\" was their hardest album and where you first heard the foundation of Candiria's breakthrough sound. As you go up to the albums in sequence, you notice how they change the sound up slowly. There is no other band out there that has the ability to mix hiphop, hardcore, jazz, techno, metalcore, and \\"trippy sounds\\", as smooth as these guys. You can listen to any of their albums over and over and always find something new in it. I remember seeing these guys in CBGB's years back, and if you think the albums are hard, you should go to a live show...one of the most amazing live performers in the hardcore scene!

What seems to make sense on the page has the life sucked out of it by the reliably low-wattage of Eric Stolz. Peter Fonda, likewise, seems to have wound up in this movie after losing a bet. You could change all of the names of the characters and it wouldn't matter. This is a plug and play film about generic intellectual X and how her selfish out-there-ness wears out her loved ones. Zzzzzzzz. This director clearly does not have the gift of getting worthwhile performances out of his actors.Anyone who already knows who Ayn Rand is won't benefit from seeing this movie(which has one of the most relentlessly irritating jazz scores I can think of).

If you're interested in Ayn Rand's history, rent the Oscar-nominated \\"Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life.\\" This piece of cable TV melodrama is based on Barbara Branden's ax-grinding book -- hardly an objective source of information, as proved by the contradictions between her account and her husband (Nathaniel's) account of the same facts in his own autobiography.

I was stupified to see that it was very inaccurate and portrayed Rand as a person who excommunicated people and made knee-jerk decisions based on nothing but her own vanity. As anyone who has read her personal journals or \\"The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics\\" knows, this could not be further from the truth. It was difficult to watch the smearing of one of the 20'th century's greatest thinkers."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE PASSION OF AYN RAND","review":"The Passion of Ayn Rand looks to be an incredibly intense film that was marred solely by a poor Digital rendering. Helen Mirren is as usual incredible with a dead-on Russian accent no less. I'd suggest renting it if only to see an incredible actor deliver another incredible performance. When Helen Mirren is on the screen, no one else seems to measure up to the level of realism and believability she brings to her roles. For that reason and that reason alone, I suggest you rent this film just to see a master artisan at work. 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing But A Smear Job","review":"No, Ayn Rand was not perfect, but this film is nothing but a smear job. If you want a better sense of what the woman was about, try the 1998 documentary \\"Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life\\" or read any of her books. The fact that she was a WOMAN has a great deal to do with the hostility towards her exemplified by slanderous defamations like this movie.

To hear it in stereo thanks to modern technology is almost like a re-incarnation of hearing it for the first time many years ago- it's age-less! I think many movie fans are indebted to the Barrons' for their effort and imagination in producing this soundtrack. I can't imagine this movie with a 'conventional' soundtrack after seeing and hearing it so many times in it's original format. A MUST HAVE! It's really cool to play this for someone who has never seen the movie, and watch the expression on their face as they listen to the 'futuristic melodious strains' unfold!

The repairman told me that the Philips brand may have been bought out by another electronics corporation.

I had this TV for less than three years, with NOT a lot of viewing time on it and a major component goes out on it that caused red blurry images.

I couldn't wait to see this movie.I guess the reason why I hate this movie so much is because I was so disappointed. I was really expecting more from A&E.My complaints? Whoever made this movie must have watched much too much melodrama in which the villains twirl their black mustaches and cackle at the misfortunes of the innocent. The characters are stripped of all complexity. I do wish the filmakers had taken Sir Walter Scott's name off of their hideous creationThe series became so vile, I was unable to get past the fourth tape.Sad, very very sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"The mini-series that somehow managed to get it ALL wrong.","review":"First of all, I read (several times) the unabridged book and enjoyed it greatly. This \\"movie\\" is a hatchet job on perhaps the most brilliant tale of chivalry of all time. The book \\"Ivanhoe\\" was an extremely romanticized portrayal of the 12th century, doing so for literary effect. The movie takes great pains to make you hate the era as brutal and sadistic. Graphic scenes of torture are added; gross historical inaccuracies abound. Any good actors in this film are wasted by an inept adaptation and childish direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I had high hopes that this version would be true to the book, but I guess that is too much to ask in a movie. I have read and reread the novel, and this version strays in certain aspects. I was glad they included Gurth and Athelstane, but I did not appreciate their subplot of Ivanhoe trying to clear his name of treason, which is completely invention. The word that comes to mind for this version is \\"crude.\\" I know that medieval life was probably very crude, but I do not appreciate seeing it on screen. Give me the idealized MGM version any day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grittily superior to a prissy book","review":"This is one of my favourite portrails of early mediveal life in all it gritty detail. The adaptation takes all of Walter Scott's annoying Deux et Machina out and leaves the watcher with a gripping, dynamic tale. The care that is taken with the minor as well as major details is a joy to behold with great costumes and settings and a wonderfully authentc feel.Ciar��n Hinds is absolutely superb as the Templar Sir Bois-Gilbert as is Christopher Lee as the Templar Grand Master Sir Lucard de Beaumanoir and Susan Lynch as Rebecca. Steven Waddington's Ivanhoe is good, but definitely diminished by the three previous actors.Whilst more Brannagh's Henry V than Olivier's I feel that this adaptation is only strengthened by that fact and would be replacing my tape version with a DVD one today if it was available as region 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the book; love this film","review":"I saw this when it first aired stateside, and feel in love with the story.

I would recommend this to anyone who likes knight in shining armor stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"The moust realistic Ivanhoe to be seen !!","review":"One of the best movie ever in this genre.It includes everything;Love passion,acction,history,you name it.And the best about the movie is Ciaran Hinds who plays the tempelar Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert.He is outstanding.Buy the video, and enjoy!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A rather unintentionally stupid film","review":"I tried to watch this film but could not finish it. Afterward I set to reading the unabridged book \\"Ivanhoe\\". I found the book to be infinitely superior.There were many gross (and I do mean gross)innacuracies and deviations from the origional book.For one, the melee combat. In the movie the fim makers claimed the Normans cheated by using daggers during the melee which never happened in the book. The Normans were actually noble opponents.And then there was Font de Beof's burning death scene. It is shown in beyond graphic detail. Sir Walter Scott (I'm going from memory here so excuse the paraphrasing) said of that scene: To describe the scene would be unchristian.A character is added for the sole purpose of being beheaded just to show how mean and nasty the villains are. We already knew that considering they kidnapped, murdered and stole.I could go on longer about this but to sum it all up, a very poor adaptaion of the wonderful book Ivanhoe"},{"rating":"1","title":"Distasteful rubbish","review":"What characterizes this movie is an utter lack taste and decorum. The inability to understand that wanton violence does not make a good movie, destroys any shred of regard I might have felt toward the movie.Why is it that every time a messager appears in this movie, he is killed in a prompt, corny and unneccassary fashion that does not keep with the spirit of the book. You would think that all medieval messagers would quit under such conditions!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ivanhoe Goes To War","review":"Ivanhoe is a classic story, loved by children and grown-ups alike. By what misguided arrogance do screenwriters think they can write a better story than the original author? The attempt to introduce new motivations for the characters leads to a plot full of holes and empty of the delight and careful craftsmanship of Sir Walter Scott's book. The tenor of the film is monotonously angry and the battle scenes are a tedious, cheesy hacking and hacking. The male roles look and act so alike that one cannot tell them apart. The last scene with Eleanor from A Lion in Winter has nothing to do with anything and disconnects both John and Richard from the characters they have played all through the rest of the movie. If you like Ivanhoe, reread the book. If you do decide to buy this, do yourself a favor, at least, and fast-forward the battle scenes. You won't miss a thing and you'll be able to get to bed on time for a change."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great adaption","review":"This is a wonderful adaption of Ivanhoe. One feels a part of the drama. After watching the Hollywood version with Robert Taylor and Liz Taylor, I was a bit skeptical of purchasing this one. Once again A&E produced a wonderful movie based on great literature and stays fairly true to the story. Definitely worth your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sure, the book takes a few more brain cells but...","review":"It's worth it! The standard excuse for a movie that does not follow the book is that the book was too confusing. That is no excuse for the strange dramatic choices made in this adaptation of Ivanhoe. There have been many movies that manage to capture the spirit and charm of a book without completely gutting the basic personalities of the heroes. I refer to Rebecca's swooning manner (she was a firecracker in the book), Rowena's shouting match with Cedric (she got her way by being sweet and confidant, never by screaming), the Normans cheating at their own tournament (they didn't need to, they were on their own terf and the Saxons had a disadvantage to begin with) See what I mean? Strange dramatic choices.Attempt to slog through the unabridged Ivanhoe, it may take some time and it certainly won;t be brain candy but every character is balanced and developed as only Sir Walter Scott can do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Interpretation Of Wonderful Story","review":"The story told in this two DVD set is quite devoid of the elegant writing, witty dialogue, intricate storyline, and the plot's carefully deliberate unfolding that made the book a classic. In fact, this movie is heavy-handed, predictable and focused on cruelty and violence. Also, visually, be prepare, if you are purchasing this set, for a grainy square pictured video. I was obviously disappointed in this purchase. If I was not so interested in stories and movies of this time period, I would have rated it with one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ivanhoe","review":"This movie presented a ridiculous insinuation that Richard the Lionheart and his brother John were somehow \\"brokered\\" into a peaceful relationship by their mother.

To see two grown men in power positions at that time in history being chastized by their mother was almost laughable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glory must mean Gory!","review":"I bought this DVD in an A&E Romance collection. It would have been better packaged with the \\"Guts and Gore\\" collection, because there is plenty of gore to be had in it, I assure you. I don't even want to keep the DVD set because I was just so grossed out from all the battle wounds, the head in a bloody sack tossed to the victim's friends and all the full sound effect stabbings and swordfights. I can handle a bit of gore, but this was so graphic and so constant throughout the 300 minute epic that I don't ever want to watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst adaption of the book ever!","review":"My family rented this DVD because we were pleased with A&E's various other BBC productions. This is horrible! Every character in the movie is covered in filth. The script is awful. The writers have the characters speak as if they live nowadays. The acting was terrible.

After SLAVES OF NEW YORK got so much acclaim, Janowitz was unfairly treated with the backlash reserved for those who become famous \\"too fast\\". A Cannibal In Manhattan was not a great work, but CROSSDRESSER most certainly was. It's extremely funny, whimsical, and daring. I've read it several times, and no other book in existence has ever made me laugh so hard. SLAVES was great, but I seem to be one of the few who feels this is even better.

I found the first half fairly funny, but the road trip and everything afterwards was over the top. It wasn't just the head -- burning down her father's house? Keeping the head all the way to Maine? How stupid can a person be? That I was supposed to sympathize with Pamela's misadventures is insulting. The only bright spot was Abdhul -- he deserved better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly entertaining, but tries too hard to be funny","review":"This is an odd book that actually makes only passing reference to the title (explained a little towards the end), which I assume is mainly for shock value and to entice you to pick it up (it worked for my friend, who lent it to me).Our anti-heroine is entertaining enough, and at times her trials and tribulations are outright funny, but after a while this all begins to wear a little thin. Her antics become so disastrous, that it is actually difficult to take it all in. Just somewhere along the line, I needed her to have a break from all the havoc!So whereas this is not what it seems, and it tries to hard to be funny, it may be appealing to readers who like a relatively fast paced book. But it fell a little short for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing and far-fetched read.","review":"Tama Janowitz's creation, Pamela Trowel, is one of the most self-defeating and sorry protagonists I've seen. Janowitz piles on the problems for Pamela, but doesn't equip her with the sense or the wit to cope. It's one thing for an unrelenting series of bad things to happen to a character, and quite another when the protagonist does nothing about them, or worse, brings them on herself. For instance, seeing a bad psychiatrist who holds his sessions in a bar is something that should be easily remediable. The point where I decided the book wasn't worth it anymore was where Pamela comes across a severed head in a plastic bag, decides it's one of those fake severed heads from a novelty shop, and merrily takes it to the kid she is sort-of, kind-of kidnapping. Well, oops, it was an actual bloody, messy severed head, and we are supposed to believe that she couldn't tell the difference. No, and if she truly is that ignorant, I have no interest in her story."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Story's Not So Great, But The Writing's Good","review":"For the first 3/4 of the book, the unrelated incidents don't seem like much of a plot... just one bad day after another for the main character.

I definitely recommend these for leisurely biking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value","review":"It's a cheap tire, but it's a great value for the money.

I'm a big guy at 260 and I can tell you, these tires definately roll faster and easier than a stock MB tire. I inflate to 50 psi. So much easier going uphill and faster going down. Going up a hill is still going up a hill, it's work. But these make it easier if you have no intentions of going off road. I feel confident in turns. Beware of sand or other loose stuff or you will be eating rocks. Haven't had any flats in the 5 or so months I've had the tires and I ride on a rocky path sometimes. Awesome for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD was terrible.","review":"This CD promotes shallow quick breathing which can cause you to hyperventilate.

It is a challenging game and this is a good thing but more often than not your character will die due to poor controls, bad camera angles, and poorly laid out maps. The controls are related to the camera so when the camera changes direction your controls change with it causing lots of missed jumps. Laura is very clunky and tends to wildly jump in the way wrong direction sometimes. I'm very dissapointed in this game it has a lot of potential but it is just to frustrating to play. Highly recommend spending your money on something that has more thought put in the programming."},{"rating":"2","title":"tomb raider-fun","review":"this game is alota fun, the art of the set designs are cool and well done. the puzzles are interesting and fun with a little action every now and then. though not the original tomb raider and you can tell by some disappearing elements and the aura the old lara gave off, from the previous games-which were good in and for its time. its a pity the 6th game was faulted to ruin everything. instead of a reboot, surveys couldve gone out or the original game producers couldve been supervised or something. yes, i do miss the old tomb raider. but the reboot was for the best hopefully."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Way A Remake Should Be Done","review":"Tomb Raider Anniversary is a perfect example of what a remake should be and should be done. This game just isn't a graphic overhaul; it's a great impovement in control (ala TR Legend), bigger maps, and general gameplay.Players who enjoyed the original Tomb Raider on the Playstation will find many things familiar; while all gamers will also find many new aspects that keep this game fresh and exciting throughout.Iffy camera controls are about the only real negative in the game. Some frustrating jumps and timed puzzles exist here-and-there, but that makes the game challenging.This is a great game to own for Tomb Raider fans old and new. For the price, this game is a steal. This is what a remake should be and how remakes should be done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Re-creation of the Original!","review":"TR:Anniversary is a great adaption of the original Tomb Raider with updated graphics and the new Crystal Dynamics engine from TR:Legend.

I would recomend Anniversary both to those who remember the old game and those who never played the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"I broke my controller!","review":"After beating Tomb Raider Underworld I thought I'd give the PS2 versions a shot and I am one of the few who didn't like this game. The controls feel unresponsive when you have to make quick moves. The T-Rex boss battle was enough for me to quit. You can't dodge the guy very well. You are running backwards shooting trying to get him to charge into some spikes that you can't see behind you. I rarely just give up on a game but playing a boss battle for hours and not getting past that point ceases to be fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nightmare Tomb Raider","review":"This Tomb Raider was sooo Difficult that i couldntenjoy it! You better have the Guide to this one Before you even start it. Laura doesnt exibit the cool moves as she did in older versions. I couldnt get her to do the cool side jump back flips like i use to. The horses were a pain because in past games you had to be Agressive with your attacks. But in this level You had to Act Cowardly and Run AWAY from the horses to beat them. The Lava pit with 4 platforms had retracting poles that were only a diversion. Just run Grapple n get it done. The Bat attacks on Every platform you reached Got Old Fast.The Lava Tunnel was a challenge just when you thought you had it made out a new Blast of Steam or a Sinking last stepping stone killed Laura.

The game play is a crawl-balance-move away from identical. The camera is dizzying that quickly leads to just plain old annoying.

For one thing, this is a style of music that isn't the most common Celtic music, therefore it's often tossed aside as silly, but when you understand where it comes from (you'll have to read the small book that comes with it), you'll understand why this music is so important to Celtic history. On top of that, while I will admit, a number of the tracks are a little silly sounding, (especially the first which make me wonder why they put it there), a number of them are marvelous.

Well it was the old bait and switch routine. They sent the 1.6 size in a box with no return paperwork or invoice at all! How convenient! I sent 2 email complaints through Amazon with no response.

The author spends a great deal of time and pages in unnecessary character development. The reader's expectation is for a novel that describes naval warfare of the period in the genre of Hornblower. The action, as such, is confined to 24 pages and all this occurs at the end of the novel. There are references to other actions but these occur in other books so the reader is encouraged to make a risky purchase.

I know that by having the story take place there it gives the story more variables but is depressing. I also really don't find it very interesting when the whole story is about these four people trying to get to a place and every chapter some group of things comes out of the middle of no where. There are so many different kinds of gangs and it is hard to tell who is good and who is bad and who has more power. I like book like that but this did not float my boat.

An old man named Ryter remembers about reading and writing and tries to teach Spaz. Spaz starts his adventure to his sister with Ryter. Then later on he makes new friends and finds out a secret.

I liked it because I have read some other books by Rodman Phillbrick and liked them alot. I thought this was a good book also. I like the style this book was written in. The only thing I didn't like was that it was a little longer that Freak the Might and Max the Mighty.My favorite part personally is Chapter 31. It is called \\"Fear Itself\\". I really think is breathtaking when Spaz sees them and Ryter says \\"things fall apart; the center cannot hold; mere anarchy is loosened upon the world.\\" Then, when they see them come over the hill they yell Ryters name and yell \\"Wheel him! Wheel him!\\"Then they sieze.......the last book in the universe.The best elements of the book were the style of the writting and overall the story was very good.

In this book, we are drawn into the not too distant future where societal decay is rampant, addiction is electronic, and human emotion is on the wane... until an elderly writer and a young gang member form an unlikely friendship that leads to a revolution.Well written, absolutely lovely implicit moral message, and clean as a whistle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live in Heaven or Hell","review":"This book By RodmanPhilbrick is about a boy named Spaz who lives in a future world ruled by gangs.One day he gets a message that his sister is sick and must see him.

Their journey is far and dangerous,but thanks to Lanaya they travel in a takvee (a car) that is black.

Little did Spaz know, the old man ( Ryter ) will become a major role in his life. Spaz and Ryter set off on a quest with the help of Layana and Chox, to find Spaz's sister. before she dies. When they arrive to Spaz's old family unite they have to cure her of her disease called Leukemia, but their times they have lost the sure for it. So they only have one option.

He gets a letter from his foster sister (Bean) that tells him that she is very sick and wants to see him one more time before she dies.

Last Book in the Universe by Rodman Philbrick is about a boynamed Spaz. The world he lives in, the depressing Urb, is a land ruled by gangs. Eden is a place where genetically improvedpeople (proovs) live; it is a beautiful place with grass and blue sky. Spaz receives a letter telling him that his sister will soon die andthat she needs to see him. Spaz, an old man named Ryter, a proov named Lanaya, and a little boy go on an adventure to findher. Many different things happen on their adventure to see his sister and they run into different characters like Lotti Getts a latchboss and Billy Bizmo another latch boss. The unique style of writing that Philbrick writes with, such as using \\"gummy\\" to mean anold person, makes the story very interesting to readers of all ages.

Author Charles R. Geisst presents a detailed discussion of the contest between the forces of libertarianism and regulation. Detail is both the strength and the weakness of this book. Often, the author has trouble organizing it all, and the book would have benefited from a stricter editor to help distill the \\"story\\" in this history. Despite such problems, however, the factual basis is rich and intriguing. We believe that readers interested in U.S. financial history, especially those in the investment and financial services industries, will want to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely inaccurate about the current downturn","review":"The book provides some insight into forgotten economic events, but I'll bet the author didn't believe Lehman would fail, nor the \\"panic\\" that since has transpired in America."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Bob's tightest sessions","review":"This became one of my favourite Bob James' albums when it was first released and it has retained that status through the years and has aged extremely well. Yogi's Dream is a cataclysmic, cathartic reflection on the recent death of a band member, Yogi Horton. Alexander Zonjic performs extremely well on flute and the material he is given here reflects his ability better than some of his own contemporary releases. Leonard \\"Doc\\" Gibbs does sterling work on percussion - on track 5 \\"Orpheus\\" James' opts for synthesised percussion and this is much more predictable fare and perhaps the least successful of the six pieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whole Affair by Izit","review":"Very cool: sort of Swing out Sister (remember them?) meets the Brand New Heavies.

It is written in a very chronilogial order, which is very helpful for notes and understanding the judicial process behind this case.The information on Bakke and the other people involved in very good. Arguments are made both for and against Affirmative Action. There is no bias. It is written very clearly and it is really not possilbe to get caught up in all the legal terms.

I picked up the complete idiot's guide, hoping it would improve my understanding of this amazingly comples language.To put it mildly, it didn't.

For anyone looking to REALLY learn Latin by themselves this may be a good starting point. But if you are a student of the language for over like three months, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY.The fact is, you are better off with the newest edition of Wheelocks.

However, this book helps explain the grammar a little, rather than expecting the student to memorize all the cases at once, as many of the old fashioned Latin books used to do.The book also gives interesting historical background which helps to put the language in its proper historical perspective, both in Roman times and later when Latin was used by the Church. There is also a section devoted to Latin in the modern world.All in all, I find this a very informative book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Latin Light....","review":"If you are looking for a magic alternative to learning your declensions and conjugations, then forget it- there is still no substitute for drill, drill, drill.

From the first chapter on, there are many mistakes such as an exercise which says the answers are in the appendix, but the appendix skips the exercises for that chapter. Then one exercise had a list of words to be matched to the English translation, but not only repeated one of the Latin entries but listed a different pronounciation. Throughout the book I found many errors of omission or just plain mistakes. The website for the Idiot's Guides has been down for a re-make and so I haven't been able to see if an addendum is posted. I'd skip this book and go to one of the standard texts.

The Russian setting could have been used SO much more eloquently than it was, the slave farm scenes were frankly ludicrous, and a lot more \\"fight and spice\\" should have been used to get the two main characters back together again - a simple \\"tell me your story\\" just doesn't work in real life, much less fiction!

Im my opinion these books give a much better view of the current state of paleoanthropology and are better written. I found numerous typos in the text as well as the illustrations which were poorly put together. The sections on genetics were basic and often redundant- Wade's Before the Dawn explains these areas much better.

When doing the research the closest comparisons were by Panasonic and Sony. But the Toshiba won out in pretty much every area: price, picture quality and widest selection of video inputs.

Pass on it","review":"After reading the other reviews I thought I would order this to see if it would work on my pond. Quick answer no it did not. Great concept. It uses a reverse flow to direct the water backward away from nozzel and hence creates suction. I thought I would be able to fill the pond and clean at the same time. Problem is that the collect net is directly in the water flows path. As the muck gets vacuumed up into the net it (the muck) gets caught in the net. However, one the net is all filled up with muck the pressure increases on the net and it breaks away from the vacuum. This would be okay if there was a lot of muck but its only enough to barely cover the screen/net. I tried for two days to get it to work. Used lots of patience but no luck. I wish it did work but now have to find another muck solution."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good product","review":"It's made of very cheap plastic, joints were glued together crooked, bag comes off during use, and after little use the seams of bag started to fray.

Definitely NOT worth $20."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this product- altho not perfect!","review":"Have a 2500 gallon pond- want a vac but not willing to spend hundreds of dollars on one. This little vac is not perfect- but it does a great job!! it definitely picks up rocks and debris on the bottom very well- although the finer dirt does go through the bag and back in the water. i tried putting some quilt batting in there- which really helped and got a lot of fine dirt out. Again, as stated before, the construction is rather flimsy- especially the plastic handle- but if you are careful- it should last. I am very pleased with the vac- as it is def. worth the money to get a lot of the bigger muck out of the pond. Easy to work, easy to clean- Glad I bought it!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pond vac","review":"This vac is ok for light duty only. I have a small pond and wanted a small vac to clean up the occasional leaves or light debris which windy weather can bring.. The bag has a tendency to fall off when filed more than 30%. The pole cannot withstand weight either. The brush attachment does work well to scrub sides of dirt/light build up. Would invest in heavy duty model vacuum if your pond is of any significant size. This vac is serviceable for small ponds and fountains."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for the price","review":"I used this immediately on my 3500 gallon koi pond and it works great. It even sucked up rocks on the bottom. My only complaint is that the pole bends a lot when you pull it out of the water, I'm afraid it's going to crack apart at any moment but it hasn't happened yet. I also used it to suck up some of the tadpoles that are taking over my pond.

There, I said it and I'm glad. There seems to be amongst some opera mavens a vendetta against this wonderful singer. 'Great voice, but there's nobody home.' Or some such. But just listen to the Marschallin's monolog. I defy you to say she doesn't sing the drama as well as the music. That one little phrase \\". . . Resi war\\" tells you volumes about how she feels about her passing youth. And the wisdom of \\"Und in dem 'Wie', da liegt der ganze Unterschied\\" is conveyed in her phrasing.

I am stunned. Having abandoned Richard Strauss for several years (I consider myself lucky to have attended stellar performances in Munich, Berlin and Dresden), I felt it was time to get in touch with him again. This is my first record with Renee Fleming: her Marschallin is superb, as is the singing of Susan Graham and Barbara Bonney. I am especially fond of the Capriccio music, and I regret that there is a relatively new recording of the full opera with the VPO (with Kiri Te Kanawa as Graefin) - so it will be unlikely that DECCA will do another Capriccio with Renee Fleming (alas!). This record is surely one that wets the appetite of anyone who is interested to get into touch with Richard Strauss the opera composer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nearly perfect album","review":"This album is a true masterpiece.

I've clipped it to the bill of my hat, my shirt pocket and to places on the equipment I'm trying to fix.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I think they should've made it just a tad sturdier. Make the off switch and the wires to the l.e.d.'s heftier and you'd have a really reliable light that lasts a while. I went through my first one in a year, but I use it alot.

Interestingly, although the music has that ability (if you are into that sort of thing), I also found it to offer an earthy hypnotic invitation to begin swaying your hips and moving your arms to create one's own sort of slow moving sensual-type tantric dance -- especially so if you are alone. If you find yourself with a significant other, the music's exotic sensuality invites...well, one thing to lead to another. On top of all that, I'm a massage therapist and this music is great to play when my clients want something a little different. Personally, I really enjoy this CD. The only drawback, if you want to call it that, is that it's not the kind of music you could listen to every day.

Set in the Dutch countryside, Antonia returns to her village from the city to raise her daughter. The film spans maybe 50 years and 4 generations of Antonia's lineage, both literal and figurative because, after all, it takes a village to raise a child. The film is a beautiful fable that illustrates that family is not just your given family (blood relatives), but also comprised of your chosen family--the community around you who are your friends, neighbors, teachers, and for better or worse, also, the town misfits. Each one of these individuals help shape an individual into who he/she becomes as an adult. While the film's theme is matriarchy-based, the message is universal.

It's a vendor specific sales tool masquerading as a book. This kind of \\"book\\" is what consultants might like to hand over with a sales proposal tucked inside to add legitimacy.

When writing a novel based on a Bible character, I think it should be as accurate as possible. Yet Mr. Morris circumvents the topic that Abraham and Sarah are half-brother and sister (as stated by Abraham in Genesis 20:12-13 when justifying himself to King Abimelech). Instead, Abraham & Sarah have supposedly never met before their engagement in \\"No Woman So Fair\\". Unlikely. Also, Abraham gives a cheesy answer to the Pharaoh of Egypt as to why he stated Sarah was his sister and not his wife. In the Bible, Abraham does not answer the Pharoah, but later addresses this question when answering King Abimelech (Genesis 20:11). Christian historical and bibliographical fiction using Bible characters should be built upon what is already known, not override the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very realistic.","review":"This was a used book and not in the best of conditions.

I love the way she sings on her more recent efforts like \\"Wrecking Ball\\" and \\"Spyboy\\" and admire her on \\"Roses in the Snow,\\" but this is the CD that cements her reputation in my imagination. She just tears stuff up! She is the only singer who can sing a Johnny Cash song better than Cash himself and the only singer who can write the lyrics she does for herself--so much so, indeed, that Linda Ronstadt, the dominitrix (or parasite) of popular song, covers them! If you listen to Ella Fitzgerald for joy, listen to Emmylou, and not Billie Holiday, for despair: she reigns over melencholy as if it were a feifdom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet excess","review":"This album has a style and sound all its own: sort of a late-80s impressionist country. The instrumentation, and the way the instruments are recorded, lend the album an austere and somewhat lonely feeling. There are lots of big, crashing drums, almost like timpanis, and dramatic cymbal crashes. There are also a lot of twinkling pianos and the occasional austere-sounding synthesizer. I know I'm not making it sound very good, but the total effect is sublime. Sometimes Emmylou and her producer try too hard to wrench the emotion from your soul, but at least as often they are successful. And when you get to the last steel guitar solo which ends the last (incredible) song, you'll forget about any of the album's excesses.

The author gives you diagrams on how chord forms (major, minor, 6th, 7th etc) relate to a given position as well as how to find these chords across the fret board. It has some simple exercises related to each roadmap, but working through this book could take several years if you wanted to design your own exercises based on each chord formation in each key. It is a deceptively thin book for all the information held within. I would not recommend it to brand-new players because the lesson design is not really geared toward getting a new player to play arrangements. If you have played through Jack Hatfield's 1st book on 5 string banjo playing (go to his website), then the material presented in this book will make sense to you; and it is an excellent resource for learning the fretboard."},{"rating":"1","title":"POS","review":"First of all, I just bought this 2 weeks ago and paid 23.00 and now I see it's 1/2 price.

The issue is it simply isn't very well made. First off it is innaccurate, of course I didnt expect much, but still. Simply inneffectice at ranges greater than twenty feet, and within that it is hardly fast firing enough to be a guarenteed win in that distance. In airsoft wars it is a alright side arm but their are much better ones. Also after a few weeks of standard use (didnt drop it, but carried it to quite a few wars and put mabey a thousand round through it) it became unusable. It devolped problems with its cocking slide where it would come off entirely whenever it was cocked leading to hilarious situations where you have to assemble the gun to shoot it. After that it just quit shooting. If you are looking for a not to serious airsoft gun or a cheap sidearm by all means get it. If you expect accuracy or durability look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"I guess this gun is ok for beginners. But the thing is that when you shoot it, it never shoots the same way twice. sometimes it will shoot somewhat accurate but most of the time it either drops straight down or curves off so much that its completely impossible to hit anything unless your right on top of it. The only thing i kinda like about this gun is that mine (from walmart) came with a speed loader that holds like 88 rounds.

The vibrations are about as powerful as the average cell phone, and that's on the highest speed. It can be used while charging, but the vibrations felt are more weak than the lowest setting.The verdict? This thing is a joke. It simply isn't intense enough to be useful.

I love both of their original albums. However, this CD has been a big disappointment. The whole thing seems just thrown together. The lyrics from the original songs are frequently lame. Two whole tracks are devoted to the really bad \\"California Christmas\\" which at best appeals to a very limited demographic living in the southern California area. I don't know about you, but Christmas songs about the \\"Cali Way\\" don't have much appeal for me. The highly repetitive \\"Call Him Jesus\\" sounds like any gospel production you can find in small churches around the country. \\"The Real Thing,\\" \\"Hark the Herald...\\" and \\"Carol of the Bells\\" are each OK, but not enough to redeem this CD as a whole.

There is little that Warryn Campbell produces that does not appeal to me. He is a super-talented producer. However, this project is a miss.

In fact, the balance of both is very good. \\"Tuptim's Garden\\" is probably my favorite.There are two or three tracks differing from the rest, but the change is not necessarily bad. Not the most consistent of New Age albums I've heard, but definately worth it if you're looking for quiet Native type of music.I don't think this makes good meditation music if that's what you're looking for.

It has the earthy resonance of Native American melodies blended with other compositions that remind me of Enya's Celtic mysticism.

Maybe that's why it appeals to me so much: an ethereal excursion touching several musical traditions, that relaxes the psyche and the body."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring-Boring-Boring-Boring","review":"John Serrie is typical new age that tries various venues (native american) and puts out more new age fluffey music.

Thanks for such a prompt response!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising, challenging, original","review":"This book is completely unlike standard intellectual histories or biographies. You don't just see the development of one person or even of the four main subjects (Holmes, James, Peirce, and Dewey); instead, you really get a feel for a whole messy terrain of intellectual life, in which hundreds of people are running in and out, influencing each other. It's challenging (actually, impossible) to remember everyone whose ideas are mentioned, but it's not really necessary. The point is to follow the ideas, as they combine and react over time.The book is also extremely surprising to read because many of the ideas are completely unexpected, from a modern perspective. Many individuals seem to fuse together 1) ideas we might agree with today, 2) ideas we are aware of and utterly reject, and 3) ideas that just seem outrageously unexpected, completely \\"outside-the-box\\" (such as the contention that the gravity was produced by evolution).All in all, it's an amazing read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A grand peek into the intellectual community of the 19th century","review":"While the title of this book might grab your attention, it is it's subtitle, \\"a history of ideas in America,\\" that really embodies the subject of the book. Louis Menand's \\"The Metaphysical Club\\" is a well researched and thoroughly engrossing history of America's vangard of intellectual activity from right before to right after the American Civil War.Following the lives primarily of the James', Holmes', Louis Agassiz, the Pierces, and John Dewey, Menand explores the root of 19th century American philosophy and science, with touches of law, math, psychology, and every other subject one can think of, within the context of Civil War influence in a way that can be described only as masterful.My only criticism is Menand's seeming devotion to Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. and John Dewey, whom I believe sometimes unnecessarily overshadow Willliam James and Charles Pierce.Regardless, it is an entertaining and truly educational read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This is my first time reading a book on American philosophy, and I love the book. Page by page, it is transforming the way I view the U.S., esp. the Civil War. I am a novice on the subject, but I find the writing thrilling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great view of how the past informs today's America","review":"This book is an amazing tour through cultural, legal and philosophical ideas in America from the Civil War through the First World War. It does so in narrative and (mostly) chronological order, making it much more compelling than a textbook. The narrative form also helps expose the conditions that allowed certain ideas to flourish, rather than presenting a simplistic view of x followed by y followed by z. As a bonus, the reader gets to enjoy a well-painted picture of the elite intelligentsia and some window into daily life in America at large during these time periods.My only complaint is that it occasionally wandered or backtracked and I was never sure whether newly introduced ideas and people would remain important or central as we moved forward."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book","review":"I read this book several years ago, and it is what inspired me to study history in college. Menand uses biographies of Holmes, James, Peirce and Dewey to show how modern ideas like pragmatism emerged in American society, and it works beautifully.The prose may be dull at times (the reviewer who thought this did not deserve the Pulitzer probably took a few cat naps in between pages), but welcome to the world of influential scholarship! Menand is one of those rare writers who breaks new ground in subjects for which he was not even formally trained. From voting behavior to philosophy, and from literature to history, Menand has skillfully addressed dense and often difficult subjects not only in this book, but also in first-rate publications like The New Yorker.I look forward to another great book from Menand in the future.(By the way, I thought Menand's American Studies was simply what was left over after his research of The Metaphysical Club, so I would not recommend that one.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Metaphysical Liars","review":"Anyone who praises this book has never read it. Those who say they read it and liked it are lying through their teeth. Menand tries to explain science, and mathematics, about which he knows very little and the results are a mess. Over-written, poorly edited and not surprisingly it is available for $10 because no one in his right mind would pay full price for this junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Distinctly American","review":"The Metaphysical Club, while hefty in size, is an amazing piece of scholarship and writing. Menand's book, while nonfiction, reads much like a novel--characters interact as if it were a TV drama--in order to tell the story of the development of the distinctly modern, distinctly American idea of pragmatism. Throughout the book, the key players--Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., William James, Charles Sanders Peirce, and John Dewey--are richly highlighted by their always eccentric, sometimes hilarious contemporaries. Anyone interested in how American pragmatism developed would surely enjoy Menand's excellently-researched and written text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry as Dust","review":"A dissenting view--I came to this book as someone who wanted a good introduction to Pragmatism. I have to say that I was disappointed. The book meanders all over the place, telling gossipy stories of the Civil War, Dartmouth College/University, and Hetty Green that the author barely bothers to tie into his main theme. I kept thinking, \\"Okay, when are we going to get to the part about Pragmatism?\\" Only in the last chapters do we finally get a comprehensive explanation of what Pragmatism is, but these chapters could easily be read on their own, without the buildup of all that came before.A very perplexing read. A book that isn't sure what it wants to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing short of a tour de force","review":"A great look into the philosophical concepts emerging from the mid-to-late 19th century and early 20th century. For anyone studying American History, Philosophy, or just looking for a great read, The Metaphysical Club provides a vivid image of American life through clear-cut prose not found in too many books today. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perpetually on the verge","review":"This book, initially so promising, was ultimately extremely annoying. The essence of these philosophers' thought is suffocated by biographical mishmash and annoying side trips. As I turned the pages, I hoped that Menand would manage to tie all of his many loose strings together, or at least to explain with some clarity what his subjects had in common. No such luck. Three-quarters of the way through I abandoned hope. Pity the poor editor whose job it was to make a book of Menand's meanderings. I am totally mystified why this book garnered such nice reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audio CD fine, direction and scope unclear","review":"The audio CD set was fine, but it was mysterious why these particular figures were covered, and what scope of years was covered and why. The audio CD never stated what the theme, scope, or thesis was, so its coverage seemed arbitrary. So it's hard to say whether the book (as reflected in the CD) achieved its purpose.I may not be the best reviewer, as a philosopher who knows little so far about American intellectual history. This audio book was fairly edifying, but a bit mystifying as well. I may read the book to determine the conceptual scope.Aside from the lack of a roadmap and justification for its scope and figures covered, the audio CD was well executed and I would definitely recommend it for anyone looking for good nonfiction audio books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, come on","review":"Didn't anyone find this book overwritten and pedantic, not to mention highly unfocused and rambling? A good editor would have lopped 200 pages off, including the completely irrelevant long opening descriptions of Holmes' Civial War escapades. A better title: Name Dropping Through History."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pulitzer?","review":"I guess this won the Pulitzer for the most comprehensive theory. There is too much unnecessary information in this book. This was like reading the transcript of your grandfather's latest 19 hour talking spree on the civil war and the post civil war era. ZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzz!!! If you like to know about every nook n' cranny about the a few few characters from the civil war and the post civil war era mixed with a thick layer of philosophy then this is your book. But don't take my word for it. This was a required reading for a Master's class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"This book is perhaps deep and thoughtful but it is unnecessarily obtuse and droning. The author loses sight of his goals on almost every page nesting stories within stories within stories like someone cackling on and on.It is inconcise dribbling on about information that it was clear the author dug up and was so excited about he just had to include it even though it was irrelevant. Combine that with an unnecessarily high-brow vocabulary and you have hard to understand and slow drum beating prose.While there is information in this book that is fascinating it is lost inside a poor writing style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wondering","review":"One star is strange because the book is an enlightening one. However one sentence, p. 375, makes you wonder if the author understands what he himself narrates, a story that begins under the spell of the Civil war: \\"Pragmatism explains everything about ideas except why a person would be willing to die for one\\". A case of divided brain? Or maybe of belief that writing an history of ideas does not necessitate reading those who produced those ideas?

I think he remembers this CD as one of the few things that soothed him as a newborn. I think it was one of the few things that soothed me as well! Its beauty and gentleness stayed with us through the birth of another child and beyond. (My second boy asks for Einini.)

Both try to fight their feelings for each other between finding a murderer and having sexy interactions.I love love love Terri, she is sooo damn funny, (and not in that generic humorous way that most authors try to fork off on readers , this is good writing)I found myself trying to remember her wisecracks and saving them for myself. Hall is able to develop such a rich character in Terri when it seems some authors dont bother with the effort. Usually you get the virtuous cinderalla who says and does all she needs to do in order to keep the story going.

I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. Hysterical!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A lightweight comedy that made me laugh out loud","review":"This 2009 film is a lightweight comedy. And sometimes a lightweight comedy is just what the doctor ordered. I smiled throughout and sometimes actually laughed out loud. This film is funny and there's something about it which is easy to relate to.The main character, played by Paul Rudd, is getting married. However, he just doesn't have a male friend to be his best man. And so he starts on a quest to look for a friend. His adventures are hilarious as one guy after another seems wrong. One is gay, one is too old and one is just plain mean. And then he meets Sydney, played by Jason Segal, and the fun really starts. Sydney is an over-the-top caricature of every clich�� you've ever heard about being a guy. This is good for a lot of laughs as the Paul Rudd character learns what it is like to be a \\"real\\" man. Naturally there is a happy conclusion. And it is very satisfying.Enjoy this film for what it is. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!","review":"This movie is hilarious! I waited to see it until it came out on DVD and I wish I would have seen it in theaters. Our redbox did not have the movie, so I picked it up from the store instead. I'm so happy we ended up buying it -- it is that funny! My husband and I are huge fans of Jason Segal (Forgetting Sarah Marshall=hilarious! I Love You Man=even funnier!), and we love Paul Rudd also! This is a great movie, you will not be disappointed. Not as vulgar as other people are making it out to be, so I guess it depends on your age group and your sense of humor! I personally thought this movie was funnier than the Hangover. I highly suggest it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my Favorites","review":"One of my favorite movies of all time.

Jamie Presly, as Denise, is a knock out, even with a horrible hairdo. John Favreau, as Barry-Denise' husband- is a laugh riot. Some of my favorite scenes are w/ Denise and Barry. All star cast was thoroughly entertaining. Loved Jane curtain and JK Simmons as Ma & Pa Klaven. Andy Samberg, as Robbie Klavin, is hilarious. Jason Segal was memorable in his role as Sidney. I loved the script and the actors were the perfect ingredients for their recipe making a comedy I believe will become a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, and finally...","review":"This was a very funny and entertaining movie.

It's funny.\\" He was entirely correct. I laughed out loud so many times that watching it was totally entertaining. The silly plot didn't even matter. This was more about the performances of some talented comedic actors than it was about the contrived tale of a young groom looking for guy friends to fill out his wedding party. What I especially appreciated was that it wasn't just base-level male humor, there was some base-level female humor in there too.Fun to watch for couples who aren't easily embarrassed in front of one another. And BTW: How fun was it to see original Not Ready For Prime Time Player, Jane Curtin??? Great ensemble cast."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Return of Ferrigno","review":"This movie was ok. Just ok. It had some yucks in it but it wasn't a great comedy. Worth a watch but I don't think it is a repeater like 40 Year Old Virgin or Wedding Crashers. The Ferrigno stuff was mildly funny and Jamie Presly is hot as usual. Favreau was kind of wasted and didn't really do much of anything. Sarah Marshal was better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely boring and pointless movie","review":"Was not funny. It used the same type of humor that was in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Knocked Up, and the 40 Year Old Virgin (and yes those movies had the same cast members). They are trying to sell us this type of humor over and over and in those movies it worked but in this movie it failed miserably. I am also sick of seeing the same people cast over and over again for these roles- you see a preview and you know right away what kind of movie it is and it is getting old.

It was moving, as it was about human friendships and relationships. It was funny to see the main character (Paul Rudd) struggle to find a man-friend.

This always gets the boys howling and slapping their knees, nudging each other and doubling over with hysteria. To me, it's boring, disgusting, brainless. And then we have the same comical performers that appear to have worked on every movie comedy for the past five years. We know their lovable mannerisms and can predict their dialogue before they even say it. Paul Rudd got boring fast when every scene pounded home to us that he's a real needy modern guy who needs the help of other guys to help him see the light.This movie is very much in the genre of Nice Guy Needs Help With Sex Life. All that was missing was Seth Rogan popping up to do his usual shouting, F___word spewing clown."},{"rating":"1","title":"sleeping aide","review":"if you have trouble sleeping this is the perfect movie for you.

I searched high and low and finally had to order it off of the Marketplace. It was well worth it. I should have ordered two copies in case one gets messed up. This CD is so relaxing.

If you like xmas then this book is for you, maybe not beginers but intermedite players. Most of the songs are easy to play with a couple more advanced. I say not for beginers because of the alternate tunings. These are not songs you sit down, play once and know. They take a week or 2 to get the hang of them. If you like sitting around a fire on a snowy day playing xmas songs buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful arrangements, but not for beginners!","review":"This is my second Mark Hanson fingerstyle book (the other is his Beyond Basics book.) The Christmas songs in this one are very well chosen, including absolutely stunning arrangements of Go Tell It On The Mountain and In Dulci Jubilo. It's worth the price for the CD that accompanies the book, just to hear Hanson playing!The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it's misleading to call four of these songs \\"easy.\\" These so-called \\"easy\\" songs are definitely not what most people would think of as easy! Others have made similar comments about the book being for intermediate to advanced players, and I completely agree. But if you have a few years playing experience and are at least an \\"advanced beginner\\" with respect to fingerstyle playing, then I highly recommend this collection of great songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"theres just something about this book that makes it boring","review":"I have read the book Little Women and I thought it was excellent, but this book Amy's story bored me to death.

This was in the 1970s and the first copy I bought was used. I was hooked and read all of them. I love the characters, particularly the Commisaris, and the tales progress in such an unconventional way. The conversations that take place are always worthwhile! I am presently reading them all again, loving them as much as I did 25 years ago. They are timeless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book, but too many errors in the Kindle edition","review":"I purchased this title in the Kindle edition. The book is very good, and I love the author, but the Kindle book has far too many errors for something that cost almost ten dollars. I have discovered errors on nearly every page, most usually the substitution of the letter 'd' for 't'. Some words are pure gibberish."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid Grijpstra and de Gier Mystery.","review":"I really enjoy the way that Van De Wetering handles the police procedural from the Dutch POV. Like Freeling and Simenon, his characters tend to live more in the lives of the commonplace than exploring sensational serial murders.In this novel, a virtual hermit is killed by a single shot-- very un-Dutch in a country where firearms are so controlled. It takes you through the underbelly of Amsterdam into houses of prostitution, the world of grey market electronics, and into the house of a flamboyant possible villain named Cat.Not my favorite Grijpstra and de Gier (that honor still goes to _Death of a Hawker_) but still a great example of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!!!!","review":"I am intrigued by the a small school professor's ability to see strategy so clearly.

Good deal, I'm happy with it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A cheap way to store your tri-pod or take it with you.","review":"I use this with a cheap full size sunpak (22\\" folded up) tripod and it works well. The strap is long enough to adjust it so that the case fits across your back. I use this for day hikes and wildlife photography. The strap is adjustable, but there isn't really any padding on the strap, so it can get a little uncomfortable on long hikes. The radius of the case is maybe 7 inches so tripods with large panning heads should fit alright. You may want to double check the specs, but I don't have to disassemble my tripod for it to fit in the bag, which I find convenient. The case its self is just a woven bag that won't really offer any protection. If you need protection you shouldn't be buying this bag, since it's not really a case at all. I think its only intended use is to store and make transporting a tripod by hand a little easier. Just man up and this tripod bag shouldn't be a problem. For the price it's a five star item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not last a week!!","review":"Very Poor Quality.

It can be enjoyed by both adults and children with neither becoming bored. The story telling within the story is gripping. It is a memorable video. I wish there were more movies made like this. My children, boys ages 11 to 13 enjoyed it. Younger children and girls would also enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roan Inish","review":"I saw this movie on a library DVD. It is a great story that is well written, directed and filmed.... but I have an aversion to seeing any child depicted in the nude (yes, frontal nudity of a two year old boy is repeatedly shown - which was totally not needed, they could have used shots from the waist up for instance).

Last year I bought it as a gift for my mother, this year I bought it for my daughters and myself.

True, there is magic but it is a singularly Irish magic. The heroine, a young Irish lass shows tremendous courage and tenacity in the face of adult disbelief. I think this is a story that, if it becomes known, will truly be a classic, an extremely good film for children and adults alike. Young children will need to watch the film with an adult for explanation of the somewhat complex plot, but the results of the girl's belief and willingness to accept responsibility is a marvelous moral message. I have given the film to my grand children and they also love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silkies","review":"I am of the West of Ireland where the Silkies live side-by-side with ondines and cluricauns and other assorted members of Yeats' Sidhe.

Jeni Courtney is quite convincing as the lead role of Fiona, the newly motherless girl who goes to live with her grandparents (Mick Lally and Eileen Colgan)and becomes tangled up with a mystery when she finds out from her cousin Eammon (Richard Sheridan) that Jamie, her long lost brother who was said to have drowned years ago, has actually been seen floating about with seals!

Of the three, it is by far the weakest in several respects: Hitler is one dimensional and over the top in presentation; his dialogue is generally made up of cobbled together verses and phrases from his speeches. Many of the Bunker principle players are missing.The film is dated and the inter-cut original footage does not work well. It looks out of place and only serves as a distraction. The movie really does not measure up next to \\"Downfall\\". I do give them credit for being the first to take on this subject matter as a feature film. However, don't think you're watching history unfold in this movie, especially at the end when there is a fictional \\"soap opera\\" turn of events as Eva Braun and then Hitler commit suicide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"'Hitler: the Last Ten Days\\" is a very realistic portrayal of Adolf Hitler's days in the Berlin bunker. Alec Guinness plays history's most famous evil goofball very convincingly. The film presents verified events in a very engaging manner. It's an expensive movie, but if you have any interest in Adolf Hitler you will find it well worth the price.

I have never laughed so hard in my life. Although based on REAL events that took place in Hitler's Bunker, there is obviously a GREAT deal of theatrical license at work in the dialogue. You'll never believe what comes out of these people's mouths! When Alec Guinness declares that there is \\"no shortage of cream\\" in the Bunker, I just completely lost it... It's nowhere near as accurate as Downfall, but who needs accuracy when you've got an over the top Alec Guinness chewing up scenery and screaming at the top of his lungs. It's an absolute LAUGH RIOT!!

The protagonist, Piper, just can't seem to catch a break. I cried so much while I read the book.The language is beautifully poetic, drawing up vivid pictures of Piper's home and surroundings. I loved the relationships in the book -- the characters are all human, flawed yet interesting.But what is best about this book is that it is at the core -- apart from a book about dying, and about abandonment, and about rape -- a book about female friendship. Piper is dying, and her best friend Becca is by her side. They go through a lot, the two of them, that might have severed a less strong friendship, but they stick together, and that is a wonderful thing to see, in fiction or in real life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I positively loved this book.

Johnston captures the true essence of the men that fought and suffered in the Civil War. As with all U.S. wars, ordinary young men who were farmers, shopkeeps, mill operators, etc... from small towns across the country like Kalamazoo, MI did extraordinary things. A great story set in accurate historical context, I hope there's a sequel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite vivid in its portrayal of a war-torn America","review":"Set in 1862 during the American Civil War, The Boys from Kalamazoo by t. J. Johnston is a fictional account of the famous Kalamazoo Sharpshooters. Lending a vibrant freshness to a yesteryear world of American history peopled with the heroes, villains, ordinary soldiers, and citizenry who fought and died in the toils and turmoils of a bloody civil war, The Boys From Kalamazoo is entertaining, thoughtful, thought-provoking, and quite vivid in its portrayal of a war-torn America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reality beats","review":"A rich Argentinean FAZENDER sacrifices his twenty nine year marriage, grown kids and everybody around for copulating-sick sheep's favors, being put down by a natural competitor-a ram, and his son-in-law is seemingly to follow into his footsteps.Really, something is wrong in societies where asset owners' delusions overweight a logic and daily reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much less than expected!","review":"This TV is not very sensitive and does not pick up stations very well.

The camera looks good and it feels solid. Good piece of engineering. There's only one fundamental issue with the camera - it can't focus. Roughly 25% of pictures I took were blurry for no apparent reason. I emailed Fuji to get updated firmware, but was asked to call them and did not have the time to hang on the phone with customer support. I used an old Canon S20 before and never had similar issues.

It takes up no space on the desk and with the AC adapter included, battery life is a non-issue. I've found that I can squeeze about 4 full-length albums onto a single CD and the playback is bearable through slightly upgraded earphones.

In it, he gives voices to two dogs for a night, who tell each other all about their experiences under their different masters. Cervantes uses this fantastic scenario to sketch out a satire of human behaviour of his time in a way that is almost picaresque, and greatly entertaining. It should certainly be of interest to anyone interested in Cervantes, or simply anyone who enjoyed Don Quixote. The new translation by hesperus is of the same high quality as I have found all their other ones, and it is no less attractively produced.

The first half of the book hints at the possibility of some deepness in the second half, but disappoints in that respect. The \\"Afterward\\" gives the appearance of the story being non-fiction, but unless the author is using a male pseudonym, that would be impossible.If you want to follow the meaningless lives of two sisters and wallow in the elder's loneliness, peccadilloes, and bad judgements then this is a book for you.

The lack of intelligent issues and/or depth of thought is astounding. Wright's use of the female voice as well as his attempt to go back to the year 1945 while keeping the thoughtful reader even vaguely interested has failed. Were Wright to have written from his own patriarchal, present-day perspective, his attempt at writing an engaging, intelligent novel would most likely have been more successful. For those who enjoy shallow, easy-to-follow books, this one is for you!

I couldn't wait to listen and be moved by the lyrics.My impression of his songwriting is that he is repetitious, simplistic, and sometimes even childlike - as if he was writing an album of children's songs. He always goes for the easy rhyme and, when all else fails, just repeats the same line over and over again.If you want to listen to some fine songwriting, I suggest you listen to the music of Stan Rogers, or John Gorka.

Where most games nowadays have you shoot and kill any and everything that moves, the biggest goal of this game is to sneak around and get through the missions without killing a single person. This is challenging in itself, and makes for a different and fun challenge from most games. Not a bad play through at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellet Co-Op Campaign","review":"Arrived quickly in great condition. I have yet to play the singleplayer story line.

These tools are made in China, which was not mentioned in the tool description on the web; that might have given me a better clue what to expect.

Indeed I did find \\"The Return\\" not only refreshing and exciting, but so much more. The words exhilarating, exciting, riveting and heartstopping suspense immediately come to mind. \\"The Return\\" has all the components of a bestseller by any standard. I was especially impressed by the tasteful romanticism intertwined throughout the intriguing and riveting action. I was so engrossed in this book that I got behind in my housework! And that's rare for me. I really appreciated the positive image portrayed of Africa, the African-American as well as that of women. \\"The Return\\" also gives insight into the author's personality (Iron that does not fear fire).

I'm not one to speculate the next turn of a story--good thing because everytime I thought I knew what to expect next, the story went in a different direction.

Generally magic realism in any form appeals to me. Now I am wondering how this writer managed to get his reputation if 'The Leaf Storm' is representative of the qualty on offer. The characters are psychologically implausible; unsympathetic and unconvincing, the plot is uninspired and uninteresting and I found the language at best, inconguous without resonance or beauty, at worst cliched. Any surreal qualities this book has feel like a contrived cover for its lack of substance. I really wouldn't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best work on Stravinsky","review":"Mr. Walsh's new book on Stravinsky has some interesting anecdotes and insights into the years in America for the composer but seems to lack real relevance historically.What seems to be missing from this new book is any primary sources for his many anecdotes. The Stravinsky estate after his death is a matter of public record in the courts, yet Mr. Walsh has not done the research to get the real facts. Why?There are excellent books by sources much closer to Stravinsky--to say the least Robert Craft's. Craft a twenty year associate of Stravinsky documented just about every waking moment of Stravinsky's life. Referring back to some of Craft's books on Stravinsky I find that Walsh has lifted numerous writings from Craft rather than bringing anything of real interest to life for the reader.I have to say, this book is not the best work on Stravinsky and I hope other readers will go to better sources for a cohesive and cogent telling of Stravinsky's life and career."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best albums of the 80s.

The lyrics are as relevant today as they were then and the sound has aged beautifully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lou Reed's best concept album.","review":"New York (1989) tells the story about life in New York City. Adark and depressing album with a light at the end of the tunnel. Lou Reed expresses his deep affection for his beloved city with moving lyrics and carefully structured guitarriffs, solos and a fantastic rhythm section. Maureen Tucker and Dion make special apperances on this disc. Finally, a truthful look at the eighties like it truly was. Beneath all the excess and glitter, life was terrible for the masses. This winner was followed up by another equally great (and dark and dreary) album.Highly recommended. Endless Cycle, X-mas in Februray and Romeo had Juliet are some of the best tracks on this disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harsh, Agressive and Beautiful!","review":"New York is everything a Lou Reed album should be and more.

But \\"Dime Story Mystery\\" is an homage to a really awful movie, Martin Scorcese's \\"The Last Temptation of Christ\\"; \\"Good Evening, Mr. Waldheim\\" is as topical as the daily newspaper: it was dated within a few months of its release--or maybe within a few weeks or days; and if \\"[that WAS] the time\\" in 1989, it can't very well be now, can it?

With New York, Lou hits heights not seen since the Velvet Underground. Romeo Had Juliette is a simply stunning opener, hard-driving poetry set to a beautifully distorted guitar beat; Dirty Boulevard is justly famous for its \\"Statue of Bigotry\\" verse; and Strawman manages to be fiercely compassionate and just plain mean at the same time. There are other highlights, but let it just be said that this, my friends, is rock and roll."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time and money--steer clear of this one.","review":"I make my living as a conflict management trainer and consequently make it my business to be familiar with books that I can recommend to my clients to help them deal more comfortably and effectively with conflict.

The cat is now out of the bag -or, forgive me -the cork is now out of the bottle. Oldman's Guide gets to the point with down-to-earth and useful information. It really is all about \\"shortcuts to a connoisseur's confidence,\\" to borrow a line from the BW review. The organization of the book is the most helpful I've seen in a wine guide -with crisp, funny headings and clear charts. My wife and I have had a lot of fun mastering many of the book's \\"secret alternative\\" wines -buying up great and very affordable versions of Barbera, Dolcetto, Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand, Viognier and even Chinon, the crisp French red. It has also begun our love affair with Pinot Gris, done best in the Willamette Valley of Oregon, a perfect wine as the weather gets warmer. We refer back to this book endlessly for its sound advice and accessible approach."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great introductory book","review":"Truthfully, most introductory books have very similar contents. Mark Oldman's book is great in a sense that it does have all the right information and it's presented in a smart, fresh and really approachable way.Probably my favorite introductory wine book out there, simply because it's a pleasure to read and it's written by someone who doesn't just claim to demystify wine, but who actually does it.Flipping through these pages is easy and quite fun.

Here the film is packed with talented and aspiring people - but there is something seriously lacking - the entertainment factor. I became quite disappointed when I discover that the potential of a product, such as Dr. T and the Woman, can become so disillusioned by the need to achieve what seams to be the producer and director's personal watermark - 'something I can leave behind'.

Anyone who finds the director, Robert Altman, to be a genius needs to make sure they have eaten their green jello before leaving the mental institution. Every actor and actress in this flick need to double-check what they are paying their agent. I am still waiting for someone to tell me what the plot was. I normally don't go out of my way to critique a movie but people need to heed the warning about this one. It's unbelievable what Hollywood will spend money on.

I have never written a review before, but after watching this movie I needed some way to lash out at having wasted two hours hoping the movie would redeem itself with a proper ending, however, I was grossly disappointed in that also.

While I liked \`Cookie's Fortune' less than most folks, I liked this more. Funny, sweet, and about as good as Richard Gere has ever been. The last 20 minutes are indeed a mixed bag. However, personally I liked the symbolic, surreal ending, even if some of the plot twists leading up to it felt clunky, and didn't make a lot of sense.But the bottom line is, this is certainly more original and thought-provoking than most modern movies. And that's enough to win a lot of brownie points from me"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only For Farrah Fans To Buy a Bad Movie!","review":"Richard Gere is prominent Dr. T the gynecologist. The opening scene has Mr. Gere looking at an elderly lady during her gynecolgical check up. From the opening scene, you think this movie would be funny. However, a talented cast was wasted in this mediocre script. Poor Farrah had only a few scenes but did have third star billing. She does do a nude scene in the shopping mall's water fountain. The other cast is in small scenes as well, with maybe the exception of Helen Hunt. Shelly Long is funny in her role as Richard Gere's assistant, who is secretly in love with him. The lesbian sequence should have been eliminated because it was very small and didn't add much to the plot of the movie. But then again, the movie doesn't really have much plot. Anyway, if you are a Farrah fan and want to collect all of her movies, add this to your collection in her memory. However, I for one am glad that I only spent $1.99 for this dvd. Sorry to the Robert Altman's fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there a way to give a -5 stars, it was a huge waste","review":"I beg of you, not to waste your dollars or time.

Any child who had grown up with a physician father, or any father with a hectic, high pressure job, would know better than to go to his work place and ask for a few minutes to drop a bomb on him. They would choose the weekend, or at the very least, a week night to have a heart-to-heart. If you're going to make a big mess of a movie, at least have it be realistic.With the great cast, you would think no way this film COULD be bad. This movie is so bad its almost unbelievable.

Unfortunately, since it was considered socially unacceptable to get up and walk out of the theatre I sat through the ENTIRE painful film.Even then, I thought that no movie could ever come close to being this horrendous, including those made at home by a high schooler.

I did watch it all the way through, wondering where it was going. As many of the supporting rolls were performed by interesting actors, I was hoping to see more development but was left hanging. The ending is really disappointing it just runs out of gas. It was like the film makers did not know how to end it and they just winged it. I was just as confused as Richard Gere in the wedding scene.

He's in the midst of a fling with Helen Hunt who must have a quota of crappy movies to make in a single year. Just when you thought this movie could bite no more, he drives his convertible into a tornado and lands in Mexico in time to deliver (we get to see a live birth) a baby.

Its hard to believe that so many fine actors will agree to anything to work with Altman. This has certainly lowered my opinion of the director.

In conclusion, I would not reccomend this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've seen worse - but not often","review":"I expected this to be a \\"chick flick\\", but my wife and daughters agreed with me that Dr. T and the Women wasn't worth the cost of the rental. The story just drags on and on and the ending could only be described as a bizarre idea from the twisted mind of someone overly influenced by the beginning of the Wizard of Oz.As bad as the movie was, the \\"making of\\" feature on the DVD is even worse. It appears that the director and actors are genuinely proud of this movie - or maybe they saved all their acting talent for the \\"making of\\" feature. They can't be serious and it's sad to see them gushing over how wonderful they think this poor excuse of a movie is. Remind me to skip anything else Robert Altman directs...

The Love interest story played by Helen Hunt goes nowhere and leaves you feeling flat and down. At the end of the movie they had an un-necessary birth scene that bordered on hard core ponography, just too much. I believe that the actors in this movie did a fine job acting but they had nothing to work with. Was there a plot? I really don't think so. I almost did not watch the movie to the end.

Another celebrity filled 2 hours you will never get back.Dr. T and the women is exactly that. AWFUL. I might watch it on a plane, if I was snoozing in between.

This, as Gramophone magazine recognized upon original release, is one of the really great triumphs of musical recordings, an immediate and lasting classic.

These albums remind me of Van Morrison's \\"Poetic Champions Compose.\\" A terrific album but not particularly differentiable from the records that came just before and after. Further, it's hard to identify a single song that speaks for the album. In other words, there is no hit single. Over time, Tikaram will be appreciated for the accumulated body of her work rather than any single song or album. I'm shocked to see several of her albums unavailable here in the US.

I never play this album...ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Bon-Westerberg????","review":"Not a good album, but actually it was their only bad one. There really aren't any bad songs on this album but man the production is just god awful. If I were westerberg I would take these tunes and get a decent producer and then do em over, because they really aren't that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do exactly what the album asks you to do!","review":"Don't tell a soul about this album, because they might get the notion that this is what the 'Mats were all about. P.U. A stinker from beginning to end, this was Paul's greatest VH-1 splurge. In five short years, the band that put out LET IT BE (BUY THIS), turned into a sappy, Kenny Rogers cover band. Do yourself a favor, buy nothing they put out on Sire/Warner. The records that came from Twin/Tone are pure gold. The only slight exception is Tim, which had 5 or 6 true gems on it. But this? It signalled the death of one of my favorites, and I admit, I was bitter. Still am, obviously. Go to Twin/Tone country!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't tell anyone","review":"The number one reason why chorus is a poor choice for guitar. Paul Westerberg is too good of a songwriter for a total flop, but his grain-heavenly voice can't save this one. A few redeeming moments, but one left off the album. I doubt his pop stardom would've made me think otherwise. (noteworthy: \\"Church,\\" \\"I won't,\\" \\"we know the night\\") Pales in comparison to classic lp's \\"Let it Be,\\" and \\"Tim\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bob where are you?","review":"I always felt that Bob Stinson (and Chris Mars to an extent)was the only thing keeping Paul Westbergh from going totally pop. Bob gave the band a reckless and harder sound. Somehow the boys were able to make an excellent first effort (Please to Meet Me) after Bob died, but this album showed that \\"Pleased..\\" was a fluke. This album should not even be compared with any of the Replacements' albums before. It is pop, pop and more pop. Oh sure, they have one or two songs that might have made it on to \\"Tim\\" or \\"Pleased..\\", but overall, it was a tragically bad effort by a legendary band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps the last bit of truth in this dying world.","review":"Paul Westerberg is THE truest, most honest poet of the modern world. He is both the grace of Lord Byron, the inner-depth of William Blake and the power of John Milton. I love you, Paul and I want to know you're alive and well. It's time. If not for you, than for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the great Replacements albums","review":"This is a great album. Althought 'Tim' and 'Pleased To Meet Me' are better overall, this album has some absolute classics. Between the great pop songs 'Talent Show' and 'Achin to be', we are given a couple of classic slacker themes in 'We'll Inherit the Earth' and 'I'll be You', along with the poetic 'darling one'. For fans of pop, you won't find yourself unsatisified."},{"rating":"2","title":"head and shoulders above anything today","review":"yes this isn't their best album.... I think we all can agree on that but even so compared to modern bands like oh... eve 6, bush, wallflowers, everclear, smashmouth,....etc etc you can see that the music fans of the 80's were spoiled....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just buy it...don't ask questions","review":"Quite honestly, one of the greatest albums ever made. I too don't understand why 'Mat fans hate this album...maybe it's because I'm just a dumb girl, I love it so much. (I defy any fellow dumb girl to not listen to \\"Darlin' One\\" and shed a tear or two) As far as commercialization goes, I'd have to disagree completely. When were the Replacements EVER commercialized? \\"I'll Be You\\" was the only 'Mats song to break into the top 100 of any pop chart, which makes me wonder if the stigma of being \\"The Best Band to Never Become Famous\\" is such a bad thing. Agreed that this is the beginning of Paul Westerberg's solo career....I'm sorry, but the man is just a genious. If it's possible to wear out a CD from too much play, I pray that the God of Musical Bliss keeps my weathered copy of \\"Don't Tell A Soul\\" alive for a few more years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Album from a Great Band","review":"I've always wondered why people dislike this album. To me, it seems to be one of the Mats' finest efforts. Four of the songs are instant Mats classics (\\"Talent Show,\\" \\"We'll Inherit the Earth,\\" \\"Achin' to Be,\\" and \\"Rock and Roll Ghost\\") and all of the other songs are very good. The production does sound a bit too 80s on some songs (i.e \\"Asking Lies\\"), but the songs are good enough to overcome any production flaws. The disc also happens to be The Replacements' most mature album. There are no songs like \\"Gary's Got a Boner,\\" which is probably for the best. \\"Don't Tell a Soul\\" picks up where \\"Can't Hardly Wait\\" and \\"Skyway\\" left off, meaning that the album is more subdued than their previous efforts, yet the band can still rock, as evinced by the songs \\"Anywhere is Better Than Here\\" and \\"I Won't.\\" If you like The Replacements, then buy this; if you don't like The Replacements, buy this album and see the light."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weakest Link","review":"The Mats were among the all-time greats. Westerberg is an American Ray Davies. And, like the Kinks, the Mats reached their nadir in the late 80s. Bad hair metal, totally 80s production is completely inappropriate for a Davies or Westerberg song. I've got no beef with Paul maturing. One can't do the whiskey-before-gym class routine forever. \\"All Shook Down\\" is a better album. Growing up doesn't have to sound as lame & cheesey as this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Westerberg Set The Bar So High","review":"The reason many 'Mats fans aren't that fond of this album is that Westerberg set the bar so high on previous albums that this one falls dramatically short in the songwriting department. \\"I'll Be You\\" is as good aanything he's ever written, and \\"Talent Show\\" gets high praises, but after that, nothing seems to work. Unlike, \\"All Shook Down\\", most of this album is just to drab in comparison to the standard he set as a songwriter. If I was asked which 'Mats LP not to own, this would be the one, (save \\"I'll Be You\\", of course.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"If I could only have 5 albums.....this is on the list","review":"This album hits me from note one and never stops. Absolutely brilliant song-writing and the boys seem to have put the beer bottle down long enough to finally take themselves seriously (literally: you can here a bottle hit the floor in 'Talent Show' - I love that.) Not to take from the attempts the lads took to depart from the normal car wreck approach on 'Tim' or 'Pleased To Meet Me', this release is cohesive and mature - they turned the corner on this one. Those who fell in love with the thrashpop of 80's Mats will no doubt call them a sell-out as 'I'll Be You' received a fair amount of radio time in the early 90s. This is a Replacements masterpiece - buy it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the finest books on libraryhistory!","review":"This is definetely one of the most stunning books about books, thathave been published in recent times.

Every stop is out. Solti's conducting is electric and the soloists of the highest calibre- Minton and Popp's vocal talents are rich and warm but never too intrusive and blend in superbly with the music. Solti's pace is a little on the brisque side but this only adds to the overall sense of occasion and greatness of the piece. A worthy entry into this mammoth symphony. When compared with other versions Solti holds his own admirably with this electric perfromance- not as warm a sound as Tennstedt's but more wide ranging, dynamic and rich. Buy, switch off the lights and prepare yourself for an experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Symphony of a Thousand Is One in a Thousand","review":"Solti owns this. Of course he enlistst the help of hundreds of wonderful artists. The recording dates back into the analog days but with this new transfer it almost attains the same sounds as a digital recording---hence the sound is spectacular. The voices are recorded extremely well and the orchestra is balanced perfectly. Solti obviously has delved into this work and brings out the beauty, majesty and sheer force that Mahler intended, and he does this moreso than most other conductors that have recorded this piece. At mid price, this CD is the obvious first and best choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A landmark","review":"This must be one of the very few recordings that was never intended to be made in order to make any money...All those relentless efforts. I don't think they make such recordings anymore, in an age of global marketing, cold-blooded profit making and blindest frenzy for total shareholder return...This is an event of epic proportions, and especially astoundingly good sound quality given the fact that this was 1971... Ten stars for the engineers alone.Solti at his artistic finest. Grand, but still subtle, drama, but no pathos. The choir work is breathtaking. It sounds like opera. As intense and well-refined. I particularly like the short appearance of Rene Kollo; very fluent, youthful, almost light. A nice contrast to some of the other singers.I always thought Karajan's digital live-Ninth was Mahler's best and finest, and while this may still hold true, this one comes darn close..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astounding Mahler","review":"Listen to it yourself.Don't let anyone else tell you what to think.You will know what you are hearing.There will be no doubt left in your mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Monumental Mahler Symphony.","review":"This version towers over all others. Superbly produced and performed, Sir George Solti has left one of the great recordings of this work.

This makes it a little hard to classify, but then no matter what your mood there is a song on here for you. I think this would appeal to anyone who likes folk or bluegrass and doesn't mind if the extra production is stripped away and the music is left bare.

Oil-less operation means no oil blown on a fine veneer that would foil a finish. The tools light weight belies the precisely controlled power available. Exact fastener depth control means no blow through, no hand setting - leaving the minimum hole to deal with for finish. The steep angle of the magazine allows difficult corners to be fastened easily.

Her muscled voice, sounding very assured here, is more than capable of carrying this R&B standard with finese and confidence; and from the sounds of it, the aggressive beat of her last outings is becoming her instrumental trademark. So my complaint is not with her reading at all, but with the lack of Erin that appears on this nearly 70 minute disc. Of the eight tracks here, five are dub mixes that reduce her vocal to mere percussive accents, making for superfluously extended (hence, boring) remix treatments. Van Cleave's remix--which includes Erin's full vocal-- is by far the best track here. Other's may have rivaled his work (Tony Estrada, specifically) had vocal versions been chosen for inclusion over basically instrumentals. After all, it is Erin's voice that drives this song so perfectly.

You may have to get them separately, but Isaac Stern does them much better. I find Ms. Chung's playing to be uneven, choppy and full of seams. The phrasing is not smooth. Her vibrato is also very sloppy in places. Frankly, having listened to several recordings of these two pieces over many years I would have to keep thesediscs out of the running entirely. I would recommend Stern orFrancescatti in the Bruch and Stern in the Mendelssohn. You getthe tops Tchaikovsky performance as well if you get Stern (with score cuts in overly repetitive measures)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of control","review":"Kyung-Wha Chung tends to be too edgy, histrionic and out of control.

I have never really been a great fan of the Mendelssohn work included here but I enjoyed the Scottish Fantasia, which sort of made up for it. I have been aware of this recording for 20 years but I had not heard it until I bought it. My previous standard by which I measured the Bruch was the wonderful Oistrakh version of the same work, recorded in the 1960's. The dynamics of this piece were not previously as apparent to me as now and there are passages in this recording which really make my hair stand on end. Kyung Wha Chung makes the instrument speak as I have never heard it before and that, combined with a subtlety as well as some blistering runs, started to really speak of the genius of Max Bruch. A good performer can do a piece justice but it takes a great one to give the listener an insight into the ability and intention of the composer. Kyung Wha Chung really raised the bar with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mini Altoids Makes Much Moisture","review":"I love the mini sugar free altoids and keep one tin in my purse and another by my bedside.

The 3M Weather Sealing tape is much better quality and more effective than either of the previous products I used (Home Depot and Lowe's generic brands). Having had them on my windows for the last few months, the amount of heat kept in by sealing the windows with this product has really helped me to keep from freezing inside during the winter. Also, compared to the generic plastic, this one was much less tear-prone (once you have even a small tear in the insulation plastic, its basically useless). The tape has also remained adhesive throughout. No, it can't replace those new windows I badly need, but in the meantime it does a decent job of keeping cold air from coming through my window panes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Energy Saver","review":"This high quality, easy to use product probably paid for itself in less than 2 weeks.

The biggest weakness is the absence of detailed historical facts about the course of the 1485 Bosworth campaign, which encourages the author to extrapolate from a handful of facts. When the author depicts three possible different locations on the battle maps for the vital contingents of the Stanleys, it only serves to reinforce the vagueness of detail available on this battle. The actual fighting is covered in less than 10 pages out of 95. Furthermore, why a brief dynastic skirmish of a handful of Englishmen in the 15th Century merits a campaign title is never convincingly explained. There is very little actual detail throughout and this is further diminished by a writing style that moves at a sluggish pace. Information on order of battle and casualties is negligible.

This has the downside that some non-fans will be convinced that the film is really a classic and excellent film, and not just a fan cornerstone.Dawn of the Dead starts without a beginning, there is no introduction to the setting, the story, or the characters. It is so confusing that I had to go back to see if I missed a chapter. It also has mediocre acting, mediocre make-up and effects, and a mediocre story. I strongly suspect that it has been so influential solely because it was *first* with something or other, not because of ultimate quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is very very bad","review":"This movie has no real plot or story direction, bad acting, bad special effects and not scary.

Romero scores big time with this genuinely frightening, inteligent comentary on the human race. While the main plot is the characters trying to survive, Romero sneeks in a sub-plot about human indulgences. The main characters start off in a tv station, but when they get their hands on a helicopter, they run off to a mall. The characters board themselves up in the mall (much like the characters in Night do to the house) and temporarily have the mall all to themselves. In this time, they go on a rampage through the mall, taking whatever they want, back up to their little room upstairs. Of course, like all Romero films, things go awry, and we are treated to a spectacular finish. In the end, its not the zombies the characters worry about, but something far worse.

The mall is filled with zombies. Tom Savini leads a gang of bikers who want the mall for themselves and go after Ken & co. (all GREAT performances) and you actually feel bad for the zombies who are getting attacked by Savini & his bikers. Cool twists, cool flick,great acting, & SPFX the best Zombie film if you ask me.

Excellent special effects (especially for 1978)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Twelve Oaks\\" of Terror","review":"Okay, so I hear about this movie from my 13 year old brother who says it looks cool. Then, one of my buddies invites me to go see it (I'm 11 at the time) \\"The movie takes place in a mall, and we're gonna see it at the new mall, Twelve Oaks!\\" Okay, to be honest, I didn't make it through it the first time (It scared the crap out of me!) I finally watched it again in High School, and it has since become one of my favorite movies. I think it made such a lasting impression on me due to the fact that I saw it in a shopping mall. This is the pinacle of 1970's horror. (The remake isn't half bad, but this is the original) This film has everything working for it...Director, story, music, mood and acting. I have since had the pleasure meeting Tom Savini and David Emgee, who help make it one of my favorite films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch out...","review":"Hey all, if you are thinking of buying this DVD...DONT!!!Just wait for the big disk collection coming out soon. I actually thought this DVD was the directors cut..it's not. Don't be fooled. I got the real directors cut on VHS a long time ago and it was UNCUT. But this dvd, is known as the directors cut but it is NOT!!! it has scenes missing. Still watchible, but if I were you, I'd wait for the big set to come out with this version, the TRUE DIRECTORS CUT,the dario version, and DOCUMENT OF THE DEAD. You will thank me."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Fraser, Zombie Freak!","review":"Can i just say that DAWN OF THE DEAD is a true work of art.The storyline, the action, and everything else works better then i ever expected in a horror film, the atmosphere is astounding and the zombies do excellent in this fine piece of work from and can i say 'a true master' GEORGE A ROMERO.I would like him and would think thousands of other fans like him to do more 'zombie' flicks but in different situations.Im not going to spoil this GREAT horror because you must buy it to be believed, your money will be worth spent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST of the dead","review":"After recently buying a Korean copy of DOTD on eBay, and having it lock up in my DVD player, I was i complete anticipation of this new one. It may not be the director's cut, but it certainly is the best version of the film I've ever seen. Transfer is crystal clear, audio is Dolby enhanced w/surround sound if enabled, sountrack errors (like when it slices short after they shoot Wooley) are corrected...All in all, one great DVD for the die hard collector or even the first time viewer. This is the way to watch this film. When the two-disc director's cut comes out, I'll buy that too. This was a sweet movie. Not necissarily the scariest movie ever made (as they advertise), but still one you watch over and over again because you like the characters.Night of the living dead was dry, and Day of the Dead sucked. This was the one to see. Enjoy it"},{"rating":"2","title":"I must agree with evildead01","review":"This is a great movie on its own merit; why create a remake which, while it will surely have superior special effects, is almost certain to be infoerior without the creative genius of Romero behind it? This disturbing trend of remaking horror movies, and updating them with a bunch of lame hip characters and cheesy soundtracks a la the new Texas Chainsaw Massacre with teenybopper Jessica Biehl, is very annoying. Remaster and re-release this classic to the theatres instead. But since they are not going to do that, be sure and check out this DVD, the movie is one of the great pieces of horror of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"See Night of the Living Dead Instead...","review":"This movie is silly. It's often boring, while the gore is comic, the zombies are as blue as smurfs and there isn't a scary moment in it. I totally recommend Night of the Living Dead, which is a quintessential horror film that is effectively creepy... Dawn of the Dead is just camp."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY VERY VERY BAD","review":"This is the definition of bad movies. This is among the top two worst movies ever. The other one is Vampirella.I don't know what it is because I enjoyed Creepshow and The Dark Half, but this movie is excruciatingly horrible. By the end of the movie you feel as if you've been watching a documentary of an Ed Wood movie. The makeup is so cheesy and the special effects aren't that special.I don't understand the motivations people have to make movies like this. This movie is pointless, boring, and it doesn't flow. Sam Raimi's Evil Dead series was brilliantly done. I just can't imagine anybody enjoying this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Yawn for the Dawn of the dead","review":"I rented the director's cut VHS because I heard they are coming out with a remake in 2004. I never saw the Dawn of the Dead until a few days ago, so I felt I had to see the original before I saw the remake. Many fans of this movie were complaining because they don't want to see a remake, but I say bring it on because you can't go anywhere but UP with a remake for this movie. The dialog was as awful as the characters. The movie started off slow, bad make-up job on the zombies, typical falling on the ground and making bad decisions that make you want to groan and shake your head. I realize this is an old movie and that is why I said bring on the remake and put some of these Creative minds, great make-up artists and technology (special effects) to work. I looove horror movies and this movie wasn't scary AT ALL. Highly laughable, very slow, but not scary. For anyone who hasn't already seen this movie wait for the remake because you aren't missing much."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY VERY VERY overated!","review":"This movie is a disgrace to all zombie flicks. It is not at all scary, the zombies look too human,(In some cases this is a good thing, but here, it is not)and it is extremely boring. For some reason a lot of other zombie fans loved this, so maybe you will too. As for me,though,my favorite zombie movies will always be,Night of the Living Dead(1968), Return of the living Dead, Zombie, I walked with a Zombie,and Tombs of the Blind Dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dawn Of the Dead.","review":"Well, For some Gore counts as Horror, Especially Canablism Cheap Gore and Zombies to round off this so-called classic, nothing impressive, except body parts falling.Not what I would describe horror but much more Shock value and what generally is wrong with people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you people insane?","review":"My God, this movie was awful. Bad acting, brainless dialogue, innefective makeup, and some of the worst editing I've ever seen. How this movie could have so many fans is mind-boggling. I guess it's good for a couple of laughs, especially when it comes to the head-exploding scene. But otherwise, this is lacking in both wit and actual fear. It's a trashy type of film you see at around 2 in the morning with a pizza in your hand. Just because it claims to be a satire on consumerism doesn't make it a good movie. Just because it had gore doesn't make it a good movie. This film has nothing going for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make up you mind when the movie come out","review":"DAmm no 3 of themDawn of the Dead -- U.S. Theatrical Cut (1979Dawn of the Dead (Divimax Edition)Dawn of the Dead: The Original Director's Cuti bought the Divimax Edition so i guess i got rip because when i but the dvd i thought i was going to get every thing that i miss out but i guess i have to buy all three of them what a rip. greedy"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"When There's No More Room In Hell...\\"","review":"The story begins with a continuation of the theme from \\"Night of the Living Dead\\": the dead have arisen and are now stalking the living.

Before purchasing this DVD, I hadn't seen the original in nearly 20 years. \\"DOTD\\" is as disturbing as any horror film ever made. It mixes black humor in horror in such a way that many other films have attempted to copy with little success. The acting may be a bit stlited at times, and the storytelling might be a tad rough around the edges, but horror films don't get much more realistic (or brutal) than this. It also appears (at least from the previews) that the new theatrical version is going to be a far different movie from this one.The DVD, however, is a bit of disappointment in one repsect. Other than commentary from Director George Romero, there isn't much in the way of special features."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Horror film, Great transfur.","review":"One of the best Horror movies in history, that after every viewing leaves you wondering what would i do if i was in this hellish situation in a fight for survival, with no bounderies and no laws, and staying alive is as good as it gets?

Romero's followup to his cult classic Night of the Living Dead is a classic in its own right. Superior to its predecessor Dawn deals with some global issues. Two issues that are brought to the front are racism and Darwinism (Survival of the Fittest), as a group of four humans fight off zombies and humans alike. The makeup by Tom Savini is great and the zombies look real. Savini also appears as one of the bikers who the four humans must fight to keep the mall intact. Romero's direction is sort of cartoonish in this film but it fits. A not really all scares film but still a really good movie with some touching and funny moments as well. Highly Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Sequel Ever!","review":"People usually say that sequels ruin the original look of the first films. But this movie is way better than 'Night of the Living Dead'. This movie scared me when I was about five, and again, when I was ten.This review may not be much, but rent 'Dawn of the Dead' anyway. You won't be displeased. I promise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romero - all-time king of zombie filmers!","review":"In one word: a classic. \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" is the heart of George A Romero's zombie trilogy that started of with \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" ten years before and ended with \\"Day of the Dead\\" in 1985. Forget all the other zombie movies made by some Italian B-picture amateur - here come the genuine undead! The story and suspense of Romero's film are extraordinary: four people flee from the marauding zombie hordes into a giant shopping mall, establish a refuge for themselves and hunt the undead down to find themselves in every consumer's dream: everything they want and/or need for free! \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" is not only a incredibly good horror flick but also a clever satire on our greedy society. Never again has another director achieved the same effect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie & great package but poor transfer","review":"I'm a fan of Dawn and I prefer the extended cut because the extra footage really shows a world that begins in chaos and ends in desolation. However....on my 16\\"x9\\" HDTV the film is formatted incorrectly - it appears \\"zoomed in\\" so part of the picture is lost. Similar to pan & scan, only not just the sides. It's the transfer to HDTV compatible. And I know how the film should look because I compared this DVD to my VHD extended cut that I bought back in the 90's. Still, it's a good price for the only DVD release of the extended cut."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best zombie movie, bar none!","review":"dawn of the dead is the best zombie movie of all time.

I love all kinds of horror movies,but zombies are probably my favorite. Dawn Of The Dead is definitely in my top 10 horror movie list,(along with The Exorcist,The Evil Dead,Phantasm,The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Blair Witch Project,City Of The Living Dead,to name a few). My list may change slightly from time to time,but DawnOTD is always there. If you are new to zombie movies,I would recommend this one first. It is the best of the Romero trilogy(in my opinion). It has a few scares,alot of gore,and a great story. This well written movie is entertaining from beginning to end. A true classic! Thank you Mr. Romero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking compared to the hype...","review":"This film lacked to live up to the hype that surrounds it. While the film did have a lot of good zombie death scenes, it lacked the plot of the original \\"Night of the Living Dead\\". I wish the character interactions had more depth and a better explanation of the power supply for the mall existed.WARNING, SPOILER: The bikers at the climax of the film were what rubbed me the wrong way most of all; trained military personal fell before a hoard of zombies but random bikers lived and thrived just fine? I don't think so..."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the GREAT direction that make this a winner...","review":"This is a very gory zombie flick with some really good special effects and superior acting for a film of this kind. What really puts this one out in front of the many other zombie flicks is the superb direction and outstanding camera work. Romero gives the script a real sense of credibility. My only complaint is that at over 2 hours, I thought it could have used a little trimming.Sure NOTLD will always be the top of the heap but this fantastic Romero effort ranks a close second in providing a realistic and stylish look at the world of the living dead..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Legendary Movie in a Great New Package","review":"Like many others, Dawn of the Dead was the film that really got me into zombie flicks. I fell in love with this movie so hard that once I had seen it, I immediately sought for a copy of the movie. I went through harsh extremes to get a sweedish dvd of it that had the Argento cut. I watched it all the time, but the quality of the dvd was wretched. Anchor Bay had 2 dvds of it, but I decided to wait it out for a better version. Out of the blue, this definitive package came out, and I grabbed it in a heartbeat. The package contains 3 versions of the movie (u.s. theatrical, extended, and european) plus a dvd of documentaries, a booklet, and a comic book. For anyone who is a die-hard fan and wants to get the full package, I highly reccomend getting this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smoke if you got'em","review":"Most of my favourite movies (like Die Hard and The Breakfast Club)are set in one building. This is one such movie. The hollow ,barron feel to this movie adds to the tension and the constant anything-can-happen atmosphere. If a movie ever had an affect on the real world, then this one is really bad for our health. Not only is it a bloody (pardon the pun) good zombie flick, it is - without a doubt - a beautiful celebration of the cigarette. Everybody smokes. Everybody talks about smoking. Mind you, if I was knee-deep in zombies, I'd be smoking a shed-load of ciggies too.--- Ren ---"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Documentary Ever Committed To Film!!!","review":"Being in the right place at the right time with a camera is much better than having a script and actors. When I first scanned the documentary section of the video store in 1983, I came across this gem. I knew zombies were real from reading about them in books when I was 12, but I never knew there was proof of them captured on video. I was disturbed by their violent nature and their hunger for human flesh, but that's life when you're a zombie. Mr. Romero (better known as the Joker in the Batman TV series) took his crew out for a shopping spree when the violence broke out. Truth is much stranger than fiction, and this documentary proves it. After watching this film, I have sworn off eating human flesh ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"How does this movie get 5 star reviews?","review":"Honestly, I am usually a big fan of horror movies, but this movie was a real let down for me. The makeup was dull, plot was boring and the action is low (if any) to get to be a 5 star movie. I watched it twice just to give it another shot and I had a hard time staying awake both times. I thought the remake was way better and I usually like originals better so that tells you something."},{"rating":"1","title":"What!","review":"Two words can express this movie it is absolutely terrible.

It's just stupid, sick, violent, and gory. All the gore effects are there for the sake of viewers wanting to see some zombie action.

This is the worst film you will ever see,which is a shame because the premise is cool. The Makeup is amatuer and phony looking! The horror movies from the 1930's had better make up for crying out loud! 28 Days later was lousy but is a masterpiece compared to this crap! For the first hour of the film you will laugh if you havent fallen asleep by then.

Someone in a chatroom (I should have known not to listen!) said that the original was much better. So I waltzed over to Circuit City and purchased this. Sigh. I'll NEVER get that $35.00 back. I feel so bad for having purchased this. This movie was not scary. The zombies were not scary. The characters were completely insipid. Perhaps I wouldn't have felt cheated if I'd watched the original before the remake, but had I watched THIS drivel first I wouldn't have WANTED to see the remake--or anything else remotely connected to the movie. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the remake, which I had to watch 10 times before it no longer scared me at all. But this--I don't get it. It wasn't even REMOTELY close to the remake.

Blu-ray quality, my backyard!I have seen many standard dvd's and vhs tapes that can make the viewing of this movie look like dust.As for Romero's Classics, this was definitely not his best work. I'd take Thriller anytime over this zombie movie. So be warned you can do better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"An insult to horror/B rated movies.","review":"This movie is horrible. When I say horrible, I mean, I'd rather be sexually molesting Celine Dion horrible. Well, perhaps not that bad, but still. I have never turned off a movie halfway through before but this one made me do it. The acting is horrible, the plotline is basic if even existant, and the special effects are... well, lets just say it's 1978. I love B films. Cheesy horror cult films are totally sweet. However, this one is just bad. It was a waste of 2 hours. The basic \\"plot\\" is that zombies have taken over the world apparently. (of course they give no background to the story) These four people keep running around in a mall for some reason. The black dude paints the walls. I'm so pissed I saw this movie. I'm gunna go gouge my eyes out now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Director's Cut DVD Review from the U.K.","review":"Just a quick review to say that the Director's Cut of this brilliant movie is available on DVD from Amazon.co.uk. This cut is sooo much better than the previously available U.K release that we could get over here with a good 20 minutes of restored footage and gore. (The only bits missing that I can see are the shotgun shooting of a civilian by Wooley and a bite to the arm of the woman by her zombiefied husband \\"Miguel\\" (Don't know why they cut THAT out!) Apart from that I think it is uncut (139 minutes running time) and is basically on of the best horror gore flicks of all time.

I would totally expect the CGI generation to hate this movie. I just have a great appreciation for what this movie was when it was released and its old school feel just really enhances its greatness. The first 3 Romero zombie classics are absolutely essential to any horror collection. If you don't like this...don't even waste your time with Day of the Dead. If you do appreciate it, you simply must check out Day as its an incredibly underated classic in its own right. BTW: The blu ray of this movie couldn't be much better. The picture is incredible! Don't miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this movie","review":"Romero does it again. What's not to love? Zombie's,a bit of humor, and once again the subtle undertone's of social commentary. This film start's out as the zombie outbreak is getting out of control. Savini's great special effect's (espically for the 70's) make's this film a zombie movie classic. Savini's stunts are excellent. Romero did a perfect job casting and directing this film which is the second in the dead film's. I have so much to say about this excellent film but fear I will give too much away. I have seen this film over 30 times and notice a new zombie every time and never grow tired of this film. If you do not like horror movies this film will convert you. Consumerism has never been more appealing. Romero really shine's here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lords of the Dead","review":"Once again George Romero crawls out from the insides of guts and gives us a decent zombie flick that is better than all the Italian cheapies.

Wonderful and fun to look at till the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Horror Films Ever Made!","review":"Gore...zombies...cops...swat teams....a mall...corpse...funny music...'What more can you ask from a cult horror film of the 70s?\\" If anyone is to think, \\"What a bad movie becuase zombies are silly and stupid\\" WELL THEY'RE WRONG! The movie is a cult movie and it has inspired many video game makers who made Resident EVIL!!!

When the world is being overrun by zombies 4 people hide out in a shopping mall, and horror ensues. Recommended highly! everyone did a good job on this from the acting to the direction to the music. i have not seen the remake yet and i am sure it will not be as good as this!P.S.

I can't believe anyone would want to remake this film!...Then again...maybe they wanted to try making a version that didn't completely suck... If you want to see a better movie, try Night Of The Living Dead (the original, of course), and also the Evil Dead Series, which is 10 times better than this worthless piece of trash.

Watch Karloff's Frankenstein or any of the Universal monster classics instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dated Gorefest","review":"I once viewed DAWN OF THE DEAD as something of a masterpiece when I first viewed it in the mid-80s. Having viewed this film again recently with the release of the director's cut, I have to say that this one doesn't really stand up that well. In fact, it looks rather dated. Romero's intelligence shines through in the above-average script and characterizations, but it's all the then-trendy 70s/80s gore effects that badly date the film. Makeup effects artist Tom Savini did wonders on a low budget, but the makup fx are so gaudy and over the top that they look rather cheesy. Every time the story gets interesting, there's a slew of garish gore effects that had me groaning and chuckling to myself, with the result that the film overall is uninvolving. This was once terrifying, and is now a cheesy chuckle. See the original NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD for a genuine exercise in how to build fear on a low budget."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Awesome Classic!!!","review":"There are a lot of things I love about this movie. I love the dialogue about the zombies including \\"When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth.\\" I love all the gore scenes; like toward the end there is an awesome gore scene where the zombies are ripping some guy apart and showing his guts. It even has the classic look of the 70's! Not long after the original, the zombies are still coming back to life and feeding on the flesh of the living. A group of friends named Stephen, Peter, Roger, and Francine leave Philadelphia in a helicopter and see that the epidemic is worldwide. They soon take refuge in a huge mall and make themselves at home. Soon, more zombies get inside the mall and they must fight for their lives. I highly recommend DAWN OF THE DEAD!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"When There's No More Room In Hell...","review":"\\"Dawn of the Dead\\" is a great film no matter how you look it.

The US, International and extended editions are all here plus loaded with extras included commentaries on each version of the film and the great Frumkes Document Of The dead.

If you are a big fan of the film I highly recommend you buy this now before the prices get outrageous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Best","review":"I have always been a fan of the horror genre of movies but the best of the best would have to be this movie-sequel to \\"Night of the Living Dead\\". Perhaps if its predecesor hadn't such low budget production values it might have surpassed this one, but \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" is by far the most terrifyingly amusing (how's that for an oxymoron) film ever made. The suspense is presented through frighteningly realistic news coverage which puts the viewer into the situation. Once the main characters are put into the shopping mall to fend for themselves, the suspense builds to dizzying heights. Thank goodness for moments of levity to relieve the more terrifying scenes. Tom Savini's gory effects are top notch for the day. This is not an Oscar calibre movie (except maybe for fx), but taken as pure horror, it is right up there with such luminaries as \\"The Exorcist\\" and the original \\"Halloween\\". You want to be scared? This is the movie that will do it! NOT for the faint of heart!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I think this movie is a must for horror/zombie fans.","review":"This movie is an excellent choice for purchase.

Where did that come from?","review":"I first saw this film 15 years ago. It was the first tape I ever rented and I still get a kick out of watching it today. After buying it on tape 2 different times,the second with a bogus promise of being a Directers Cut, I'm happy to say the DVD version is actually that. Although why did Romero delete the groovy Goblin music in the opening TV station sequence? And after seeing this movie many, many times, it's the first time I noticed that Gayleen Ross is showing her breasts when she's sitting up in bed after her \\"romantic evening\\" with Flyboy. DVD clarity strikes again. But I have to say, there is something a little spookier about watching this film on a worn out VHS. Savini's effects look better when diffused.

He has shown himself to be very skillful at composing for voices, as his many operas and his choral works such as Itaipu bear out. I am not really a fan of his orchestral work, as his musical processes do not seem to work well with the orchestra. They do work well with instrumental soloists, as this recording bears out.The Glass concerto is a marvelous piece of music and is exceptionally well played. The Adams concerto is also marvelous, and Adams has real skill when it comes to composing for orchestra. This is a special work of Philip Glass'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here to say a good word for the Glass work","review":"I concur very much with the favorable comments by \\"gtrain\\" and C. Anderson regarding the Adam's violin concerto. It's a finely crafted and performed piece. I would not say it's particularly easy to be enthralled with on first listening. I'm a fairly seasoned \\"classical\\" music enthusiast with broad tastes, but I've had to put some studied listening time in to get to enjoy the Adams. Now, considering Glass's version of a violin concerto, one just has to listen with different expectations. Yes, this is typical Glass style, takes about one second (or six pulsations) to recognize it as his. But hey, this is invigorating exciting, stuff. The first and third movements make great aerobic exersize background - real aural fuel power. And the slow movement is beautiful, maybe not so profound or complex, but wonderful, and \\"user-friendly\\" i.e. sounds nice the first time through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent but not perfect","review":"Vornado builds intelligently designed products. The HU1 4.2 gallon humidifier is probably the best portable package out there. We need it out here in the desert. The humidistat control is a great feature and the unit runs with almost no audible noise. Real quality throughout. However, there are two design flaws. First, as water is consumed, air enters either bottle making an annoying thump...thump...thump sound (plastic water bottle resonating) till pressure is equalized. Second, the soft rubber feet constantly fall out if the humidifier is slid sideways rather than picked directly upwards. Vornado should easily rectify these problems. Otherwise, these small (but noteworthy) defects do not detract from the overall excellent, quiet and effective design. It's a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Loud Knocking ...not gurgling sound","review":"Having read all the previous reviews on this humidifier I decided to disregard the comments about disturbing sounds from the humidifier. I am sorry I did. The tank construction is so flimsy that when water is released into the wick tank (more than once an hour (depends on the amount of humidification)a very LOUD knocking sound (5-7 bangs at a time)will disturb your sleep. I thought the next door neighbor was doing construction next door, I couldnt believe this was actually coming from the humidifier. Seriously, I was only one step away from going over there and waking them up at 230 am. I wish I had bought the ultrasonic types. If you have hard water..prepare to clean the wicks often as they absorb them, discolor and turn hard. I can't complain about the basic function..the unit humidifies well but even after almost a month I cannot get used to hearing the banging sounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"smart design, great product","review":"This is an amazingly well designed and effective humidifier. I swear it is keeping me from getting sick this season. I have used three humidifiers in as many years and this is a keeper. It is quiet, easy to fill without soaking yourself or the floor, and it is easy to keep clean and bacteria free because the electronic parts can be completely separated from the sections that hold water. I have never written a review before and really don't have the time to now, but this is such a great product I had to pass on the word."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super Quiet","review":"Our humidifier is superquiet, but then again so are most things I own that don't work at all.

The humidity in my home was often 25 to 35 percent. Too low. I tried the Vornado cold-water humidifier from Amazon. Unfortunately, though it was rated for 1,000 sq. feet of roomspace, it couldn't raise the humidity of my office by more than 5%. I sent it back. If you want a cold-water humidifier, you'd better buy one that is HUGE, like the ones Sears sells. Like the size of an evaporative cooler, which is what it is. Otherwise, the best way to go is a steam-producing humidifier i.e. vaporizer.. Get one with the largest water-capacity you can. I found one sold on Amazon for about $40, and it works great. The ultrasonic models aren't very good either, as they leave a white powder residue everywhere in the room."},{"rating":"2","title":"mk","review":"This is truly an amazing product-- light in weight but effective and long lasting.

I was skeptical in buying this because the of a couple of reviews that said the gurgling sound was very loud. I can barely hear it. I think this is a fantastic machine. The only thing that is a bit difficult it filling the bottles, however, that is a minor problem. I bought 2 more of the smaller version for my kids rooms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mold problems","review":"The tanks are easy to fill. The unit works, the controls are simple. The machine is easy to take apart.That said, I have the following problem with it. To avoid mold buildup on the wicks (filters) I have to run these (I have two) with very little water in the tanks so that it will run dry and dry out. The only alternative to this is to pull all the wicks every few days and soak in water and vinegar.I was much happier with the Bionaire humidifiers I had a couple houses ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"We have had this humidifier for 4 years now. We bought this shortly after the birth of our first child, and fell in love with it. We had a Vornado heater so we knew it had to be a good product. We used to use a large humidifier, but would usually spill water through the vents when filling it. With the Vornado you don't have to worry about making a mess. I noticed some people said the top doesn't fit very well, but once you put it together you never have to take it apart. And as for the water gurgling, yes it does make this sound, but it is not very loud. If it wasn't for the fact that the motor ran so quietly you probably wouldn't here it at all. We are on child number three now and it sits next to the crib, and trust me it won't wake a sleeping baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I was looking for","review":"I wanted a small humidifier that could fit on a sturdy but narrow table.I wanted to be able to fill it easily, and for it to adequately humidifymy medium-sized bedroom (14' X 15') during the dry winter months of central heating. This one fits the bill. I've had it for 6 weeks, use it every night. I ordered extra filters when I ordered the product. I fill the reservoir with cooled, boiled water just to avoid adding or attracting any mold spores, but that's not a requirement. I find that it runs very quietly and I am a light sleeper. I have not heard any disturbing noises, only an occasional soft glug-glugging during the night. This is simple and clever and very well priced, as long as you are looking for a small machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vornado 4.2 Gallon Humidifier","review":"Very satisfied with the purchase of this humidifier.

First, the humidistat is a useless gimmick. I have three hygrometers to guage the effectiveness of Vornado's \\"humidistat.\\" It does not shut off when satsfactory humidity is reached. Second, the wicks grow mold rapidly (30 days), although they're supposedly treated. Third, there is no reliable way to thoroughly clean the water tanks. You can't get inside to wipe them down. If you have allergies, as I do, the wicks and water tanks present significant problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet, good value, easy to use.","review":"A really good design, easy to operate and great value. Some details:Quiet - don't worry about the \\"glugging\\" sound mentioned in reviews below. Yes, it does that: but you can reproduce it before you buy. Fill an empty large coke bottle with water. Hold it upside down a couple of inches from a bathtub - something where the water flow does not make a noise. The water glugs as the air bubbles in. That is the sound this thing makes. It never disturbs me. Also, the fan is quiet enough not to disturb a light sleeper, even on 'max.'Simple design - the water containers (2, each holds 2 gallons of water) can be refilled while the unit is operating.Filters - easy to fit/replace.Great buy. Glad to have it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply - bad design","review":"I bought this based on the several positive reivews I read here. Unfortunately I am returning mine because it is poorly designed. So poorly that I found myself saying to myself more than once - Did the people who made it ever use it? Here are the main drawbacks:1. The whole thing falls apart easily. You cannot move it around the room since the falls apart like that Jenga game thing if you dont lift it just right. And even if you lift it right, it is almost certain to spill2. It spills easily. bumpt, tip it, lift it and you'll hae a puddle on the floor.3. The fill holes on the water tanks are too small. Since the tank is too big for put under the faucet in my sink, I have to fill it in my tub. But the tiny hole (large enough for your thumb and a little more) does not allow water in easily. I had to hold the tank under my tub faucet for 8 minutes for it to fill!!4. It is not pretty. Thing looks like a boom box made of cheap plastichope this helps you."},{"rating":"1","title":"It sucks in air and spits out what?","review":"I bought this unit thinking it would be a heavy duty humidifier. Unfortunately, the cool air coming out of the top doesn't feel moist to the touch even if you keep your hand there for quite some time.In fact, it's hard to tell if this thing even does anything. The translucent water jugs don't show you the level of the water inside, so you don't really know if anything is happening. Worse yet, you can't tell when the water is all gone. Inevitably, you find the thing running all day when the jugs are bone-dry.Presumably, the water is in the atmosphere, but who really knows?I don't reccommend this humidifier and will probably throw it out soon.

I mostly use this for am talk radio and I am satisfied with the quality of sound and the build.However, a few weeks ago I dropped this radio on the floor and it hit the power button on it's way down. This broke the micro-switch under the power button cover from the main circuit board. I opened up the case and found the micro-switch. Very small, but I was able to carefully solder the tiny switch to the circuit board. I assembled it back together and it works great. Most of you should not try this at home unless you are familiar with electronics as there are no user serviceable parts inside (HA!).Yes, I would recommend this radio and would buy another one if it was lost or stolen."},{"rating":"2","title":"a thumbs up!","review":"after reading the other reviews i decided to purchase the sangean radio and i am glad i did. it was just what i was looking for. compared to the radio i had been using i went from listening to three possible stations to over eight.the radio is small, convenient and powerful. a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This product is a great buy.

Very good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless After Only 18 Months","review":"This was my second DT-210. It lasted only 18 months before the channel selection buttons quit working. The first radio lasted 4 years before it started having problems with the channel selection buttons. It, however, at least still works in one direction. The newest one doesn't work at all. Another problem with the first one is that the volume dial has quit working, and now the radio only plays at the highest level. If you're looking for a reliable radio, I don't recommend this one. I really regret the fact that I took a chance and bought a second one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest pocket radio of all time","review":"I'm a radioholic. This is the best pocket radio I've ever had. The reception is excellent, even for stations that other radios have trouble bringing in clearly. The sound is crisp and clear for such a small speaker. I had found it difficult in my area to clearly pick up one of my favorite AM stations, especially at night. This radio brings it in like the tower is next door. If you're looking for a great pocket radio, you won't be disappointed by this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Portable AM/FM/TV Around","review":"My Sony radio/TV audio broke after only a year and I was looking to order another one but decided to see what other radio/TV portables were out there. The Sangean DT-210 won much praise, while some cited similar problems with their Sony. I decided not to put myself in a position to be fooled twice and purchased the Sangean instead. I'm willing to try most things once! Well, what a wonderful surprise to discover that the Sangean lived up to its name! Reception was better as well as length of use on two batteries. I like the swivel belt clip which keeps the radio from being jammed off when getting into the car. The speaker option is a plus when it's necessary to be able to hear other things around you. The only thing I miss are the preset buttons that take you straight to the station rather than having to scan through all of those you have programmed in. But all in all, I feel I have a better radio/TV and am very satisfied with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Radio","review":"This is a nice little radio. AM, FM and TV reception to boot.Reception is great and having a PLL circuit sure beats my other analog radio.Sound is good, but as another reviewer indicated, the volume on the TV side could be louder.The FM sound is really nice. The DBB is a waste of time. If you use the included ear buds, you'll quickly saturate the earphones. As the manufacturer already states, using DBB with the speaker is useless. A higher end pair of headphones might help with this feature.Overall, it makes a good buy for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"On/Off Switch issue","review":"The radio itself is good but the ON/OFF button stopped working after only 7 months of normal/light wear.

What I got was a worthless piece of junk. First, the earpieces are the size of megaphones. Unless your ears are the size of caves, the fit is so ergonomically uncomfortable there is no way you can wear them for any extended period of listening. I had to use my iPod earbuds, instead. The AM band is totally worthless. In the AM band, this radio can only pickup some local stations in my area (Sacramento) At best, the reception of these local stations is weak and statically distorted. My primary reason to buy this pocket radio is for listening to AM talk radio and sports. The radio does a better job on the FM and TV bands. Reception of local stations on these bands is adequate. Well, what can I expect from a $43 radio, right? I'm still shopping for a good pocket radio with strong AM reception.

I have the Sangean PR-D7, and in a side-by-side comparison, the reception on the PR-D7 radio is excellent (both AM & FM), whereas, the same reception on the DT-210 (with the cheap little plugin wire antenna they provide) is really awful. Other than that, the ease of use is good, and the sound quality is what you would expect from a little radio like this. But at the end of the day, if it doesn't pull in the stations, little else matters.I'll be returning this for sure. I bought this from Datavision instead of Amazon, and now have to pay a 15% restocking fee + return shipping because I don't like this item, what a mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sangean DT-210","review":"Difficult to give a meaningful review as the radio only lasted a week and a half before failing - all functions failed, screen went black.

Batteries run out every 2 weeks. Feature that shuts off radio in 90 minutes has stopped working, so batteries last only 2-3 days if I don't wake up to shut it. Difficult to program, can never get that function to work. Right tuning key has lost power to go that direction.

I wanted to just plug the headphone output directly into the amplifiers like I do with my iPod. Reception has been an issue when I tried this with hardware before. I tried an mp3 player/fm radio, and some fm tuner/remote for the iPod. Neither could pick up my favorite radio station at all. It's a college station in Atlanta, WRAS 88.5. The mp3 player didn't even tune that low.So I had big hopes for this radio, but they were dashed once I got it. The station came in okay inside; not good, but at least I could hear it. However there was no reception in the car.Another thing I didn't like was that the output spiked when turning it on or off, which was loudly audible through my speakers when it was connected to the amps.This radio has worked for many people, as evidenced by the other reviews. However, I had to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little radio with only one flaw","review":"I had the previous version of this radio and left it in a hotel room. After trying a Radio Shack product, I got tired of using up batteries so fast and bought the DT-210V.It is easy on the two AAA batteries and has a 90-min cutoff, which is good for me because I like to listen to late night chatter and tend to fall asleep.My only problem, a somewhat minor one, is that the scan buttons are too close together and if I want to jump from one preset station to another, the same scan buttons have to be activated by another switch, located at the top on the right hand side. This is awkward, especially in bed in the dark.It also draws in distant stations better than my Radio Shack radio (which cost about the same)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sound","review":"The sounds is really good in both AM & FM.

I think I will return it. It was very easy to set the pre-set stations but the way to recall a pre-set station has an extra step.After you set your stations you must hit a recall button on the side of the radio and then hit the Tune up or Tune down button to get to your station. On my Sony you could justhit one button and would go right to your stations. This was only a problem to me because I use it when running and I don't want to be looking down to find the right buttons.Also, I listen to it at night when I can't sleep and in the dark it was hard to find the buttons.I also found some of the stations that came in fine on my Sony did not come in as well on the Sangean unless I moved it around.

When I realized the radio was worthless I called sangean and they told me the warranty had expired at 90 days.

The real problem with the radio is that for its price one kind of expects a better and perhaps smaller product. What I don't understand is that a product that lists its normal price as $99.50 (though its been half-off for almost a year now) somehow doesn't have a memory that can be saved without batteries.

I was told by the Tingley rep that I would need a size Large overshoe to fit my size 11 1/2 sneaker. However, the Large was too small, so I had to send the overshoe back and order a size Extra Large. For some reason, the Extra Large was sold by a different vendor than the one that sold the Large.

However, I was disappointed to find that Tingley has changed the model 1300 to be \\"Bigger, wider and longer\\" than the overshoe I was accustomed to. In fact...the new style was too big, too wide and too long to fit my boots properly. I've looked everywhere for the \\"old\\" style (exact same model number) but have not been able to find them. I wish Tingley would've left the \\"old\\" style alone and just created a new model, with a new model number, to accomodate the bigger, wider, longer boot/shoe.

The tread is more robust than my previous ones, each set lasting me a couple years on concrete and asphalt, 3 hours a night during the inclements. Your mileage may vary.

Sam Pacetti certainly qualifies. His guitar-work on \\"Solitary Travel\\", is exceptional with an Irish flair, and he proves that he has a more than adequate voice to back up his own picking. His high-speed flatpicking instrumental numbers are the best on \\"Solitary Travel\\" -- \\"Brian's Rapier,\\" \\"Merrily Kissed the Quaker's Wife,\\" and \\"Triple-Sec\\" are outstanding, and Pacetti owns up to an obvious influence from Martin Simpson with his version of \\"Shawnee Town.\\" While it seems he has a local stature in his native Florida, it appears that his following does not necessarily follow him out of the Sunshine State. This is a shame.

I considered (for a moment) keeping it even though it didn't collapse, but decided against that, as money is tight and products should work.My next--which was a simple pack-n-play by Graco--has proven to be good, simple to fold and move from room to room. The bottom doesn't seem as sturdy as the Dream on Me, though, and it is surely not as roomy...but, it isn't defected.Amazon was really great about the return of this, too, as I couldn't fold it into the original box due to the side that wouldn't budge, and they paid for the shipping of two boxes and gave me the full refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible product","review":"I can't actually say how it might function.

The insert solves two problems mentioned by others in these reviews: (1) gives more cushioning and support; (2) fills in the space so that the lip at the back of the heel is not pushed down.

Overall, it is fairly comfortable, and the fit is perfect. The only problems I've had with the shoe are a slight amount of irritation from the decorative edging/trim around the shoe, and with the lip at the back of the shoe.

I read it in a day and was loathe to put it down once I'd started. It's the adventures of Ana, the half-sister of Bea Bearhorn, '80s pop star. Ana comes to London after Bea's suicide, meeting her sister's friends and finding out about the one hit wonder's frequently unhappy life. The characters are likeable and if not they're always redeemable, and all's well that ends well. It's not literature and who cares? Lisa Jewell herself strikes me as a top chick, giving out practical advice on writing on her website, www.lisa-jewell.co.uk. It's refreshing to come across someone who wants you to have a crack at what they've been successful at, rather than someone who's up their own where-the-sun-don't-shine, jangling the Keys to the Gate of the Literati in one hand, London Review of Books in the other."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Hit Wonder","review":"BLAH! I did not really enjoy this book.... Definitely not what I had expected. Very dark & dreary.

This is bad, bad writing - bad characters, bad dialogue, bad plot - but since it is a book for lonely Auntie Mildreds past their sell-by date, none of this is important, the attraction of these books are psychological, not literary. By reading about prettier, thinner women finding the 'Flint' (please, no) of their dreams, the need for love is momentarily satisfied. What a cheap illusion. Silly girlies: even if you dont want to be taken seriously yourself, PLEASE stop insulting femalekind everywhere by buying stupid mindnumbing drivel like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book of the Summer","review":"I have putting off reading this book all summer because I was not in the mood for it, what a mistake. One Hit Wonder was absolutely fantastic. It is a story of growth and understanding, finding yourself while uncovering the mystery that was your sister. This book was particularly engrossing, poignantly affecting a range of emotions (comedy, drama, romance); the moment I finished it I put it on my sister's desk for her to read. I have read all of Lisa Jewell's books and this story of Ana's search for her sister Bee and the discoveries that develop make this my easy favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"I could \\"see\\" the characters !!!","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The writing is relaxed and confident. Having the two perspectives of Anna and Bee was a great contrast. Anna ia a bit of a wallflower who embarks on a journey to find out why her estranged sister Bee, a faded pop star, committed suicide. Bee's history is revealed truthfully but without judgement. While the premise seems grim, the combination of Anna's wise observations of people and her own path to personal fulfillment makes for a tremendous story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A jewel of a book","review":"A friend of mine leant me this book, and boy am I glad she did! This novel is well-written, the characters are descriptive and likeable and most importantly; the plot is an enthralling suspense story that keeps you interested as it unfolds. One Hit Wonder is based around a woman whose singer sister dies. After she travels to London to arrange her things, she begins to realize her sister had a secret life and she never really knew her at all. This book is an excellent journey you'll want to take."},{"rating":"2","title":"One-Hit Wonder is a hit!","review":"Lisa Jewell is one of the best British chick lit writers out there.

But then Bee appears dead in her London apartment. Now Ana must find the cause of her sister's mysterious death.This is chick lit mixed with a bit of mystery, which makes this novel even more enjoyable to read. One-Hit Wonder should be on every chick lit fans' list of summer must-reads! I urge to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book by Lisa Jewell","review":"I bought Lisa Jewell's book \\"One-Hit Wonder\\" only based on what I had read at Amazon.com/Uk and I was glad that I did. This the perfect book for the beach or for a rainy day. Ms. Jewell gives the reader a simple plot about one woman trying to discover why her sister killed herself.

His version lacks the titanic proportions wich are required. B?hm misses mystery and weight. By the time one gets to the third part, it's quit tempting to put on another record. Why this record is getting all the praise it's getting is a mystery to me. I admit that this recording does have its positive sides. B?hm has complete controle of the score and the Wiener Philharmoniker are playing their best music. But Bruckner requires a different approach. A marvelous recording of the \\"Romantische\\" is von Karajans '71 recording for EMI.

Shot was lovely costumes and views of the British countryside, this is engaging and romantic period film captures the essence of the requirements of manners of the period.Fans of the book might have problems with the casting of Toni Collette as Emma's protegee and matchmaking victim, as she in only very few ways resembles the original character. However, Sophie Thompson is a standout as Miss Bates and Juliet Stevenson, as the wife of the Reverend, is wonderfully unappealing as a party guest.A very, very enjoyable movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enjoyable","review":"This is definitely a chick flick, but it is a real feel good movie.

I guess we should leave Jane Austen novels to the Brits to get a realistic portrayal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really,really,dreadfully,scarily,woryingly bad","review":"I hate this adaptation.Paltrow is drippy,insipid and just isnt Emma.O.K,so im not a great fan of the book but i love Pride and Prejudice(book and film)and thought i would give this a go.I can see im kind of in the minority here as everyone seems to love it but the sad truth is in my opinion it is boring ,badly acted and i hate Paltrow.The co stars are at best passable and most of them are not even that.When a film is taken from a book it needs to have 3 main ingreds:It needs to be 1: faithful to the book 2:interesting and lively and 3:well acted.This adaptation has none of these.So basically dont buy it.If you do be prepared for v.bad acting"},{"rating":"2","title":"True to the spirit of the novel...","review":"This <cite>Emma</cite> adaptation channels the buoyant tone of the novel perfectly.

It adheres to the book well enough (it's only 2 hours after all). It's certainly faithful to the sensibility of the book. I think it's very well cast.

It's bright, refreshing, funny, and romantic. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gwyneth Paltrow=Emma Woodhouse","review":"No film could have done Ms. Austen's enchanting tale more justice. The atmosphere is exactly the charming, romantic dream I was admitted to, when I read the novel. Gwyneth is Emma in every way. The sparkle of the eyes, the sweet smile, and the sense that Emma is at once eloquently perfect and hopelessly flawed. A film that beams with elegance, grace, and beauty. Ms. Paltrow's reveals that she has this miraculous sparkle. Her portrayal of Emma gave me an extra chamber in my heart to store joy in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Good As BBC's Emma","review":"I was disappointed in this version of Emma. As much as I enjoy watching Gwyneth Paltrow, she did not achieve the essential chemistry with her co-star (Jeremy Northam as Mr. Knightley).

I highly recommend BBC's Emma, but only weakly recommend this version."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pale version of the original","review":"So you're a Jane Austen fan? This movie is probably irresistable for at least one viewing purely for curiosity's sake. Be warned though, that this movie is so full of celebs that are so busy playing dress-up that it absolutely ruins a classic romance and cleverly witty masterpiece. If it's Hollywood's interpretation of England you want, this movie is for you. Otherwise, stick with the Kate Beckinsale version of Emma."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather too cute","review":"Too much a vehicle for Paltrow, and too little a vehicle for Austen. The Beckinsale A&E version is much better, and I'm not sure that the BBC version was not the best - I cannot decide. But this one is superficial and unsatisfying. Too vague a Jane Fairfax, while Frank Churchill is sometimes too flashy and sometimes too dull and lumpish, while the relationship between these two is undeveloped. Miss Taylor is too young and foolish, and Mr. Knightley looks still wet behind the ears - no match for his Emma. Emma is too pretty and Harriet not pretty enough, the hypochondriac father, so richly and amusingly portrayed in both the other versions, is just thrown away here, while the Harriet Smith character is rather wooden and the Harriet-Emma relationship lacks most of the humor Austen wickedly portrayed in it - which the other two versions bring out very well. I will say, I do like the portrayal here of one of Austen's prize jerks - the ineffable Mrs. Elton."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"I enjoyed the '97 version with Beckinsale, but I LOVED this version! Haven't read the book yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"a dissapointment","review":"This is a sad, sad version of a beloved story.Even Gwyneth Paltrow's excellent proformance can not save this film. The screenplay was horrible, Northam as Knighley laughable and the hair very incorrect. It does not have that timeless quality a Jane Austen classic deserves. In 10 years it will be dated as a 1990's studio formula film.While it does have some funny and entertaining parts (also the costumes ARE good) it simply doesn't do justice to the book or the charaters. Too long on farce and too short on charm.If you want to see a good, believeable version watch the A&E Emma (1996 with Kate Beckinsale). Don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terribly BORING MOVIE!!!","review":"I had to watch this wretched film for one of my English classes. I could have gouged my eyes out towards the end. The only thing that kept me awake was the stunning beauty of Gwynyth Paltrow. She is an extraordinary actress so it makes me shudder to think she did this piece of trash. If you want to see her do perfect British then I firmly suggest Shakespeare In Love."},{"rating":"1","title":"a romantic sort of movie, but ...","review":"The problem in that movie is that nothing happens! It is not a bad movie, but I found the story too long. At least the movie shows how to improve one's own life by helping others improve theirs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could there be a bigger waste of time?","review":"The definition of fad.By the time Emma Thompson was attempting her Austen-esque witticisms as she received her screenplay adaptation Academy Award for Sense and Sensibility, Jane Austen was already finished as a viable movie source. Almost as quickly as she became hot, she was not. I just don't think many had realized it yet.Emma is a weak premise, at best, and this interpretation is outright intolerable. To say it pales in comparison to Clueless may be brash, considering the teen-fodder compost that was the Amy Heckerling version.Sometimes classic literature should remain just that, literature.Could there be a bigger waste of time with Gwyneth Paltrow present? Unfortunately yes---it's called Great Expectations (1998)."},{"rating":"1","title":"hey, did any of you dudes catch that they ripped off the plot from clueless?","review":"this is the poorest of the plethora of jane austen adaptations we have undergone the past decade, with gwyneth paltrow stumbling her way through an unfunny retelling of austens classic. fortunately its been 3 weeks since i watched this and ive managed to put the details of WHY i found it distasteful into the nether regions of my mind, but it was a mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored to tears.","review":"I hate to give Emma one star because I think Paltrow's performance is flawless and love that british accent she piles on but Emma was so boring, pretentious and completely dowdy as can be. I guess the language just threw me for a loop, too wordy, bland and pointless to me. It's a shame because I thought Emma was going to be a great film, damn those critics! Sorry Gwyneth, you are a great and talented actress but there is nothing to swoon over this drab film. I recommend some other Paltrow films instead: Shallow Hall, Sylvia, Proof and Sliding Doors (welcome back british accent!) Emma will have you drowsy after the first thirty minutes, yawn!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Badly Done Emma!....badly done\\"","review":"What a wonderful and colorful movie! Gwyneth Paltrow is superb as Emma! It seems if I look closely, the actor who plays Mr. Knightley looks like Paul Rudd in Clueless. Gwyneth plays a convincing role as vain and overconfident Emma. This movie is a gem and should be watched with a lighthearted mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's own take on the story","review":"This version of Emma is much more chick-lit style than the others. Basically, it takes all of the funny parts out of the novels and leaves out the parts that are pedantic and soul-searching. It's entertaining, nothing more. Jeremey Northam is handsome and likeable. Gweneth Paltrow is less annoying than usual and Toni Collette is very amusing.This was my favorite version of the movie before the Romola Garai one came out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting for comparison...and that's it","review":"I happened to get to see this one on TV before I could buy it and I must say...its one version I'd rather not own. While the cast is surprisingly familiar from the casts of many other lower-key films I enjoy (and extras from more popular ones) the acting is unusual and disjointed. Personalities from the novel are over-exaggerated or not present at all. My largest dissapointment was with not deemming it worth owning, since it has been my goal to own every TV/theatrical version of all of my favorite Jane Austin-era novels, but this one I don't want, unless its for \\"bad movie night\\".I do commend Gweneth Paltrow's efforts at playing a role for a story she's probably never heard of and an era never she's bothered to act for. I appreciate her efforts, but the older versions have outdone them.**I know I did not comment on the story line, but I'm certain another reviewer has written enough on the matter...along with Jane Austin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Starts slow, gets good.","review":"Gwyneth Paltrow got my attention right away as Emma, even though the story did not, but it wasn't long before I was interested. Emma seems to be outside the story at first watching and altering other people's lives and so the audience is a little detached as well, but when a handsome suitor starts to give her attention and she begins to have feelings of her own for someone else that is where the real story shines.The acting is all excellent, the sets as well. This is top notch entertainment for period piece lovers. I have never read the book so I can not compare the two, but I recommend this based on its own work and not on Jane's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"I liked everything about this movie, the era, the characters, the lines. It's one of my favorites. Emma is fun and funny. The pace is quite slower than many people are used to now, but that also makes it a refreshing change from our hectic fast-paced society. It shipped quickly and in perfect condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"b-o-o-o-ring","review":"this movie is good, if you like this kind of movie. the british accents are hard to understand, the plot is hard to follow, and the entire movie is boring, unless you like that kind of movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't impressed","review":"I enjoyed the book but didn't enjoy the movie.

Often disc became blurry thus impossible to watch. unfortunately did not view until after return date."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasure film","review":"This was a very enjoyable film, thanks motly to Gwyneth Paltrow, who gave a clear portrayal of the essence of the book, of the same name, written by the much celebrated author, Jane Austen. I would offer a moderate recommendation to those who particularly enjoy the work of this author, & who enjoy the quality of performance offered by G. Paltrow. I did think that casting Toni Collette as Harriet Smith was a very poor choice, but I am unable to suggest who might be qualified for that part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gwneth is as exciting as warm milk","review":"I just don't like Gwyneth paltrow. She bothers me. Perhaps that's why I did not enjoy this version of Emma as much as \\"Jane Austen's Emma\\" with the stunning Kate Beckinsale in the title role. Kate has a spirit that Emma possesses and Gwyneth lacks.Both are faithful adaptations of the book, but I just found the other one had more true spirit.Also, while Mark Stong, who was Mr. Knightley in the Beckinsale version, is not as classically handsome as the very cute Jeremy Northern (or Northam? I haven't got my copy with me to check) I found him to be much sexier. He also seems to exude manliness in an almost palpable way, giving me all kinds of interesting thoughts. Northam, again, is very handsome, but too droll for the forthright Knightley.I have compared the two twice now, and found that this version is just blah compared to the Beckinsale/Strong one."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Emma\\" is a delight!","review":"While not always a fan of Gwyneth Paltrow, I greatly enjoyed this version of the classic story of \\"Emma\\". The cast (Jeremy Northam, Ewan McGregor, Toni Collette, Greta Scacchi, and Alan Cumming) are wonderful and bring such life to their roles. I love the quick witted humor and the banter between the characters. Even if you're not a avid reader of classical literature, this story may convert you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jane Austen's lesser greats","review":"A good/fair, viewable Austen story which doesn't quite fullfill its promise.

Even I noticed. The skin color is oringy and the whole picture is fuzzy, not sharp. Mine is a widescreen version (which I lately discovered I don't like because it takes away so much from the size of the picture- but that is just a personal opinion, I wasn't rating that) and in addition to the bad quality it was even harder to see (I don't have any eyesight problems).I have seen Emma with Gwyneth Paltrow before and I am o.k. with it but I do think the British version is better.Having said all that, now I regret not paying a little more money and just purchase that one.My copy is unenjoyable and when I attempt to watch it, I get somewhat fustrated by it. So I usually chose other DVD's over this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insufferable!","review":"This movie is Not Jane Austen's work but the making of Hollywood EGO having the audacity to think that they will improve, change and rewrite the story.

The scenery was spectacular, the costumes were beautiful. It is a very \\"pretty\\" movie and in that way enjoyable to watch. (with the sound turned down) Paltrow's acting was just that , acting. She was totally unbielevable as was \\"Harriet\\". The actress who played Harriet was just awful. Paltrow came off as silly, and unconvincing as Emma. The A&E version was much more like the book and the acting top notch. When watching Kate Beckinsale as Emma, you felt she really understood the character she was portraying. She was totally natural and at ease with the dialog of that period. This version of Emma can't begin to compare with A&E'S."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very pretty picture...","review":"I was surprised by all the other reviews that hacked this film to bits. There seem to be a great number of \\"authorities\\" on what is correct for Regency England. May I offer a gentle reminder that unless you were alive then and lived it, you aren't an authority? I always assume that the movie version will never be as good as the book, so I allow some slack for that. Jeremy Northam is delicious no matter what he does. My only grievance is Gwynneth Paltrow--she never plays the character, she always plays Gwynneth Paltrow. And am I the only one that hears her whining through her nose? Why does she do that??? Overall, I enjoy this film and have watched it several times."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS IMPORTED BLU-RAY VERSION!!!!!!","review":"I was excited to buy this Blu-ray version because I've enjoyed the DVD so much over the past few years. This version is actually worse than the DVD. I actually returned the Blu-ray to Amazon, and they fully refunded me everything that I had paid for it.This is such a bad version that it has actually brought me to leave my first feedback on Amazon after being a customer for over 10 years!Note - If you have bought the new Blu-ray of the A&E; Pride & Prejudice w/ Colin Firth and are expecting the same amazing high-quality with this Blu-ray, you will be terribly disappointed. I will now wait for the US studio to release its Blu-ray version of Emma."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible blu ray transfer","review":"I Had bought Emma in The Blu ray format from another vendor.I just had to write something here to warn other customers not to buy this release as it is a very poor transfer onto Blu ray.I agree totally with Kim K with her review of the same Blu Ray release of EMMA.Its as though they have transfered the DVD onto a Bluray disc.Very poor indeed.As Kim K said wait for the US release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever Adaptation","review":"Emma, played by the refreshing Gwenyth Paltrow, is a young woman in high society who tries to use her wits and position to \\"help\\" those she cares about. While her intentions are pure, she often ends up being too clever for her own good. While her plans to secure her friends' happiness go awry, she finds she's left her own life considerably lacking.This adaptation captures the essence of Jane Austen's brilliant social comedy. It shows the intricacies of relationships (played by exceptional actors), the humor of human foibles and undue formality, and the dangers of good intentions.As with all Jane Austen works, the ending (while wonderful) is not as important as the path the story takes in getting there. The creativity of the cast and director, along with the brilliancy of the work itself, makes this version of \\"Emma\\" a must-see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"Beautiful, and thoroughly enjoyable! A clean movie and a pleasure to watch. It brings a smile to my face every time Mr. Knightly and Emma dance; after all, they are not brother and sister!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful adaptation of a classic","review":"I was surprisingly impressed by this adaptation of Emma. Gwyneth Paltrow, despite her accent, played an amazing Emma and made her extremely likable and endearing. Jeremy Northam was the perfect foil to her as the handsome Mr. Knightley. I agree with another reviewer in that he made this role his own as Colin Firth did in Pride and Prejudice playing Mr. Darcy. Paltrow and Northam have wonderful chemistry, which makes the characters that much more lovable. Although P&P was a better read than Emma, I have to admit that I actually liked the latter more than the former when viewing it on the screen. The comedy in this film is great and kept me smiling throughout the whole two hours. This is a movie that I can watch over and over again and intend to purchase and add it to my Jane Austen collection :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad quality control","review":"I love this movie, which is why I ordered it from Amazon. Twice. Each time it was defective (some scenes impossible to turn off captions/subtitles). Gave up and asked for a refund. Just FYI."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming","review":"\\"Emma\\" is a very charming movie. Even though Gwyneth Paltrow's accent left a little something to be desired, I didn't mind it too much. :-) All the actors and actresses are wonderful. The characters are hilarious as well, though I found myself getting annoyed at the silly Harriet Smith more than once. All in all a great movie for friends to watch together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect in every particular!","review":"This is one of my favorite movies! Gwyneth Paltrow made a perfect Emma. The music, costuming and sets were perfectly intertwined to form a real 19th century atmosphere. Well done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Any movie with Ewan MacGregor singing can't be all bad...","review":"Perhaps I would have liked this adaptation if I hadn't seen the BBC's version first. Or if I hadn't read the book. However I regret to report that Miramax's \\"Emma\\" was painful to watch. I felt like they were trying too hard. Perhaps the screenwriters were desperatley hoping to rake in the \\"Clueless\\" audience. As an avid admirer of all things Austen I was throughly disappointed. The story was so chopped up, not simply abridged, but chopped, that I didn't feel the closeness of the relationships that I got from the other version and the book. It was sadly 2 dimensional and forced. But, any movie with Ewan MacGragor singing can't be all bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful.","review":"I am an 18 year old male, who writes reviews on scientific books, likes sports, and cares nothing about novels. But this movie, and the book, are absolutely great. The way Austen, and the movie, capture a timeless struggle in society is compelling. This is my favorite romantic-comedy-in-victorian-times movie (actually, regency era, not victorian), without a doubt.It actually makes you change mood as the characters do. The cast is simply magnificent, and Paltrow is absolutely brilliant as Emma...I should mention too that the movie is a pretty good adaptation of the novel, with the usual limitations of course.It is quite distressing to read other reviewers suggesting the storiline was [taken] from clueless....Jane Austen wrote Emma in the 1800's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Because It's Austen......","review":"....doesn't mean this is a good film. In fact it is pretty dire. Paltrow certainly gets into the role as meddling young Emma Woodhouse who, despite her good intentions, thinks far too much of herself and messes things up good and proper when trying to marry her friends off to eachother.But this is so evidently awkwardly made that it is embarassing and it sufficates the briming potential energy that everyone seems to have in this film.And Ewan McGregor as the supposed rake who behaves most inappropriately is incredibly wooden.The only redeeming feature this film has is Alan Cumming who is terrific as the pompous Mr. Elton - it is just a shame he is let down by everything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've seen it a hundred times and won't get tired soon.","review":"This is absolutely the best movie made this decade! Even my teenage brother likes it, and when I'm with my girl friends, we watch it over and over and over and over and over! There's always a new word, a new glance, a new nuance of meaning to be found and laughed at! BUY IT, TRUST ME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I've never been a fan of 19th century love stories, but even among that category Emma ranks pretty low. I watched this movie because my wife wanted to. The mindless conversation goes on and on, and soon you just forget what they're talking about. Even Gwyneth Paltrow can't save the movie. My wife wasn't a big fan of it either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful","review":"To be honest (and this is addressed directly to those who complained about the movie), the first time I rented \\"Emma\\" I couldn't get through it and fast-forwarded directly to the last scene. I decided to give it another chance, however, and have since watched it six times. It is truly wonderful! The movie's atmosphere and language is very true to that of Jane Austen (I just finished \\"Northanger Abbey\\" and can verify this). The scenes themselves are very beautiful to look at--the scene in which Emma hides the mail from her father looks just like a painting. The acting is wonderful, especially from Jeremy Northam and (yes) Gwyneth Paltrow. Mr. Northam was fascinating in a close-up (watch the way he looks out of the corner of his eyes at Emma) and Ms. Paltrow was beautiful and projected the right combination of self-absorption and good will. In short, I highly recommend this film to anyone in the world. If you don't like it at first, be sure to give it another chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality","review":"I ordered three DVDs of different movies and this one was very poor quality compared to the others I received.

Hope I don't get anymore that look like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Movie","review":"I found this version of Emma to be more enjoyable than the A&E production.

I think it deserves a higher overall rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst version of Emma","review":"I have both versions of Emma Kate Beckensale and Gwyneth Paltrow versions and I must say that Ms Paltrow completely ruined the story for me. Emma is supposed to be spoilt and used to her own way but not spiteful Ms Paltrow made her out to be prissy and stupid. Mr Knightly I liked in many ways but found that Mr Churchill was a prat when he should have been more of a man I would have not given him the time of day. Miss Smith was a simpering simpleton not a bit like the character in the book. I am sorry but I cannot recommend this dvd to anyone"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good film, but picture quality lacking on DVD","review":"I only have one trifle to add, as others have written detailed reviews of the film and did a better job of that than I could.

Austen's low-key sense of humor comes shining through, as does the beauty of the English countryside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch the BBC version instead","review":"This Hollywoodized version of \\"Emma\\" completely bastardizes the story and diminishes it in every way. The film is more about Gwyneth than the story itself. Even her hairdo is \\"clueless.\\" Gwyneth simply prances around \\"playing\\" the part of Emma with a \\"Look at me! Aren't I cute!\\" attitude. She turns the film into a comedy, completely missing its finer aspects. Low-class and cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of understanding makes movie dreadful.","review":"From a die-hard Jane Austen fan, I can honestly say this is one of the worst films I have ever seen. It was clear watching this film that none of the characters, directors, producers, or anyone involved in the making of this film actually understood the book. Emma is portrayed only as a pretty English woman who has social class and knows it. But the character of Emma is so much more complex. Now, granted, Emma is probably the hardest Jane Austen book to film, because Emma IS so complex, and it's hard to get on-screen, but Paltrow and McGrath did an extremely poor job. When I watched this movie, I had no desire to ever look at the book again.If you want to see a fantastic adaptation of Emma, watch the 2009 BBC adaptation. Not only is it much better than the Paltrow/McGrath, it is perfect. You will watch the adaptation, and want to start reading the book that night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emma is missing in Emma","review":"Dreadful adaptation of Jane Austen's Emma. The book deserves far, far better -- perhaps a mini-series like the wonderful versions of P&P, or a more talented screenwriter such as Thompson's S&S. The Paltrow Emma is paltry, leaving out critical scenes, and then inserting strange ones (what is that harvest scene doing at the end, anyway)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"I love all of the Jane Austin books turned into movies.

Get over the Gwenyth accent thing, she was superb. I think her manner accurately portrayed the Emma that Austen invented so many years ago> Great job!

This movie is funny, it should not be missed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Blu-ray Quality; DVD Is Higher Quality Than This Sham","review":"This is one of my favorite movies, so I was very excited to see it had been released on blu-ray. BUYER BEWARE: This is not a remastered, high-definition print of \\"Emma.\\" In fact, the quality is even worse than that of the DVD that I foolishly sold after I'd placed this order. The lip sync is off for the entire first scene, and the print quality is TERRIBLE - lots of artifacts and so shaky at times that at first I thought maybe it had been videotaped by some guy with a camera in a theater.Save your money. Buy the DVD for cheap until someone does a proper blu-ray release of this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow","review":"This production is okay--not a complete waste of time, but not great either. Overall, the script is a very shallow translation of the book, particularly regarding Jane Fairfax and Frank Churchill.Though Ewan McGregor is pretty forgettable as Frank Churchill (partly because of the script), and Toni Collette seems to be less Harriet Smith and more Forrest Gump at some points, there are still some excellent performances. Gwyneth Paltrow does well with the material (such as it is), and she works well with Jeremy Northam (Mr. Knightly). I especially enjoyed Juliet Stevenson as Mrs. Elton and the real-life mother and daughter team of Phyllida Law and Sophie Thompson as Mrs. and Miss Bates.Overall, this production looks pretty, but it's Austen for the masses. People who enjoy watching movies with a historical feel and aren't particular about literary sources will probably enjoy it. For the rest of us, I recommend the production of Emma staring Kate Beckinsdale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very entertaining!","review":"Emma, the vhs fell apart during the first playback.I was not very happy when this happened.This took place within the first 5 minutes of play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This movie is a great love story, an example of love right before your eyes. l definetly recommend this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who told her she could act?","review":"Does Paltrow think she is British?

It has its faults (Mr. Knightly is too severe), but I find it closer to Jane Austen and more satisfying as a movie. The characters are richer. They ring true.

The type of person who would put needles into halloween candy or something.Besides that, this book is pretty much Bill's attempt to cast himself in the role of a father. Who's Looking Out for You? is a self-help book that borders on lunacy. The ideology of this Bush apologist blinds him from the real concerns of real Americans.Those people that are rich should enjoy this book because O'lielly is a whore for the Corporate-Jet Conservatives. For normal Americans, skip this book and save your money for an author who isn't tainted by the politics of country club conservatism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmmm....","review":"Read this book in a couple of evenings. A friend gave it to me for a laugh. Unfortunately there is no humour in it. While B.O is correct about a few things in this book,like dont trust the media, it is mostly an angry middle aged whiteman rant. If you watch fox news dont you already get that? If you want a insightful and humourous book get Al Frankens Book......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"O'Reilly's attempt at being some sort of life advisor comes from no experience whatsoever.

But you would also have to ignore the fact that the book itself is boring, preachy, poorly written, self-promoting, and just plain bad.I do believe that this is the book O'Reilly plugged on his show as a perfect gift for Valentines day. If you plan in giving this book as a Valentines day gift, I recommend cutting out the center of all the pages and stuffing it with money. That way you won't get dumped/divorced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better title: Who's Looking out for you? Not Me!","review":"Bill is an angry, self absorbed man. Deep down he is nothing but an insecure bully. He lies, then lies about said lies. It goes on and on. The only reason to buy this book is to see a very, very insecure man's political ideas.By the way, check out the review that says that \\"All citizens should think this way.\\" and says that \\"Give me a break....just becuase we live in the land of the free does not mean you can't put down this GREAT COUNTRY.\\" Liberals don't hate america.

I like his stuff and he generally does a superb job at finding the stuff that the mainstream liberal media elite shun. This book however was something that I had high hopes for and was disappointed. It came across as whiny and detailed WAY to many problems with little or no solutions. O'Reilly deals with all aspcts of American life and details how certain groups are NOT looking out for you and only for themselves. Basically, I know this stuff already but I got depressed the further I read into the book. You are better off reading this at your local library than buying it for $18 or whatever. If you want people to look out for you, VOTE and stay active. Things will change rapidly when you do."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't give Zero stars","review":"Wow, after reading Bills other books I was really looking forward to reading this one. I wanted political talk and got a puff piece that looks like it was written to counteract the Al Franken book, just thrown together to make Bill look like humanities gift to news. As we all know from his show, Bill seems to think he is being attacked at all times. This book seems to make an attempt to bring Bill back into the human race. It really is sad.

And each night, his reply is, \\"more, daddy, more, more, more.\\" I especially like when he wears his Viking helmet and I grab the horns and he does his best Ned Beatty impression.So why only one star? Because that beyotch gave me the clap! (It turns out he's been messing around with Ann Coulter.) You see, ol Bill has a problem: he wants to jump into bed with every Republican he meets. And he's usually on the receiving end (even with Ann- don't ask).The only reason he's still my girl is because Rush is history.

I am tired of all public figures thinking they are \\"experts\\" on all subjects. When Bill O'Reilly spent a week downing the high school \\"parents\\" that had a \\"private\\" party for their children's senior formal.

There is even a paragraph that appears two times in the book, with the exact same wording. I'll chalk that one up to a mistake by the editors though.This book is only 220 pages, with generously wide double spacing, large font, and about 40% of the information is reproduced from his other books...save your money.

O'Reilly may be the most insulting, abusive, and downright sickening figure on the national scene. It isn't because of his opinions. Indeed, his opinions are all over the place, most settling in the moderate middle. (Okay, in some respects he's extreme, but he's more of a populist than an extremist.) And granted, he can't scream at you from a book. But just as he rudely treats his many guests (always with the standard, empty effort to appear reasonable, \\"Hey, but I respect your right to disagree\\"), this book, in effect, is just as rude to its readers--punctuating truisms with arrogance and one-sided views.And maybe it's all a big act.

After the 200th page (yes, you can actually read 200 pages of this book in an hour-it's that thin!), I abruptly closed to book, returned it to the humor section (since it was so laughable), and drove back to work, angry that I had wasted an entirely lunch hour. For a man that decries the use of \\"spin\\" in politics, he sure uses a lot of it in his book. There is not one shred of proof he uses to back up his claims. Not even a footnote. Instead, he tries to bludgeon the poor reader in the head until he or she either believes him or not. And if you don't, then you're simply an idiot.

He is obviously an author who is capable of probing his own deepest recesses in order to come up with these teachings, which could only be backed up by his own great moral rectitude!True, there will always be those naysayers who would counter that O'Reilly is only \\"plugging himself\\" with his latest book.

It's pure fluff, plain and simple, no thoughtful insights that I could take home. My main comment is that if you have to go to Bill O'Reilly to figure out how to lead your life, you're in big trouble. You're better off listening to Dr. Laura.I did hear Bill boast on his radio show last week that this book will \\"outsell Al Franken's 5 to 1\\".

Don't waste your time with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A New Low","review":"This book is set up like an \\"advice\\" book (\\"Be brutally honest with yourself\\") but it is basically a frame for O'Reilly's \\"insights\\". The \\"insights\\" are his usual simplistic right-leaning views on society's ills, and these are tedious, but the really amazing thing is O'Reilly's apparent delusions concerning his importance as a observer of America. He actually believes that someone other than the dim bulbs who watch his show (mostly, I guess,to confirm their Limbaugh-like delusions and rationalize their pathetic minor league greed) care what he thinks. Ah, if the world were as simple as O'Reilly says it is and good old \\"hard work\\" was rewarded and those vulgar rappers sang about love like their Four Tops parents, then good old boys from the mean streets of Levitown would be kings."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Sure, it common sense.....but......\\"","review":"A good read....sure, it's common sense, but in today's world everyone needs it spelled out for them sometime.

The man is almost as intentionally sloppy a journalist -- or effective propagandist -- as Rush Limbaugh (The Big Fat Idiot of Al Franken's other excellent book).This book is no improvement over O'Reilly's usual Right-Wing shout-down hothead schtick. It is chock full of the lies and distortion we've all come to expect from Bill. It is important to mention both, because O'Reilly is a master of both -- he raises dishonesty to several artforms.The theme of this book is, presumably, 'trust'.

Mr. O'Reilly appears to think that it is an achievement to be, in his own words \\"a jerk\\" \\"annoying,\\" \\"brash,\\" and \\"rude.\\" He also apparently thinks it appropriate to brag about his crude behavior. An example is his career as an Altar boy/extortionist.

He is constantly challenging his critics to critique his output and not himself. Well, I read his book and I can say that he is not much of a writer. The ideas he puts forth alternate between facile self-help cliches and pompous right wing rhetoric. Recently, O'Reilly was being questioned on NPR's Fresh Air and his only repsonse to the questions asked was to cut off the host and assert his opinions as facts.

Nothing here to cause such hateful reviews as those ahead of my own. I think the book is thought provoking at times and, as always, he and I disagree a bit where religion is concerned.

I wish I could criticize this book, but there was really no depth to it. The only thing that I found really offensive was the polemical attacks against the Clintons. Other than that there was just trivial stuff along with some endorsement of religion in public life. There are no citations whatsoever in his book.

His writing is patronizing. Bottom Line - Everyone who disagrees with his way of thinking is not looking out for you ! He spends a whole chapter (atleast felt like that) criticizing Hillary Clinton. Just like on his TV show, he knows everything, can explain everything and everyone who disagrees with him is a pin-head. He repeatedly portrays the \\"FACTOR\\" (his TV show) as the one program in the TV world that is the embodiment of justice, fairness and balance. Which if you see it you know -it is not. The show is a perfect example of how to put down reasonable people by yelling at them, shouting w/out manners and how to \\"Spin\\" your opinion before the guest has had a chance to even voice his.I must admit his style of writing makes for an easy read though ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do me any favors, O'Reilly","review":"I can't tell you how frustrated I am with being a conservative republican with guys like O'Reilly running around.

The book is well-written and a quick read. I gave it a 4 because some of the commentary on situations is a bit obvious to a well-informed or street-wise business person, but to the average to above-average person this book offers many timely insights and helpful supportive guidance.I might suggest that those who have given a low rating to this book is probably attributable to their personal disagreements with Mr. O'Reilly's views on his Fox New's show - The O'Reilly Factor or their personal left-wing politics perspective.

It is just a re-statement of the stuff from his last book. Second, he doesn't solve any problems with his unobjective views. This book is SHORT and Bill is just trying to get some more dough because he knows his fanatical followers will waste their money on it. He must be out of bad ideas and lies. His views should not be listened to when he cannot even keep his promises:On April 22, 2003 Bill said:\\"if weapons of mass destruction aren't found,... I will have to apologize because I bought into it... All right, a month from today, we'll do this story again.\\"On March 18, 2003 Bill said:\\"if the Americans go in and overthrow Saddam Hussein and it's clean, he has nothing, I will apologize to the nation, and I will not trust the Bush Administration again.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"How splotchy is Bill?","review":"The first thing I noticed is that Bill's face doesn't look anywhere near as splotchy, on the cover of his book, as it does in the photo on the cover of Al Franken's book. Has anyone seen Bill up close when he isn't made up for a show? How splotchy is he? Inquiring minds want to know.Frankly, I found Bill's book humourless and repetitive: the same old right-wing rantings which are as factual as his two Peabody awards. However, I did agree with him on one thing: the untrustworthiness of the media. After reading his book, I for one will never trust anything that comes out of the Murdoch empire; especially the fair and balanced comments of O'Reilly. My suggestion is to save your money for now; in a few weeks this book will in the bargain bins for $4.98. Meanwhile, if you want value for your money, get Al Franken's book instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who's looking out for Bill","review":"The great irony at issue in this book is that it's really all about Bill. If O'Reilly could fashion himself as the messiah (and Roger Ailes might be willing to produce that show), he would undoubtedly do so. While this book apparently showcases his best work, its arguments and insights are ultimately as poor as the rest of O'Reilly's verbosity. As always, Bill is a talented rhetorician and a below average thinker. Complememnt this fact with his willingness to forsake any notion of cogent analysis and lower the standard of public debate in order to champion his own celebrity, and you have one really lousy book. For God's sake, change the channel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Al Franken will love this book","review":"If Bill hates doctored pictures on covers of books, he shoud fire his air brusher for this cover.

I can only hope that the angry caucasian middle-aged men of this country read this book and realize that \\"them\\" have had it too easy for too long. Hopefully this will result in some sort of export program, or at least some other thing where like, some guys have to wash our cars for free or something.It's about time someone looked out for me!

What i found instead was a person who tries to blame \\"Hollywood moguls\\" for the downfall of the country. I wish it were as simple as that, Bill. The sucess of his TV show has most definitely gone to this guy's head, and he needs to focus on the issues he proclaims to know so much about, instead of just trying to sound smarter then he obviously is.

I generally like Bill O'Reilly, have purchased his first two books, and listen to his daily radio program. The content of this book is just a rehash of what O'Reilly spouts off each day. There's very little here that I haven't heard again and again on the radio over the past 12 months.The talk radio machine (Sean Hannity, Laura Ingram, O'Reilly, Savage, etc.) has quite a nice book racket going. Almost without exception the books are short, simplistic, and a rerun of their shows. \\"Who's Looking Out for You?\\" is a blatant example of this. It's only 212 pages. The font and margins are gigantic (not to mention all the blank pages in between chapters). In a regular font that's single-spaced this is more like a pamphlet.

It seems to me that O'Reilly only has negative things to say about rappers. When Cam'Ron said that violent movies, such as The Terminator, are just as bad for children as his music. Then Bill was saying that The Terminator is a cartoon. O'Reilly must be pretty ignorant, because The Terminator is not a cartoon. Plus, O'Reilly constantly interrupted Cam'Ron and Dash, because it's his show. I knew O'Reilly was full of crap when he complained that Ludacris had the most vulgar and violent lyrics. Bill doesn't even know Ludacris, and I highly doubt he's listened to Ludacris' music, so Bill doesn't really know what he's talking about. He's the kind of guy who doesn't like rappers period. Some people believe that O'Reilly is racist, but I just think Bill is a douchebag who has to complain about things that aren't politically correct. I hope this review helped you out.Peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Political Comedy at High Levels","review":"Once again, O'Reilly provides pure political comedy.

You gotta appreciate that in a guy.

He can also dodge bullets, claiming to have never said what he said or never meant what he meant. . .then accuse Kerry of flip flopping.You gotta love Bill O'Reilly. If you don't, then you must be un-American. In fact, if you disagree with him then you're disagreeing with Bush and that means you're against the war on terrror so you may as well be an enemy combatant contained in Guantanamo Bay.Bill doesn't like to talk about the dark side of the Bush dynasty.

Perhaps then he can come to terms with his issues and write an advice book that is worth reading. Why on earth would anyone take parenting tips from such an obviously angry and bitter man?

He did actually refer to him as MR. O'reilly, which came as a suprise. It's hard for the Communist Left to accept the fact that we don't want them around. They are so vocal because they are wealthy and think because they are, they know it all. Bill O'reilly does a fabulous job in crafting this book.

Tens of thousands of brown children are being sacrificed in our glorious adventure in Iraq. Why worry about Florida? Jeb Bush is a loyal soldier devoted to the cause.

His writing style is fine, workmanlike, but fine (I'm no great writer myself). As for the negatives of this book, well, Bill's a bit of a holier-than-thou type that really grates on you after a while. And I think he sounds a little bit paranoid too. Whereas Franken backed up EVERYTHING he wrote in his book, Bill's style, aside from his own life's narration, is one more of conjecture that suits his own world view.

This dog may or may not be friendly but its purpose is clear . . . to be on the lookout for anything suspicious.It occurs to me that Bill O'Reilly is like my neighbor's dog, unrelenting in his bark - - facing what's wrong in the world head-on.

On March 18, 2003, O'Reilly was on ABC's \\"Good Morning America.\\" He made the following promise about Saddam's weapons of mass destruction:\\"If the Americans go in and overthrow Saddam Hussein and it's clean, he has nothing, I will apologize to the nation, and I will not trust the Bush Administration again, all right?\\"It's time for Bill O'Reilly to apologize to the nation and tell us that he no longer trusts the Bush Administration.

I'm torn between forgetting this masterpiece of hypocrisy at a local bus stop just to get rid of it, or burning it to prevent any further damage to the senses for unsuspecting others. O'Rielly is nothing more than a hack with a microphone (or publisher, as it were). I'd complain directly to his website, but he has the audacity to charge $5 for that small privilege. Once again, his way of cutting off those who might disagree with his social, cultural, or political spin. Goes to show than anyone with half a half-baked opinion can publish. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the man, Hate the ideals","review":"I'm an avid avowed deeply committed Leftist Atheist, yet I have to admit: I love Bill O'Reilly. That is, I love the man, but hate nearly every one of his simplistic ideas. I cringe with absolute contempt and hatred even at the thought of Bill O'Reilly, yet at the same time, watch him on tv nearly every night. In fact, when I don't watch him, I get depressed. When I do watch him, I hate everything he says, yet still find my eyes glued to the tube. I don't know what it is about him, but he has charsima that can only be compared to Ronald Reagan's, though I believe liberals like me (radicals rally) were more indifferent to Reagan and his policies than they are to O'Reilly. Since I can't stand any of O'Reilly's ideas I can't recommend this book.

Its sooo good, I especially recommend the chapter on where he graphically describes giving head to a fuzzy beaver, never thought you had it in you Bill to nibble the sushi.

Though they are different from one another in context, They are very much alike in asking the question \\"What is going on in our world\\"...The second book I read is Nightmares Echo.

It cracks me up that people take this guy seriously, given that unless he can cut you off he runs away like a sissy.\\"Shut up!\\", seems to be his best way of quieting a worthy opponent. He claims that others slander or libel him when he constantly attacks and lies about those who disagree with him.He is a classic example of the right-wingnut constituency that listens to him. It is kinda sad that a man like this has any audience much less the nationwide audience Fox gives him.Buy Al Franken's book instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and Self-Serving","review":"O'Reilly spends more time serving his own ego and twisting facts and figures than he does trying to present valid points on important issues for America. Poorly written and at times utterly dull, this book barely deserves even one star. No-spin zone? Right, try again Bill."},{"rating":"1","title":"The world revolves around...","review":"Bill. Everything in this world must be seen through his eyes, because only he knows the truth. Everything that he doesn't agree with is heretical, and everything he does agree with is divine. \\"They\\" are out to get him, and he fights \\"brilliantly\\" against \\"Them\\".(sigh) It seems that of all the virtues the shrill child O'Reilly ascribes to himself, humility and constancy were thrown out somewhere between his aggrieved childhood and his aggrieved \\"adult-hood\\". Spend your money on something else, unless you like hearing someone cry \\"Me! Me! Me! Me! Me!\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pablum for the Partisan Right","review":"It is ironic that Publisher's Weekly notes that O'Reilly takes on those who teach hate for personal gain. That is precisely Mr. O'Reilly's modus operandi and he, like they, does not seem to care much about the facts. If you feel like a victim because your view of life is not accepted by the majority of Americans, read this book. It is intended to make you feel that your sense of victimhood is justified. If you want an objective presentation of facts, read something else. Mr. O'Reilly is interested in profits and polarization -- probably in that order."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Real Information or Insight--Disappointing","review":"I suppose I shouldn't really have expected a talk-show host to offer much real information on how society or life works. (After all, a talk show host is merely in the business of ENTERTAINMENT, not philosophy or sociology). Still, O'reilly is such a contorversial figure, that I decided to see what he had to say. Mostly, I found that this book consisted entirely of personal opinion, delivered forcefully, but without anything real to back it up. Disappointing in every way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Bill's overly simplistic view of America is nauseating! He pretends to be smarter than he really is, and I say pretend because it's so badly written, illogical, and overly simplistic that one has to laugh (and then cry about the money wasted on it!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good at the first two","review":"It surprised me because he ranted about himself or his background a lot. Unlike his first two books prior it was blah. I like this guy because he is willing to confront the celibs and other powerful people out there that have lost common sense and brains but have a mic. Unfortunately, people don't like the truth which is why he is disliked. I read it in 7 days due to it being an easy read. I was hoping for more Bill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Personality Disorder","review":"Does Mr. O'Reilly fancy himself a journalist?

It gives me chills to think that there are people out there who find this man respectable.and the two"},{"rating":"1","title":"Undeveloped Mind","review":"I've seen O'Reilly on the tube many times, but in print I saw another facet.He has a discussion about the existence of God that is perhaps the most juvenile I have ever seen in print on this topic. Like O'Reilly, I went to Catholic schools. The attempted indoctrination included four years at a Jesuit high school. So I sat through many lectures on the nature of God, the chain of causality, yada, yada, yada. O'Reilly's dribble would deserve no more than a \\"C-\\" as a 10th grade essay.I began to understand why this dork is a bully. It's all he has to work with. His mind is stuck somewhere in middle adolescence, guided not by intellect but by swirling emotions which he can barely harness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking for intellectual material? Look elsewhere.","review":"Despite the fact that I have been severely disenchanted with O'Reilly's show, I decided to give his new book a chance. I was hoping that perhaps he was different in written form, not as boisterous and bullying. However, I was completely wrong. Trust me when I say that this book is filed with outrageous hyperbole, flawed logic, a hard right political slant, and flat out lies and misinformation on a host of topics. O'Reilly prides himself on being in the know, the common man, and moderate, but these claims are destroyed with anything above a casual examination of this book.Even if you are a conservative, I urge you not to purchase this book. You have every right to hold whatever opinion you want on any issue you want, but by no means should you allow yourself to be influenced by this angry, virulent, and misinformed man. There are many places to read conservative viewpoints and well thought out essays.

I don't know whether or not that was because the delivery guy decided to use my package like a soccer ball (the outer packaging had no visible signs of damage), but the nails were completely un-usable by the time that they got to me - I had to throw almost 75% of them away because the pieces were too small to see the directional arrow printed on the side of the nail strips."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just another band out of Boston?","review":"I grew up in Seattle in the late eighties early nineties and this was one of the bands that made alot of bands step up their game.

It is made well, and we are into our second season with no problems. However, I think it is fair to warn prospective buyers about two things: (1) Although the fan is very quiet, it does make a glub-glub-glub sound every hour or so when the water is released from the tank. We were concerned that it would keep us awake at night, but we both sleep through it. A more sensitive sleeper might have trouble. (2) It takes longer to fill the tank through the narrow opening than other humidifiers we have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job","review":"Bought a Vornado after doing some research. When I kept seeing that Hunter brand humidifiers needed parts, broke down, leaked, etc., I noticed a few mentioned either going back to, or buying a Vornado brand. So I did.I keep this one in our hallway so that it keeps the bedrooms comfortable. Wasn't too worried about the entire house. Waking up and feeling like I had just walked through a desert was.I fill this up about every other day. I keep on low to medium speed depending on how dry the air is. It's a breeze to fill the resovoir.As far as problems, nothing major. I guess the only thing is that the body can hum if the top and bottom are not sitting on each other right. Other than that, no big deal. Adjust it and it's fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a wonder!","review":"If you've ever been told to use a humidifier, you know how many there are to chose from! I have tried about 10 over the past 10 winters! Until this one, all were noisey, got musty or I was unable to replace the filter becasue it had been discontinued! This one is so quiet, stays fresh and works magic on my allergies! The best is that the filters are easy to get and just come in one size! No more trying to remember the model number or anything!Just what the doctor ordered!"},{"rating":"2","title":"solid workhorse - 5 year warranty","review":"A couple of years ago, I bought two humidifiers made by Bionaire. Just outside the 1-year warranty period, the power switches on BOTH of them failed. I bought this Vornado unit as a replacement based on how satisified I've been with the quality of the Vornado fans I own, and it seems to be quite solidly built and it has a five year warranty to back it up. Also, it's made in the United States, in contrast to the cheap (but not inexpensive) Chinese-made Bionaires I had before. The only complaint I can come up with is that it makes a noticible \\"glug\\" once an hour or so when it draws water from the tank. Aside from that, the fan is quiet and it's very easily refilled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gurgling Noise","review":"I bought the Vornado HU1-0012-11. The gurgling of the water bottle wakes me up several times each night. If I had to do it over again I would buy a higher rated machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"When this humidifier is running on high, it is so loud you can't be in the same room and talk on the phone or listen to TV or music unless you raise the volume. A neighbor stopped over and after in the house only a minute she said,\\"WHAT is that noise?\\".It also makes popping noises every 45 min to hour as the water drains out of the water holding tank. The first time I heard it I thought someone was knocking on our front door. The first time my husband heard it he said, \\"What the he-- is that!\\". If that is not bad enough, when the unit runs out of water there is no indicator light and it does not shut off...it just keeps running and running. Also, you cannot move the unit until all the water is empty. If you need to move it to vacuum or wash the floor, good luck because the vents on the bottom part where the water is are very low on the unit and the water comes sloshing out out all over. Cannot believe the incredibly poor design from a company that makes great fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vornado recommended","review":"I would highly recommend this humidifier mainly because of the simple design and ease of use. Compared to another brand that I have, this one is very low maintenance. Noise is not a problem unless perhaps you use the \\"high\\" setting, which seems unnecessary. My only criticism is that it is difficult to see the water level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic Humidifer","review":"I've had many humidifiers and this is the easiest to clean and operate.

Well here it is early Feb and this thing just plain sucks. I have a digital humidistat sitting right next to it in a med size room (13x13) and it never reaches higher that 29%. In the dry months of winter 29% is unacceptable, and my eyes nose and throat would agree. So don't do what I did, and save your money. Or if you must try it, just be prepared to send it back or donate it to goodwill. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better humidifiers for the price.","review":"I bought this because many claimed how quite it was, especially on low setting. Well the fan is quite on the low setting because it barely moves. On the higher settings the entire thing vibrates making a sound you can hear on the floor below, even when it is placed on a carpeted floor. I am very disappointed with this humidifier, so much so that I might just throw it away and get a different one. I plan on never buying Vornado again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skin is still dry.","review":"I moved out to LA from NY and there is considerable less amount of humidity in LA.My skin was drying up. So I asked and was recommended this humidifier.Unfortunately it did nothing to alleviate my dry skin. I blasted it on high and still nothing.The filter seems to run out pretty quickly. The product seems very fragile. The material is cheap and the water tank doesn't fit properly into the product, so that moving it even it a little causes water to leak.The plus side was that it was easy to assemble and it was cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be great but one big flaw","review":"I bought this unit to help humidify my bedroom. Normal operation is nice and quiet and yet still seems to dump a good amount of water into the room.The way the unit stores the water is in a big bottle on the side. The bottle feeds into the base of the unit and there is enough water in the bottom of the unit to keep the entire bottle from dumping out all at once. This provides a convenient way for you to refill the humidifier.HOWEVER, when the water level drops enough that water is fed from the bottle there is a LOUD burbling sound as air replaces the water in the tank. This sound is loud enough to wake me from a sound sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good humidifier","review":"Works well. Would appreciate something that indicates when reservoir is empty and a more convenient way to remove the reservoir when it needs filling. Otherwise very good, though loud hum, even on lowest setting, made it less than perfect in the bedroom."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not loud!","review":"Another great Vornado product; the glugging is quiet, and the fan is fine, good background noise, even on 'high'.

Oh, yes.","review":"After looking at the other reviews, I thought that they had said it all, and said it well. But since there are only four, I thought I would chime in.While similar to Die Zauberflote in many ways (which should be enough of a recommendation to many), this is an excellent example of singspiel complete with comedy, drama, romance and touches of the supernatural. The sound is excellent, the performances solid, and it really is a fine opera in its own right. The adorable 'cat' duet betwen Lubano and Lubanara is almost worth the price by itself, in my opinion, but there's much more to it than that.As I mentioned, other reviewers have already said it all. I'll just add that it's all true. This production really is an accomplishment, and hopefully it will be recognized as a major work in years to come. In the meantime, be the first on your block to own it.

The manual was written in Taiwan by someone who could barely read and write English. Shortwave reception was dreadful, even after purchasing an outside antenna at Radio Shack. The programmable cassette recorder doesn't include a cut-off time, so the recorder runs until the tape ends, and you can only record one broadcast.

Overall, one of the Kinks better original studio albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"gorgeous and underappreciated","review":"The Kinks were a fabulously talented band who unfortunately got overshadowed by their British Invasion contemporaries. Everyone remembers the Beatles, the Stones, and the Who, but very few people nowadays would have a clue who Ray Davies is. This is probably partially because despite the fantastic melodies and poignant lyrics the band crafted, they suffered two massive setbacks: a singer with an irritating voice, and very inconsistent output.Fortunately, Something Else mostly overcomes these problems. Waterloo Sunset is one of the most beautiful ballads ever written, a truly shamefully overlooked piece of rock history. David Watts is a wonderfully lively number (the Jam do a marvelous cover) and Death of a Clown and Harry Rag will be permanently stuck in your head.

He always wanted to go and wonder in the meadow and chase birds or butterfly's.Tootle had to be taught a lesson.This little book teaches children in a fun way how important it is to follow directions.My granddaughter and I enjoyed this read.The illustrations were colorful and the book was enjoyable for her to look at.Nice job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT about Conformity","review":"Tootle contains a deep truth.

Shades of current \\"no child left behind\\" policies can be clearly seen. \\"Learning means listening and remembering.

Obedience to society is the key to success for Tootle. Is this always the message that we want to instill in our children?

There is no reason at all given for why Tootle must stay on the track other than it is what trains do. So poor Tootle is forced onto the tracks even though he is hurting nothing at all by taking an occasional jaunt in the meadow as he loves to do.

I especially loved the very end where Tootle, with tears in his eyes, realizes that he should be on the track, where his instructor is waving a green flag.

Throughout the book Cole goes through exciting problems that apparently help him. For instance, Cole gets mauled by the Spirit Bear. After he got mauled another 6 chapters was dedicated to what was happening to him as he was lying on the ground almost dead. After he was rescued from the mauling he had an un-realistic change in personality. He, all of a sudden, wanted to help Peter and other people. The book dragged out what happened to Cole and had over-specific details stating what happened. It has un-realistic consequences to what happens to people when they do something bad. It can teach children that if they do do something bad, they can get different consequences for what they did, even though it was wrong.

He has an anger problem. He is sent to Circle Justice to get it straight. The beginning of the book is good ands gets your attention. But in the middle it really starts getting your attention. He starts realizing that life isn't a game. At first the story takes place in Minnesota, but then he has a fight with a boy named Peter. Then he gets sent to Circle Justice. They send him to an island where he gets to se the legendary Spirit Bear. He has to stay there for a whole year. He gets off the island a year later, but I can't tell you everything.

This book is about a boy named Cole Matthews. He gets into a fight with a fellow peer in his school and beats him up. The boys name is Peter. He has a lot to do with the book because he is the cause that Cole is on an island in a cabin. It is built for him then he burns it down, shortly after Spirit Bear beats him up. He is living in the cabin for pretty much the whole book. Ben Mikaelsen did a wonderful job. It was very interesting and I would definitely like to read another one of his books. It was both humorous and suspenseful because you always wonder what is going to happen next. The book is also sad though like when Spirit Bear beats up Cole and he has wounds.

This is a breath-taking story about a young boy who constantly deals with his anger. Cole Mathews was recently sent to an Island for bashing a fellow classmate's head into a concrete sidewalk. The main setting for this story is an Alaskan island. The conflict in this story is Cole's anger and it's extremely hard to control. It results in a bashed head, a crisply burnt cabin and supplies, and a dangerous attack. It was finally resolved when his victim Peter Driscal was also brought to the island and forgave him. In this story the one event that sticks out in my mind is when a mysterious bear attacks Cole. This bear is also known as the Spirit Bear.

We all make mistakes in life its just the things that you do afterward that really counts because it shows if you can change or your just another liar in the world. So this story influenced me if I ever make a mistake I have to think of what to do afterward to make things better or atleast have people trust my words instead of getting proof.

I work in an office full of electronic equipment, an d the building is build into the side of a hill. My office is 1/2 below grade and radio reception is bad. This radio can pickup many stations that I previously thought were unreachable from my desk. The sound is really amazing for such a small radio. It's rich and full (a nice pair of headphones lets you enjoy the fm stereo). Battery life is wonderful, plus the ac adapter was included. The radio feels solid and well made.

It doesn't use a lot of air either. I use it with a Dewalt 4 gallon compressor and it kicks the compressor on after about 20 nails. As with Senco products I suggest you use Senco nails for it. I tried several cheaper brands and I was not satisfied. Bottom line is if you want a good roofing nailer that you won't have to replace anytime soon then buy this one. If you want to skimp on price buy a cheaper brand. You will be sorry you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remaster sounds worse than original CD","review":"I was excited to hear a remaster of this album. I've had the original Sire CD for years and listened to it relentlesly back in the 80s. The remasters I've purchased of other 80s rock such as Joe Jackson's Look Sharp and Echo and The Bunnymen's Crocodile sound way better than the originals. Clearly the technology is out there to make CDs sound full and multidimensional and musical. But the engineers failed on this one. My original sounds better. The remaster is scratchy and compressed. Did they even get the original master tapes, or is it a CD of an mp3?

We have many of their fans and have gotten years of great service out of their products.I thought I would try their air purifier since I was so happy with their other products. I especially like the fact that their products are made in the USA and they offer great warranty service.After a long wait, the purifier arrived. It set up quickly but I was a little surprised at how flimsy the case was. It opened with the smallest touch. Rubberbands are used to keep the filter in place which didn't seem like a good idea since rubber ages so quickly.After one day of use, the purifier started giving off a horrible smell. The entire room began to smell of mildew.

I found that it lacks foundation and is practicaly void of historical facts. Although broken down in five chapters, the book at times reads more like a collection of random thoughts without any real structure about the sujbect at hand - a defenitive lack of editorial skills in my opinion. That said, it does offer the reader something to think about, which does earn the book a couple stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Jane Jacob's insight regarding fundamental shifts in social forces in the United States over the last sixty years is nothing short of incredible. For example, every word of her analysis into the educational environment is true - and frightening. The country has changed before our very eyes and most of us have not even noticed. If you want a wake-up call regarding the decay and ultimate abandonment of the character of \\"the greatest experiment on earth\\" read this book. It can be read in two days but its impact will be with you for your lifetime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Post 1990s Blues","review":"Few write quite as well as Ms. Jacobs on social and urban issues.

Jacobs clearly hates the Romans yet the Dark Ages we commonly refer to refers to the period after their downfall. If they were so bad, shouldn't we be glad that they disappeared? Jacobs relies too much on Diamond and (horror of horrors) Armstrong. In all this, Jacobs demonstrates a surer sign of cultural decline: an irrational disgust with one's own culture and its foundations. I stopped reading seriously after the chapter on education versus credentialing mainly because it only barely touched on the subject. I started skimming after that, then just gave up. As other reviewers note, Dalrymple is a much more interesting and smarter critic---and a far superior stylist."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly reasoned diatribe","review":"This book is neither well written nor well reasoned. The author identifies five societal trends that she believes will cause a new \\"dark age.\\" Her arguments supporting this position are all rambling and unconvincing or unrelated or incoherent (or all three). It seems that after identifying the problem the author ran out of new ideas (or arguments) and was, therefore, forced to rehash her past attacks on modern urban planning and suburbanism. Most of the reviews that award this book three stars or more are rating what they wished the author wrote as opposed to what she actually wrote. If you are interested in a coming cultural collapse, there are many books that provide well reasoned discussions.

In these books and others, Jacob's was able to examine society and the economy in ways that went against prevailing assumptions. Unfortunately this is not the case with this book. There is little insight here. The book is just a rambling collection of anecdotes strung together to justify some preconceived ideas.The ideas themselves are not new. They are the stuff one reads in newspaper columns about urbanism. The world is going to hell because not everyone thinks that suburbs and cars are the works of the devil. Jacob's broke new ground in her previous books. This one is just a rehash of tired ideas that were not particularly good the first time around.This is lazy book full of shallow ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip It","review":"In a nutshell, credentialing, atrophy of the scientific mind, and failures of professional ethics are leading to a new Dark Age where there is much information and little truth.

But, all she did was list 12 of the 13 moons in the last few pages. So, THIS is all that the book was lacking.

Arsene Lupin is no common pilferer-- he's a gentleman thief of the highest regard, and virtually a celebrity throughout France. He is constantly being pursued by Inspector Ganimard, his only worthy adversary, yet is never caught-- and while Lupin may be an unscrupulous, good-humored bandit on the surface, his larcenous actions end up aiding the common good as often as not. Lupin is something of a folk hero in France, having recently spawned an excellent animated cartoon series entitled \\"Nighthood\\"-- hopefully, in light of that, these wonderful old stories will be rediscovered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Story, terrible publishing.","review":"I really enjoyed the Book itself, but as for the multiple spelling errors, typos and repeating paragraphs, the book was terrible!

Leblanc is more interested in going on and on about how great his hero is--a matter of reputation--than in showing us how he works in any sort of interesting way--a matter of dramatic tension. Most of these tales have the transparent dramatic devices (how many \\"It's Lupin in disguise!\\" tricks can you pull in one book?) and anti-climactic conclusions of Grimms' fairy tales. Usually it's more important to Leblanc that Lupin did a crime than it is HOW he did it, which isn't nearly as interesting.

It is an interesting team because it reminds one of the Lennon-McCartney team with Mr. Costello playing the cynical, vicious side to Mr. McCartney's optimistic, upbeat side. The first song they team up on is \\"Veronica\\" which became Mr. Costello's biggest hit in the U.S. The song is a look at Alzheimer's Disease but it's dark subject matter is masked by a bright and catchy melody (obviously Mr. McCartney's influence). Their second song is a bit of a throwaway, \\"Pads, Paws & Claws\\". Mr. McCartney also shows up on the album's opener, \\"...This Town\\", playing some great bass. The two continued the partnership on Mr. McCartney's Flowers In The Dirt album.

He hit the music scene in the mid-1970s, and no one quite knew what to make out of this strange man with the big glasses and funny stage name. At one point he was labeled Punk, and another New Wave. But, Elvis Costello (born Declan Patrick MacManus) was never easily buttonholed into any category. About the only thing you can say is that he is Elvis Costello.This album is Elvis Costello's twelfth studio album, and came out in 1989. It contains fifteen tunes carrying that great Elvis Costello sound, which is sure to please his fans - well, it sure did me.

I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elvis Costello is: Spike, the Beloved Entertainer!","review":"\\"Spike\\" was recorded after an unusually long (for EC) hiatus from recording, and it goes all over the stylistic map, from Irish folk to jazz. This eclecticism can be jarring and means that there's probably at least one track in there you won't much care for- I've got a couple. But the advantage lies in the sense of musical travel and adventure. And the best songs are simply great. These include \\"Tramp the Dirt Down\\" (an Irish folk influenced tune with a lyrical attack on then British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, including the lines \\"When England was all the world's whore/Margaret was her madam\\"); \\"Miss MacBeth\\"; the lovely \\"She Plays Around\\"; \\"Satellite\\"; and one of the fruits of EC's late '80s songwriting collaboration with Paul McCartney\\", \\"Veronica\\".

It shuffled to the backwaters of my collection and was on deck a couple of times for re-sale. I'm glad it never made it to the used CD shop. I've recently given this a couple spins and have rediscovered a fine album. Spike features some of Elvis' best arrangements and most pungent lyrics (no small feat). Stylistically all over the map, this is not an easy disk to digest, but several tracks such as Let Him Dangle, Tramp Down the Earth and God's Comic are true classics of Costellian proportions. The Dirty Dozen Brass Band adds spice to the affair, while Marc Ribot(guitar) and Micheal Blair(percussion) add a Tom Waits-like flavor.

In contrast to some other popular accounts of autism, the book tells the story of a child for whom no treatment produces a \\"miracle cure\\" or \\"amazing recovery\\" (in other words, a child typical of the overwhelming majority of those with autism). Some treatments or methods of education seem to help; others are ineffective; none produce a \\"cure\\". At the book's end, life goes on, though radically altered.A further account of Jordan's life features in \\"When Autism Strikes: Families Cope with Childhood Disintegrative Disorder\\" edited by Robert A. Catalano."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was ready for this one","review":"After years of reading book after book, article after article, website after website--combing the earth for remedies for our son's autism, I came across this book.

It merely said, \\"you are not alone\\" as it described my very own feelings about the emotional roller coaster that is autism.

With its action-and-travel oriented plotting, lack of character depth, and sensational-but-stupid visual events, this reminds me of a treatment for a bad action film with an [stupid] plot - i.e., a plot that only makes sense if you accept that all the characters are [stupid]. Author couldn't decide whether to draw the pseudoscience McGuffin from genetics, physics, or history, so he used them all, plus more, in a ghastly muddle of distraction.The sexual encounters by Watson were sheer vaudeville...

Watson and Holmes are out of character, and one wonders if the author even bothered to read the canon before writing this. I seriously doubt that Doyle would ever have written a story in which the narrator goes into needless detail about his love affairs, as Vanneman's Watson does. And are we really supposed to believe that Holmes would fall in love with the widow Han? Aside from the poor characterizations of Holmes and Watson, the author insists on introducing a legion of intelligent rats, and adding bizarre mystical subplots. I personally feel this book is not worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sherlock Holmes fans, beware","review":"As others have noted, this book starts very well, with Vanneman offering a reasonable imitation of Doyle. But once Holmes and Watson leave England, the book takes a sharp turn for the worse. Watson goes on a long sea voyage, with Vanneman seemingly describing each league along the way. He has sex with four different women, a most un-Doyle idea. Holmes is off stage far too long, thinly-written other characters intrude, and finally the reader's patience wears out altogether. There have been several pastiches based on Doyle's mention of Holmes involvement in a case centering on a giant rat of Sumatra, and few have been good. This is the worst yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"A laughable attempt to take advantage of the Holmesian's desire for new adventures.

We live in an apartment in Manhattan and the kitchen lacks proper ventilation so any kind of cooking creates odors which linger for days or which requires the window being opened, a Vornado fan being used to draw in fresh air and opening the front door to create a draft, sending the aromas into the hallway and sharing them with all our next door neighbours. Less than ideal. Now we start to grill or cook, turn the AQS35 on full blast and the odors are dealt with in real time. The air is kept constantly clean. Amazing.Additionally, Manhattan apartments accumulate enormous amounts of dust (maybe apartments in other parts of the country do too but I wouldn't know about that) due to the dry air and heat. I leave this little guy on during the day while I'm away and the apartment air is cleaned, making coming home even more of a joy. Well done Vornado.

This album was like a breath of fresh air when it came out and for all the people that hate on it, there's a reason that this album was instrumental in introducing so many kids to hardcore. although I question some of their intentions these days i'm looking forward to seeing them on the reunion tour and finally getting the chance to pig pile and shout these songs.

We diligently follow the scattered trail of mayhem looking for a bit of understanding, but ultimately find none, ending with barely a single character left alive to sort out the forsaken mess.The Devil-Ex-Machina climax pops out of nowhere, wipes out everyone left standing, while simultaneously and abruptly changing the writer's narrative point of view to that of a new character we haven't even met prior; only heard about.

It will have you dropping the blinds and double checking the doors before bed! The worse part is there are probably people out there in this world that are this wicked! I loved this book so much,now reading the prequel and it is just as scary,,KEEP THEM COMING!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"People may misunderstand the contents","review":"Desert places is a very good novel. Loved the point of view, the way you see things by the perspective of the writers mind makes it very interesting. Though people may misunderstand the contents in the novel, this is a story for only some audiences. This novel shows the true and ugly mind of a serial killer and the plot couldnt make it better. A writer with a twin brother who is a serial killer makes it a real amazing ride. Its family vs.moral. I strongly recommend this novel. Blake Crouch is the writer of our time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well plotted, well paced, very original!","review":"I don't often go in for horror books, but decided to give this one a try, and I'm glad I did. The book gripped me from the start and stayed pretty original throughout, giving lots of twists I didn't see coming at all. Not to be cliche, but I really couldn't put it down!Definitely would recommend, especially at this price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"And you think YOU have sibling problems!","review":"First, this book was good enough that I finished it, not always the case with so many great reads out there! Definitely well written with a fine sense of time, and especially nature, be it North Carolina, New England, or the deserts and blizzards of Wyoming. It is also one of those cross country road novels, and gives a good feel for large sections of the USA. The characters seem a bit far fetched (to say the least), and you'll be hard put to find a nastier serial killer! The trouble is that the goriness and nastiness gets out of hand. But give the author credit for dreaming up a truly sick individual, a very close relation of the 1st person hero-mystery writer. A solid debut, but definitely not for the squemish!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, poor execution","review":"The basic premise of the story was intriguing, but far too often the plot moves forward simply because the \\"hero\\" fell asleep or downed a few gulps of booze at the most inopportune moment - as though Crouch wrote himself into a corner from which he could not otherwise escape. This resulted in \\"oh c'mon\\" moments that put the brakes on the story when it should have really started chugging along.As for the gore factor, there is some, but frankly it was not so over the top as might otherwise be suggested. \\"American Psycho\\" this ain't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"i was looking for something interesting to read and stumbled upon this jewel.

Where do they come from? The worse rating this excellent book should get would be a 3-star rating.This is my 2nd solo Blake Crouch story, withRunbeing the first. I thought Run was one of the best books I read in 2011. I came into this story having already meet the two main sick puppies, Orson Thomas and Luther Kite when I readSERIAL UNCUT (Extended Edition)in Oct of 2010. I had planned on reading the Andrew Thomas trilogy and when these books became avilable for free in Dec and I jumped at the chance to get these books.I enjoyed the suspense & terror in Desert Places. Yes, Orson is one vicious killer, and he really messed with his brother's mind during this story. The book if full of gruesome killings, but to me, not quite as bad as I read inTrappedby J.A. Konrath. But I can see why Konarth thought he and Blake would work well together based on Desert Places and Run."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sordid crud!","review":"You may not be interested in my review since I didn't read more than about one fourth of it. The story's sick plot involves torturous killings and the attempt to apprentice a relative into the insanity. The only merit up to the point of discarding the book was the villain's conclusion that writers of such stuff are not too far removed from the insane who do such stuff. This should be good material for wanna-be slashers and the insane who have no problem killing family and friends. Can you imagine the mental process a writer would go through in the development of a story like this. Not healthy, to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Drags On.....","review":"I read this book in 2 days and i thought it was pretty crappy. It starts when a author gets an anoynomous letter that says he he doesn't follow directions he will be framed. So i thought this book won't be so bad. When the author reveals who the villian is it was pretty lame. With just too many brutal murders and too much information not to mention when the villian kills an old lady.(don't want to give it away)Everyone in this book dies not to mention the fact that this killer has no reason why he is doing this in the first place. The hero gets drugged alot no to mention sleeps alot also. The ending made no sense whatsoever. This book just keeps dragging on and on! i guess if you like books with so much detail and not enough significance this will be a great book for you.

I was waiting for something that never happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"A desert of talent in Desert Places","review":"The true terror of this book is that it got published. Desert Places is a dumpster-full of slasher, mindless violence upon which the thinnest of innconceivable plots is superimposed. The author and his publisher, Thomas Dunne Books, have confused gore with merit, betting that the book's sadism would pay off in the marketplace. But really, to be more honest next time, the author should dispense with writng that has no merit and simply draw pictures of bloody, tortured captives, guaranteeing immediate appeal for those who liked Desert Places while saving those who found it repugnant, or enjoy reading well-written prose, time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"In my life there has been only 2 books that I never finished reading. I always hope that the book will get better if I keep on reading. Guess what??? this one made number three (3). First few pages kept my interest until he met his tormentor. After that, it was just a bunch of trash and gore. A person that can kill its own mother does not deserve for me to finish reading the book.Iam sorry that the author debut was not better in my judgement but I hope that his next books are better.

I really expected to enjoy reading this book, however I was very disappointed. I found the Hamish/Rutledge characterization to be very interesting, but the remainder of the characters in this story were not well developed and practically a cliche'. Most of the plot I found predictable and I am sorry to say that within the first 15 pages I guessed one major plot point, before the middle of the book, I knew 'whodunit'. If you are looking for something that's compelling reading, pass this by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing In Action","review":"A story line of little interest populated with undeveloped characters that no one, but a mother, would care about.

This one did the trick! It was not the heavy tome of a P. D. James or Elizabeth George, all of whom I have read, but it did elicit the English dynamic as does Deborah Crombie. Two American writers who give us a fairly short procedural to figure out.I must admit the solution to this mystery came out of the blue; perhaps I am critical because I just never figured out who it would be - in other words I didnt have a clue!!!! :DHamish as a sidekick (conscience) is a different ploy. But I liked Inspector Ian Rutledge and I hope he grows as I continue to read this series. Picked up Charles Todd on these review boards - am so glad I did.I never even suspected the killer; a plus for me even tho it was a bruise to my ego!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"an excellent series begins","review":"This is the first in a series that just keeps getting better. It has been easy to forget the impact World War One had on British society. Rutledge (and Hamish) make that impact very real.

Alot of the movie also counterdicts itself by showing that women are indeed as dispicable as men if not more so. Killing off men because they are to violent isn't violent?Whatever.

So I used the broken belt and I add a piece of 3 inches of another broken belt [I sewed the two with nylon] and it worked. Conclusion the belt used or recommended from Hoover are wrong: too tight! If the company [Hoover] wants to solve the problem they only have to change the belts by larger ones, at least 3 inches more. The belt don't need to be so tight.This is my free recommendation for Hoover!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I had to put the second belt from this order on my vacuum cleaner yesterday...the first one broke, lasted less than 2 months!

I can invert at least 5 minutes with the standard rig but can't tolerate more than 30 seconds with these boots. I am going to keep trying them. Perhaps they will break-in or perhaps I need to experiment with different snugness settings or using some talcum powder at the pressure points.

I'm supposed to just watch what these ladies do and follow along for the most part with little or no explanation/direction. In most of the exercises, it is no more than what you would do with a free weight - why the kettlebell??The over emphasized breathing with otherwise silence is so annoying - no counting the reps - no music as background - just loud breathing into the mic. And, just as annoying are the delays between each exercise to prompt each one with a title screen - they are too long and unnecessary.I don't believe i can return a DVD once viewed - but i won't be using this one much - if at all.

First, the workouts do not have music. Listening to the breathing and grunting is bad enough but add in the counting of the people off camera and it's very enoying. The biggest problem I have with this DVD is the lack of instruction. There is a quick tutorial at the beginning to explain some of the moves and that's it. She does not give any explanation on how to do the moves during the workouts. It's just breating and grunting. NO talking.

What I especially like about this book is it doesn't treat ancient Egypt and her stories in a disrespectful or dismissive manner, like some books unfortunately do.The binding on this particular edition does break apart a little too easily for my taste.

Here he does another crappy job with who, you might say..Charlie Sheen (Tv's Spin City, The Big Bounce) of all people. Sheen plays a was been cop who got divorced and he has a booze problem. He also has written a book on about serial killers. Things dont happen until the cops find the first body in the garden and it seems interesting but the mind decieves and it turns out to be a pile of waste. The Killer is a necrophiliac and likes to lay with the bodies and so forth....wow, I think. Sheen drops his booze binges and helps out the cops. Wall to wall stupidity. Very predictable. The end where Sheen is running after the guy is hilarious. They both seem to run like Steven Seagal or something. Also starring Ivana Milicevic (I think she is a model of some sort) and Michael Halsey (Mean Guns, Tv's Angel)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great documentary","review":"Four stars because it fails in one important aspect.

He is being charged with this case and he claims that he is innocent. Unlike most books, this particular one was written as a movie script by the main character, Steven. Not only is it easy to understand and read, it also gives you in depth details and actually journal entries during his time in jail. It gives you a totally different outlook on jail life and teaches you to pick your friends wisely because if they're doing wrong and you follow, you're going down with them. Throughout the book he fights for his innocence and it starts to get harder and harder to put it down. Once you begin you won't stop reading till you're finished.

In that matter, Monster is a very different book than most. Also, it captures the rarely touched aspect of being tried in court in an ordinary setting. For these reasons, and for the brilliancy of writing it as a movie, Monster is an amazing book.It is about a black man named Steve Harmon, who is in a jail cell, being tried on court for felony murder, which would place him in bars for 25 years to life. It is written in notes by Steve in the form of a movie accounting his experience. Through notes and script, Myers brilliantly writes about what it is like being in jail, and being the defendant in a trial. Being a book I, the person who almost always can close a book, could not drop, I highly reccomend this book to anyone and doubt they could close the cover of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monster","review":"Steve is a 16 year old boy growing up in Harlem. He decides to help out a robbery of a local drug store. While he wasn't there while the crime was committed, he helped by being a lookout and did a terrible job. He was then charged with felonious murder because he helped in the crime. Throughtout this gut-wrenching novel you jump from the jail cell to the courtroom. The thing that makes this book so good is that for the whole novel Walter makes you decide if Steve is guilty or not.

If you like the \\"Law and Order\\" series on television, or crime mysteries, then you've come to the right book review friend... As you might not expect, \\"Monster\\" is not about monsters, or ghosts or anything that you hear around campfires that make you pee yourself. No, this book is about a trial against a teenager accused of being the lookout in a robbery. The boy writes the story like a play. For example, if someone with the last name McHarris spoke, it would look like this: McHarris: \\"Do you know where the library is?\\" While he awaits his trial he meets shady characters and mobsters. Even if he is not accused, will he make it back alive to see his family?"},{"rating":"2","title":"monster","review":"The book monster was very good.

It shows one of the most common sayings, bad things happen to good people. In the story a sixteen year old boy, Steve Harmon, gets charged with murder.

Steve had to serve time when he didn't do the crime. It's wrong but it happens plenty of times to all types of people. Steve has to play with the cards he has and does a decent job at it.

The main character, 16-year old Steve Harmon is on trial for taking part in a fatal drugstore robbery that was planned by him and his friends. In addition to a life, a carton of cigarettes and money were taken. Steve was accused of being a lookout. During the trials as well as in jail he wrote down in a journal what was happening as though it were a movie. He decided to do so because he said he would have gone crazy without having something to do. He also had flash backs on things that happened during the robbery and about the things he missed. When his mom and dad came to visit they had acted like they didn't belive that he was innocent, but that they wanted to. In the end he was proven innocent and was able to return home with his family. I loved this book because you could actually imagine everything that was going on as if you were there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right On!","review":"I loved the format of this book! What a great way to really get inside a character's head - Chris is into film making, so it makes perfect sense to cast his story, plan his camera angles and set the scene with voiceovers. The diary effect in between chapters, the description of the \\"set,\\" both in jail and in the courthouse - all of these combined for a dramatic, suspenseful screenplay.I learned a lot about urban life in the neighborhood from this book, too. I would like to believe that gangs do not initiate, or store owners are safe, or that drugs are hard to come by for low income individuals, but none of that is true. Monster shows that gangs, burglary and drugs are part of everyday life for street kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Great Quick Read\\"","review":"MONSTER by Walter Dean Myers is a great quick read; I completed this novel in a couple of hours. I really have mixed emotions about this book as I finished this novel with more questions than answers. The main character is so young and in jail for a crime he did not commit. (Or did he commit the role indicated in the novel???) To pass time the main character records in a journal his trail as if it were a movie. Readers will really feel as if they are a part of the trail throughout this novel. This would be a great read for anyone however the youth of this generation should read this novel in high school and have a \\"great debate\\" of some sort. Continued success Mr. Myers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad but Inspiering","review":"Monster is about a six-teen year old boy named Steve. He is telling his story behind bars.

Steve's situation is very real; everything that he feels, I would feel if I were in his situation. Even though Steve is innocent, his lawyer doesn't believe him. Steve's father also treats him differently, which leads Steve to question who he really is.

His movie includes the court visits to the daily angst from being locked up and his concern with his future. He does return to life beyond bars. This book was an interesting look life behind bars and the consequences of a situation that seemed innocent at the time that turned bad.

I read it quickly and wanted to discuss it with others who had read it. If I could, I would teach this novel for the purposes of not only talking about peer pressure and crime, but to explore the criminal justice system and how it impacts young African American males. This book shares similarities with other good works on the same topic: they include Sanyika Shakur's Monster: The Autobiography of an L.A.

The other characters, James King, Richard \\"BoBo\\" Evans, and Osvaldo Cruz all had a part in this murder but, the question is, Should Steve be locked-up behind bars and did he really do anything worth turning into a criminal.

Two main reasons that I started reading this book is because of the cover of the book and it had finger prints on it and that reminds me of criminals. I love reading books about criminals. And I guess u already know this is about criminals well sort of. Because Steve was getting some stuff in a food store and his friends said they would buy it for them so when they came out they said they paid for and they really didn't so he got put in jail for it.

If you are a lawyer or a judge, or training to be those, you might like it, but it is filled with court lingo so for kids it is hard to read.

Trust me, you will enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monter","review":"I found Monster a very exciting and thrilling book. I highly recommend this to everybody who enjoys reading. It is about a boy named Steve who is on trial for felony murder becuase he was in the store right before the store owner was killed. I found it very interesting by how Walter wrote the book as scenes in a movie. I was on the edge of my seat during the whole time I was reading the book.Kyle"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"She Called me Monster\\" by The Odd Squad","review":"Picture this...you're in a dark, scary cell anxiously awaiting your verdict...guilty or not guilty? Being in the wrong place at the wrong time, Steve Harmon, a sixteen year old African American, is accused of a felony murder. Written in the form of a journal and screen play, Walter Dean Myers,(Scorpions), puts vivid descrpition of life in a jail cell. Steve was a kind person and a good student at his school in Harlem, but does that make him any less dangerous? Although Monster was great, Walter Dean Myers puts in too many characters that can confuse the reader. Testomonies can become confusing. But, this book is still a thriller that is sure to leave the reader at the edge of their seats, biting their nails and begging for more. Recommended for a mature audience. (Ages 11 and up)"},{"rating":"2","title":"J. Pedraza Scott 4","review":"I have recently finished reading the book \\"Monster,\\" by Walter Dean Myers. I thought this book was excellent. It is about a sixteen-year-old African American boy by the name of Steve Harmon. Steve is accused of robbery and murder. The book shows the trial in depth. It also explains how he does not like prison. But is he really guilty or was he just not in the right place at the right time? I would recommend the book \\"Monster\\" for people of all ages. I would especially like to recommend it to people who love books that involve court room drama. You will be extremely interested while reading and it will keep wanting more. You will not regret reading \\"Monster\\" at all, enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly disappointing","review":"I was left terribly unsatisfied by this novel. It's won a handful of awards, so I was expecting to be wowed. But I felt very lukewarm toward the storyline throughout the entire book. I just didn't *care* about any of it. I was *really* intrigued by the story being told in the form of a movie, but I ended up not liking it.Not something I'd recommend to anyone. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Book about a Flawed Case","review":"The book kept me really engaged, but I had a hard time seeing WHY the lawyer thought he wouldn't get off when the case seemed INCREDIBLY flawed for the prosecution. It took away some of the suspense and made me not believe the lawyer as a character. Perhaps the main character is an unreliable narrator, but I thought that all of the weight of the prejudicial message was put on one character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monster","review":"Granted I read this back in high school, but I loved it. It was so interesting to me; someone who has not experience much at all myself or really doesn't even know much beyond my small town life.

I would recoommand this book to everyone it is really eye opening, it is a little scary but life is scary."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome!","review":"This book has so many mysteries to uncover that you just want to read more and more.I liked the ending because it was shocking.I liked it because I kept wondering of which person is guilty. I totally recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for teens especially boys","review":"Steve Harmon is a good kid growing up in a rough neighborhood. He does well at school and seems to be going in the right direction to have a successful life. A bad decision may cost him everything for which he has worked. This book describes how that choice could send Steve to prison for 25 years. The story provides a good lesson about the choices young people make. Is Steve really guilty of the crime he has been accused of? Did it happen the way his \\"so-called\\" friends that are testifying against him say it did or are they lying to cover for themselves? The story is told through Steve's eyes as a movie script, a way that is new to this reader. He tells of the days before he is incarcerated, his time spent in jail and his trial. The reader gets a very heart felt look into this young man's heart throughout the story and the ending is VERY thought provoking. This is a must read for all young people especially boys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique Way Of Approaching A Situation","review":"This is a uniquely written story about Steve Harmon, a young man on trial for murder. Written in the form of a film, with journal entries throughout, we are presented with the thoughts and emotions of this teen as he copes with his trial, prison, and in a sense, just trying to stay sane through it all. The style of the book may be difficult to grasp at first,but by using the cast list of characters in the beginning of the book, the reader should soon catch on. While the story does not lend itself to in-depth portrayals of all main characters, we are able to glimpse into the mind of Steve. He tells us what it's like to be on trial for murder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistically written","review":"This book is literally one that you cannot put down. It is written in the real-world language of a 16 year-old that authenticates his being in the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong people. The movie script style in which Myers writes keeps you reading non-stop, like watching a movie wtih no commercials. The plot hits home probably for so many young teens who find themselves in situations and with people that they thought would/could not harm them, but indeed does. Meyers briefly involves the main character's family to show the reader how this one \\"mistake\\" or wrong decision has effected all who are close to him. This book will keep your heart pounding and aching to the end to see how innocence can be taken."},{"rating":"2","title":"J. Rivera Scott 8th","review":"This is a really good book.

Once you start reading the book your not going to stop.It's just a good book that feels like a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monster is scary, not in a great way","review":"I found that the story was too fast paced for something as dramatic as a 16 year old boy on trial for murder. The settings changed too quickly at the beginning, and I found the plot kind of confusing. The plot though, was believable and realistic, and there was very little profanity, if any. The language was not coated with heavy accents, the closest it got was gangsta talk. The point of view was from Steve Harmon, and there was a fair share of the plot jumping around. The characters were very real, and you could really picture it in your mind. Sadly, I could not say this for much of this book.I would really recamend reading Eragon, and the Harry Potter series."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book!","review":"This book was in great condition, it still looks fairly new although I only paid a fraction of the cost for it. Also, once I paid it was shipped quickly and efficiently."},{"rating":"2","title":"The great book","review":"The book \\"Monster\\" has been the best book I have read so far. Water Dean Myers did a magnificent job when he wrote his book. He described the life of a teen that made mistakes. The book was intrusting how he wrote, it was like if I was their.

Also because on how he describes the characters and the settings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consistency","review":"Timex does a super job at making a really durable product. This watch I just received is a replacement for the exact watch I purchased 8 years ago that was still going strong. The only reason I replaced my original one is the strap wore out and the lettering on the bezel lost the black highlights thus rendered unreadable. Not that important in the big picture. The issue I do have with Timex is their watchbands are a hassle to get replaced. So for the price of this watch (which is about half retail from Timex) it was preferable for me to just get a new watch vs. the hassle of getting a new band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timex Watch","review":"Got this for a friend for Christmas. She lost hers. She found it a few days later at the lake where she worksout but it had been run over. The color is her favorite. She really likes the watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great watch; terrible band.","review":"I purchased this watch less than a year ago from Amazon. It was a fantastic companion to my daily exercise and work routines, until the band split. I discovered, subsequently, that it cannot be mounted on another band by design, and that the resin material is completely resistant to repair by epoxy, hot glue, or super glue. Electrical tape held it together for a while, but after just under 12 months of ownership I was left with a fully functioning and completely unwearable watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable, good looking watch, intuitive buttons","review":"This is a very nice looking watch and it is very comfortable. The face is slightly larger than I expected, but it is not too big. I haven't worn a watch in years, but got this one for running. I put it on last night and forgot I had it on! Very comfortable. I started to play with it straight out of the box without reading the instructions, and I was able to set the date and time easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trusty watch","review":"Great watch. Tried and true this watch has lasted throught the years. However, the little round band that holds the strap down breaks a lot.

It won't function at all. I wasted my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"has timer, but not intervals","review":"I bought this watch based on a previous review that said it comes with interval timers. It doesn't. It does have a timer that you can set so it repeats once it reaches zero. I wanted a watch that you can set to time run/walk intervals - on those you set interval 1 and interval 2 and you can set it so it repeats the intervals until you stop it.This watch does have the chrono feature (but I think pretty much all sports watch have that), the timer, 3 alarms and something called \\"occasion.\\" Looks nice, as pictured.If you're a runner and you're just interested in your split times, this will work. If you do the run/walk thing, or you want to do timed sprints with a timed recovery in between w/o constantly checking your watch, this isn't the watch you want.This is the only watch I've found so far that does intervals:Timex Women's T5K007 Ironman Sleek 50-Lap Resin Strap Watch"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Watch","review":"I've had this watch for about a month now, and several trips to the pool later, there have been no condensation issues, so that's a big plus. The face is a little larger than other sport watches I have owned, but it's not overly huge. I love that the time is much easier to set/change than previous Timex watches I have owned (didn't even have to read the directions this time :) ). The color is great and the large numbers on the display are nice. If you work in or around water and are likely to be wet or sweaty all day, the resin band is absolutely the way to go; I'll never work in a cloth, velcro, or leather band. So far I am very happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Value","review":"This is an excellent watch for the price, there are several functions that may take the place of some phone funtions. My wife loves all the options and easy to follow directions. There is the most suprising, date reminder. If you are looking for a watch that can do it all and not all that complicated for around $30, this is excellent and would recommend it for anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This watch does what they say it does","review":"I bought this watch to replace an earlier model with substantially the same gizmos. The two time zones come in very handy when I travel. When I'm not traveling, I keep it so I know what time it is for one of my children living in Europe. I use the timer all the time, so I don't get a parking ticket where there's a meter, when to take a next dose of medicine when that is needed. It has lots of other features, but I dont' use them. What I use are important to me, and they work well. I had my other watch for about 6 years of hard use, went through 2 wrist bands. That's not as long, perhaps as some, but this is not an expensive watch. Plus, it looks good. I have a small wrist, so a woman's watch is preferable to a big clunky mans watch, that looks as if it's hard to lift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pink & Gray","review":"This is a great watch.

The color of the band was a little more purple that I thought from the picture. I still like it and would certainly recommend this seller."},{"rating":"2","title":"great all around watch","review":"I bought my first model of this watch almost 3 years ago. I was a newbie runner and needed the chronograph/timer features and a durable watch that could handle lots of sweat. This model is perfect! Never had any issues with it at all until the part of the band that holds the end in place broke last week. Having it loose got too annoying for day to day wear so I opted to get a replacement watch (the band would have been half the price of a new watch and wouldn't have matched).This watch is the same model in grey and pink. :) I am thrilled to have found an exact replacement and hope this one serves me as well as my first one (which has become the kid's timer for trips to the park!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing instructions","review":"I returned this product because I had trouble figuring out how to use the functions.

Got a new one, but after swimming in the ocean for an hour, the display went blank. I wasn't sure if it was a battery problem or if water had gotten into it, but either way I had worn the watch for less than a year. I am sure that i didnt bang the watch too. I took it off to deal with later. The next day, the display was filled with black inky liquid. The warranty was worthless since this was categorized as a \\"display problem.\\". Needless to say I am very disappointed in the lack of quality and recourse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good watch!","review":"I am not a \\"serious athlete,\\" but I swim 2000yds 3x a week. I just got this watch and have swum with it three times. I am very happy with it. Definitely read the directions and then the way it works makes sense. For the money, it does exactly what I was wanting - just timing my distances. I can hit the conveniently located split button, get my time and then have it for review later. The watch is a little bulky and the way the free end of the band is held down could be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of great functions","review":"This watch is great! I use all the functions all the time. I'm currently training for my first 10k and i use the stopwatch to do my interval training. I also enjoy the multiple alarm feature, and use the timer frequently. I did have one little incident with its waterproofing, but it's never happened again. The face fogged a bit, and it started beeping sporadically. Overall, I very much enjoy the look and feel of the watch, its very comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"not water resistant","review":"Initially disappointed by the shipping time. Watch arrived nearly a week after Amazon estimated it would.Then, wife wore the watch for about a week. In the swimming pool a couple time as well. Moisture got underneath the plastic face of the watch and fogged up the display. I don't notice this problem mentioned anywhere else in the comments for this style Ironman, but several of the other styles do have similar comments (guess it is a risk you run to get one that is truly water resistant).Returned the item and will buy one from Walmart locally. Since there is the possibility of it happening again, would like the quicker return process my local Walmart will provide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paint Chips Off","review":"I initially liked this watch.

Careful if you have latex/rubber allergies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great woman's watch","review":"I'm a nursing student and this watch is exactly what I was looking for. Not too feminin but the pink I makes it girly enough. I like the military time option too. Slim band and a very comfortable fit. Love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect choice for me","review":"Love this watch. I initially bought just to help me time my running, but ended up making it my everyday watch. It's a nice size - not too large for a small wrist. Easy to work. I would buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great watch - again","review":"Love this watch. Easy to use, durable, stylish -especially for the price. I had another Ironman watch that lasted about 3 years until the strap broke due to normal wear and tear from training (sweat, salt, heat, chlorine, etc). I really like that the display is slightly bigger on this new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the tender hearted!!!","review":"I've used an electric 'foil-type' shaver for the last 15 yrs and decided to try the rotary type. Well, they should have called this the 'pull and tear\\" instead of the 'lift and cut'. I've been using this shaver for about a month now and I wince everytime I use it. I have a light beard so i figured it would cut easily. To my surprise, it is quite painful to get used to this type of shaver. if you can handle the pain, it does cut extremely close. My reason for the 2 star rating. Other than that i would not recommend this type over a good foil electric shaver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adobe Acrobat 7 Standard","review":"I needed a reasonably priced Acrobat version to create PDF/X-3 files. Version 7 is not the latest, but it does the job. I paid a much lower price for it than for current version 9.

One area I have always had a problem with is the formatting of some documents in size and sometimes Acrobat simply fails to recognize them and so I switch to the Free PDF software which has no problems doing this and is easier to use.However if you are a pro PDF maker who wants to add sigs and links and notes and chapters and all the other function tags including security tags then I recommend this product hands down as the best one. I just find that it is not always the best PDF software package in the world, but a good one all the same.I would not recommend buying this one just to make standard PDF files alone.

I have called three times in the past two weeks and have had to wait, at a minimum, 23 MINUTES just to speak to someone.When I finally got my product, they sent the Mac verion rather than the PC version I purchased. I called again and waited approximately 30 MINUTES to get customer help. I had originally ordered the PC Standard version and asked to upgrade (and pay difference) for the Professional version -- since I still hadn't received the PC version. Customer service stated that they would ONLY ship me the Standard version to replace the incorrectly shipped Mac Version and then I would have to wait for the Standard verison to arrive at which point I could call again, and ask to exchange for the Professional verion - INSANE!!!

I have disabled outgoing internet access in my firewall from programs like Acrobat because Adobe's habit of doing push marketing into their software. But that screws up the reactivation and you cannot use the software. When I tried the phone automated reactivation, it refused the numbers that the program gave me to enter! The customer service will want an e-mail address to send you a patch to \\"fix\\" the reactivation problem and they asked me for phone number as well!The choice for Adobe is simple, stop doing your push marketing into your software that I pay money to acquire and I will forgive your problems with reactivation.

When I called, the person was rude, arrogant, and condescending. Unless I gave him my credit card number, he would not help me.

For a low cost replica I've always enjoyed this sword. Came with a very pointy tip and a bit of an edge, which I had dulled. The metal is too soft and the tang not sufficient for fight coreography. Though if you are cautious it can take some limited abuse:) But it makes an excellent pirate blade for reproduction work. My biggest problem has been the handle. The handle is wooden and quite slick, especially if your hands sweat. I highly recommend sanding or leather wraping the handle before doing anything with this blade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hours and hours of entertainment!!","review":"Originally bought this little gem back in 1983 when it first came out. If you have a thirst for the bizarre and unique, this is the book for you. Even someone not a fan of the Grade Z or cult category of film will appreciate the blunt, amusing descriptions given by Michael about these irreverent mostly outlandish movies. Lot's of photos of rarely seen promotional photos and posters makes it even more enticing. Only complaint, I wish it were produced in a hardcover version and had some color photographs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good not great","review":"As much as I love Ralph Feinnes, Toby Stephens and Liv Tyler in other films, this work was not at all satisfying. It started out strong enough but somewhere in the middle, it simply fell apart. Maybe it was the editing... but I never felt that Onegin (Feinnes) was as violently in-love with Liv Tyler's character until the very end. The last half hour needed more meat. It was too rushed to be able to appreciate any of the unrequited love. Rent it-- don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"O Negative","review":"Sorry folks. Honesty is the best policy. I lust after Ralph Fiennes and though he usually wins - when he's losing - in all his films, I wonder what he was thinking when he played this role. Man, he loses big time and quite honestly, I can't stand my lovers to play a victim role. When Ralph finally figures out what he wants, he can't get it. I love Ralph Fiennes and I'll continue to see him over and again to The End of the Affair. Ralph can lose when he plays a man who knows himself and what he wants even if he is mad; one could respect his resolve. In Onegin, he gained no respect.

She is the wife of another. And steadfast heroine that she is, she will not break her marriage vows.Ah, the sweet torture. The close-ups of Ralph Fiennes's ever expressive eyes. It was a love junkie's smorgasbord.What do I know about cinematography? The film's a feast for the eyes. That's good enough for me. Direction? Martha Fiennes did a fine job in my humble opinion. And the score was hauntingly lovely.The previous reviews have been technical enough. I'm a writer.

Ralph Fiennes has never been better; Liv Tyler can't quite match him in the crucial scene at the end Anyone who doesn't know the story should be warned that this isn't David Lean's Doctor Zhivago. It was a quite small-budget film and the story isn't an epic through there is lush scenery. The story is ambiguous, where the motives of the central figure are certainly open to debate. But I think it works, the cinematography is excellent, and the music sets the mood nicely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Onegin off Again","review":"I love Finnes and the period, however, this movie is a mixed bag. I love the period pieces, and this movie certainly has beautiful scenery. I think the characters are a bit stilted, probably the direction, and yet, I liked it. It won't be my fav, but it's part of my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly awful!","review":"The roles have been so poorly miscast that this movie is simply unbearable to watch. Liv Tyler is insufferable as Tatyana, completely out of her realm in capturing the nuances of this character. Fiennes is a good actor but is too old to play Onegin, who was barely past 20 and had an affected sense of disattachment with society as a prvileged young son of Russian society would.The movie trudges along trying to fill in the scenes with an insipid dialog that hardly does the poetic novel justice. The verse novel was written mostly in the third person with very little dialog, which would force any film maker into constructing much of it, but here we see a lovely novel reduced to the level of soap opera. Do yourself a favor and read the novel rather than waste an insufferable two hours watching this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Onegin review","review":"Based on the other reviews I read, I ordered this DVD. Yes, the scenery was great and the costumes were wonderful, but I was bored stiff and couldn't quite understand why the movie had to be so slow. There is a lot of scenes that could have been left out and still been an okay movie. I was very disappointed and would not recommend this to anyone. To me, this wasn't a love story in the truest sense. Tatyana fell in love with falling in love and was a bored country girl, Onegin gave her no reason to fall in love with him, he had NO endearing qualities.So, rent it, don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh yes!","review":"This is one of my favorites.

There are not many good English translation, but anything is better than this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Onegin","review":"Ralph Fiennes delivered his usual \\"less is more\\" performance.

Loved the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck?","review":"So when does a movie stop in the middle and leave you with no closure? When you watch Onegin! It's really slow at the get go and then when you think the movie it finally going to pick up and get good it stops! And stops with no real conclusion as to what's going to happen to all involved!

It gives an uneven shave, for one thing; you have to go over the same spots several times to get enough of the hairs evenly trimmed. Also, if you have a thick beard, be prepared to continuously take the plastic guard off after each pass; it doesn't handle a lot of hair well.One other thing to keep in mind if you have a thick beard is to be prepared for the possibility of shaving it over several sessions. the battery in my unit is worthless. It craps out on me after five minutes, despite an all night charge. This is after a total ownership time measured in a few months, and using it only a few times each month.My advice is to pass this one up and go ahead and spend the money on a real shaver, something like a norelco.

Luckily I only use it to trim down a goatee, because it only takes about 3 or 4 minutes total to do so. Granted, the clip sizes are perfect if you just want to quickly shave your goatee or perhaps trim your sideburns or beard, but the pathetic charge time won't get you much.

Her tunes Elephant Box and Heaven Must Be Near and Hippy Blood still could be heard in some underculture clubs and circles. I thought Little Mama was ready for radio play when I first heard it because of the funky bassline and just the right 'it factor' in her vocals, but the \\"baby's no reason to lose your dreams\\" hook was probably a lil too much for program directors.

Unlike most books, i couldn't put this book down! It got me scared at some points. Skelton Man is a great character. the author did an excellent job trying to make a modern type monster.

Most parents will find that it is not appropriate as a mandatory reading assignment or a read-aloud story in your child's classroom.

Wow that sure is what sXe is about, beating someone up because they think diferently than you. That sure is unity. Now im not saying all of these kids do that, but there sure in hell are alot of em.

I am not someone who lumps myself into a certain category of music fan I enjoy pretty much enjoy all forms of heavy music whether it be any form of metal, hardcore or rock, if the intensity is there and the musicians have the drive to make quality music I'm all about it.

I was sadly, sadly dissapointed. It is more than obvious that the author wrote this book only to expouse his own political view points, and to lash out at every aspect of Israeli society with which he has a bone to pick.* He places the entire blame of the Intifadah on the assassination of Rabin* As such, he places the majority of the problems of Israel on anyone wearing a kippahDespite this, he manages to maintain an air of I'm-better-than-everyone-else throughout the majority of the book.I suggest you avoid this book, as it is not what you are expecting.

This one needed writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Poetry with his Politics","review":"Sorry, but I couldn't get with this non-fictional narrative, too lacking in any poetics for my taste.

While reading it I found it a little disjunctive, a little disturbing. But it wasn't until I slept that I woke knowing what is wrong with it. Unlike Thomas Friedman, Mr. Horovitz doesn't mingle, as he admits, with Palestinians nor does he go into the West Bank or East Jerusalem, except occasionally as a journalist. That would be okay; what is not okay is the writer's quite unbelievable arrogance. He believes he might have saved Prime Minister Rabin from his horrid fate--if only he had been at the peace rally in Tel Aviv the night he was shot! He believes, or strongly suggests, that his wife single-handedly threw the last Israeli election--to Mr. Barak. Arrogance isn't interesting and neither is most of this book. An attitude lies beneath it that is faux macho and lacking artistic value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid at all costs","review":"Horovitz reveals, and revels in, his hatred for all things Jewish and Israeli. He should have stayed at home in England doing whatever it is he does best instead of travelling to Israel with his obvious prejudices."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little To Close to His Ego","review":"If we are to believe the author, he alone could have saved Prime Minister Rabin from an assasin's bullet. And also that his own family is pivotal to Israeli's political life, their elections. Though the author can be credited with a certain immediacy, he was mostly writing in his journal for and about his family. The book is not well organized. It jumps around and assumes too much interest in his personal life and not enough about the great world all around him.

Many times I find myself thinking or even saying, \\"You don't live here - so you will never understand\\". As one of the Characters in David's book, I now have a reference that touches all the right spots about living here. My 17 years experience in Israel has run parallel to many of David's experiences, reading the book made me laugh and nearly cry as I looked at my last 17 years.

Both are loaded with character and very well recorded.

I doubt my hair and whiskers are getting more abrasive. That must mean that the blades are being made of poor quality materials.

My shaves with the lift and cut heads are closer than I ever remember them being with the Quadra-action heads on the same razor.

Wonderful Smith can't be pigeon-holed musically, that's for sure. From the fun songs like Gunner Car to the awesome Hard Alcohol with it's memorable first line, \\"Hard Alcohol tastes better when you feel it in the morning.\\" While it may seem no big deal when you read it, it's the vocal delivery by Holly that makes it all worth listening too.

They were always too short. I would rig the thing with padding in the bottum to fix this, but it was always a challenge to get enough padding to work, and not too much, as to spray the contents out in seconds (yes, you can empty almost an entire can in seconds). Not, it does not really work at all. It has two functions, nothing, and spray the contents of the can out in seconds.That said, for the four months when the product worked, it was grand. I loved taking a shower and having hot lather waitng when I shaved. The product worked quickly, until it broke.Purchase with this warning, it works, but not without problems. Furthermore, is $24 a decent price for 4 months of use?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"I have had one of these for several years now.

Waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"I had an old model 10 years ago and loved it. I bought this new one and had to take it back because it did not heat up. The one I exchanged it for had the same problem. I called Conair and they told me that people complained that the older ones were too hot. Now they make them so that they don't heat up as much. This is a total waste of time. I took this one back also. This new version is worthless!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No one uses these anymore","review":"Thought my dad might like this, but sent him something else. My hubby is too rigid in how he does stuff to even try it. I may try it someday. So, unless a person who wants to use it themselves orders this, it'll just be in the back of the cabinet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hot lather, for a moment","review":"The Conair hot lather machine works fairly easily. Take a standard can of shaving cream, pop off the top and the dispensor cap, and insert and secure it into the hot lather machine. After you plug it the red light will turn on, and when the lather is 'hot' you'll see it switch over to green, which only takes a few minutes.The lather does dispense comfortably hot in your hand, but it very rapidly loses its heat. Its no exaggeration to say that by the time you put your hand to your face the lather has become tepid, and once you're ready to shave the lather is no warmer than it would have been had you dispensed it from the can directly.I'm going to store this machine until winter, when it might prove more useful. It doesn't seem to be worth the trouble right now with spring and summer coming up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost great...","review":"The setup is easy. The premise is great. The lather is not that hot. This is my only complaint, but for $15, do you expect the full barbershop experience?

It died. Searched brick and mortar stores for more than a month and could not find one. Was told it was a \\"speciality\\" item -- carried only around Christmas & Father's Day. Ordered this online. Shipped promptly and works great."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE of the many books you should get","review":"While the book is very overwhelming with information, it explains how to deal with the issues. There is ALOT of information in this book, therefore, it should be one of the first books you get. As another reviewer said, the medical problems described are scary - but that's part of down syndrome. Fortunately not all down syndrome children have all the medical problems.The best part in the book is the developmental charts and growth charts that a lot of doctors, clinics, health units don't have!! It also explains what you need to know for your infant all the way through adulthood. Life insurance, inheritance, wills, family estate financial planning is discussed. Very important issues that will surprise you!I find the book to be a constant resource. I refer to it constantly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't buy this book first","review":"I was given a copy of this book when my son, Zachary was born. As another reviewer mentioned, it was quite scary reading all the things that MIGHT be wrong with him medically, along with the quotes from parents the author included. I'm sure the quotes were a well-meaning inclusion from the author - but each and every one I would review to be extremely non-descript, even bordering negative. As a parent of a child with DS - I can tell you first-hand that my experience has been nothing but non-descript...but overwhelmingly positive. My son, at less than 2 years old, has already brought so much joy into our lives and countless others. A child with Down Syndrome is a blessing in disguise. He give to me so much more than I give to him as you wil hear from just about ANY parent with a DS child - but not from the author or the outdated quotes she chooses to include in her book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overall rundown of children with DS","review":"This is overall, a good, informative resource, providing pretty much all you need to know to have a good understanding of Down Syndrome. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, is I think it presents more of the negative aspects than positive. For a new mother, it can be a little overwhelming if this is the first book you read. I would say it is a must have, for it is extremely informative. But, also make sure to read \\"Gifts\\" too, as that will present all the positive aspects of having a child with Down Syndrome as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book of the basics","review":"As a professional I found this book to offer a lot of basic information that a family could understand about down syndrome. All the children I work with with Down Syndrome, their families have this book and said it helped them so much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't let this be the first book for a new mom!","review":"When my son was born with DS, all I wanted to hear was that this was a good thing. This book was factual, yes, but it was somewhat depressing for a new mom. Reading the comments from parents was especially discouraging for my husband and me. I was searching for that joy and privilege that I had understood parents of DS kids to have... but couldn't find it. Eventually, I saw other books, calendars, videos, and talked to the self-proclaimed \\"lucky\\" parents whom I had sensed were out there. I just wish I had done things in the opposite order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"I am an early interventionist, working with several infants and children who have Down syndrome. I found this book to be somewhat incomplete and misleading. For example, it contains a developmental milestone chart for typically developing children. This chart caused no end of worry to the parents I work with. More accurate, Down syndrome specific information is available elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Babies with DownSyndrome","review":"I had recently found out that my future grandchild was diagnosed with Down Syndrome and was anzious to start educating myself. The book helped me understand the syndrome and realize that we need not be afraid of what the future holds. Since then I have found out that this baby will probably not go full term, but what I read made me realize that I should not be afraid of hearing Down Syndrome in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not to be given the day that you give birth","review":"I was handed this book the day that my daughter was born, when the doctor's suspected she had Down Syndrome. This book is informative to all the future obstacles that \\"may\\" be faced, but not something to hand to a new mother. I found this book to be very depressing and had to put it out of sight for several months. Even when a typical child is born, we don't know what types of medical issues that are going to be faced with, or the difficulties each family will have due to that child. I feel that this book focuses too much on the negative impact of Down Syndrome and not enough of how much enjoyment and happiness will be brought when each milestone is met. We are not even told that our children will meet all milestones just \\"possibly\\" at a slower pace. Babies with Down Syndrome can't be sterotyped, they will all fare differently since their genetics are all different, some smarter than others etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of classic songs","review":"I think this is a pretty good DVD, however I am not in any way musically gifted, and found it progressed a little fast for me. I think a person that had an inkling of an ear or had played guitar or banjo before would be well pleased with it. As for me, I will still play it, just for the music, and maybe someday some of it will seep into my arthritic hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"This dvd stinks","review":"You should get something else, this dvd was done in one take, lot's of use of the word um.

I gave it as a gift so don't know how helpful or well done it is for instruction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fun read.","review":"This book is very detailed in studying the level of organizations in the work setting. Must chapters seem like they take forever to read and get a grasp on. When I was finished reading it I found the information to be very overwhelming and hard to remember. It might be a good book solely to use as a reference. I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sharp shears, but too heavy and unbalanced","review":"First off, these are super sharp shears, and if you're looking for a good at-home shear, then these are a good value. However, they're too bulky. I found them to be heavy and unbalanced in my hand, and the length is such that it's hard to get close in at the nape and around the ears. They would be fine for long-hair trims, but for mens cuts, as well as short haircuts on women and children, you'd have to switch to a smaller shear for the nape and exterior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly balanced, manufactuered in Pakistan I believe","review":"In the world of hair shears, there are high end, low end, and Pakistan.

Instead Quiet Riot hit rock bottom because they were a one hit wonder. Other than Rudy Sarzo the bassist, the other 3 musicians were as lame as Milli Vanilli.

These blades are expensive. This is a great great deal, and since this product cost over twentyfive dollars the shipping was free. To go to K Mart and back would have cost me two or more dollars in gas.

My face and neck now stay irritated all the time. The remaining shave time indicator is very handy, but since the utmost requirement to a razor is the shaving quality, I wouldn't recommend it at this price. Despite the fact that I followed the charging instructions, after 2-3 months of usage, I can get 37-38 minutes at most.

As to the movie itself. Its been said that the 'facts of the matter' have been somewhat overlooked by the director/writer. Well, poetic license I suppose.

Yes, the author uses big words like \\"autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity.\\" He also tosses around: \\"principal component analysis\\", \\"importance sampling\\" and \\"Quasi Monte Carlo.\\" Anyone who needs to understand these concepts will be disappointed. The explanations are shallow ... often just a single paragraph. The reader is left with an elementary book that adds little to the original RiskMetrics document.

I did get a red light indicating that the battery was charging and could feel that the battery compartment was a little warm, but no dial tone, no illuminated screen and nothing but disappointment.

We've had a little bit of static using it once, and had to go inside and switch to a \\"real\\" phone. We've tossed this phone in the water (it does float) and picked it up and talked directly in the water.we're outside, there is a lot of noise, and we want a LOUD ring. This phone doesn't have one.

RES turtles bodies grow very often as well as their claws and the more and more they climb up the ramp to bask the more the tape's non skid material fades. Now after 3 months my RES struggle to bask, I have to help them up. Now I have to find safe non skid tape for the turtle ramp as a replacement or completely throw away the ramp and buy another one (which by the way its not exactly cheap to constantly buy the same ramp every few months, the $$$ adds up after a while.) Its a disappointment to know that an item works only for such a short while."},{"rating":"2","title":"sturdy ram","review":"My turtle really enjoys this ramp. He had one of those foam ones that didn't keep him dry before. There is plenty of room on the ramp for him to spread out and enjoy the heat.

This is a very good product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turtle Ramp","review":"This ramp worked fairly well, but because my turtles are on the larger side, the ramp would actually start to bend downward when they would bask on it. It would be nice if this came in a larger size where the ramps were wider and able to sustain heavier turtles."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Franklin is happier with this turle dock","review":"I highly recommend this product. I wasn't sure if the size was appropriate but the \\"large\\" one fits pretty nice in my 40 breeder aquarium. He has plenty of resting room. I doubt it if he uses the diving board part. He has picked up a little weight and isn't able to climb up on docks anymore. As a matter of fact, walking on dry land is a struggle for him. So, he can easily swim and rest on this Kordon-Oasis Novalek Turtle Ramp. He is able to pull his body up from under the water using this one. I was concerned about him not being able to bask as much as he loves too. His limbs under his legs are puffy so that prevents him from moving as much. I pray this is normal. I love my Franklin.He hated the soft foam turtle dock and he also hated the turtle dock that sits on top of the tank. it's not even nice looking.So far this Novalek has been the winner of all docks!!! So, glad I purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had one previous, new quality is lower","review":"Had one of these ramps for almost three years, till all the grip finally wore off it from all the climbing.

Was expecting better quality since the first one was better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basking","review":"I have a large female turtle in a 55 gallon tank. I bought this for her since all the floating ones make her sink back into the water. It has been good. I have 2 complaints I have is that it slips off the suction cups and sinks into the water a little. It is easily fixed by putting them back on. Otherwise it does keep her out of the water so she can bask properly. I have had no problems with the tape coming off or her eating any part of it (though she does try).I received it as promised in 5 days. I would recommend this item, even with it slipping off the suctions cups it keeps her dry while basking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Farming the dangerous way","review":"Coming from Northern California (albeit 20 years ago), I am very familiar with Willits and home grown Humboldt Gold. I met those that attempted to cash in on the lushest crop of all and how they went about it. So, it was with amusement that I picked up this book and re-visited old territories and memories. (what I can remember, short term as they can be, and all.)This was an entertaining, quick trip back to then, although I never was brave enough to attempt to garden this cash crop of pot.

What could be more perfect?\\" I would have to agree with this sentiment. I thought this novel, Boyle's second, was extremely funny and one of his best. Very intelligent writing with some great characters and lots of humor. The story of 3 misfits trying to make a half million bucks by growing pot in the hills of Mendocino California, is not exactly what I thought it would be - it was much better. Boyle's stories never seem to disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Reading","review":"\\"How would you like to make half a million dollars, tax free?\\" From this point on the story is fantastic, one summer of growing ganja and all the troubles and paranoia that go with it.

The story is fast and well developed. It is a quite a trip. Jerpak and Aorta were unnecessary characters. The Jerpak person could literally be taken out of a cheap movie. Aorta does not add any value to the story from my point of view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as much fun as you may be lead to believe....","review":"I first read this about 10 years ago and enjoyed it. However, in revisiting it, I have found reading it to be a chore. For a novel that's supposed to be fun, there are a couple of major problems with it. The main character, Felix Nasmyth, is a rather self-absorbed, humorless and generally unlikable jerk. I found myself totally unable to sympathize with him. Also, there's such a pervasive sense of dread overshadowing the proceedings that it makes it hard to take as being very funny or enjoyable. Lastly, as another review mentioned, the book is way, way overshot with metaphor and entirely too showy. I am by and large a fan of Boyle's work, but he was trying way too hard here to prove how clever he can be, and as a result most of this comes off as overwrought. If I were to recommend reading something by Boyle to anyone, it would not be this. Go with World's End or Riven Rock first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metaphorical overkill","review":"This book was recommended by several friends of mine telling it was fun to read. After having rested on my shelves for quite some time I recently decided to give it a try. Although I read it through within a couple of days I have strong objections to recommend it to others. First of all, I soon started getting annoyed by the narrator's promiscuous use of metaphors and comparisons. There are far too many of them and they often seem to be inappropiate. Even if you consider that Felix has been a slacker student of English literature it feels like polishing a weak story with a 'literary touch'. Additionally, the characters are flat and after the first part it becomes clear that their 'American Dream' project will turn into a worst-case scenario."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Giante Utility Pump","review":"Purchased to keep rainwater from accumulating on the winter cover of our new pool.

So instead of continuing to opening the trap to let it drain ( and chancing a sewer back up) I tried to find a small profile pump with a auto trigger.After several hours of searching I decided on this one and it has worked great for the last month or so. It fits in the small space between my sewer pipe and the side wall of the trap which is a space of about 6\\" x 12\\" and 8\\" deep with a floor of muddy dirt and some rocks. It pumps water to a height of about 7' before exiting into my front garden using a standard garden hose. The pressure at the spout indicates that it could probably still pump out water to a height of 10'-12' with ease, possibly more. The trigger doesn't start it up until there is water a few inches above it's base but I don't have any problem with that.I have no cons to report as yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, good price","review":"I purchased this because I have a walk-up basement (enclosed) and the well kept filling up in very heavy rains and flooding my basement.

Plus riddles, laws, sections of the Chronicle -- quite enough to get a rounded picture of this fascinating literature, and all well translated.

I saw it late at night with my best friend, and it succeeded in making me lie awake far into the night. I'd reccommend this to anyone who loves a good thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"As described, very fast shipping. A+++","review":"I absolutely love this movie. At moments it can be confusing due to switches between the past and present. But I think this just adds to what Mima is feeling and how she deals with her life once she quits CHAM.

Anyway--look, Manga, I appreciate you releasing stuff like this in the UMD format. But it's absolutely unforgivable to release a prominent anime film with an English dub only. There's no technical reason to do it this way. We know from your Perfect Blue DVD release that you have access to both tracks. Even the copy of freaking Godzilla: Final Wars I have on UMD has both Japanese and English tracks. Why do it this way? I don't get it. Anyway, avoid unless you're unbothered by sterile English dubs."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!","review":"AMAZING is the best way to rate this movie.

Incredible.

It adds nothing to the \\"psycho-thriller\\" genre. I was utterly bored with it. As for the animation, it's far from top-notch. In fact, there's no reason for this film to be animated at all; it doesn't come close to using the medium to its potential. It's just a live-action film that happens to be animated, and the animation itself is very stiff and choppy.Hey, I'm a big fan of Ghost in the Shell and Princess Mononoke, amongst others. Perfect Blue doesn't compare to either of these seminal films..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow this movie .... don't waste your money.","review":"Have you ever noticed that all the movies reviews by Amazon have high ratings? ....

The overall animation is okay. But the character animation is horrible! Most of the characters look like fishes! But, the detail of backgrounds and settings is pretty good. What I thought the confusing parts were, that she keeps slipping into dreams. I sometimes could not tell which was which! This movie tries very hard to be realistic, but it fails. The soundtrack sucks too. You don't have to listen to this review, but this is how I truly felt. If you like movies where it is confusing and messed up, and eveything comes together at the end, but it still leaves you with questions, then rent this movie. But for everyone else, DO NOT BUY OR LOOK AT THIS MOVIE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Anime fiend","review":"Not long after i got married my husband turned me on to Anime (Inuyasha,Ranma,Berserk,Lain,Nadesico,Fruits Basket). Perfect Blue got such good reviews, I bought it for my husband for Christmas. We watched as soon as he opened it! The beginning was really lagging and i was getting really bored and easily distracted, that's why i gave it only 4 stars. Once the movie picked up the pace and got more interesting i was totally into it! It's a great movie and the characters are more life like than most Anime i'm used to watching! This wouldn't be my first choice, but i would recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If Hitchcock was alive today he'd DIE!","review":"Mina is a pop idol who decides to become an actress. A stalker feels that this is a bad decision. If I said any more then the picture would be ruined.One review states that if Hitchcock and Disney had teamed up they'd make a movie like this. 1. Disney was not this talented and 2. Hitchcock was not this inteligent.The animation is by far some of the most realistic I have seen in animie; from the movement of the characters to the detailed city scapes, everything is stunning.The story itself will leave you dazed and confused for days. It twists and turns so much that it's almost coma inducing. No matter how many times you think you have figured it out you are always given something new to think about.If you are a slasher-thriller fan then this will be a valued part of your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful and Intriguing Masterpiece","review":"This movie is probably the best Physchological-Thriller ever. Every scene gives the viewer a very vivid and realistic part of the character that makes you want to know more and more and just when you think that you know what the reality of the movie is you are on to a big surprise. It was very well done and the characters were very well composed by Satoshi Kon (the director)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Show","review":"No giant robots, no swordplay and no space battles but I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film.

I recommend this film to anyone who likes good movies as well as Anime fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Blue","review":"A great film with fluid animation and unique cuts.

Yes, it is somewhat suspensful, and yes there were a few thrills, but moreover, the emotional state of the main character is shoved in the viewer's face in such a whiney way that it's annoying. There's an creepy stalker, mental breakdown, and a walkthrough of the main gal's life. But honestly, in the end, this movie turns out to be nothing more than a Lifetime Orginial in cartoon form."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie but could deal w/out a couple of scenes","review":"I really like thrillers, espically psychological ones. I have never really been into the whole anima until I watched Ghost in the Shell. Very good movie but totally opposite from this. Perfect Blue deals with a pop-singer, turning into an actress. There were a couple of scenes in which I thougth they could have left out. But this movie had me hooked and guessing till the very end. I would recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"It IS perfect!!","review":"This movie is the most frightening mystery/thriller worthy of Alfred Hitchcock himself! The story itself is frightening on different levels. First you see Mima, who is not very sure of herself as a person and an aspiring celebrity. She's willing to sacrifice to hit the big time which leads her into several situations, including filming a disturbing rape scene for a movie (or a TV series, depending on the version you saw). Slowly and not so surely, you see the industry strip away pieces of Mima, which she clings to. This gets really bad as she starts seeing the \\"other Mima.\\"Then the murders take place. One by one people around Mima are being brutally and bloodily murdered. The climax and ending is spectacular as the mystery begins to unravel, and unlike lesser thought out movies, everything makes perfect sense throughout the madness and murders!"},{"rating":"2","title":"if only there were more stars to give...","review":"This was my introduction to anime. And what a great start. Animation wasn't hard on the eyes like some and the dubbing was good. at first, it could be just some movie about a pop idol. When she decides to become an actress and lands her first roll in a Law & Order: Special Victims Unit-style drama, she is thrown into a world of madness. A fan, angered by her choice to become an actress, begins stalking her and her mental state slowly deteriorates until at the end of the movie, she can't tell what's real or not. It's very well done. When she loses her mind, it's hard for the viewer to tell what's real or not along with her. It even has a awesome chase scene, and the plot twist at the end came out of nowhere - it will surprise anyone. I recommend you stop reading this review and go out right now to buy it. Definately one you'll watch more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"A best in anime...","review":"One of the few MUSTS, of anime video.Everything is just too \\"perfect\\" you need to see it yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvellous, this is a piece of Art. Two Thumbs up!","review":"This is really an anime la Hitchcock. Truthly, this is not the best anime I have seen. Actually, I am an anime fan and I have seen so many animes from Akira to Ghost in the Shell and Princess Mononoke. Nevertheless, Perfect Blue deserves a 5 stars. The reason is simple, a triller amongst anime, it's not dj vu. It changes a bit from the mechas, monsters with tentacles and complex stories I have seen before. I should say that this is the first anime triller I have seen so far and I really liked it, though I wanted it a bit longer. The art is good, the characters look nice, no comment on the soundtrack and the story will keep your mouth open for 1 hour plus. Anyway I stongly advice this anime whether you are a fan or not. It's really value for money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"This is a psychological thriller title that starts out strong, but unfortunately turns sour during the last 30 minutes. Movies with major plot twists can be great(sixth sense), but in this case, the dubbing job is so poorly done, it causes nothing but confusion. The english words they dubbed in must be completely wrong, because it started to make no sense whatsoever. It's fairly entertaining, but the end will leave you wondering \\"what's going on?\\". Watch only if you're very bored, or a major anime fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've seen better anime","review":"When I saw the preview of this movie, i was grabbed by the \\"original\\" plot. Although, it was a huge disappointment when I saw \\"Perfect Blue\\". I found it, a bad image for all women out there. The only reason that I truely got this was that it was based on a book. So, If it's based on a book then it must be good right?As a HUGE anime fan, I was truely bummed. I have seen the kind of anime where a lot of people would recommend,such as Ghost in the Shell,Lain,Princess Mononoke and others.

The MicroCon is great for children, and even works well for adults looking for that split-second improvement in responsiveness from less finger-travel time.Unfortunately, the Microcatz MicroCon for the Nintendo GameCube is a fragile product.

Some people have criticized the author for not being scholarly enough, but as he himself says in the book, this book was not written for that purpose. He's telling the story of 1066 and the Norman Conquest, and he does a darn good job. I myself get bored when I read so-called scholarly books that drum out the facts in a ho-hum fashion. I much prefer Howarth's friendly approach, and I greatly appreciate his opinions. It is up to the reader whether to agree with him or not. I for one also feel that had I been alive at the time, I too would have like Harold, disliked King Edward, and been terrified of William. I suggest you read and buy this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"before all theothers on 1066 read this first","review":"Howarth's book has not only held up well over the decades I actually think it improves each time I read it. Along with Alaistair Horne's incredible Price of Glory about Verdun in 1916 I am not sure there is a better \\"short\\" history of an event. They remain my high water marks for what history should and could be. Treat yourself to both, Howarth has great charm and writes with an ease as to be almost magical while Horne will knock your socks off- WW1 has been utterly forgotten; read Horne and you will learn why it is a disgrace that we no longer teach history in any depth, from elementary school through college."},{"rating":"2","title":"Royal intrigue at its best","review":"This is royal intrigue at its best: the passing of a king with no heirs (Edward the Confessor), the mysterious coronation of a possible usurper (Harold Godwin), an angry distant cousin with legitimate claims to the throne (William, Duke of Normandy), a failed plot to overthrow and, ultimately, the taking of the throne by force at the Battle of Hastings. In 1066, William the Conqueror, Duke of Normandy -- a Frenchman -- became King William I of England. David Howarth tells the story in a readable, engaging way. He explores the subtleties of the traditional accounts and reveals nuances of the characters. Howarth offers conjecture about the motives and emotions of the characters. Some might say that he offers too much conjecture. For me, though, this was a valuable part of the book. Seeing his empathy for some characters and dislike of others, helped me to better understand the writer and his message."},{"rating":"2","title":"What more can I say","review":"There is nothing I can add to the many positive reviews that have already been posted here ... except that, this should be compulsory reading for all people, if they are interested in history or not.

Besides that there is little in common with West Coast rap. It's more like Super Furry Animals decided to make a rap comedy album. \\"Self Suicide\\" makes fun of all the dead pop stars. One of the more inspired songs is \\"Guns Don't Kill People, Rappers Do.\\" This has everything great about a GLC tune. Other songs seem like comedy routines. Some of the classics are \\"Your Mother's Got A Penis\\" and \\"The Maggot.\\" Much of this album derives its comedy from excessive drinking and excessive weed smoking. This is a funny album. But is it more like listening to Cheech and Chong than a proper band. Who cares?"},{"rating":"2","title":"GLC","review":"Great fun time band, it is a great joke.

He has never used an electric razor before saying that he did not like them because they do not get a good shave. He also has sensitive skin and after he would shave his skin would be red and it would hurt. His face looked terrible and forget about shaving in the evening after work if we were going somewhere nice. I got him this because of the money back policy. He used it and loves it. His face looks great and the shave is very close just like the disposable razors. His face is no longer red and he can shave in the evenings if we are going somewhere nice even after he shaved in the morning. The lotion last a long time. He got ten packets and still as of the end of august still has not used them all and I gave it to him in the middle of June. He loves it and would never use anything else. They say to give it 3 weeks. You do not need that long after a week my husband looked great and he loved it.

Westerners keep referring to Greek Philosophy as is it was the cradle of \\"Enlightened Thought.\\" Here Mr Burns again shows his bias of the actual cradle of Enlightenment which was India. He mentions Epictetus, Socrates and even Shakespeare as if they were the originators of Enlightened, Introspective thought. While failing to so much as consider the teachings of Buddha who spoke about everything these mental midgets repeated 500 years after his death.

I used this book when it first came out in the late 80's I believe. It was very helpful then and now as well. But you must do the work! Or it's useless, like any other self help book!

If you want to go through life believing things that are objectively untrue, cognitive behavioral therapy is for you. But does pretending to have a different reaction to circumstances beyond your control actually help in the long run? Because that's what CBT is all about: pretending, repressing, sticking your finger in the dike to hold the flood back a little longer. There is absolutely no scientific proof that it works, period. (Google \\"limits of cognitive behavioral therapy\\" and \\"why cognitive behavior therapy doesn't work\\".)CBT is nonsense.

If we can get past our feeling of depression or sadness, the actual pain might be much less. This is the basic gist of this fantastic book. I bought it 8 years ago when I was having a very rough time with depression.As I read the book I became more hopeful and it helped me rethink my disorder. Today I am no longer depressed and I think that it might be in part to what I read in this book. You must still get a Psychiatrist to help you with therapy in that you should not go it alone. However, you can not always be with your therapist and healthy attitudes and feelings will help you in the interim. It helps with proven CBT methods on recognizing the feelings and not assigning them any weight. Very powerful tool for when your depressed, also when you are feeling good.If you or someone you love has depression and are willing to read something that may help, please try this book.Thank you for reading my review."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK","review":"This book is amazing.

Nonetheless, correcting negative thought patterns is an important part of undoing depression, especially mild depression. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"his claims are too universal","review":"Some people make decisions according to how they think; their thoughts give rise to their feelings. Such people might like this book. More power to them. For me and for many others, it is the other way around: feelings give rise to thoughts. In order for \\"feelers\\" to overcome problems, we need empathy. Being told we're thinking the wrong way just exacerbates the feeling of being wrong. Also, like other reviewers, I found that the book seemed unedited, rambling, and repetitive. I'm glad some have found it beneficial. I benefit more from dealing with feelings before thoughts."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I thought","review":"I was hoping to have a practical workbook to get a better idea about cognitive behavior therapy and the effects of dysfunctional thinking, but this is more of a reading book that can be quite boring at times. While it gives examples of some of Dr Burns patients, it fails to provide practical application. I gave up on it exactly halfway through the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Invaluable Resource for Depressives","review":"I think Feeling Good has been AS valuable as therapy and medication both for my seasonal depression and my one bout of severe clinical depression during which I was suicidal. I don't see Dr. Burns as disputing the notion that depression has a physical component (i.e. brain chemistry) but he addresses the modes of thinking that amplify that effect and worsen our depression. It's obvious to me from reading the book repeatedly that he advocates throwing everything you've got at severe depression. Given that you can't be in the therapy office 24/7, the book is for those times when you are alone with the critical and self destructive voice in your head. Changing that voice to work for you instead of against you is what his book is all about.Depression may start with brain chemistry, but under the influence of that chemistry we develop self destructive patterns of thought. While we address the chemistry we cannot ignore the other half of the equation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book! My Psychologist recommends it!","review":"I started therapy a few months ago after having been diagnosed with depression. My doctor recommended that I read Dr. Burns' book. I was skeptical at first. I wasn't sure how this book could help me. But I was willing to try. Once I picked it up I could almost not put it down. It has been an incredibly useful aid for my journey out of depression. As I read through it I found the examples to be incredibly reassuring. However, I think that the exercises are the most useful part of the book. The exercises have been the ammunition in my personal fight to conquer depression. This book has helped me change my life in a wide variety of ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tremendous confidence booster ,yes I can rejoin the living","review":"Thank you David Burns.

My copy of this book was published in 1980 and I refer back to it a couple of times a year as a refresher. I found great value in his 10 cognitive distortions list and have used them to catch myself in mid-thought and really begin to see how I put myself on the path to depression. The advice in this section of his book is timeless and useful. I have never done all the exercises and I have never used his wrist counter idea. Others may find it helpful or not.

Now, I just feel silly for having done the exercises. I find the attempts to respond to distorted thoughts within Burns' therapeutic framework even more unnatural and distorted than the original thoughts themselves.What was effective was applying these techniques under the guidance of a CBT therapist. But,once the therapy ended, so did the benefits. For me it all comes down to the notion that if you are looking for argument and dialectic that satisfies at a deeper level, then this \\"quick fix\\" therapy is not the right one for you.An additional note: Burns' writing does not appeal to the imagination or the intellect. In the interest of achieving universal clarity, he seems to dumb everything down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb book!","review":"Basically all it says is, \\"In order to feel good don't be sad.\\" NO KIDDING!

It's a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, includes proactive assignments, could be better","review":"An excellent read with powerful therapeutic techniques and examples to change your attitude. Although I give it 4 stars, it could be better. Dr. Burns talks about getting back a lost relationship way too much and implies that your own communication skills and attitude are the reason for the breakup. The book does not address the underlying feeling of what happened to you in your past that generated the flawed thinking that you want to change. However, this is a very good tool for anyone who needs an attitude adjustment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful for almost anyone","review":"I learned of this book from a friend in counseling for depression and was curious. I read it and go back to it from time to time. It helped me to battle the negative thought habits that interfere will full enjoyment of life. There is a chapter on anger that I feel would be helpful to almost anyone. The chapter on underlying beliefs that set one up for depression was also excellent and thought provoking.. The review of antri depressents was also very interesting. This book will not be enough help or someone struggling with clinical depression, but I think it would be a good tool for therapy. For people who battle low level depression from time to time, it's got some good exercises and advice. I highly recommend it for almost anyone as a way to deepen understanding of what leads to depression."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Works","review":"This book was recommended by my therapist re low self-esteem. I went out and immediately bought it and have not put it down since. When I wake up at 3 or 4 in the morning feeling low or when I feel alone in the world I pick it up and read it. And I always walk away with a new understanding in my behaviour and with new insights on how to repair the damage already done. I'm also learning how not to let new negativity enter my life.

It has made a profound difference in my perspective and in my ability to see things for what they truly are and not for what I perceive them to be.

This is THE consumer-level book for Cognitive Behavior Therapy.The basic premise behind this school of therapy, is that thoughts lead to feelings, and feelings lead to thoughts, causing a feedback loop. If you change your thoughts, your feelings will also change.This has been as successful as medication in clinical treatments for depression and anxiety.I didn't even have to finish this book to find relief. I identified the negative thoughts and self-images I had (one by one because there were many) replacing them with positive thoughts. Most of the depression/anxiety went away quickly.Over the years, I've had to find the more subtle, clandestine thoughts, and replace them, too.A great book, recommended to anyone suffering from chronic emotional pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"A huge help","review":"This book was recommended to me.

I say, \\"Show me somebody with a 'persistent willingness to exert some effort' and I will show you somebody who does NOT have major depressive disorder\\". So where does that leave the rest of us?The subtitle of this book is, \\"The Clinically Proven Drug-free Treatment for Depression\\", yet my 'Revised and Updated' copy published in 1999 also states, \\"Now with the all-new consumer's guide to antidepressant drugs...\\" which seems very discordant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank goodness","review":"I bought this book for my 17 yr old daughter who had refused therapy since going through depression. She has raved about this book and how much she has learned about herself and the resources that are available when she needs them.

Because the book got so many good reviews, I thought it must have been written by God himself. It wasn't. Some of the optimism presented in the book seems just a tad unrealistic to me. Incidentally, the book was written by the same person who wrote \\"Ten Days to Self-Esteem\\" which I think is very unrealisitc. Dr. Burns seems to live in a world where ugliness and stupidity do not exist, or at least where they can be renamed something like \\"differently beautified\\" or \\"differently talented\\".

I've read several of Burns' books. He's a good writer, and I am sure that many find CBT helpful. However, my guess is that the chief advantage of CBT is that it teaches depressed persons how to mask their depression. I believe that CBT's techniques simply add a layer of positive thinking on top of an underlying depression. The patient learns to give the kinds of answers that the therapist wants to hear. I'd be grateful to hear from others about their experiences with CBT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book","review":"Basically its the Norman Vincent Peale concept of the Power of Positive thinking. I know it sounds simple but it works. The book is definitely worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Incredibly Simplistic Book","review":"I read this book in the early 90s. It was incredibly simplistic. One piece of advice I recall was that to be popular you should imitate popular people. But what if you don't like the REASONS that some people are popular?CBT seems to work well for people who don't have significant problems, who aren't terribly reflective or analytical and who have a lot of resources, especially money. If you actually have serious problems of longstanding, you're not going to be able to out-think your problems.Your depression may not be the result of dwelling on the negative or exaggerating bad outcomes. You may be in a genuinely bad state. The CBT approach is a sophisticated form of blaming-the-victim."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"Dr Burns seems to have the god complex that most psychiatrists suffer from. He makes it sound like he is so gifted and intelligent, while the reader is simply stupid. If it wasn't for the writing style I might have found this book atleast interesting if not at all helpful. For some people prehaps his approach works but for sensitive, feeling individuals this book is a constant put down, telling you how your thinking is wrong and bad. The cover is also misleading, its obviously not drug free when the last third of the book is devoted entirely to explainations of drugs. I'm interested to know if anyone actually followed his suggestion of the wrist clicker, since depressed people already feel different enough they really don't need to walk around clicking away at their wrist to exaggerate the feeling. Overall, I'm very sorry I wasted my money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"book","review":"I got half-way through this before I tossed it from the examples of a woman blaming herself for her husband's adultery.

I think that this book is okay for an adult audience which suffers from, at most, moderate depression.

I've been severely depressed for 2 years, and this was the first book I read for depression, and I did a lot of work with it. Well, id did help me, but may be only 15%. The author applies that we can change our way of thinking, well, some of it but not everything. There're some things that we can't change because we live in a society with its own values and expectation, and we can't become completely ignorant toward some things that we've believed in all our life, and in which people who surround us believe in it, too.

This is not true. For those that understand that no one has a cure-all method to mental health Dr. Burns writings offer some good principles that help people learn how they perceive the world and how that effects their mental state. These principles do work, I have used them and found them to be good tools for working through my problems with other people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book buying customer","review":"My shrink suggested I buy Feeling Good so I did. It's a good book that has obviously been written by someone who's done a lot of research on the subject of depression. But that's the problem, for me it's too much research.The book is longer than a depressed person has patience to read. It's over 700 pages and all that is packaged in a small paperback. All I want is the results of the research not hundreds of pages of studies and survays and research. I know it's good to know all this stuff but as a depressed person I don't really care about it. All I'm interested in is in dealing with the depression. Bottom line, I havn't finished the book yet because it's too much like a text book and that's hardly what I need.Other than that, as I say, it's a good book with a lot of information if you have time to either read it all or try and find the info you're looking for without putting it away for later."},{"rating":"1","title":"If your problems are due to negative thinking alone...","review":"...then this very upbeat book by Dr. Burns can indeed help. But I very much doubt the central thesis that thoughts control feelings and that substituting positive for negative thought patterns is the key to happiness.One telling omission in Burns' book is how to cope with ill health, especially where medicine has no answers. It would seem to me that if there is any area that could serve as a test bed for Burns' thesis that thinking is the key to \\"feeling good\\", this would be it. And yet there is nothing here on subjects like coping with chronic pain.To be sure, one can in fact cultivate self-defeating and negative thoughts and attitudes, and if that is your issue, this book can be very helpful. But if you are looking for something more profound in combating serious depression or other emotional travails, I'd advise you to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book has changed my life","review":"I'm a 29 year old male who has had depression since middle school. I've always been the tough guy, not seeking help because I should be able to fix my problems myself. When I couldn't, and finally got up the courage to get help, a doctor recommended this book. It has literally changed my life. I now know what it feels like to be normal, to be able to do the things I've always wanted to do, but was always too depressed to do. I couldn't possibly recommend this book more. I don't know if it will work for everyone, but it sure worked for me.

I've been to three therapists and could intellectually understand the tenets of cognitive behavioral therapy, but was not absorbing them at all. However, Dr. Burns' book changed that. Somehow, seeing the thoughts that you thought were your own unique brand of horribleness written out there in black and white, without the added stress of doubting the therapist, made everything that was going on in your life crystal clear. The best part is that the identification of these negative thoughts is paired with the tools to combat them. Anyone suffering from anxiety or depression would do well to keep this book around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I expected","review":"I was instructed by a counselor to order and read this book. So far, it is helpful. I was pleased with its condition and the promptness in delivery."},{"rating":"2","title":"...a valuable component of a complete treatment program.","review":"In conjunction w/ medication and therapy, this book helped me turn my life around. I found the exercises valuable and they have provided insight that I still find myself using on a recurring basis. I have now been depression- and medication-free for several years. I credit Dr Burns' book with playing a significant role in my recovery.{non-disclaimer: I have no connection with either the books' publisher, Amazon.com, or the medical/pharmaceutical industry.}"},{"rating":"2","title":"Will be required in my utopian society.","review":"If I ever start a Utopian Society of some sort, there will be three prerequisites to citizenship. First, automobile drivers over 80 will need to retake their driving test every year. Second, lime-flavored candies are replaced with apple-flavored ones (limes, however, will be provided with every club soda purchase), and third, you must read this book! By reading and understanding this book, I understood so much about myself which I had taken to be intrinsic... I have learned to control my moods and emotions... Dr. Burns makes sense in his writing. Clarity of writing and practical, real-life-situation application makes this book a must for anyone who knows someone (or is themselves) dealing with anxiety or depression."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry read and condescending","review":"Having gone through dialectical behavior therapy (similar to cognitive behavior therapy) and reading other books, I can say this isn't the best resource. First, it was a dry read for me. I couldn't finish the book.I would recommend the Dialectical Behavior Therapy Workbook instead to help you make concrete changes in your life to help you create a happier life. Of course, it can be embarrassing to carry around a large workbook that screams \\"I go to therapy because I have lots of problems\\".So another more \\"socially acceptable\\" book is Happier by Tal Ben-Shahar. He writes from a personal perspective and isn't condescending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to Follow","review":"While the ideas presented in this book are good, it is very difficult to follow and absorb. There is too much technical jargon. It would have been much more helpful if it had been written in a much simpler way. While trying to already sift through all our emotions and thoughts, we don't need more to have to try to figure out. Never finished the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the book for beginners","review":"This book was nothing but a let down.As a novice PS user, I found the instructions to be sadly lacking with steps left out, and directions that just didn't work.I had assumed from the name--Teach Yourself Adobe Photoshop 7--that the book would be geared to beginners. It wasn't. Maybe if I had used PS 6 or the like in the past I would have known, for example, that step 1, 2 and 3 were implied and that the author was starting at step 4. As it was, I was just confused.I also wonder if the book wasn't rushed into print too fast without the needed editing. There were quite a few techniques that I followed (many times) step by step that just did not work the way the author said they did.All in all, I would recommend that anyone interested in learning Photoshop do what I'm doing now and find a better instructional book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glaring Omission","review":"As I have been wading through this book for the past week, I have found it more and more difficult to understand. This book's glaring omission in my opinion is its lack of physical graphic images that I can manipulate. We need to see before-and-after examples done with our own hands that explain what she is talking about. The first image that you can download on line is well into chapter 3. I got the most frustrated with the \\"Cut and Paste\\" section in chapter 3 which had no photos on line for me to recreate with her, and her explanation of how to Paste was non-existent. It was at this point that I decided to move on to another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mistake ...","review":"... even after reading the above reviews I decided to give this book a shot. Bad idea. There are a few typos in the book that are annoying, but not really enough to lead you completely astray. Unfortunately that is about as good as the book gets. There is a complete lack of really good visual aids, diagrams, pics, and step by step \\"how-to's\\". Carla Rose also will use terminology that isn't explained until later on, making things more confusing. Additionally all the screen shots are in Mac, not Windows, which may or may not effect the examples. This book is not for the beginner. I would look else where."},{"rating":"1","title":"agreed, too much left out or just glossed over","review":"Steps omitted, no visuals for icons and also mentioning a feature and then saying nothing else about it.

Photshop is a fully featured program for professionals. This book spends way too much time on filters that you won't normally use and not enough time on what you really need. I went out & bought the book right after I got the program a few weeks ago. At the time it was all that I could find, but it has little or no info on creating & using actions, styles or macros. It doesn't teach you the fast ways to do tasks. I learned a bunch more from The Photoshop Wow book which also has a CD of really great styles & actions. Photoshop 7 Down & dirty tricks is also great."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is terrible","review":"Maybe the so called expert thinks this book is a 5 Star but take it from a novice, this book is absolutely terrible.

This is my opinion and that is why I am returning this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Must Get One!","review":"This book is never leaving my sewing room (unless I'm holding it while reading elsewhere)! There are no photos, just illustrations, but they are well done and clear (I'm probably rated at an advanced beginner to intermediate sewer, so not a total newbie). The book covers a lot of different techniques with step by step instructions that make sense. Chapters include pockets, underlinings/linings/interlings, collars, zippers, sleeves, hems, seams, facings, buttonholes and closures, and more! I wanted a book that covered more than just basic sewing and this is definitely it. If you are totally new to sewing, get this one and DK's The Complete Book of Sewing and you'll be well set. My mom, who used to make ballet costumes and suits, even thought this was a good one to have (might have to find her a copy sometime) This book should be in every sewer's collection for those times when you need a review or just to learn how to do something. Track down a copy for yourself, it is worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not such a good book","review":"I guess back in 1981 this book was a good reference, but sewing has changed. This book addresses none of this new stuff. First, there are fancy new notions now that make sewing faster and easier. Second, sergers are now in the home market. And lastly, color photos (although they existed then) are now in MOST good sewing books and readily available. This book is outdated and I am sorry I bought it. (Thank goodness used for only a few bucks. You get what you pay for.)The author's techniques are not shortcuts, but are the standard in sewing techniques. Nothing new here. The book is filled with illustrations, although most sewing techniques described do not have an accompanying drawing.Get a better book (or books) like the Easy Guide sewing series instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda dull -- don't know why others like it!","review":"Well, she's thorough, that's for sure. Every possible sewing technique is covered here. But with only line drawings for relief, it's kinda tedious to get through. Maybe if you just wanted to look up particular techniques. Her other books are great, but this one really leaves me cold."},{"rating":"2","title":"revealing informative but conventional","review":"The so called FAX ROMANA which encompass a period of relative peace in Roman empire did not last very long as barbarians from different directions interminently raided the empire and coupled with the decadent and incompetent reigns of suceeding emperors contributed to the eventual collapse.What the book said is well knowned by even secondary students of world history.but the thorough presentation and careful chronological analyses provided by the author is helpful for contemporary political scientists of today who look back at our cultural past for guidance in trying to understand our present."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christian theology bias subverts veracity","review":"After reading about half of this book the author's blatant pro-Christian bias became so obvious that I could not continue. The continued use of date references using BC/AD instead of the more scholarly BCE/CE notation is a minor detail but is only the beginning. Frequent references to time periods \\"before the birth of Christ\\", explications of Christian doctrinal positions to illuminate various events and decisions, and biblical quotes assuming literal truth all provide ample evidence to doubt the objectivity and historical accuracy of this author. This \\"New History\\" adds nothing of value to the exciting field analyzing the history of the Roman Empire and its collapse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barbarian influences in late Roman civ","review":"A very detailed and insightful analysis of the influences andcomplex interactions of various outside groups entering andmixing with the classical Roman pop. The author apparently hasa superior knowledge about the Tribal migrations, and how theyimpacted the overstretched Bureaucracy of the late Empire. Iespecially liked the focus on some of the more interesting andimportant characters of this period, ie., Stilicho,Constantiusand Aetius, but I would have liked more detail about the roleTheodosius played post Adrianople in keeping the wolves at bay,Also his relationship with Ambrose and the risingpower of chrisyianity. I also thought the influence ofchristianity in weakening the Empire was downplayed a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drawing order out of the descent into chaos","review":"Nearly everyone \\"knows\\" about the \\"fall of the Roman Empire\\". This is the first work I have read (not having the stamina to finish Gibbons) that explains just what happened. Working with always inadequate source material, but helped by the results of 20th Century archeology, Heather gives us a fascinating and plausible narative of the one hundred years that saw the end of the Roman Empire in the west, and the beginning of the Middle Ages. A little long, and a bit too detailed for a layman (after all, Heather is a professor writing in the first place for other academics), but still well worth reading for anyone interested in Roman history, or for that matter, in the anarchy which is always waiting out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent book, unacceptable Kindle edition","review":"I read the paper edition; it was very good. I'll not go into a review of it, plenty of others have, but as an authority of both the late Roman and late Barbarian periods, Heather brings many recently-revealed facts to light with superb analysis.I used the Kindle app on the iPad to re-read this. Implementation was very poor. The text is marred with randomly-distributed italicized and underlined passages. I can work around these annoyances, but what I cannot work with are the maps. Even when expanded, they are unreadable. The scans are very poor. This makes the book very nearly useless. I want my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learning the Lessons from History","review":"A very enjoyable read, considering this is a substantial work with a wealth of background information and thoughtful analysis. I find the parallels between Rome and the modern world to be fascinating. The trick with a huge subject like this is to break it down into manageable chunks in a logical way. The new angle in this work is the focus on the \\"barbarians\\" - and there the author's theories make a lot of sense. If you like historical works, this one is recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every CEO's Manual","review":"Most company failures come as a surprise to management and shareholders alike. The downdraft is often sudden and devastating -- think Bear Stearns -- but Peter Heather shows C-Level executives everywhere a new way to think about what can happen and the ways it can happen.The collapse of Rome is like the failure of so many high-cost companies today under assault from many small, low-cost alternatives. They don't often see it coming until its too late, like the recording industry (Rome) so quickly dismembered by Apple (Goths etc).Heather's great book is every CEO's necessary book. A super lesson in what can happen if you don't understand the structure of your markets. Don't manage your company without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative and Entertaining","review":"Was a last-minute Christmas gift. This is a really fascinating book, well-written and easy to read and follow. The author (a Brit) employs a little dry humor and uses explanations that make sense to the 21st century reader. Really does a great job bringing the major personalities and events to life. Also makes it clear where the historical records are a bit thin and applies suitable analysis of similar events to draw logical conclusions. Also provides some interesting food for thought (to this reader at least) about the direction and possible destination of our own modern 'empire.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Kindle Edition","review":"Superb book, but absolutely ruined by the horrible transcription of the book to Kindle format. Maps are blurry, even at normal size, so forget enlarging. And maps are critical to following the text of the book. I am very upset."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Review of the IPO Process","review":"This is a great book.

Yesterday I clicked desperately for 15 minutes trying to get ready for church.

I have to return because it ruins the whole product. Beware, I also went to Target and that is how they are making them now. They need to correct the picture.

I guess it's supposed to help keep your hair on the hot part. But in actuality it means you can't pull the iron down through the curls unless you lift up on the handle thing.

I picked it because of the many heat settings. My hair curls super easily and holds a curl for days so I wanted really, really low heat to prevent damage to my hair. For some reason, even at the lowest setting this was way, way too hot. I want a setting that won't burn my fingers when I touch it. I'm thinking it may have been defective.

The second album by Into Another is their crowning acheivment, mixing Post-Hardcore and Maiden-like metal to come up with something unique. This album slows down the pace compared to their first outing _Into Another_ with 2 acoustic tracks and more mid-tempo rockers. Richie Birkenhead shines on this album with his high register vocals. He sings about haunted ghost ships, deceased war-heroes and much more. Some of the highlights on this album are Poison Fingers which has shouted vocals behind crushing riffs. Drowning features a great mid tempo gallopy riff and has a spacey atmosphere to it. Lastly, Anxious is an acoustic track and a great way to close out this album. It has an amazing bassline and has interesting lyrics about wanting to be another creature. If you ever see this album in stores (very hard to find) pick it up.

Catchy melodies mixed with sincere, intelligent, and poetic lyrics make Ignaurus a staple on the CD rack of anyone who knows what's up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun play for my 22 month old daughter!","review":"Wonderful addition to the dollhouse for role play and loves to play independently with it now too.

I bought the dollhouse from Amazon, but the individual rooms are extremely overpriced here! Same price for one room as for the entire house? Are you kidding?!!Go to Walmart or Fisher Price website for the accessories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't belive everything you read","review":"Man, this album has some bad reviews.Ok, this album would have been much more highly acclaimed if it had come out in 1983, instead of 1989, but i still really like it. This album IS 80'S SYNTH POP! It is not the same techno stuff that Underworld released in the 1990's. These guys have been around for a long time. Back in 1984 (or maybe 83) they Karl Hyde and Rick Smith were in a band called Freur. They made cheesy 80's music. Maybe you might remember a song called \\"Doot Doot\\". That's them! Or \\"Hey Ho Away We Go\\" or \\"Devil in Darkness\\". This 80's music continues with Underworld's first 2 albums, Underneath the Radar and Change the Weather.This album is good though. I like it better than Underneath the Radar (which often gets much better reviews), and would highly recommend it to anyone that's a fan of 80's pop music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do you like synth pop??????","review":"I know it seems like a good idea to buy this album because it's a rare, early Underworld, right??? Believe me, it's not a very good idea. This isn't techno, it's weird, silly, laughable synth pop directly from the closing credits of a back to the future movie. Believe me, i love Underworld, but this is not Underworld, at least not the Underworld that anyone likes. Karl Hyde dubbed the first version of Underworld \\"Mach One\\". Believe me, theres a reason that they weren't popular.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underworld doesn't even like this album","review":"If you love that unique techno sound that Underworld is known for, be forwarned- THIS ALBUM DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY OF IT! I'd only recommend this album to those who are really into 80's synth pop, and even then, not so much. This album was produced before Darren Emerson was added to the group. I even read in a magazine article that Darren hasn't even listen to any songs in their entirety because he thought it was so lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mistaken . .

I do NOT think so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good 80's Music","review":"Bought this when it came out based on liking Underneath the Radar quite a bit. I thought it was pretty good and some of the songs really grew on me, but overall, not as good as Underneath the Radar. Two songs that I still enjoy from time to time are Fever and Sole Survivor. One review called it a combination of the Cure and Depeche mode. That's a pretty good description in my opinion. A little bit of the darkness of the Cure mixed with the atmospherics of Depeche Mode. If you like 80's music, this is a pretty good album. If not, well then you probably won't like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Under....NAH, that CAN'T be them","review":"Whoah, this is HORRIBLE, sounds like some odd cross between The Cure and Depeche Mode...I gotta say that if this was the first bit of music I'd ever heard from Underworld I would have NEVER liked them. Get Dubnobasswithmyheadman....trust me, this IS NOT what they sound like!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is This The Same Band?","review":"I bought this CD based on the first few reviews here on Amazon. The CD is a selection of horrible 80s music. I've never even let the songs play all the way through because they are so BAD. Think I paid something like $10 for it here on Amazon and now can't get rid of it for more than $3.25. Now that's a bad investment. Save your money unless you want to buy it from me dirt cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back when Underworld was Underworld","review":"This is one of my favorite albums. I aquired my first copy about ten years ago for $1.99 from a liquidation store. I'd have bought all the copies if I'd known what I was buying. All I have to say is this album is great. It has great bass lines and tempo despite what someone from Oregon said. I'm Glad to see it re-released so now I don't have to worry so much about my original copy. If you like these guys Check out Freur, the original Underworld."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same band as of today.","review":"This is not the same Underworld you might think. There is no hint at techno-rock. The style is remniscent of early 80's flock of seagull's.I love Underworld don't get me wrong, they are one of my favorite groups. But this CD is not even good by 80's standards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should own this album.","review":"This album is great. Underworld before their sound went down the techno toilet. Good lyrically and melodically. Underworld is proof that even the best bands can make mistakes. Unfortunately Underworld just keeps on making them by releasing the worthless electronica for which they are now known."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nominated!","review":"yup.

Amazon came through with a good price and free shipping!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the Point?","review":"I really do not see the point of spending a lot of money and effort on a water distiller that empties itself into a plastic receptacle. The purpose of a distiller is to remove toxins and other impurities, and all available evidence indicates that there is a risk of reintroducing toxins into the water through the plastic storage container.

The rest of the family loved the water so much that I often ran out--couldn't make it fast enough for all the weightlifters in the family. The main culprit (20-year-old) is going away to school next year so he asked for a Waterwise for Christmas. The spout design is a minor annoyance (you must pull the spring-loaded spout cover back with your thumb or it spills), but we minimize spillage by pouring it immediately into a BPA-free counter container with a spigot. Looks like the 9000 avoids that problem as you can just switch out the bottles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy with model 8800","review":"I've had to replace the steam pipe six times in the past 4 years 2 months. Currently, the distiller is leaking/losing equal to 1 inch of water in carafe. Water accumulates in the upper chamber above the kettle/boiler where the fan is located. Water and electricity don't mix. Not a good sign. Pain in the neck to ship for repairs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy From Waterwise!","review":"Waterwise has an awful customer service and does not stand by their products. I spent hundreds of dollars on this distiller just 4 years ago and it broke down twice, costing me 80 dollars each time for repair and shipping. The second time they actually sent it back broken and leaking. They did not agree to repair it for free after they made it worse.I am not giving them another cent, so it's going into the trash.I'll now buy one from another company. A while back their shower filter cracked on me after just 2 years and they wouldn't stand by that either.

That kind of thinking will contribute to ever minimizing girls and women. Why not have featured a girl protagonist and worked a little harder to have made that character interesting to both boys and girls?"},{"rating":"1","title":"ANYPLACE Is A Great Place To Read!","review":"No no no! This author has the premise all wrong.

A boy's unstable mother drops him off at his recently-resurface, inexplicitly rich great uncles' place. What's the truth behind all that dough?

The ending was also a bit heavy-handed. We didn't need to be clouted over the head like that to see that Hub and Garth were just who they claimed to be. But the powerful central theme of the story comes through loud and clear. And it is that way because of the really good acting put in by Osment, Duvall, and Caine. NOBODY plays the old curmudgeon better than Robert Duvall - watch Open Range and you can see him in this role again. Caine counterbalances him very well, and Osment's acting as the bewildered youngster just blew me away. This movie is a really great family movie with action, adventure, eccentric old dudes, and true love that never dies. I have no problem recommending this for anyone and will likely buy this one for my home collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"Reviewer is much mistaken...sweetness and molasses? forget that!Two very eccentric brothers raise their great nephew. The men are complete unconventional; have retired from living a life of great adventure.So they find their own adventures, albeit not as death defying as in their younger days, and we, the viewer are greatly entertained. Never a dull moment!Love Robert Duvall, Michael Caine, and Haley Joel Osmet. Wonderful casting"},{"rating":"2","title":"Family or Couples Entertainment","review":"Secondhand Lions is one of the best American family films to present itself in years. One can recommend it as a feel-good film for the entire family and even for a fine date-night choice, regardless of the age of the viewing couple. Tim McCanlies has written an intricate, heart-warming story with as much action as the viewer could possibly want, and has cast his film with perfect actors for these well-drafted characters, including some marvelous dogs, a pig, and a lioness. We cheer the flawless performances of stars we have loved for years, and applaud the emergence of lesser known players such as Christian Kane, a delight on the current TV series, Leverage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Secondhand Lions movie DVD","review":"Very touching and heartfelt movie of hope beyond the horizon, and just how much of an impact certain people can have on someone's life.

Walter (Osment) goes to stay with his rich great-uncles, Garth and Hub (Caine and Duvall) whom he has never met, after his mother (Kyra Sedgewick) runs off.

This is a film that you will remember. The actors are excellent, and the significance is very real- broken families, mothers who aren't really there, ostracism, finding a family, growing up, respecting and revering older ones, and you may find more themes. As a Language Arts teacher, and one that understands most of my students don't come from the conventional family, I plan on perhaps sharing this film with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"A great movie about a boy lied to by his mother.

A few of the other reviews here almost convinced me to pass up the opportunity to see this delightful movie. Sure, it was sentimental at times, but it added to the charm....it is a movie after all and should be viewed as a pleasurable escape. I've since looked at the reviews again, and noticed that the reviewer who was the harshest critic, needed spellcheck... that says it all. Michael Caine and Robert Duvall were at their usual best.

First, the story is unbelievable. Haley Joel Osment is an annoying whiny little kid who's voice cracks all the time. And who stores paper cash down in the basement of a barn?

Don't waste your money like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you people watching the same movie I did?","review":"This is a bad attempt at making an independent seeming movie from Hollywood. Haley Joel Osment couldn't act in this movie at all, or was he just retarted? The dogs were cute, but seemed like an afterthought to try to get something memorable in this film. Please leave the good film making to Miramax and the others who know how to do it, Hollywood! The writers seemed to be using some template to write this movie. Have some off-beat characters do some whacky stuff, have something bad happen, have a happy ending, insert cute dog here. Robert Duvall was great, of course, Michael Cain, whatever! Don't believe the hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"Walter has not had an easy life, now at the age of 14, his mother decides he should spend the summer with his two eccentric uncles, who at first are anything but pleased to have him, but that will change.Soon Walter finds out his uncles are not the norm, as he hears stories of adventures that he wonders if they could really be true.It doesn't really matter however, Walter enjoys the stories, true or not. A bond grows between the men and this young boy and this turns into one of the most heart-warming movies I have had the pleasure to view in a long time.If you want to feel good all over,and walk away with a smile, please see this movie. Packed full of adventure, drizzled with humor and sliced with just the right amount of emotional pulls at your heartstrings, Secondhand Lions is a winner. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best family movie in a very long time.","review":"I don't get movies for my kids very often. I think most of them are way too hyped up and intense. Most \\"kids\\" movies I've seen lately have comedy that is embarrassing to me to watch with my kids. Second Hand Lions was so refreshing.

I hope we see more like this on the shelves soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great family film","review":"Duval and Cain are great in this quirky little movie about a young boy who's mother leaves him with his two great uncles. Mom is a floozy and is off to see her new boyfriend. The magic of this movie is watching the old men (cain and duval) slowly take the boy under their wing. I did not expect to like this movie, but my mom made me watch it when I was visiting her. What can I say, again, Mom was right!

Well I did enjoy it immensely but not because of the cars and planes. I enjoyed it for the story of a young boy growing up with two aging oddball uncles. I was hypnotized by the wonderful stories told by Michael Caine and Robert Duvall. I was fascinated by the tales of the great wealth they had and the possible African adventures or gangster activities that gave them their money. I was moved by a lion protecting it's boy cub. I cried unashamed at their passing and the wonderful affect they had on that boy that had grown to a man. All in all a great family movie. I plan to buy the DVD myself.

Duvall and Caine are excellent examples of what classic, American men are all about. Unabashedly male, tend to business, like women (and \\"...can fall in love with a passion you can't imagine.\\"), and know right from wrong even if life deals one a bad hand. This is a movie about compassion, tenderness, courage, and kick-in-the-pants humor. Granted, there is a bit of excessive stereotyping, but it's within the context that challenges the politically correct roles currently being jammed down the throats of boys in public schools all over the country. Dare one say it? The mother in this story is a quintessential loser. No, she doesn't use drugs or rob banks. She isn't a victim of males. She simply lacks the gumption to make something of her life and protect her son from the creeps she hooks up with.This isn't a perfect movie by any means.

I was wrong. I always enjoy Michael Caine and Robert Duvall, but this one was just too much -- or should I say, too little. Caine's southern accent sounded more like southern England to me. HJO seemed like he was doing a paint-by-numbers performance (\\"Cue the crying! ACTION!\\") and his looks as he grows older seem more and more suited to doing a bio-pic about the life of a young Barney Rubble. Then we have our supporting cast of your typical Disney-movie types -- the young punks straight out of 'Happy Days'; the wacky wind-up relatives, etc. They all looked and sounded like refugees from a typical Disnelyand attraction.I suppose this movie is OK for kids, but it isn't a movie adults -- or even mildly intelligent teens -- will want to suffer through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripped off","review":"I feel I have been ripped off.

Michael Caine is brilliant in his supporting role as one of two 'retired' bachelor great uncles who have a secret past. Robert Duvall is the other. They suddenly find themselves the recipients of Walter, played by Haley Joel Osment, who is dumped on them by his irresponsible, dam.

I am not a really good computer person and did not know how to easily do this, so I just decided the effort was not worth it for an $11 product.I always assumed that if I paid Amazon.com that they would directly handle any problem that occurred.I will never order anything from Amazon.com that is not sent directly from their company."},{"rating":"1","title":"WANTED TO RATE IT NO STARS AT ALL","review":"The video that was ordered took too long to arrive, Once it did arrive it turned out to be from the United Kingdom and COULD NOT BE VIEWED on USA players.

Though my kids liked it fine, I felt that it never lived up to its promises. For the first 30 minutes or so, I thought I was watching a classic. Then it fell apart. I kept feeling as thought it had been condensed from a much longer film (or book). After watching the movie, I viewed the alternate/deleted scenes. Oh my God! The director must have shot a different version of virtually every scene in the film! Many of the alternates would've led to a COMPLETELY different film. There is even a (much longer) alternate ending. I feel that the director/writer lacked the confidence to commit to one storyline or message and just filmed every idea that came into his head, only to try to sort it out later. The final film reflects that lack of consistency. This is one case of where the included \\"extras\\" actually lowered my opinion of the finished film."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie made absolutely no sence...","review":"...and I find it very hard to categorize! It's a some kind of surreal drama, sometimes odd as a fable, one hour longer than it has to be (serious!), and easiest described as a movie not quite going anywhere -it's like you are waiting for the story to begin, and after a long gasp it is over -and you have no idea what you have spend one hour and fifty minutes on.Not that it is horrible, but it's not good. Three talented actors, including two senior-legends hardly do much acting at all -and their roles requires nothing but one look on their faces, and no emotions are shown at all during one hour and fifty minutes..! It's the strangest movie I've seen so far this year -and I'd recommend you to do something else instead.Warning : It's not in the category of \\"Grumpy old men 1 or 2\\" in case you wondered -this is very, very different and far from being comparable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Secondhand Lions (spanish subtitles)","review":"The information that Amazon provides is incorrect, this title does not have spanish subtitles, I have returned this tilte two times and Amazon can't send me the right version of this title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated Gem","review":"This is probably the corniest, sappiest movie I've seen in the past twenty years.

It is good, 'ol fashioned movie making based on the cornerstones of excellent writing, acting, directing, and camera work. All the family will enjoy the story, albeit on different levels. It instantly became a favorite of ours so we bought the DVD, which we rarely do. Don't forget to look for the Easter Eggs if you buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Family Film","review":"Again, I run into a problem with amazon's rating system. This movie was better than 'OK' (three stars), so I give it four - but then it lumps itself in with other films I've given four stars, and this one wasn't quite as good (i.e., He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not). So, I'd say three and half stars, which rounds up to four in this case. Why? Well, the ending was a little sappy. I guess it was intending to show that the stories were valid, but it seemed a little forced. Also, Osment has officially entered the awkward stage - get ready for lots of squeaky exclamations! On the plus side would be flawless performances from Caine/Duvall, lots of clean action, and some wonderful artwork from Berkeley Breathed."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT MOVIE","review":"This was a wonderful movie.

It is not one of his most famous ones probably because it is not the genre of what most fans think of when they think of John Wayne, comedy. It is a good movie though. When I first watched it I was amazed. Everyone (from Wayne to the actress that plays his daughter) does an excellent job. John Wayne's first role was in a silent in which he played a football player, and he also played football at USC for a couple of years with Ward Bond. So it is a subject he knows well. Overall, it gives light to a new side of the Duke, the comical side (which isn't bad). It isn't one of the best, I grant you, but it is great because it shows Duke's acting talents with a great script and cast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas gift for husband","review":"My husband collects John Wayne movies.

I literally ran out and bought one at 9:00 pm.. the box didn't have '95 on it but I thought that Amazon.com had useful information. I got it home. I had trouble loading it. Now after buying this thing and staying up ALL night and spending half a day today doing a diagnostic on my machine..I can't get this printer to work. It's on my system but the system doesn't recongize a USB can someone help? ugg. Now, I have to call Canon..(and oh '95 drivers are not available on the web!).. help. It's cute printer; sounds great; looks nice on my desk but I can't get it to work.

For whatever reason synogogues in the U.S. often are designed in quite daring styles. It is intriguing to observe how each congregation says a bit about themselves in the building style they chose for their synagogue. I expecially like the spectacular Temple Emanuel in New York City, it is simple breathtaking, though I liked something about all of these buildings. I highly recommend this book; for someone not that familiar with the Jewish faith or synagogues in general it is quite enlightening."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lean, Mean, Genital-Shaving Machine","review":"Any genitals that you put in front of this beast will come out smooth and shorn - as if the job were done professionally. At first, I was a little leery about putting something so violent near my most precious of bits, but the Norelco 5615X Advantage Shaver was very gentle. It felt as if the hair was being licked off by kittens. Because the unit is wet/dry, you are free to use any combination of shave gels or scented oils that you might want to employ on your quest to send your genitals through the fountain of youth.The only downside is that you've got to clean this unit manually, kind of like your own unit. Brushing and wiping short-and-curlies and scented oils out of small blades is nearly impossible, and because of that, upon your next usage, some tugging and pulling might occur. This unit is now inexpensive enough to employ as a single-use disposable item."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quality razor for a great price","review":"I have been a fan of \\"wet\\" shaving for years. Frankly I wonder why anyone shaves with a dry face. This shaver is quiet and shaves as close as it gets! With this great price- it's time you moved to a wet/ dry shaver.What I don't like is the trimmer attapter. Although it works fine- I do not like having to pull the heads off to insert the trimmer. I fear the plastic hinge might break (it hasn't).I lotion seems like a gimick- but it does dispense the nice gliding solution. With a wet face with a little soap- there is no closer shaveStew"},{"rating":"2","title":"Norelco shaver heads - form, fit & finish excellent","review":"The replacement heads are an exact copy of the originals.

I contacted seller who stated they would make a refund but I had to pay for return shipping.

Or so it claims to be. But it didn't come with any instructions so I was left to try and figure it out on my own. Do I run the tip along the side, like when you sharpen a knife? Or do I stick it in the depressed area and spin it around like a top?The only thing I figured out was that I couldn't figure out how to use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smartwool Socks","review":"These are very nice socks.

They came in the mail very quickly, are just as described and he loved them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smartwool socks","review":"Smartwool socks are consistently the best of all socks. I have had several pairs that have lasted over 12 years (of different models) The only whole is where I tore the top of them 7 or 8 years ago, but the hole has never gotten bigger over the past 7 years. I wear these whenever it starts to get cold, with whatever shoes I can. ALWAYS keeps my feet warm without getting too hot.If you buy some and don't like them, don't send them back to the retailer, send them to me! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Best sock I have ever bought, well worth $20 a pair. I wore a single pair for a week straight, to work and home and they didnt even smell bad. They do stretch out a bit after wearing them for a day so you can see they are made to accomodate more than one size foot, but its not a big enough annoyance to bring down the rating. They have held up well so far and if they disappoint down the road I will update my review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love them","review":"If you never have owned a pair of smartwools your missing out on the better things in life. I love them and I wear them year around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent socks","review":"These are really excellent socks. They are warm and wonderfully comfortable. I remember wool socks in the old days, when they were warm but scratchy. These socks are soft. They are bulky, of course, so you will want shoes that leave room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special","review":"A decent sock but not very durable and after merely 5 or 6 washes, it started to lose it's ability to stay up high on the calf. I'd recommend buying something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smartwool socks","review":"During the summer of 2012, I purchased two or three pairs of Smartwool socks for my husband. Thinking I had purchased the best, I sent him off to Elk camp this fall knowing his feet won't get cold. I'm writing this message not because his feet got cold but because one of the socks developed a small hole near the top of the sock. My problem is, I don't know whether to mend the damaged sock, hoping it doesn't happen again, or try to mail it back to you for a replacement. Do you have any suggestions? Any help would be appreciated.Respectfully,P.S.The socks kept his feet warm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get them wet","review":"If you plan on doing serious backpacking these are not great socks. In really wet environments where wet feet are a fact of life these are utterly useless. Once wet, they stay that way for days literally. Very comfortable, great for dry climates or day hiking. NOT for wet environments at all. I'm sticking with my old GI socks, they dry in under an hour by a fire and a couple hours hanging from my pack and are pretty well just as comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't get these socks?","review":"I ordered these socks but I received a woman's size small. Luckily they fit my little sister so I didn't have to return them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for road cycling","review":"I was looking for a pair of socks to keep my feet warm for road cycling. These socks are good to wear around the house and walking outside. However, for road cycling, they don't keep your feet warm below 45 degrees temperature. Above 45, they work well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome socks","review":"After using synthetic socks for activities from in-line skating to hiking and loving them, I found out about Smartwool socks after bying a Smartwool zip t-shirt for use as a mid layer for outdoor winter activities. These socks are incredibly comfortable with great padding on the bottom. They also kept my feet nice and warm when hiking in the snow with it being 20 degrees outside. I would highly recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Socks I've Ever Worn","review":"I love smartwool socks. They are expensive at $10+/pair, but they are really good socks. Super soft, warm, and breathable. They also do a good job at keeping my feet from sweating too much (which is sometimes a problem with other socks). And they don't really absorb odors or moisture and themselves stay dry and fresh without washing for longer than most other socks I've worn.This pair in particular adds a little extra cushion as well, which is great for hiking. I've also never had any problems with rubbed/chafed skin or blisters with these, even after 10+ mile hikes. Great, great socks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Private Scandals","review":"The book was in much worse condition than disclosed.

Deanna Reynolds and Angela Perkins are basically in competition. Deanna was a news reporter who then turned to talk show host to replace Angela's spot after turning Angela's job offer down. Something Angela never forgets. You fall in love with Deanna and she manages to find love along the way herself. She does have somebody stalking her all the way through. The ending was great as I didn't know for a minute the \\"who done it \\" and was very surprised. This was a great book and truly Nora at her best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fluff at its flimsiest","review":"I found this book predictable and hard to get through. Deanna, besides her issues with Angela, has a stalker. When she got her first note from said stalker, I had a pretty good idea who it was. Unfortunately, I was right.Disappointing, formulaic, and boring. Forced myself to finish it in the hopes that Ms. Roberts would throw me a twist.
