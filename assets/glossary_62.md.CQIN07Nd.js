They have the earplug/marshmallow type material that molds to your ear and basically creates a seal to block out background noise. They're ggggggggrrrrrrrrreat!

I've also had issues with the plastic bodies separating (they snap back together) trying to fit them under my helmet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"I bought these to use on trips to India that included long flights and layovers. I got a pair of Koss over-the-ear style headphones for use when I wanted some noise to filter in (flight announcements, etc) but I also wanted a pair to block out the world. The Sparkplugs did exactly that. The foam inserts expand within your ear to provide a snug fit that keeps out external noise. I agree with other reviewers that the bass is a bit lacking, but as has been suggested, simply blocking the holes on the outside of the buds corrects that completely. My only complaint is that after a while, one of my ears always got a bit sore. Might be because I have pretty small ears that all buds have a hard time staying in. Regardless, these are worth having. For longer term use, and for when I don't need the sound cancelling, I liked the Koss Portable over-the-ear set.Koss KSC75 Portable Stereophone Headphones"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst earphones I ever tried","review":"I tried these on an iPod Nano and listened to an audiobook.

I'm happy with the sound -- nice and clear, no boomy bass like so many earbuds have these days -- and the noise isolation is amazing, vastly better than standard rubber-plug earbuds. (They do whistle a bit outside if there's any wind; a bit of tape over the holes on the outside, as recommended by another reviewer fixes that.)The down side is that the plastic part is too big to fit my ears, so after 20 minutes they're painful, and changing the cushion didn't help.

The Philip has higher fidelity, clear vocal, more high and mid range, but less bass compare these Koss. For large headphone, Sennheiser's lines are the best.I like jazz, vocal and some techno trance and these will not do. The sounds are unclear, muggy and you get ear fatigue.

I thought the audio quality would save it, but you know what? If the phones cause your ears to hurt after about 2 minutes of use, audio quality is least of your worries.Things that are wrong with this product:1) black foamy things are susceptible to dust/ear wax collection.2) black foamy plugs don't fit correctly in your ear.3) the white plastic where the little speaker is housed is made cheaply so if you move while you wear this ear phone and if your ear flap touches the plastic edges - they hurt! (sharp edges of the plastic)4) The wire is made from some cheap rubbery material which means it tangles really really easily.

Wrong. These sound tinny and harsh, and they can't handle hardly any bass without severe distortion. I am very disappointed. I'm ordering some Sennheiser CX-300 canalphones to see if they do any better.

I have tried lots of earphones over the years, and found these to be the best bang for the buck. I listen mostly to podcasts, but also found them to be good for music. They are comfortable for my ears for extended listening, and decent for sound isolation. That's the good news. The bad news is that I recently purchased two Sparkplugs from Amazon, and was very disappointed. They look pretty much the same, with the exception of the plug that goes into your MP3 player. It is straight, instead of the right angle as in the photo on Amazon. The big difference is the sound. They sound harsh and tinny. I did plug them into a music source for two days just to give the \\"burn in\\" theory a chance. I also tried using my Ipods equalizer to improve the sound. No luck. I just returned them to Amazon for a refund, and for that I am grateful to Amazon's generous policy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"You definitely get what you pay for with these. Bought them because I had lost my iPod standard headphones for $14 at a local store. The cushioning of the earpieces made it possible to keep them in for long stretches of hours without ear soreness. The main issue with them was that they stopped working after 2 months. The wires attached to the inline mute button came loose on both ends, requiring 5-10 minutes of fiddling with the wires and positioning, until I could get a faint stream of music, which went away the second the wires shifted and were disconnected again. Koss customer support still hasn't responded to any of my emails for three weeks now.Buy them if you just need cheap decent headphones, but don't be disappointed when you need to buy a new pair in a few months. At least for $14, you can afford it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headphones for the daily commute","review":"I found these headphones great for the long noisy commute. After the foam expans in your ear, you're basically blocked off to the wrld, and able to listen in solitary silence to your favourite music.

They then proceed to indicate that in order to properly follow these seven laws, these same readers are bound to all of the rabbinical interpretations found in the Talmud. They continually call for the death penalty for various offenses mentioned throughout the book, and call for stoning and strangling as appropriate penalties. In one place, the authors state that it is a violation not to stone an offender. Many other actions are called forbidden in an apparently arbitrary manner. There are frequent not so subtle references to Christianity and other belief systems throughout the book that are quite uncomplimentary. Truth should stand on its own without these kind of inflammatory comparisons.My opinion is that this book does not represent mainstream Judaism and should never have been published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Good Book","review":"It was hard to read the book about Benedict Arnold and was old book on the cover was ripped.

Benedict Arnold personifies the kaleidoscopic nature of loyalties, betrayals and intrigue prevalent during the War, circumstances much of which determined his course in life. In those days, most citizens were not revolutionaries but either loyalists or non-participants. Arnold's ambitions and abilities were manipulated by his constant striving for recognition and wealth. His inconsistency in allegiance reflected the inconsistencies of society and geography. Unlike Washington whose stability was based on his status as a general, statesman, politician and aristocrat, Arnold was a maverick sometime general and contraband entrepreneur seeking permanent social status, which was denied him throughout his life. Consequently, he jumped sides, outmaneuvering himself and suffering the consequences of traitor to both the new republic and England."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHRISTMAS COLLECTION BY FOSTER & ALLEN","review":"This CD was receved 12/12/11 and the case look like someone used a saw on it.The case is in terrible condition, this is the first time I haverecieved merchandise in this condition from amazon"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bean...BEANS!","review":"The Bean is a neat exercise item -- or would be if it didn't LEAK!

Plus, I hate getting down on the floor to do ab exercises.I was even considering buying the deluxe version. But in less than two weeks,it's gone completely flat.

Secondly, it's made of metal and plastic, thereby getting past the most mentioned problem of The Bean (losing air, total deflation because of rips or holes), and last of all, you can grasp the sides with your hands to remain steady or not slip off (another problem people have with The Bean)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holds Air Not Shape","review":"The Bean Deluxe arrived with a hole & the included the patch kit worked fine.

I expect to have to say to callers \\"Hold on a moment while I put on my headset.\\" But it can go on either side of the head, which is good. The on/off button on the cable works. The volume control works.An even better payoff is that although I got this one to be compatible specifically with my Motorola cell phone, it also works fine with my aged Lucent cordless handset, and I wanted a new headset for that too. This is inexpensive enough so I've just ordered a second headset so I can keep one attached to my old cordless at home and have one to travel with my cell phone.I've given it only 4 stars because I haven't had it long enough to see how well it survives wear and tear.

The driver is slow, performing a length recalibration before every scan. There isn't a WIA driver available, only TWAIN, so stuff like the Windows 'scan now' context menu item just don't work. The provided 'Scan Toolbox' software is ugly, slow, and horrible to use if you're scanning more than a few documents. The front panel buttons break easily.

You WILL regret it for the rest of your life! It is a complete waste of over $40 considering all the great music out there! Girls Aloud are the product of English stupidity namely popstars the rivals (a failed TV show whose result was Girls Aloud). The songs though having catchy tunes become annoying and the girls themselves are unable to sing and extensive technological work has been put in in the studio to make their voices on this album sound remotely acceptable (if you don't believe me listen to them live!!!) I find it disgraceful that such untalented vocalists are allowed to run amok on the music industry when undiscovered TALENTED vocalists are still struggling to make a living!

At some point the metal hinge bent and so now the lid doesn't fit without a gap - so there no longer airtight. Just today i had some soup stored in the large one and as i took it out of the fridge, it spilled some on the floor because i must have not kept it fully vertical. It spills its contents very easily.I like the idea of these things, just the application is very poor and I'm surprised the manufacturer didn't spend any time actually testing them.I use the ones I have, but i would never buy any more even though i want to buy more stainless steel containers.

As you try to close it all the way the metal clasp bends all the way back. You can bend it back easily with little effort, but as we all know bending metal back and forth a few times will cause it to break off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy","review":"Cheap. Cheap. Cheap.

The lids on all but one of the 4 containers were off to the side and when the latch was closed there were large gaps between the lid and the container due to the tops being off center. These are not airtight like the title implies. Maybe if you carefully guided the top down with one hand while you flipped the latch with the other hand you could get the top to line up until the latch is down. These are being sent back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty poor quality","review":"I bought these from a kitchen store and I'm pretty disappointed. They are a nice size for storing flour and sugar, but the pros end about there. The two smaller canisters are quite loose and don't seal at all- you can actually lift up the lid of the smallest one and create a visible gap. Not ideal to keep sugar fresh. Also, as at least one other reviewer noted, they are most certainly not stainless because there are flecks of rust all over them after not even a year (and they don't get wet)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and lids don't seal well","review":"Nice container and very economical. It has silicone seals that keep the air out. However the lids shift side to side, and the seals shift from their original position, so it does not have a quality feel.

I'm just keeping cashews and almounds in them so I imagine the will work ok, but real low quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"good match of quality and price","review":"The stainless steel body and acrylic top make for a lightweight canister that's easy to handle. When empty, the lid doesn't topple the whole container. However, the hinges arrived slightly bent, and the lid doesn't line up perfectly. Despite that, for the price, they serve their purpose. Since the capacity isn't provided in terms of volume, here are some tips: The second largest one will hold a pound of coffee, and the smallest one will hold a box of brown sugar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Looking Canisters!!","review":"I opened the box and was pleasantly surprised to find such nice canisters!

They don't close once opened once. The top will open but then the cheep rubber moves immediately and cannot be resealed even with quite a bit of tinkering.

They have the look I wanted, but not the quality I had hoped. They are very light and the top piece is cheap plastic. I have compared them to some I had almost purchased at Bed, Bath & Beyond. For the same price, I could've got heavy duty containers with glass tops. But they do seal well, so they perform their main purpose. Also, be careful when washing them (I recommend hand washing, I don't think they will withstand a dishwasher), the water kind of gets trapped between top piece and the rubber ring that seals the cannister. You have to dry really well or water will leak into the cannister.65% Satisfaction"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap","review":"These look great, but are cheaply made. I already had to return these once because they were dented as soon as they were unpackaged! After use they fall apart! The silicone seal warped and fell off, which means that the canisters can't seal tightly. The plastic rim around the lid also cracked easily.Splurge a little and buy a better quality set!"},{"rating":"1","title":"eh... ok","review":"they ARE NOT AIR TIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!they are nice on the eyes and look good in the kitichen. i just put my goods in a ziplock bag in the canister."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as Hair of the Dog","review":"Why this wasn't released in the U.S. is beyond me.

If she is unaware of this then she needs to do her homework before writing a book. Second, nothing in the book suggests a miracle. Information on treatment is completely inadequate.

You'll be able to tell it's a movie that had a lower budget to work with, but overall - it's a great movie for kids. Nothing at all that's too scary for younger children.

But as you study the English on the one side, you will see the Script on the other side \\"light up\\" to the point where if you do it often, in time you can read in the total dark because the pages actually light up.

Loses connection at a very short distance ( 8-10 feet)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great as some would say...","review":"I purchased this unit after reading how clear the transmission quality was; several had said that those being called couldn't tell when they were using their headset, or speaking directly into their phone.While the voice quality is good, I had problems with the following: 1) Volume on the headset doesn't go up as high as I would like, 2) Doesn't hold a charge for at least 8 hours, and doesn't tell you, and 3) (and this is the most aggravating) for some reason I regularly go to answer a call and get a message that there is a weak signal between the headset and my phone.

I found myself doing everything possible to hear people and get the speaker closer to my ear. If I turned the volume up as high as it goes, I just about heard the person on the other end. Most of the time I would grab it off my ear and just use the phone speaker.On the plus side, it's nicely designed and simple to use.

I'll gladly eat the shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOKIA BH900 NOT COMPATIBLE N93","review":"N93 doesn't work with either of the headsets. Not even with the BH-900 which is advertised as compatible. Both headsets do connect to the phone, pairing works, the headsets can be set as trusted, and from the BH-900 it is also possible to change the volume control settings of the N93 - it shows in the N93 user interface - but unfortunately no sound gets routed in or out of the BH-900. So no phone calls possible, as audio doesn't flow. Trying to make a phone call by pressing the dial button from BH-900 starts up voice recognition sw from the N93 but it is useless since audio doesn't find its way to the N93.. Any suggestions? Take the N93 back for repair?"},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible battery life","review":"This is a very comfortable headset and was quite easy to set up with my Motorola phone. The sound quality is as good as other headsets I've used, and people on the other end of a call have told me that my voice is clearer.

I have tried numerous bluetooth headphones. This is by far the best. Reception is clear. I have not lost a connection and the set up is easy with my Nokia E62 phone.

Overall excellent functionality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Working Great for Me","review":"I just bought this so I haven't had a lot of usage on it yet, but I really like this product. I gave it a 4 star only because it is a bit on the expensive side. But the sound quality on the Nokia is so much better than my past 2 Logitech headsets both of which broke in less than a year of using them. It paired flawlessly with my LG325 any my Sony Vaio laptop. The voice dialing and all the features I need work great. Alot better than my old logitech in fact. I used to have to scream into my headset to get voice dialing to work. With the Nokia I can speak softly and I didn't have to reprogram any of the voice dials either (like I had to do for Logitech). Certainly by far the best Bluetooth headset I have owned."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Headset","review":"The BH900 works great with the Nokia e90 phone. It provides clear audio quality and allows clear voice dialing. However, the standby time is not what is listed. I get 48 hours of standby and about 8 hours of talk.The boom is the best feature.

I can hear the person on the other end clearly and they can hear me just as clearly also. It is easy to use and easy to set up. I gave it four out of five stars because of it's size. I wish that it was a little smaller. Some kind of carrying case would of been a plus also. Overall it is a great product. If you are looking for a product that will stick into your ear, this is not the product for you, it sits on top of the ear not inside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound, less than 100% connectivity","review":"The sound quality is excellent and the people I talk to say they hear me as well as if i spoke directly into my Razor V3.

You will want to know how because you will want to do all the activities in this book and then some.

The ideas in this book are easy to complete and are educational and fun.Enjoy and well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun way to learn","review":"My son got this for his birthday. It has a lot of interesting experiments and great information. What a wonderful learning tool.I was under the impression that this kit is supposed to come with all of the stuff required for the experiements. While reading through the book, it seems like nearly all of the experiments (especially in the beginning of the book) require a separate bottle to be used.This makes sense considering the bottle that comes in the kit comes apart and is not water-tight. But due to this fact, they should have made the majority of the experiments cater to this. For experiments that require a water-tight bottle, they could have created a separate chapter in the book and combined them together. It's somewhat difficult to find an experiment that does not require extra supplies that are not readily at hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I ordered this for my 11 year-old nephew for Christmas. One afternoon we decided to do some of the experiments and found that a majority of them needed additional materials such as food coloring and extra bottles. Food coloring is needed for so many projects that it should have been provided. Aside from that, many of the experiments did not work. We had a nice time trying, but we ended up disappointed since we expected a lot of them to work. Sorry, but I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop Bottle Science","review":"Great gift for grandson. Teaches kids about science that it can be fun and interesting.

The large pop bottle is split for creating terrariums etc. and appears to seal with an interlocking system. It actually doesn't seal and so the majority of experiments which involve water or an air tight container - fail miserably! Water pours out from the seam of the bottle and gas escapes.The book that is included is well done and the other equipment is fine. We ended up scrapping the bottle and using our own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for all ages","review":"The Turtle Saver is such a wonderful story. Easy to read and has a great message.

The interpretations of these songs -- which have been described repeatedly by the artist in terms of \\"irony\\" -- are not worthy of his great, great talent. Irony is cheap; this sublime artist has much more to offer.

The script is peopled with familiar stereotypes - the Hollywood analyst who needs treatment as much as his patients because he cannot deal with his own grief following his wife's suicide; the troubled teen; the various neurotic Hollywood types. The main problem is that too many characters are introduced who remain undeveloped, so that they seem to be just filling space.

And who among us hasn't packed our children in the car to see some children's entertainer, only to realize later that we would have had more fun snuggling up and reading to eachother at home? Because she shares her humbling parenting mishaps, it's easier to consider her advice in the stories when she seems like such a perfect parent. She offers practical and thoughtful ideas for slowing down, connecting, and really being present with our children.This is my favorite book to give to mothers with young or school-age children. Buy an extra one -- you'll want one to loan out so you can still keep your own. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"This \\"little\\" book is so full of big ideas for the busy mother. As a new mother of a 7 1/2 month old little boy, I found the suggestions breathtakingly simple, yet profound in their depth and intention. I would and do recommend this charming book to any parent who wants to bring a deeper meaning to their family life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not in too much of a hurry to read this!","review":"Katrina Kenison can make magic. This short and easy series of thoughts on mothering was able to go down all the better for it's brevity (the boy's napping - let's take 5 and read a couple of pages!). It's brevity causes it to lose nothing for gravity and richness - it only serves to make her thoughts more precise, more clear. I've enjoyed adding things to our own life (like the brownie who lives in the kitchen) and will happily look for more of her work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smug and self-righteous","review":"Obviously many readers have found this book inspiring. I'm not one of them -- I found the tone smug and self-righteous. I nearly gagged when she made her son throw away all his toy guns after the Columbine shootings -- and he meekly went along with her. I'm not accusing her of making it up; it's just hard for me to identify with a mother whose children are so extraordinarily accommodating.Kenison is a good writer, but she'd be a whole lot better if she had the tiniest hint of a sense of humor, especially about herself and her family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting, thoughtful way to look at motherhood","review":"While this book echoes many of my feelings about being a mother, it added new life to the possibilities for enjoying and growing with my children. Kenison encourages parents to fully experience the world together by slowing down, listening more closely, looking more carefully and reaping the wondrous benefits of the people we created. The first night I read it, I found myself doing things differently. Written in short and inspiring chapters, each one is a delight. It's a treat for any mother who wants more joy amd meaning in her life with her children. I can't compare this book to any other I've read which makes it all the more valuable."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book changed my life...","review":"It is rare to say but so true. It was given to me by an older woman and it truely changed the way I parent my two boys, see life and helped me create a summer that I will treasure. A must read for those who want to slow down and get off the \\"treadmill\\" of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something so simple","review":"This book has such a basic message to all of us with children. Keep it simple. Ms. Kenison's style truly is a pleasure to read. I gave this book to my mom eventhough she has an \\"empty nest\\" now. I think it reminds us all that we don't have to be everything to everyone all the time. We don't have to do it all. Especially with a child, there is time. We will all get more out of an experience IF we are able to experience it. I include this book with all my baby gifts now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"This is such an inspirational book. It really helps to bring your attention to the important things in life that we often forget during hectic days. It would be an excellent baby gift, so a new parents could remember to savor every moment in their child's life. The book is easy reading with each chapter a story on its own. I'm sure that I will pick it up many times over the years as my children grow up."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book changed my life","review":"I love how well written this book is and how it gives you the tools to be a better person, mother and wife."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Disappearance of Fligt 412","review":"I have probably never seen a movie with quality as bad as this.Even my old tapes from TV were 500% better. The picture was faded, the characters looked like they were 90 years old and the sound track was off so badly that it also garbled words, so looking away from the movie did not help. It is also one hour long--but seemed like three-probably a copy of a TV movie as it also had cuts for commercials though I could not find any place that said this. It was advertised as a 2 Hour DVD-and it is--I guess, but I could not see any more of it. At the end of one hour, it just showed credits and it was over. I am returning it-and it is the first copy of a DVD that I have ever returned for picture and sound quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible transfer","review":"This dvd looks as if it was copied from a hand held camera at a theater.

THE SOUND IS ALSO A JOKE. TOTAL WAST OF MONEY, I PUT IT IN THE TRASH CAN AFTER THE FIRST MINUTE. WHAT NERVE THEY HAVE TO SELL THIS THING."},{"rating":"1","title":"For UFO film fanatics only","review":"This movie is slow-going but is interesting if you're a serious fan of UFO films. This film is much less about a UFO that is sighted by a few pilots than it is about the government's process for shutting up the pilots. After the pilots report having seen radar blips moving strangely and the disappearance of one of their planes, they are locked in a secret facility for 18 hours where government agents mess with their heads and try to get them to say that nothing out-of-the-ordinary happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Disappearance of Flight 412","review":"This movie is not what I thought it would be. I really thought it would be a plane disaster movie. Boy was I wrong. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I know it is based on a true story but get real it was awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIP OFF LOW BUGET JUNK","review":"THIS FILM USES A NUMBER OF \\"NAME\\" ACTORS , TOO MAKE A FEW BUCKS ! A WASTE OF TIME !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"I was utterly disappointed about this movie and turned it off 23 minutes into it. As mentioned, the visual and audio quality is horrible, but on top of that the cover picture of a commercial airliner leads customers to believe this is a disaster movie about a commercial jet airliner going down with a couple of hundred passengers on board, and the rescue and investigation efforts after the event, instead, this is a military film with no suspense build-up whatsoever. So in addition of the misleading cover picture (\\"false advertisement?\\"), this movie is beyond boring - it's a waste of money and resources."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweden by way of Texas","review":"Texas has always had a rich history in underground music. In the early '80s, when hardcore punk ruled, there was D.R.I. and MDC. Fast forward 10 years later to death metal's reign, and there were really good unsigned acts such as Magus and Embalmed.Shift to the town of Plano and you had Divine Eve, who went against the grain of what was coming out of America at the time and seemed to prefer to emulate the sounds of the Sunlight Swedish bands such as Entombed and Dismember.This EP is actually a demo that was recorded in October of 1992 and then picked up for major release by Nuclear Blast in 1993. I can see why the label snapped the previously unsigned band up, as this is some quality Swedeath with still a hint of American influence riffing-wise.Maybe not quite up to the level of the originators of the sound, but Divine Eve proved that the trademark Swedish buzzsaw guitar and bass sound could be done almost as well by an American band. Good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended by my Dr","review":"I purchased this because it was recommended by my Dr. I have ALS and my neck cannot hold my head up very long. I purchased the largest one I could find, and the merchant sent it on time, etc. My problem is that I did not try one on first, and these cannot be returned. The brace is too small for my neck and head. So try before you buy is my recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Major quality information","review":"I have shown this to my patients and watched it several times myself. To the point, factual, and reliable. A must-have, and a must-see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soft Core Porn","review":"This movie is great, if your looking for a soft core porn rather than an enjoyable horror film. I love over the top horror films to just sit back and laugh at, but this movie was horrible! Sure it had a couple lines in it that were pretty funny mostly because of the terrible acting, but for the most part the jokes were lame, the killings were boring, and since I was wanting to watch a horror film and not a porn the 3/4 of the movie where they just strip, dance and rub each other got old. Not recommended unless your just looking for an hour of boobs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hot blood sundae and Ice scream","review":"The origional movie was called Ice Scream and it came out long before this one. Exact same plot, same charactors, only the origional had Conrad Brooks in it. I wonder why that one is not on dvd. I wonder why the total rip off?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless","review":"I was hoping to watch a mindless, low budget flick for pure entertainment. I was wrong. This one was a true disappointment and it should be re-titled...\\"Hot Blood Silicone Sundae\\". I don't know about others, but I'm not a silicone fan, especially when the surgery is low budget, too. I guess these ladies needed the dough...no talent whatsoever. I feel stupid buying this one (for $2.34 used).

Large space at bottom to hide the long power cord."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't let the title fool you","review":"This was my first bite into the words of Harrison, and I quickly bought three more of his afterwards. Wolf is not so much about Harrison's hero searching for the beast, but of him searching to find himself in the reality he has thrown himself into over the years. Drying himself off of bourbon and physical and mental loves over the years, while reminiscing over his well travelled youth. With humor and words that are true to the way we speak and think. Sometimes he'll ramble in newfound dreams while walking alone through the woods, where it's hard to follow, but its interesting to see inside his mind during these times. We truly follow his train of thought, which is important in understanding and relating to the man. Harrison's world lives in all of us..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great first novel by an American icon.","review":"Harrison's first novel is a great book. It shadows the irrevrant character of the novelist himself. From the purpose of the trip [to see wolves] to the final gorging of food in Ishpeming, Harrison takes one on a roller coaster of emotions all bundled up in the persona of a modern man trapped in a world he doesn't understand and that has long foresaken him. Wolf is a must read for Harrrison fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambling and Incoherent","review":"I had read Sundog and Woman Lit by Fireflies and was excited to read more. This novel was a great disappointment. Harrison seemed to be exploring a prose style which mirrored the insanity of his alcohol deprived/cold turkey protagonist. It was a valiant effort but in the end - it failed misearably."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I too read this book and was deeply disappointed. A rambling story with no real satisfaction reached by the reader at the end. I rank this book right up there with \\"Farmer\\" and \\"A good day to die\\" as being one of Jim's lessor works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Product Ordered","review":"Order product and arrived on time and in great shape, would order again from this company - completely satisfied with book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two stories","review":"Mackenzie's Pleasure (4 stars): Zane protects Barrie.

I got this book a while back, and made cardboard models of the Great Pyramid for my own use. I painted them sky blue, for Healing and made my own pyramid water. The plants grew like mad! The pets had vastly increased energy and minded better. I used it on wine and it tasted great! I used it on a sick pet, one the vet said would not live long, and that pet is still alive! When I drink it, I can think better. I don't know how it does that! They don't know how it works, it just does. You need to use it to find out about it. It makes water an elixer, by expanding the molecules. Try it, read the book, and do it. You won't regret it.

It is not an easy read and the majority of the book is full of what I considered useless information. The part of the book that is supposed to explain how to construct your own pyramid is the smallest section of the book and isn't even clearly defined. I have read 5 or 6 different pyramid books and this is the only one I found that didn't keep my interest and I couldn't use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I zipped through this book, the experiments and facts about what pyramids can do will astound you! I tried various experiments using the drying technique of placing something organic inside a pyramid and it worked every time! It dried food and it was quite edible. Of course finding out that they calculated Jesus's birthday as being the same day as mine blew me away as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really very poor and it's just a mixture of several books.","review":"Poor.

There were too many pointless scenes happening, and it was hard to like about The Cannonball Run. I'll admit, that doctor did crack me up. But as far as the rest of the film goes, it's all stupid. Three thousand miles to be covered in thirty-two hours? Probable...yes, but it requires a lot of planning, luck, and straight driving. Of course, the film The Cannonball Run makes it too easy for everybody to make it on time although it becomes predictably a footrace to end the race. I wished the rules of the race were explained more clearly so I could grasp the outline and the purpose of the race and the rewards thereafter the finish, but The Cannonball Run would rather focus on the tits of Farrah Fawcett (which isn't saying much for me) than bother with the muckety-muck of the race.

Maybe they were trying to be way too politically correct about human racial races (not car races). The commentators laugh a lot too. As for the film itself.

Deep Dish's solo projects by Sharam and Dubfire are also pure gold.Avoid GU 32 like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"A different spin for GU","review":"This release does not fit into GU collection, trying something new does not work every time. This mix is horrible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Snuff","review":"I was pretty excited when I saw that GU was coming out with their 32nd release from the DJ series. It looks as if I will be anxiously awaiting the 89th release one day as my appetite for new GU doesn't seem to be waning...unless of course there are too many more like Freland's weak release. Nick Warren never seems to let down, his Paris mix still seeing a fair amount of playtime on my ipod. Danny Howells came out with a pretty good one from Miami, but the Freeland mix is dilute, forgettable, and just seems to meander aimlessly. There is one highlight on disc 2 and that is the Silvrsun Pickups with a track called 'Lazy Eye'. I copied that track to the end of the disc onto itunes just so the $20 I spent to preorder this wasn't a total waste. I definitely wouldnt recommend spending much of your hard-earned money on this mix."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Global Underground Ever","review":"I am completely sickened by the junk on these two cd's. I'm a big fan of breaks and this album is the Worst breaks set I've ever heard. Every track is annoying, and nothing fits. Try Adam Freeland's Coastal Breaks or Tectonics which are both phenomenal. Unfortunately Adam is devolving as a dj and that's sad to see. Do Not waste your money when there are soooo many great Breaks compilations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Humdrum from GU??","review":"Like some of your other reviewers, I was very disappointed in this new offering from Global Underground, so I sold it after just 2 listens. The beats are relentless but uninmaginative and the whole 2 discs are so forgettable. There's no innovation. Adam, grow up and get some more gigs under your belt before you go to GU again."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect freeland.","review":"As other reviews will tell you, this is not a typical GU style release. Frontman for Marine Parade throws down some sick tracks for mexico city. Very innovative DJ and put Evil Nine on the map. I would recommend you listen to the cd in its entirety. (cd 1) electro infused synthy-breaks (cd 2) minimal house into some rock/indie vocal style breaks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two CD's of noise","review":"I have to agree with the other reviews that came in at one star. If they had a rating of zero stars these CD's are awful enough to have deserved a zero star rating. If you are into sounds that mostly make you cringe then this is certainly your style. NO need to go on any more, but there's not a single track on these 2 CD's worth listening or dancing to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Freeland fan","review":"I'm usually love Adam Freeland's stuff. I have several of his albums and his Essential Mix on Radio1 a few years ago is still in my playlist as one of my favorites. Also a huge fan of the Global Underground series (I have every one of them), I was excited to see Freeland's name in the lineup. Sadly, I think this is my least favorite GU so far.I'm not sure what Adam was trying to do here, but disk one just never really gets going and disk two is just a mess. There are so many times in it where it seems like he thought \\"let's just make a ton of random noises here and see how it works out.\\" It didn't.I was very disappointed with this release and hopefully Freeland doesn't go quite so experimental if he gets another chance on the label."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Around Excellent","review":"I ordered this cd knowing that John Williams played my favorite version of Concierto de Aranjuez, so I was barely taking a chance on the rest. It's a great cd, all around! It is a little heavy and generally melancholy, but Williams' talent makes the melancholy desirable. Williams' version of Satie's Gymnopedie no. 3 is exquisite!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent","review":"I've heard John Williams, the guitarist, many times on public radio and finally purchased one of his CD's. This is one of the most beautiful recordings I've ever heard. Every selection is exquisite. My overall favorite would be \\"Cavatina from The Deer Hunter\\". You must get this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly one of the best...","review":"I was originally turned on to John Williams a couple of years ago when I saw a television showing of one of his concerts. I then got on Amazon and ordered his \\"From the Jungles of Paraguay\\" CD, and just purchesed this CD recently. Though I've only had an interest in classical music for a short time, this has got to be one of the finest classical guitarists of our time. His technique and precision is flawless, as best displayed on track #5. His interpretation of track#19 is one of the prettiest I've ever heard. This is great music to read to, eat to, paint to, play along with( if you dare)...and nod off to. He has definitely gained a new fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"Excellent CD for those interested in classical music. All the tracks are great in sound quality!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Title","review":"We ended up not buying this book after evaluating the information on the impulse C website as we felt that a pattern of misleading customers emerged. First, the book's title is misleading in that it does not make clear that the book is an accompaniment for a single product (Impulse C) and of no interest without that product. Secondly, when trying to find out more about the product the book is intended to promote, again vital information is simply left out. Nowhere does the website say for example what operating systems the development tools can run on and what the system requirements are. It appears customers are supposed to buy the toolchain without knowing if their infrastructure is suitable or not. We decided that regardless of whether this is deliberate or oversight, we don't want to do business with the author and his company. Caveat emptor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a highpoint","review":"Unfortunately, Willie Colon's best recordings are not as readily available. This one looks good, as the pairing of Willie Colon and Hector Lavoe is a good one; however, the tunes just aren't that good. What can you do? Look for the compilation \\"Crime Pays\\" or some of their earlier recordings like \\"El Malo\\". Check out \\"El Juicio\\". Avoid this one, unless you're an incorrigible completist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Propaganda","review":"The other reviews covered all the bases on this one - but it really is a great cd. If you are a fan of Claudia/Propaganda, this is one you can't pass up. The production is powerful and keeps the ear entertained. You really can't lose with the pop sensibilities of OMD and the unique vocals of Propaganda mixed together."},{"rating":"2","title":"A long wait,","review":"but well worth it. This disc is beautiful. Brucken's voice is great and the OMD collaberation is genious. A must have for electronic, dancey-trancy fans. You must also own Love and a Million Other Things from Brucken and the early Propaganda stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well.. they looked good","review":"I bought these for my company truck F-250. The ad copy had good words... tough.. fiberglass backing etc.. The did bolt on fine. In less than one month one of them had split across the center about 10 inches. I called the seller and they said... we only warranty these for 14 days.. after that nothing. I would expect them to last more than 14 days. I dont even know if a defect warranty can be just 14 days. I am trying to get Amazon to help me but so far not luck.Also.. when contacting the seller ( I found their phone number on the web) I think I woke someone up.. it took a while for them to get back to the phone after answering.Too bad.. these mud flaps do look nice when they show up. Just not nice a couple of weeks later. Mine were not rubbing on anything and look absolutely brand new except for being split in half.I hope they can send me a new flap.. or refund but they say no.. 14 days have passed.Dont Buy These."},{"rating":"2","title":"One to wag your tail about!","review":"This is a terrific book for anyone who has a dog. It clearly explains how dogs do unpredictable things, but are a constant source of love. My daugher giggles at all the silly things this dog does and his actions resemble that of our dogs. It helps a child understand that you need to display patience when dealing with a dog, and that that they deserve respect too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blurry pictures","review":"We bought this camera last year right before Christmas. It is okay outside, but terrible inside. If there is the slightest movement the pictures are blurry.

This has been the only accident and there it goes, I can no longer see anything on the screen.This camera also blurs very easily, but you can get use to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool Camera......Bad White Spots","review":"I really liked this camera.........cool looking, easy to use, and it takes great photos with natural light.......... But when you turn out the lights and need to use the flash......well just like many people here will tell you(read reviews for coolpix s5, this camera has same issues).........RANDOM. WHITE. SPOTS.Sometimes 15 other times 1 or 2. For me it occured on about 90% of alll photos that require use of the flash. Now I bought this at best buy and I took it back and got another coolpix s9 ( I really like the camera) and the same thing happened. Of coarse the Best Buy \\"Digital experts\\" told me it was user error. I'm glad to see its not just me."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"terrible. Takes horrible pix - and have tried fiddling with all the different settings. Has a quirk that causes it to freeze up so you have to pop the battery out to make it work again. Couldn't get a sharp picture to save my life and there is a terribly long delay before the picture actually takes - huge loss for wanting to take pix of our newborn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks with poor repair support.","review":"I am holding a great paper weight. A 270 dollar camera that broke with no reason to break. This camera looks like it just came out of the box. The camera's menu suddenly stopped working, and the picture of the menu distorts and flickers. The buttons do nothing, and the only way to turn it off is by removing the battery. Nikon will fix it for [...]. Not worth it. I will by a reliable brand, from A company that realizes that the consumers are the reason they are in business. The pictures it took inside were so so. the flash overexposed everything, outside pictures werent too bad, but the random breaking of internal buttons or lcd screens is a problem. DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU WANT TO PAY TO REPAIR SOMETHING YOU DID NOT BREAK."},{"rating":"1","title":"quit after 1 year","review":"I bought the Coolpix S9 in March of 2007--it lasted until June 2008. Just quit working and Nikon wanted $99.50 to repair. I bought a Canon Powershot and donated the Nikon to a camera shop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as Canon","review":"I bought the Nikon Coolpix S9 as a replacement for my Canon PowerShot S410 because I wanted a lighter, less bulky ultra-compact camera with good picture quality. The S9 was the one of the lightest, and earlier versions of the Coolpix family received decent reviews.While the camera is light and fits nicely in my pocket, I must say I was not pleased with the quality of the photos I took with the Nikon Coolpix S9. Most photos taken with flash in dark rooms came out blurry and washed out white, and often had lens flare. And photos taken with flash off did not come out as clear as they did with the Canon S410. Photos in normal lighting with flash on came out okay, but still did not match the quality of the Canon.I'm returning the Nikon Coolpix to Amazon today and purchasing a Canon."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this camera","review":"I have owned this camera for ~6 months and have finally deciced to replace it. I bought this camera to replace another Nikon CoolPix that was stolen from my house. But this one does not have a view finder to begin with and is way more complicated to use. I have always liked Nikon cameras but the S9 just doesn't make it. I can not use it outside because I can not see the LCD screen. Sorry Nikon but you blew it on this camera!!So I replaced it with a Canon PowerShot A710. What a difference in ease of use and... it has a view finder. also my 1G memory card from the Nikon fits in the new Canon."},{"rating":"2","title":"This has it all","review":"Great pictures, fast response time. good resolution for a little ultra compact. Why pay for the sony T10, when this is so much less, and takes standard SD memory like my old camera. The memory stick change is the major reason why I wont change over to sony. nikon shines with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Red-eye reduction doesn't work!","review":"I chose this camera specifically because of the advertised in-camera red-eye reduction fix. I have a new baby and like any proud parent, take loads of photos of him. It is a pain to have to fix the red-eye manually in Photoshop, but at the same time I don't want to lug around (or learn how to use) an SLR type camera. I thought the Coolpix S9 would be the solution to my problems. While the photos are very crisp and clear, the red-eye is worse than in my old Casio digital camera and the flash really washes out indoor photos taken at night. In fact the flash is so bright it makes my son turn away from the camera, so the pictures that didn't have red-eye were all of the back of his head! I returned this camera and am renewing my search for something that will meet my needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect point and shoot","review":"If you are looking for a point and shoot pocket size camera this is the one! It's got lots of cool features and has high quality pictures. Great zoom and various other options! Very user friendly."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as Canon","review":"I have two other digital cameras, both Canons. Both are great cameras with great price/quality values. My wife was specifically looking for something she could keep in her purse for quick/easy family photos and also capture the kids playing tennis and rugby. The convenience factor and style of the S9 make it worth the extra dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outrageous","review":"Do NOT order this book on Amazon. It's just an extremely bad scan. Three pages of the text are missing (43, 65, 117), and all the photo plates (seven of them) are simply black blots without any recognizable form.This is a true affront to the Oxford University Press that originally published this book and whose mark is on the very first page.

I have tried numerous headsets and this is by far the best! I'm also very picky about electronics and read may reviews before purchasing an item, so if you're like me, keep reading.I've tried bluetooth headsets and found they all produced too much static and anyone I spoke to said I sounded distant. I've tried other wired headsets and they either fell off my ear or made it sound like I was on speaker phone. This is the ONLY headset I have found that 1) stays on my ear very comfortably and 2) sounds great both to me and the person I am speaking to. In fact, no one I have spoken to while wearing this headset has been able to identify that I was wearing a headset.The only reason I gave this headset 4 stars instead of 5 is that I find it to be a little quiet. It may just be my phone's output, yet I do wish the speaker was a little louder sometimes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Headset ever!","review":"Excellent sound, comfort and flexible configuration to boot! Works on home cordless phones or mobile phones! Bluetooth maybe wireless but they still can't match the sound quality of an excellent wired headset like this one.If you want to hear and be heard loud and clear with minimal ambient noise, get this headset. Plantronics scored big with this design. I'm gonna get the xbox 360 version of this fine, durable headset."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Hear Well, Not Sure Why?","review":"I bought this one after my wife already bought another one almost identical to this one at Wal-mart and she really liked it. She used it on our home phone and I was buying this one for her cell phone. She plugged it in and the volume was too low no matter what we changed in the settings. We then switched back to the other head set she bought at Wal-mart and it worked great. I still think, since they are both Plantronics and look identical except for a small on/off button on the one from Amazon, that they would be of the same quality- so it probably was a \\"lemon\\" set and wouldn't be typical, unless others have similar problems with this particular model. I sent it back. (Amazon does provide for a very simple and easy return)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls short","review":"I've had very good experience with other Plantronics products and this one does not measure up to the others. It is difficult to get a good fit on the ear, due to that or perhaps otherwise, the audio is difficult to find a range for comfortable listening and the people I am talking to express some concern about a somewhat muffled sound of my voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headset","review":"I bought this for my daughter.

This one fits well and both the mic reponse and audio is very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible for cyclist and other windy environments","review":"I often commute in my bike and this the ONLY headset I've ever found that you can ride a bike and talk! It's amazing. I was once flying down a hill at 35+ and at the bottom I asked the caller if she hear any of the wind noise and she heard nothing but my voice the whole time.Also, if your phone supports it (I have an LG Voyager from Verizon) the MX510 has a little button on the audio control that allows you to answer (click once) and redial the last call (click twice). So if you get cut off while riding or driving, you don't have to reach for the phone to redial a dropped call or to answer one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Low Microphone Levels","review":"The problem I had with this item is the extremely low microphone levels which made it unusable for me.

Also simply beautiful to look at - the use of style, color, and direction is astounding."},{"rating":"2","title":"A SUPER CLASSIC","review":"Thisd is a super classic.

The local Avon lady comes and takes him home because she feels sorry for him. Edward falls in love with the Avon ladys daughter. Then Edward is shunned for being an outsider.

Its DEFINITLY worth it!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A purer Love","review":"Films about imagination and about involving a weirdo make me feel at home. This film brings me home every time I watch it. Depp and Ryder are two people who can really bring out the best of imagination and a delightful weirdness. Depp's character, a strange creation with scissor-like hands(if you can imagine)speaks to me in how different he is. When he comes to a suburban town, people love him, but for the wrong reasons. One girl, Ryder, sees him for him and loves him for that. Their relationship gives me hope everytime I watch this film. I am reminded how sweet and rescuing a purer love is.

The Theme of this story is beauty because of how beautiful Edward makes things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, but disk doesn't work","review":"Edward Scissorhands is one of my all time favorites, especially because of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp who are both amazing. I ordered this blu-ray disk from Amazon in March, but didn't try to watch it until this summer (after the return date). I discovered that the audio worked only partially. Sounds such as background music and sound effects were played, but things like voices did not. I checked all the disk settings and nothing would fix it. No other DVDs or Blu-Rays had this problem in my blu-ray player. I don't own any other players that support blu-ray, so I couldn't test it out. I contacted customer service about the problem and they told me to try it in another player, but I told them that's not an option.

This is one of those movies that will never get old. I mean it's the perfect mix of genres. Drama, some funny moments, fantasy, etc. Believe me, those of you who haven't seen it yet, you MUST see it.

It comes with some HD-DTS english audio and no other english option which does not work on all Blu-ray players, so be cautious getting this version, unless you want to be stuck only being able to listen to it in French or Spanish. That's the only reason I give the Blu-ray thumbs down. The picture was fine, the special features worked fine, but there was only music and background sounds. No spoken voices as t all in the DTS, which once again is the only English choice that comes with this, besides the audio commentary, which works fine also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly Movie","review":"Did not enjoy movie, too silly and fantastical.

The first time I saw it, I wasn't old enough to appreciate it. Now I'm tired of renting it and wanna order it!! Surrealism, drama, true love,heartbreaking music, and flat out reality is perfectly combined into a film that satisfies the strange person in all of us. Better yet, its actually a GOOD kind of strange. It's the only movie that can really make me cry, and I'd recommend it to anyone, any age. Order the film and the soundtrack and you'll be the happiest person on the face of this planet. The film reminds us of the many different forms inexcusable innocence can take and the ruthless ignorance of people today....and more importantly, the power of true love. The music brings out the light in darkness...its all just plain good. I'll leave you at that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Destined to become a Holiday Classic.","review":"Tim Burton has outdone himself with this surreal fairy tale. The classical Price scenes filmed in b&w gave this movie serious weight and set it apart from other modern-day classic attempts to decommercialize Christmas. The ice dance, for example, was enchanting and still gives me chills even though I've seen this film several times. Depp was (as he always is) perfect. The ending could have been less violent, but the rest of the film more than makes up for it. 5 stars!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite movie","review":"Not just my favorite genre film, my favorite film period. Nothing can explain the emotional attachment one will have to this film after a few viewings. It may not hit you the first time, but trust me this film is worth the time you put into it. If you have an emotional bone in your body then buy this film. Plus, it is directed by Tim Burton...'nuff said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Edward with the Scissorhands","review":"I found the movie very good because it was very strange. I mean Edward was not a normal human. He had scissors hands. That is why the movie took my attention. This property of Edward made him different from other people's. He took the attention of other people's on him. Everybody started to love him because he had a innocent personality because of his loneliness. Edward was a very shy people, till the woman came to his castle and rescued him from his shy personality. This was very good behavior of the women. Not everybody would do this because of Edwards strange personality. With the help of the woman, Edward could get rid of his shy personality and by this he could easily walk on the streets and in the society. An other positive point was, he may have fallen for the first time in love. All of these things made me love the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will tug at your heart and make you laugh and cry","review":"This movie is superb. Johnny Depp's character of Edward Scissorhands is one of the sweetest most misunderstood creations of all time. Johnny is such a wonderful actor and you truly believe that Edward is real.

Also, the contrasts between what is arguably the world's most perfect neighborhood and the castle and Edward are dramatic, and highlight the character's desire(and failure) to belong in a colorful world of happiness and heartache."},{"rating":"2","title":"oh my gosh....i am speechless","review":"Tim Burton's genius shines so much in this movie. Winona ryder and Dianne West were good, but Johnny Depp, Johnny Depp was so incredibly great. Tim Burton is the most talented director ever, and Johnny Depp is beyond talented...he's.....ingenius!This movie starts out dark, then its gets light and happy, then turns dark again. The end is a little sad, but there is sort of a bright light shining through, a light telling you that it's going to be okay.I recomend this to everyone, espeacially girls my age that like Johnny Depp only because he is good-looking. Those girls will see that that he has A LOT more than just good looks.If you like Tim Burton, see Nightmare before Christmas. It's great and Danny Elfman is so talented and cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"For the price, I loved this movie. Watching it for the first time in 6 or 7 years.

This movie depicts the life of a person with hands of scissors as the title indicates - I just found it weird and could not accept it at all. I could not really appreciate this movie due to this and was in fact not feeling good at the end of the movie and just walked out before the last couple of scenes"},{"rating":"2","title":"killer movie","review":"This is a Johnny Depp Classic for all us fans out there.

I received the DVD which I paid $11.50 plus tax for it, with the idea that I was being charged the correct amount when to my surprise the DVD received had a tag from COSTCO in the amount of $8.49 (wow did the AMAZON shipping dept drop the ball?!?!?). Adding insult to injury, the cover of the DVD is yellowish showing age of item. Not a pretty package at all. So I am charged more than the product shows and the wrapping looks bad.

The ending could have been better.I would recommend this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 of 5","review":"Edward has scissors for hands, but no one ever says why. All his backstory explains is that the scissors; which, like his mountain home and the personalities of the people in the surrounding neighborhood he eventually pierces, are largely exaggerated; were supposed to be temporary. But the man who invented him died just before putting on his hands.Not that it matters much. Scissorhands, a well-mannered ghost of a man dressed in all leather like a slave in a bondage session, is annoying rather than intriguing, and I don't care anything about him. So even when a plot finally begins to develop, it's all in vain. The fairy tale epilogue, which explains the origin of snow in pastel Suburbia, is cute though.marcellee.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"it sucked","review":"This movie was terrible made no sence and was boring.

Visually, creatively, everything. However, I can't recommend this movie on DVD. The extra's don't do anything to enhance the movie. It has a few Q&A type questions, from the cast and crew, that last about 20-40 seconds each. Burton is a great filmmaker, but he definitely cut the audience short on the inspiration for this movie, and what went into making it. It's just not one that I could recommend. Save your bucks for something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Master Burton","review":"This title is indeed very nice.

His atmosphere that he creates is surely one of the best qualities of his films. Well, not only does this film have that, it also has great acting, great writing, and the best score ever! It is funny, eerie, and it is one of my top 20 favorites of all time. Just great. This is when Winona Ryder still only made good movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Ok, I admit that the reason I rented this was to see Backstreet Boys' Nick Carter (the slip n slide boy at the beginning of the movie) but I ended up loving it.

It's kinda a romance-fairy tale, and I usually don't like romances, but this captured my heart! It was soooooo sad at the end. I bawled for ten minutes straight! Johnny Depp played Edward so well, it is hard to picture another Edward. Mrs. Ryder played Kim really well too. At first, I didn't like Kim cause she had this big maucho boyfriend that got on my nerves! Also she was so rude to Edward at the beginning. I felt sooooo bad for Edward cause he couldn't eat or drink. Also, when he poked a hole in the water bed, then ripping it to shreads when Kim finds him, that made me cry!I am such a sucker for this movie! *sniff*"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Film Has Become More Special Over Time","review":"When I first saw this film, I thought of it as one of Tim Burton's more unusual efforts. But as time has gone by, it has become to touch me on many levels.The music and \\"choir\\" backup lends a true heart-warming and mystical quality that can be compared to \\"The Wizard of Oz\\". The scene where Ryder dances in the snow created by Edward's ice carving is unforgettable. She is able to celebrate who this person is--and love him as well. If I could edit out the attempted rape of Edward by the town slut (and a few ill-chosen profanities), I would show this film to youngsters.But I leave it as an adult tale of a love that could never be fully consumated. It is the story of the freak who is castoff by the pastel-colored \\"normal\\" people who never comprehend or appreciate that special individual who is Edward Scissorhands. I hope we never see a sequel, for this work stands alone as a modern day classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this movie!!","review":"I have been watching this movie for as long as I can remeber, and I love it! It has such a touching story and \\"Edward\\" is played brillianly by Johnny Depp. It has a love story which is quite touching and in the end it even though it kinda makes you cry when Edward is forced to leave town it still makes you feel good that he has experienced love from someone after being by himself for so long. It is so sweet after Edwaard gets out of jail and is asked by Kim why he helped them break into the house when he knew whose it was, he replied \\"Because you asked me to\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Burton's most personal work...and his most lovely","review":"This is simply a beautiful film.

HIS VISIONS ON HOW A WORLD CAN APPEAR HAVE ALWAYS GOTTEN TO ME. IN A GREAT MAJORITY OF HIS FILMS, BURTON TENDS TO SET A CLASSIC MOOD. IT IS DARK YET MAGICAL. ALL OF THE FILMS THAT HE HAS PRODUCED HAVE A CERTAIN DARK, WAVVY, AND POETIC JUSTICE TO IT. EDWARD SCISSORHANDS IS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF BURTONS MOST OPTIMISTIC MOVIES. IT SHOWS THE LIFE OF A CREATION. THE STRUGGLE TO 'FIT IN'. WHAT TIM BURTON DOES IN THIS FILM IS UNCANNY. HE CREATES AN ARTISTIC SETTING SHOWING THE TWO SIDES OF THE WORLD: A DARK ONE AND A MYSTERIOUS ONE. THE MYSTERIOUS ONE IS FULL OF COMEDY, DRAMA, AND IN THIS FILM A SUBURBAN HIGH COLORED NEIGHBORHOOD. I WOULD SUGGEST THIS FILM FOR NUMEROUS REASONS.

THIS HAS TO AT THE TOP OF BURTON'S LIST."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic Allegory or Mediocre Satire?","review":"Here is a review that lends credence to viewer/reader theory. The first time I saw Edward Scissorhands, I saw it as an allegory. Viewed within this framework, it is a film with nothing but the clichés of the Hollywood far-left worldview: the misunderstood, outcast artist unable to communicate to the world except through his art; the ultra-Brady Bunch peasantry to whom the artist tries to communicate; the nearly insane religious element. As an allegory, it was really pathetic stuff: one star.The second time I watched it, years later, I saw it as satire. Could Burton be witty enough to parody the Hollywood elite this way? Does he recognize and lampoon the anti-religious bigotry so prevalent among his colleagues? Are those who don't see it really the numb-brains who live in the pastel-colored rubber-stamp suburb? Viewing Burton's creation from this framework significantly improved the picture - three stars.I give the film the mean of the two scores."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie.","review":"It's a must have Johnny Depp movie.The way Johnny Depp plays out in a movie,no one could do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Memory Lane is a Fun Little Jaunt!","review":"Who would imagine one person could turn a boy's dream into such a life of creativity, fun and success. This book is the quintessential read for anyone who has ever dreamed of being in the music business, or for that matter, has achieved their own niche of success in the field of entertainment.Innocent and delightfully written in first person perspective by the author, this tome takes you through the early years of rock and roll and into the nooks and crannies of a regular day catching a glimpse of those individuals we revere as stars. Buzz telling of meeting Cher, Stephen Stills, Bob Dylan, Martin Luther King....winning a grammy, writing hit songs. Perfect for an afternoon at the pool or the beach...I'm stuffing it in all my Christmas boxes this year!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't believe I found it on Amazon","review":"I'm quite certain that if you're buying this you already own the first four tracks from the re-release of Contradictions Collapse and we all know that they document Meshuggah's movement away from the Contradictions Collapse style and more towards the DEI and Chaospere style. However, this disc is definitely worth the price to Meshuggah fans insearch of Aztec Two-Step. I think this is Meshuggah's first foray in programmed/industrial style metal like the Mayhem Version of Future Breed Machine. It's a very cool and very weird track. I'm gonna leave it at that, you will not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great, short album","review":"This album is another example of the greatness that is Meshuggah.

The choices are fine, even daring. However, instead of insight, the reader gets poorly written stream-of-consciousness ramblings that add up to nothing but the author's feeble attempt to justify his choices...some of which he hasn't even experienced himself. If you like trivia or history, do not buy this book. If you like an author who thinks he is hip, smart, and funny but is none of these things, go for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"the reader from california is right","review":"Interesting idea and selections, but the book is agressively poorly written. His entries provide no new perspectives on the selected works. He alternates self-praise for his \\"Idiosyncratic\\" selections with rage at anyone who would critize one of the works.

He has a better internal sense of formand figure than 90% of today's artists, and he tells a terrificstory in words as well.Some of the break-out pages in the original book series arejust awesome, humbling showcases of talent and creativity.Anything I've ever learned about drawing, inking, framing apose, shortening my lines, bolding others, comes from his workin this series.

So boring that I only read half of it before I quit. The only reason this book gets two stars is because of Miller's artwork.

It's worth getting this one vs. saving $30 less & having a small/single player display.Pros: all the cricket games; the easy to see display (w/cricket scoring); can have up to 8 players.Cons: a lot of bounce outs; sometimes darts stick in but don't register, (even when throwing hard); the outer bullseye will spin. I'm guessing that these are problems with a lot of dartboards <$200."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy Construction","review":"The digital side of the board is great, but sadly little else can be said about this dartboard. It is a lot of money, and the dartboard I received had a lot of dead spots right out of the box. There were some zones on the board that could not be triggered even by a person striking the plate instead of a dart striking it. Was so disappointed with the quality I received I decided to go the refund route and look for a different dartboard instead of replacing this one, so keep that in mind reading this review. Only dealt with one of them, but that was enough for me. I have read enough other reviews with similar issues on this board that I did not want to play the replacement game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as Halex","review":"This is hard to explain, but my reason for 2 stars is based on feel.

Using it at the low setting work best for me. The scanner will scan medium format film properly. All you have to do is make a card board frame for it. One big problem I have with it is it won't create more than 6 thumbnails for batch scanning at 2400 dpi.

And they are unattractive to look at compared with the elegant interface of Apple TV. The reason I returned it was that if you want to view your photos, slide shows, videos, TV shows and podcasts there is no on screen display! They refer you back to your iPod to manually select them.

Not so! The directions (non-user friendly, confusing, and requiring the manuals for both products) say to connect the dock with the RI (interactive-capable) compatible inputs for cable/sat and change the name on the receiver to \\"dock\\". However, I'm using the receiver with satellite TV and need that input display. Evidently, there are no other RI compatible inputs for the dock on the receiver, so I'm reduced to using inputs (AUX or TAPE) that require a separate (not included) video cable that must be connected directly to the TV (inconvenient because wall-mounted in my case). The dock is handsome, sounds good, and makes a good charging station, but is certainly is not the plug-and-play accessory for my Onyko system I imagined when I purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Onkyo DS-A2X","review":"I purchased this unit on the assumption that I could display video from my latest generation Nano to my TV ... as yet no luck and would seem that this is not poossible. Very poor interface and the on-scrteen graphics are from the 80's. All in all very disapointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"nice, but osd doesn't work","review":"Overall, I like it, despite the following shortcomings. The interaction between the dock and the receiver is promising, except that the iPhone says \\"accessory attached\\" or something and since the \\"on screen display\\" won't display on the tv, I can't see what album, title, etc. is playing. I suspect it is an issue with the receiver (TX-SR505) not sending the video image on to the tv, but that is just a guess. I have to select the playlist or whatever and THEN plug the iPhone in to the dock. Lots of monkeying around with it so far and I'm still not done. Sounds great though. (Same issues with an iPod attached, btw.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice but...","review":"It works as advertised. Only one thing to be aware of. I use it with the Onkyo TX-SR705 receiver and video in/out have to be the same (component in and out or HDMI in and out or s-video in and out). When plugged into the dock, you lose the display on the Ipod itself. The only connection for the dock is component video. If you don't run a component video cable to your TV the Ipod won't display on the screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not compatible with latest iPod models!","review":"None of the information in the ad for this product states which iPod models are compatible with this.

It's not quite as intuitive with the controls as I would like. For example, you have to hit \\"MENU\\" to go up a level. And \\"SELECT\\" to play something. You can't just hit the play button.The on-screen display is black and white, like the old PONG games of the 70's. I expected it to have the same iPod screen look.

Made the mistake of buying this after getting a flyer leaflet in the box for my Onkyo Home Theatre system. The HT system is awesome, the dock is worthless.

Cheo is undoubtedly one of Puerto Rico's greatest singers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Marion!","review":"As an avid reader of this Avalon series, I was sorely disappointed in this book. One of the things I loved about the previous books was the mystique and magic of avalon. I found this to be lacking in this book as it focussed much more on history and battles and had (in my opinion) a very loose connection to avalon.It is a well written book, but it does sadly signify the end to the avalon series. The magic is gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally without \\"The Goddess\\"","review":"Sadly lacking in the mysticism SO central to \\"Mists of Avalon\\", which truly was a MASTERPIECE. I could not recommend this book to anyone who has been enchanted by Marion Zimmer Bradley in the past, or to anyone for that matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching and thought provoking","review":"I was surprised by the intensity of emotions and contemplations this book stirred in me. Unlike many of the other reviewers, I found the first person narrative not only effective but essential to this highly personal story about belief, controversy, tragedy and joy, a strange mixture of Christianity, paganism, feminism and individualism. There were aspects of this book that I could relate to, and other aspects that aroused my passionate disagreement. This book helped me re-contemplate myself as a woman and a Christian, rediscovering the more mystical aspects of my gender, my faith and my individual identity. Though I plan to read the Mists, I am glad that I have not read it before this book, thus approaching the Priestess of Avalon without preconceptions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Had waited and waited for another Marion Zimmer Bradley but have been sorely disappointed with this latest release. Unlike her other Avalon books, I found this extremely slow moving. I actually had to re-read parts as my mind drifted from boredom.The magic, mystery and excitement were missing. I will miss Marion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preistess of where?","review":"If you're a great fan of Mist's of Avalon the first book, I wouldn't waste my money on this one. I was exited about a new book by Ms. Zimmer. To my surprise thisBook was a complete disappointment! I'm sorry I wasted my money on it. If you would like to still read it, I suggest going to the library!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre entry in a wonderful series","review":"Boy was I excited when I saw there was a new entry in this series. Then I learned that MZB was dead and a co-author had worked on the book too. It shows. I almost quit this one in the middle, but persevered to the end. It had its ups and downs, and it was better than lots of stuff out there, but I did not like it as much as the other MZB Avalon books. It felt formulaic at times, but it also differed from the other books in some bad ways. I missed the Avalon setting, and the legendary feel that made the other books so good. Set in the cold light of the Roman empire, the story lost its sense of fantasy. And there was just not enough adventure going on. Even the big romance left me kind of cold. To rank the four books in this series: Mists is by far the best, then Lady, then Forest, then Priestess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. I can't believe that this is written by the same person as wrote the truly wonderful \\"Mists of Avalon\\". The story is very superficial and the characters so undeveloped that I had no interest in them and did not care what happened to them.This book would have been better left unfinished."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unfortunate disappointment","review":"I bought this book with the expectation that it would be another \\"Mists\\". Unfortunately, I was quite mistaken. I found this book to be so boring that I didn't even make it through the whole thing--I kept putting it down and picking it up a few weeks later thinking I would eventually finish it, but I never did. For one, Helena may start off as a strong character, but once her husband and son enter the picture, she becomes content to just sit back and watch all of the excitement happen to them. I found it odd that a woman with such intellect and education would quietly retire to her country house, only kept informed by letters and the once-every-few-years visit of her son. I'd recommend not reading this one. Read \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" again instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"I, like many others, was delighted by \\"Mists of Avalon\\" and thought that I might enjoy this additional offering by MZB. Unfortunately, it is a real disappointment. The early chapters of Eilan's life on Avalon were interesting, but the latter part of the book, as she follows Constantius to place after place (they all really blur together) was a real chore to get through. Constantine is a real jerk, and I found myself wondering why anyone would really care about any of this twaddle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"Fails to capture any of what makes the first book more special. There is no Arthur, no Merlin, no Morgan, none of those characters at all really, but more of other priestesses that on reading, that I had no interest in. I guess it boils down to the less Arthuriana, the lower the rating, for this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, but at times...a little disturbing","review":"Originally, the cover and name \\"Priestess of Avalon\\" caught my attention. Throughout the story, I often wanted to shout at Helena and tell her to follow her own heart, rather than that of Avalon's. At times, all I could do was imagine slapping her husband's face off. I enjoyed the visions and psychic elements she experienced, especially in the cave in Israel. Also, it was quite interesting to learn of Helena's ancient religion, which for all we know, could be the modern day form of Wicca. I have grown quite fond of the name \\"Leviyah\\" as well. This is one of those books you might only read once, but the once will be just enough to leave you wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Series being misread?","review":"I am rather dissapointed with the other reviews. It sounds to me like everyone else who has read the book/series is completely missing the societal overtones of the entire series, but most notably with Priestess of Avalon. Not a single person has mentioned what a wonderfull book this is in respect to teaching/reminding us of religious tolerance and womens rights. The entertwining stories of the series are entertaining but I think these most important points are being missed by the other readers and perhaps everyone should reread them with that in mind. Certainly a great series for teenagers as it is easy to read and many good lessons in life can be taught by reading them (so long as you have an open mind).All in all this is a good book but a bit dry compared to the others in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time ! ! !","review":"This book was hugely over-written and extermely boring. I was tempted multiple times to just stop reading it, but I kept slogging through it, hoping it would get better. It didn't, until the very last chapter. If you are looking for the magical writing from the Mists of Avalon, it's not there - at least not in last three quarters.This is a huge historical read. There is chapter after chapter of detail about the growing Christianity and the battle between Christians and Paganism. The main character loses herself as an individual over and over again to support the men in her life, and in the end, becomes practically a slave to her son's bidding -- Constantine, the Emperor of Rome. It was pathetic to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fans of \\"Mists of Avalon,\\" don't get your hopes up...","review":"I anxiously awaited this book as I own & reread Mists of Avalon, Lady of Avalon, and Forest House. I was extremely disappointed with this book, however.There is very little of Avalon or indeed Paganism after the first few chapters. The main character ends up basically turning to christianity. If I wanted to read about that, I'd go back to church. Gave the impression that worshipping the Goddess was not enough, though in the other 3 books in the series, it was the main idea. I skipped several sections and read it over the course of a week, when I usually read a book in a day or two. I also sold mine as \\"barely used\\" as soon as I finished it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No...No...NO MORE!!!","review":"I mourned MZB's passing in 1999, but also saw it as the end of the ongoing slew of Mists prequels which were, so far as I'm concerned, detrimental to the lustre of the original.Now I get slapped with Priestess of Avalon. No, I did not like it, and yes, I could detect the absence of MZB's thought and skill. To be honest, I have a hard time fitting this one into the Avalon series--what with its first person narrative and overall different feeling. There's not much of a story here at all--and after reading Forest House and Lady of Avalon, that's pretty bad. In sum, I suspect the publishers sought to link MZB and Avalon one more time in search for the almighty dollar. That, I think, is the biggest shame of all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawless","review":"Sinister get better with every album, but their style is what makes them so great.

Pat Garrett chronicles the early days of Billys' life and how he became the man he was. It was frustrating to read here and there because of the writing style of the author, but it is a very good book all in all. I recommend it to anyone interested in the life of the Kid, why some hated him and others would do anything for him. He was only 21 years old when Pat Garrett ended his life literally inches from him in a dark bedroom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Billie the kid","review":"I love it!!Much like he Young Guns 2 .Emilio Estevez played the part as his charater was described in this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky","review":"A quirky account of the old west.

A couple of interesting things: Garrett and his men have Billy and his men cornered,but it's time for breakfast, so they ride several miles to eat at somebody's ranch, then come back to the business of catching The Kid. Another time, they have The Kid and pals surrounded for hours and the outlaws have no food. They smell Garrett's men cooking bacon and make a deal to come out peacefully for breakfast . Apparently.breakfast was the most important meal of the day. Despite this and the fact that Billy the Kid had buck teeth, there wasn't a while lot that was interesting about this book except the fact of who wrote it. Garrett was the man who killed The Kid and I suppose wanted to establish for posterity that it was a righteous kill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have used a ghostwriter here!!!","review":"Some very interesting facts are in this book. However, the book is dry and boring. So much work went into putting this book together, that it's a shame there wasn't a ghostwriter working with Mr. Garrett to capture the emotions and the urgency in what could have been a fascinating book. I'm afraid I only got halfway through this book, before I gave up. I hate to walk away from a book without finishing it... but there was no way I could finish this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A SHAME..","review":"A shame that Mr. Garrett had absolutely no writing talent at all, because the book could be good, dealing about one of the greatest legendsof all times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad...","review":"Unfortunately, this book could have been much better, because it has authenticity: it was written by the man who killed The Kid. But Garrett's style of writing is horrible; it is an irregular narrative, without any talent. Sometimes it looks like a diary, sometimes it looks like written in a rush. I has absolutely no emotion about himself or the Kid and practicaly no in-depth research. It added most of the legends now surrounding the Kid."},{"rating":"1","title":"An interesting book of sorts","review":"This book starts out slow and dry. It didn't get exciting until Pat Garrett started to take over the story. This doesn't occur until about midway through the book. Don't expect this to be a screenplay for the movies Young Guns and Young Guns II. The book isn't that exciting but it does introduce you to an interesting character profile of Billy the Kid. Personally I feel that the first half of the book is fiction that is read for pure entertainment and the second half covers the real story of the Kid. I would recommend this book if you are interested in the Kids story and you want to read every angle of his story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly pleased","review":"It's an entire world away from the Young Guns movies, but it's a fantastic read. The words that Garrett uses are intelligent, but humorous because we are seldom lead to believe that common people from that time period were so educated. I think it's a great book, I recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's hot, Eddie's drank all the lemoande, what will Maisy do","review":"If you are the parent of a young child, you probably know who Maisy is.

Why the crocodile isn't trying to eat the others is beyond me, but that's life in Maisy's world.Both of my daughters love the Maisy books; there's something about their simple stories and colorful pictures that even appeals to adults. The books are short and easy to read. But, the stories are never obnoxiously simplistic, like so many other books for small children.Maisy's enjoying a cool drink when Eddie decides to slurp it all up. What will Maisy and Eddie do?

Don Dokken produced the album, but his presence was about the only high point here; he gives the band a more \\"polished\\" sound, but the material is about as dull and uninspired as it gets, which clearly shows that Vitus was going through the motions musically and on it's last legs--vocalist Scott Weinrich was replaced on this album by Christian Linderson, who is even more dull and boring, and imitates Weinrich almost to the point of parody.Vitus did a rearranged version of it's own \\"Hallow's Victim\\" by slowing it down and naming it \\"Exhumed\\" (they should've left it buried), and guitarist Dave Chandler called himself \\"D.C. Vitus\\" on the credits (no doubt an ode to M.C. Hammer?). My overall opinion is, stick with the Scott Reagers-era albums on SST and don't waste your time and money; this CD is out of print and probably will never see the light of day again, and for a good reason: it sucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy on Hype, Light on Information","review":"I really wanted to like it, I didn't much care for the Ratner's Introduction to Nano.

It has the advantage of being light and handy, and many entries are furnished with references to semantic variations based on the different dialects.However, in being concise, the dictionary chose to omit those lengthy lexical references which are presented in the bulky volumes of the CAD (in English) or AhW (in German, on which this dictionary is based), thus rendering an interpretation of texts based solely on this book somewhat unreliable.

It gives no examples using ampere's law and its covering of induced emf is absolutely awful. The circuit examples it gives are too simple and the practice questions never require the calculus derivations (such as ones using Gauss's law) that are covered on the C test.

The book is entertaining, interesting, and informative. It provides terrific insight into early modern Europe's mentalite, which for AP Euro, is a great launching point. Oldridge takes witchcraft, pig trials, walking dead, and other phenomenon and puts them into accurate historical context, explaining why those made perfect sense to a European of the 15th century. The author uses modern examples that put \\"ridiculous\\" medieval beliefs in perspective and challenge the reader to examine our own modern beliefs. A good read for teachers and students alike!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Retro Thinking for the Masses","review":"How can you beat a title like this? It offers a wide range of opportunities to explore the highways and byways of Medieval & Renaissance worldviews. Oldridge offers a unique insight into the how & why our ancestors viewed such transgressions to the social contract of the time, and the complete normalcy of those views. What I found off putting was the rather superficial coverage that is offered to the topics the author selects. I have found other books that explore similar topics with more depth and penache. A welcome addition for the beginning student of historical oddities library. The style of this book is scholarly in a Master's thesis sort of way with an odd forced sense of humor that is unwelcomed. It lacks the immediacy needed to communicate why we did & do the things we do as human beings. In the final analysis- we are still creatures of absurd superstitions & prejudices.

There is something about the melodies and the lyrics of Sam Phillips that makes the songs irresistibly catchy.They're not catchy in a bubble-gum pop way, however. The songs catch me right in the gut. There is a part of me that responds wholeheartedly to a vision like that of Sam Phillips; a world which is wry, sly and knowing. This is music that is written to appeal to adults and people who think like adults.The friend who recommended the album to me said it was \\"old-timey,\\" but the more I listen, the more I think that's completely the wrong way to describe it.

In his witty introduction Lewis Carroll said he himself didn't know what it was about; he said it ought to be about what anyone wanted it to be about. It's just a peep into that famous subconscious of his, I suppose. Personally I think it is about endings and perhaps death yet it is so funny and memorable, and full of strange images. It's worth getting an annotated version although personally I don't think this annotated edition covers everything you need to know. Henry Holiday's pictures are terrific; in a way, as good as Tenniel's - for a very different kind of book. (For Alice fans, this poem takes place on the island of Jabberwock.

I find this book too politicly correct, so much trying to be \\"correct\\" that it isn't interesting, it does not deal with real people. This book is too schematic, with the same stereotyped characters - one \\"good\\" \\"ideal\\" family (Iggies's) one \\"bad\\" family with all the old fashioned ideas and the one in the middle - the writer's family.

While Winnie doesn't have a problem with the Garbers being black, several of her neighbors do since the area had always been occupied by white residents. So out of loyalty to her new friends, Winnie sets out to crusade against the racism in her neighborhood.Although \\"Iggie's House\\" isn't my favorite Judy Blume book (though I doubt I'll ever give her less than 5 stars on any book), she's great at tackling social problems, such as racism in this book, showing how children typically see things in just black and white, so to speak. Though prejudices aren't as easily overcome as shown here, \\"Iggie's House\\" is still a great learning tool for preteens."},{"rating":"2","title":"a book of reality","review":"This book is short and you can read it in a couple of days or if you love to read it may only take you a couple of hours. The book is about a girl named Winnie whose best friend moves away and her best friends house is sold to a black family named the Gerbers. Know one in the neighborhood likes them. Every one in their neighborhood is white.This book teaches a valuable lesson that color of skin does not matter. You can hang out with who ever you want no matter what your nationality .

Mrs.Landon (or Germs Inc.) is putting out a petition to send the Garbers away just because they're black. So when the going gets tough, Winnie tries to do something about it.What I think about this book is that it can teach you about how hard minorities have it sometimes. It's a wonderful book and teaches you not to judge a person by how they look. I recommend that if you want to read this book you should not be predjudiced and if you are it would teach you a lesson.

His \`\`Free Jazz'' is not the best place to understand what he and his collaborators are doing - simultaneously improvising different solos based on the melody Coleman composes without harmonic chordal structures to base their solos on - but with \`\`Science Fiction'' his approach is easy to follow, and rich with melodic invention.

Lucy Lui plays the trampy girl - horribly. Lolita Davidovich was the only character worth watching. And I like Woody Harrelson. But not in this movie. Antonio Banderas was a whiny boxer. Woody Harrelson was a Christian boxer who sees Jesus occasionally. The first 1 Hour & 15 minutes is the ride to Vegas. Why didn't they just fly? It would have been more enjoyable for the audience.

This is a good book to bring with you when you visit the Park.What stopped me from giving this book 5-stars was that most of the information available in the book is also available on the internet.

Forgotten 80's low-budget vixen Rae Dawn Chong (see also: Beat Street) plays this film's homicide detective (w/'tude), and is characteristically hollow. One can't help but gawk as the film turns four-letter words into one-liners. Even technical errors mar the continuity--perhaps the crew was sacrificed to land Antonio Vargas in the only respectable performance. Where special effects and a name supposedly saved similar disasters as \\"Spawn,\\" this film really can't fall back on anything.

After an hour of being barraged by these images, you feel that you would have been compelled to swiftly exit Nazi Germany to another land to not be swept up in this tide of National Socialism. Its pervasiveness is so claustrophobic that you either flee or become enfolded within it. My eyes glazed over after that astonishing hour and I'd seen more than enough of the Nazis.

This film adds to fuel to the fire on the greatest enigma of the 20th Century, but provides no illumination on its causes, but then again, it was not made to illuminate, but to persuade, and that it does, all too well.

It captures all of the splendor and wonder of the Third Reich, as well as providing a tantalizing, though incomplete, glimpse into the National Socialist ideology. Aside from the astounding film techniques, the content is riveting, the speeches are hypnotic (Hitler's, at least,) and the rallies are overwhelming.While I understand that most people who watch this film will go into it with many pre-conceived notions, it is best viewed with an open mind. Rather than seeing it as a propaganda film, which it was not, by the way, view it as you would a documentary.Regardless, whether your believe in the National Socialist ideology or not, this film is a masterpiece, as is shown by the numerous 5 star reviews it has been given. Watch it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great special features","review":"The movie came on time. It has great special features, including a voice-over by a historian.

It highlights what the nazis and Hitler were really like. Hitler cast a spell on me and his speeches were absoloutly mesmerizing.

On the other hand, you could watch this, feel mesmerised by the sheer power of the images, then realise that it is all a big advert for the basest crimes against humanity. Perhaps the greatest horror film of all time - as Dr. Alpher has suggested.On that point - English won out against German as the national language in the U.S by a single vote (check 'Made in America').

What it is - is cinematic art. Propoganda never looked so beautiful. Most people agree Adolf Hitler was the 20th century's greatest villian. But for a brief period in history, Hitler was the face of hope to many Germans. Not above a little self promotion, Hitler recognized early on the value of cinema. He hand selected Leni Riefenstahl, a young German actress/filmmaker to direct the first great propoganda movie. Granted total control and unlimited funds, Riefenstahl produced her master work - Triumph of the Will.

I suspect that the desire to claim victory over an evil and highly dangerous enemy after the war had a great deal to do with it.Leni Riefenstahl has a great reputation as a film maker of propaganda, but so does Eisenstein, and Eisenstein did it twenty years earlier.

About 70 minutes into the film it started to get the wobblies. The images became broken up and pixelated and then the image froze altogether whilst the sound continued. Then the sound froze.

While much of the footage is interesting from a historical point of view,the photography has not been digitally remastered. As for content, a more descriptive title my be \\"Hitler Goes to a Parade.\\" It becomes repetitive for the length of the film. The narration, does nothing to enhance the film. \\"Hitler put himself on a pedestal.\\" We know that. What we want to know is how does a tryant like Hitler take control of a couple of million people and bring them and himself to total destruction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"One can only wonder if the other reviewers actually watched this film, or if they were simply mesmerized by Riefenstahl's reputation for \\"genius\\" and the film's \\"influence.\\" Aside from a few remarkable scenes (the scenes everyone is familiar with, even if they don't know the filmmaker's name), and the lurid subject, the film is virtually unwatchable. Like many big-budget, modern studio creations, the trailer is the best part, and seeing it in its entirety can only detract from the power of \\"those\\" scenes. No film of which the trailer is better than the whole can be a great film, and no filmmaker can be called \\"great\\" based on a few minutes of stunning footage in an expanse of ennui."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jim Freyer - A college student","review":"I was forced to watch this movie in my Film Communications Class.

I bought the DVD for the sole purpose of seeing the 30 minute Day of Freedom and was saddened to see the usual version, which for academic purposes is missing all of Reel #2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality is a bit disappointing...","review":"I've owned a VHS copy of this film for 20 years or so and was eager to replace it with a DVD. I'd hoped for better quality than this. On the other hand, the optional running commentary by historian Dr. Anthony R. Santoro is worth the price of admission. If you want to understand the evil that was Adolf Hitler and Naziism, you gotta go to the original source material and this is the Real Deal. This is how Hitler and his people wanted the world to see them and, given the perspective of history, it's far more revealing than they could have known at the time.No wonder than Frank Capra borrowed heavily from Triumph of the Will when he wanted to show the sinister aspect of the Nazis in his \\"Why We Fight\\" series of films for the U.S. armed forces.If you're serious about history or film (or the history of film), this DVD belongs in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent film!","review":"This is the best film made by the last \\"classic\\" Empire of the XX century.

I have it set up between my computer moniter and tower and watch it while doing mindless work at the keyboard (like right now) so the viewing angle is fairly constant. Because of a limited viewable angle, it could be a bit of a problem in the kitchen where you are moving around.My only serious gripe: there seems to be no way to aquire the optional security camera, which was one of its nicest selling points (its listed on the box). I have even emailed Audiovox with no response. Judging from the products listed on Audiovox's website, this TV and all accessories have been discontinued, so beware.

The first 20 pages have words listed in alphabetical order. That's it. No definitions, contexts, synonyms, antonyms or anything else.

Only the argument counts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manufacturing dissent of dissent.","review":"I find it very ironic that so many documentaries have been made about a DOCUMANTARIAN. Listen, Moore wears his liberal bias on his sleave. He has stated on many occasions that he presents one side of a story, in defense of the other side of stories being told on a daily basis by corporations, politicians, and our very own news media. And speaking of the media, no one thing/person has been attacked more harshly by Moore in his films than the media. I find that very ironic as well, because if you listen to the Bill O'Reilly's and Rush Limbaugh's of the world, our news media has a strong left wing bias.Look, if you don't like Michael Moore's opinion, fine. But it's not like the other side isn't being represented 24/7."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Have Done a Much Better Job","review":"I am not a MM fan. I absolutely disagree with his methods.

Hollywood is showing its true colors by giving him awards in documentary categories.I don't know if I agree with his politics or not. With all of his lies and extremism, I really don't know what he stands for, other than making money.As far as this film is concerned, it really only scratches the surface in challenging his films. They would have been better off focusing more on his film inaccuracies.

Accordingly, where consciousness also focuses on the internal senses and reality, and with the awareness of the multidimensional nature of reality and of the self - the ego is perceived as one (quite useful) aspect of consciousness. Damning the ego feeds the illusion of conflict at the very core of one's self. This illusion may feel true due to information primarily perceived and cognized via the external senses - but this is not the \\"fault\\" of the ego. For non-conflict based explorations of the psyche read Jane Roberts, J Krishnamurti, Ken Wilber, or search \\"multidimensionality\\".

I am SO tired of revisionist historical novels.

It doesn't even deserve one star...I normally like Allende, especially her short story 'And of Clay We Are Created,' but this book was predictable, boring, and incredibly long-winded. What really irritated me was that after wading through all of the romantic muck and life-changing revelations, it doesn't even have a good ending! It's like she got tired of the book (can't blame her there--if it was that tedious to read it, I can't imagine what it was like to actually WRITE it), so she tacked on a chapter that could be miscontrued as a conclusion.

It lacks emotion, descriptions, finesse, there is no character development, and the story jumps around, even telling what'll happen later in the book....

Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Having loved the brilliant House of the Spirits and Eva Luna, imagine my disappointment at this shallow and predictable book.

Her characters are absolutely superb - even the minor players are rich in detail and give wonderful depth to the story.

I was growing up as a 'lady' with a steel rod in my back...I was aboard a rolling ship heading towards my lost love...My heart cried daily on the journey I was undertaking...I was overjoyed to meet so many wonderful people...and in the end, I smiled in agreement, wiped away a tear, and closed the book.

She describes the Anglo-saxon world, South American world and Chinese world with such vivacity it feels as though she is actually writing an autobiography. The variation of moods present in the novel ensure excitment, and a sense of guilt came over me when ever I put it down. My first Isabelle Allende, I will now read her earlier works with dedication.

But I was disappointed. The plot seemed weak - the main character has a short affair with a man and then searches for him all over the west coast for years. She starts by going from Chili to California in the cargo hold of a ship. Then she goes in cognito for years, all the time looking for him. Finally, at the end the author seems to get bored and ends it quickly. It is weak and appears to be thrown together. This was the monthly read for the book club and most of the other women seemed to like it but I thought that it was a bit of a waste. I did learn a bit about the environment of California during the god rush but I think I could have learned about that without reading the almost 400 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical fiction at its best!","review":"My love of this book comes less from the story, captivating though it may be, but from the wonderful setting the story takes place in.Allende is phenomenal at bringing Gold Rush California to life. The book's main characters are immigrants in the period, and their experiences provide a vibrant insight into what life may have been like in this exciting, yet tumultuous, period.The story also provides great insights for one's own life (as all good stories do).

The characters are well defined in this translation from the spanish and the action is compelling.

These characters teach us ensightful lessons throughout the story. A great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Please write a sequel to this story","review":"I enjoyed the story. The writing is lyrical and lively. It is a fast read. I always appreciate the gift Ms. Allende has for intertwining culture, history and drama. I did get caught up in the character development and their individual stories. Some of the writing made me think of The Poisonwood Bible, and some of Joy Luck Club. There were so many characters and so many things happening to them. I'm not sure if this was intentional and it was not a drawback of this book. . The characters were unique. If there is a drawback it is that I wanted to learn more about what happens to the characters. So much time was invested in describing them. I think there should be a sequel. Please tell me what happens to the characters or should I just assume they were part of the the great California past and let them all go? It would be so interesting to follow their offspring into the millenium."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine read","review":"This is the first book of Isabel Allende that I read and I am not planning to stop. In \\"Daughter of Fortune\\" coming-of-age story of a girl is explored against the background of california gold rush.

One review said that the ending is abrubt...I don't think it is...As noted by one of the main male characters when consoling the main female character \\"Nothing is in vain.

I enjoyed this book more than any other in quite a while,it has believable characters that are very well-written,especially Tao!I enjoyed the descriptions of of both 19th century Chile and the Gold Rush,better than the dry,boring textbooks of grade school.

It's really a good read .Allende is about the best author writing today. along with Tawni O'dell's \\"Back roads\\" and Asher Brauner's \\"love songs of the tone deaf\\" this is the best fiction I've read in ages"},{"rating":"1","title":"marin hot tubber seeks talent, style","review":"I used to teach high school, and after listening to my ninth grade girls ooh and ahh about miss allende, I felt obligated to at least be in the conversation. And, like the sad little boy with his nose pressed against the window desperately wanting to be with the in crowd not realizing that they were as vapid and venal as could be, I took the plunge, dropped good money, only to find, or fail to find, an ounce of quality between the covers. I wanna be 14 again"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good Literature","review":"I bought this book in an airport because I'd never read anything by Allende but saw her name enough to assume she was one of the good new writers. I also figured that since Oprah recommended her for her book club that the writing was, well, good. I don't know how much suffered in translation, but the writing was OK at best. Worse, the story reminded me of those second-rate historical novels my mom used to give me as an adolescent. For example, during a sex scene Allende actually describes the heroine's nipples as \\"strawberries\\" -- I'm not kidding. At the same time the love scenes weren't graphic enough to make it a steamy romance worth reading for the sex. Nothing for no one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scarcely better than a Danielle Steele novel","review":"I had high hopes for this book. Other Oprah Picks that I have read have been good. This book -- taking place in both Chile (exotic to me) and California (always interesting) seemed promising. It is sort of a sappy love story, though. A book equivalent of the \\"chick flick\\" for sure (and I am a woman). I don't like to read books that are so clearly only appropriate for one gender. If you like \\"love stories\\" with little else to them, this will be a small step up from the usual drivel because Allende does write well. If you prefer books with any substance, however, steer clear of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the great Allende?","review":"Never having read any Allende, I was looking forward to this choice of my book group. What a disappointment. This is a poorly written, poorly edited, historical romance, more suited to serialization in a supermarket ladies' magazine."},{"rating":"2","title":"It fell apart at the end","review":"I listened to this on audio and was mesmerized for the most part. I loved the charachters and how the plot wove between Chile, China and California. However when I got to the last disc I thought how on earth is this all going to tie together. It seems that Ms Allende is setting us up for a sequel.That's the only explanation that I can see because it leaves the reader hanging to some degree. Daughter of Fortune is better than Zorro and I think it is because there is more character development of the women. I also found it interesting how Ms Allende described the many types of love that one encounters in one's lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"I LOOOOOOVED THIS BOOK!

She weaves fiction and reality seamlessly, you feel as if you have known the characters for years! Although the plots at first seem completely unlikely, Allende is so convincing that by the end of the book, the story is totally logical!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtle presence of Native themes","review":"I wouldn't call \\"Daughter of Fortune\\" a Native-themed book because the Native presence is muted. But Eliza's mother is Chilean, so she's part Native. More important, Eliza's upbringing is a tug-of-war between Rose, the Englishwoman who represents intellect, artificiality, and constraint, and Mama Fresia, the Indian woman who represents passion, genuineness, and freedom.When Eliza escapes to America, the land of opportunity, her Indian side comes to the fore. Like the Californians around her, she learns to eschew antiquated concepts such as honor, propriety, and convention. In other words, she throws off the shackles of European civilization and becomes a \\"noble savage.\\"Rob's rating: 8.0 of 10.

It becomes apparent that the search for her lover becomes an impossible mission, but instead she finds the fabric of which she's made and discovers a new life of promise. I found myself living \\"the adventure\\" in Eliza's shoes, smelling the musty stench of fish nets on the cargo boat and visualize the wrinkley face lines of Dr. Tao Chi'en who becomes an unlikely friend and confidant to Eliza.

Most dissapointing. A preditcable tale about a young woman with troubles in love. The writing was very simple (perhaps because of the translation). I have so little free time that I want a book that engages me and compels me to put off all other things and read -read-read. This is not that book. Oprah, you did so well selecting good writers of great novels earlier in your book club. Go back to good writers, please. If you want a book that will knock your socks off: good writing and great story, I suggest The Pact by Jodi Picoult.

I heard 3 tapes (out of 10) and decided to skip to the last one to wrap up the story.....I thought that a \\"sudden ending\\" would have happened after one tape.....the only line that didn't get solved for me (probably happened in the 9th tape) is what was her parentage? If I can find someone else who read the book, maybe I'll find the answer to the most interesting storyline in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"not the first Allende book to read","review":"I'm a true fan of Allende's works and I must say very few contemporary writers are gifted with her eloquence which turns prose into poetry and her amazing ability to imagine. This book, nonetheless, is not the first book I'd recommend to anyone who hasn't read Allende before. It's a captivating story, simply a beautiful narration of the saga of Eliza and Tao Chi'en. However, considering the discontentment the ending brings, one can only hope that Ms Allende chooses to continue the saga in the nearest future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money....","review":"If you have ever read a book by Allende before, please don't read this one. It will cause you to lose all respect for her as a writer. I'll wait to check out the next one from the library before I buy her books blindly again. I was reading Ahab's Wife (Naslund) at the same time and though the stories are similar, the quality of the writing and story are so much better in Ahab's Wife."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I was very disappointed in this book, especially I loved \\"House of Spirits\\" and also liked \\"Eva Luna\\".

And normally, I like any of the books in the Oprah club. However, this book was ridiculous. The book is very poorly written with a wondering plot, that introduces characters and situations that never go anywhere. It was hard to like the heroine or any of the characters.

Allende is a fine story teller, with that mix of intellect and natural audience appeal that is often so hard to find in the mix of today's media assault. Her stories in this series will be that much more of interest if you have had the good fortune to travel to Chile, the home country of both \\"Daughter\\" and \\"Portrait.\\" This was indeed a delightful series to discover, and has been matched with a reader who effectively draws you in with her rapt attention to nuance and a distinct understanding of the lives whose stories she must tell.You will find this book appealing if you are a fan of historical novels, South American travel, and/or seek characters whose lives contain the full range of love, disappointment, and wondrous discovery."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment to a True Allende Fan","review":"I have always classified myself as a die-hard Allende fan, but Daughter of Fortune has caused me to reevaluate my devotion. The lengthy descriptions I've savored as poetry in Allende's previous works I found to be dry and dull in Daughter of Fortune. The character development was shallow and I found the plot to be predictable. >sigh< This was not Allende's finest work by any stretch..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book never connected","review":"The premise of this story was promising, but it just never connected. I did not find the characters to be believable. I did enjoy the historical and cultural information, but I was never able to quite believe this story. These people never fleshed out into humanity and their story seemed to go nowhere. I have read worse, but I picked up this book with hopes of a good read. Finished it right away but with a sense of disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Isabel Allende, who is usually a marvelous writer, has this time written nothing more than a tepid romance novel. Also, she fills the second half of this book spitting out facts about the California Gold Rush, giving the impression that she is trying to woo us with all the research she did on this period in history. I do not recommend Daughter of Fortune."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing","review":"I love Isabel Allende's books and was really looking forward to the next one. However, this seems written by a different author. The characters had no depth, the story was predictable and boring, and although my faith in Allende's writing took me through more of the book than I would ever have read otherwise, I found this a very shallow, teenage, commercial read. I would recommend any of her other books, including \\"Paula\\", \\"Eva Luna\\" and \\"The House of the Spirits\\", but skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Allende Weaves Another Wonderful Tale","review":"I really enjoyed Daughter of Fortune from beginning to end, although, unlike another reviewer, I thought the book got better as it went along. There are many characters here: English colonialists, the Chilean upper and under classes, the Chinese in China and California, 49ers, prostitutes and bandits. Their stories are all key to helping our heroine, Eliza, finally come to understand herself. The descriptions of colonial Valparaiso and northern California during the Gold Rush are fascinating. The only think lacking in the story is a real understanding of Eliza's love, Joaquin Andieta. I was initially disappointed that for all Allende invested in Eliza's passion Joaquin seemed little more than a device to get her from Chile to California. But I was satisfied in the end that at least Eliza understood what he had really been."},{"rating":"2","title":"Allende had me spellbound, awaiting the next paragraph...","review":"how richly this book was writter, bravo ms allende, this is a great read and so i am surprised that others seem to pan it, WHATEVER! i say to them....this book is a wonderful, dreamy yet realistic book, if that makes sense. i am un abashedly impressed, in 3 days i read half the book! it's gripping, and has SUCH a magical resonance to it! i am hooked! :o) this book takes you to another place, rivoting, to another time, a great diversion from (in my case) the not so great aspects of my urban commute in manhattan to home in the NYC borough wherein i reside. it is so accessible and fascinating. A MUST READ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Choose it for an excitement reading!","review":"Don't get confused, every writer has to propose you a story, and your inner feelings will show you that this one is a must, with the Isabel's high quality style.Could be better books from Isabel?, you can bet, and even though the author propose you an ending that is requesting your imagination, from my personal point of view, the book is so exciting that you want to never end its reading, and that's what gives you such an empty sensation at the end.Here you'll find a lot of motivations for the story that maybe could be not so clear for american readers, like Joaquin Murieta appareance. I don't know if the translation is quite rigorous enough, but I'm sure you'll going to have a real good time.If your goal is make comparisons or prepared a literature paper, perhaps your choice is another kind of book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing New Book","review":"I must say I way pretty dissappointed in this book and finished it just because Allende had written it and I was waiting for it to improve. The characters are very implausible and the storyline goes nowhere really. I would suggest that people save their money and reread House of the Spirits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the paperback","review":"I enjoyed the general sense of history and adventure in this book, but the story of Eliza got reduced more and more once the halfway point was reached. The writing became very simple, using unimaginative language that was not at all compelling. After four years of searching for her lost lover, we are told that \\"She wasn't sure of her feelings and she didn't know whether it was love or pride that was driving her to wait for him .\\" This sounded to me like something out of a Harlequin Romance novel. Wasn't sure?? After four years of hell??I found the ending to be yawningly predictable, and not at all interesting. After all of that reading, I at least wanted something that validated this tragic journey. This was a woman who had braved the ocean and a number of life threatening situations, and yet the ending might just as well have said \\"and she lived happily ever after.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Left a bit to be desired...","review":"I finished the book, but I had to force myself. The characters were intriguing, but the story line drew on so long that it became monotonous. I feel that Allende could have told the story in 100 fewer pages.The ending was not what I anticipated, but for all the story lines that were created within the whole book, it sure didn't give me a sense of closure."},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't want it to end!","review":"This historical fiction combines descriptive and evocative prose, a wonderfully rich and complex story line and an exotic and often cruel setting. This is the first book I've read by the author and I am now ready for more. Although it drags at times and you wish the characters would come together more often to interact, I didn't want the book to end. I am hoping for a sequel where these interesting lives can continue on. My view is that this book only scratches the surface of these complex characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"During the portion of the book which takes place in Chile, the writer held my attention and character development was adequate. The story line was a little far fetched and unfortunately, she chose to foreshadow the ending in two undeniable ways at the beginning of the book.If you are aware at all of California history, there will not only be no mystery in this book, but you may find that the premise is so simplistic and obvious that it borders on being insulting. The second half of the book lacks character, plot and contextual development. It almost seemed that she felt she needed to write a book and based her story on what she believed to be an obscure part of California's History. She erred in that, as it is, in fact, one of the more celebrated and oft told stories about California."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely","review":"I thought this was a beautiful book full of atmosphere and well-developed characters.

Ms. Allende had obviously done much research on conditions in CA during the gold rush and felt motivated to build some sort of story around it. But it just didn't work for me. And the ending was such a disappointment. We're left to imagine what happens - maybe I'm just simple but I like things wrapped up a bit more. As an example, what happened to all of Eliza's jewels?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarassing Effort by Allende","review":"I am so disappointed in Isabel Allende. Previously a big fan of House of the Spirits and Paula, this book turned me off completely. It read as though it had been composed by a mooning teenager rather than a world class author. The story lacks depth and is one of the most tedious sagas I've ever waded through. The heroine Eliza is anemic, the love story frankly unbelievable and the Chinese character just a shade shy of caricature. Blech!Phooey! I think Oprah rescued this book from the scrap pile of the remainder box, because it's hard to imagine why anyone would seek out this putrid soap opera piece otherwise. If Allende can't do any better than this, she should find another line of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soap Opera","review":"With this book Isabel Allende has attempted a leap from magical realism (\\"The House of the Spirits,\\" \\"Eva Luna,\\" \\"Of Love and Shadows\\") into conventional historical drama, unfortunately with a most unsuccessful result. It does not measure to her previous writings! Using a wide canvas and multi-ethnic characters, the author goes into the realm of absurdity, of unrealistic twists of plots, boring and inconsistent characters. Dealing with the old and never-ending \\"love theme\\" can only be stretched up to a certain point, otherwise the result becomes a soap opera. And as much as soap operas are popular, so does this book became popular. The result is clear: reviews have been extremits, it's either \\"love it\\" or \\"hate it!\\" The main character's (Eliza) last words are: \\"I am free!\\" For some readers it was a relief, but others wanted more... Disappointment for readers of Isabel Allende, disappointment for the choice made by Oprah."},{"rating":"1","title":"Merely a pleasant story...","review":"This book tells a story, but had no particularly interesting insights, no real content.

The prose is rich with detail, the tale is adventurous, and it gives a lot of information out about the gold rush in California.

I've recently been bored of Ophra's choices."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good historical novel","review":"I have very mixed feelings regarding Isabel Allende's Daughter of Fortune. It took me a very long time to get into the novel, although I found the characters interesting and the writing beautiful. Maybe it was because the hook of a woman following her lover is not an intriguing one for me. While I found young Eliza Sommers to be an interesting character, I had no patience with her when she fell in love.The second half of the story was very interesting to me> I liked the historical detail about China, life at sea and especially California during the gold rush. I am very fond of historical novels and thought this was well done.I didn't find this to be a novel of much depth or insight, which isn't a real concern for me, because I read more for entertainment than enlightenment. It was a good historical novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good book","review":"i liked this book much better than \\"house of spirits,\\" which was an uneasy mixture of journalism and magical realism. here allende creates a better mix of history and magical realism. the characters are engaging (eliza and tao chi'en are my favorites) and you learn a lot along the way about Chinese and Chilean culture and the gold mining days in california. none of it is dry....it is very well told, crisp and well paced. it's also a story about finding love where you're not expecting it, and the serendipity is pleasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Careful attention to details","review":"A lot of people say that this book has an abrupt ending, that it needs a sequel.. but Allende gave so many \\"hints\\" into the future of Eliza's life that a sequel is certainly not needed. This is definitely a book where small details cannot be skipped and skimmed, 'cause ya might miss a few clues if you do.Otherwise, the novel was a good early morning read during my subway ride to Manhattan. Allende transported me into another era, another world. Everything was described in such lush detail that I could smell the odor of every character in the book.Tao Chi'en and the scent of the sea. Eliza's cooking. Rose's vanilla perfume. Joaquin's sweat.*yummmmm....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best","review":"Isabel, the author of so many sensible books, lost her hand in this predictable story about a girl and her journey to find her love. The first part, that takes place in Latin America, is better than the one that takes place in California. All the profound beauty of her previous books is missing in this new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chose an earlier Allende book to read","review":"I just got home from a book group in which we discussed this book. Of the 6 women there, no one was overly enthused. The general feeling was that while all of the detail was interesting in a historical sense, it was not presented in a way that advanced the plot or aided in character development. We cared about a few of the characters but most others seemed shallowly drawn. We were not riveted to the resolution of Eliza's search for her true love. All thought the ending was predictable.Allende fans in the group all advised reading some of her earlier works to see why she is so popular. There is too much wonderful fiction to read out there to spend time on this mediocre work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Allende continues to shine","review":"This is an epic story which uses the typical Allende style of twists,turning the world on its head and maagic suprise.

She is a gifted writer who really hooks the reader early. I loved reading it but I wasn't thrilled with the ending.

This was a wonderful book and I was hooked from the start. Allende does not deliver obvious storylines - the book does not end how you think it will. The locations and the love stories are fabulous too! There is more than one daughter of fortune in this story... I was entranced by Eliza and her tale and did not want it to end. Thoroughly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good! Kinda long, but thorough on description","review":"I really liked this book. I was kind of disappointed by the ending, but you can't have everything! I love the in-depth description and the back story so that you understood the characters and why they were the way they were.

The beginning of the book had me really excited and wanting more, and then I don't know what happened. The first reaction I had when I finished the book was anger. How can such a brilliant writer and storyteller have possibly gotten so lazy from the middle to the end of this story. If you guys want to read a brilliant story by this lady go out and buy THE HOUSE OF SPIRITS. Don't waste your money and time reading mediocre writing by an excellent writer. Buy her good stuff, and save yourself the disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"The story was incomplete.","review":"I wouldn't recommend this book. It started off well and seemed to drag on in the middle and then ended abruptly with many loose ends. I thought that many aspects of the story were undeveloped, while others were drawn out. The abrupt ending left me very frustrated and unsatisfied, with many unanswered questions. It actually seemed like she got tired of the story and didn't know how to end it.I bought this book because I had enjoyed \\"Portrait in Sepia\\" so much that I assumed that this book would be equally enjoyable, but it really wasn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Grand Disappointment From Isabel Allende","review":"Regrettably \\"Daughter of Fortune\\" is a far cry from Allende's great novels such as \\"House of the Spirits\\" and \\"Eva Luna\\". There is far less magical realism, and instead, regrettably, ample banal realism present in this novel. Indeed, one could regard it as a \\"paint-by-numbers\\" tale in which the plot and characters seem too familiar and contrived. The most appealing character in the novel is the Chinese doctor Tao Chi'en. I wish Allende had built her tale around him, emphasizing his own epic journey from Manchu-occupied China to Chile and finally, California, instead of her main protagonist Eliza Sommers. Unfortunately Sommers comes across as the least interesting female character in a novel replete with strong-willed wives and prostitutes. Those in search of epic writing by Isabel Allende should turn instead to her earlier work, most notably \\"House of Spirits\\" and \\"Eva Luna\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"Isabel Allende is one of my favorite writers yet I found this book actually tedious. It was dry and cumbersome. The story seemed to end without going anywhere...a sequel perhaps?? Count me out. My joy on a new Allende turned to disappointment. I hope more promising things are yet to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good beginning, disappointing ending","review":"I've loved previous Isabel Allende works, and the beginning of this book has all the promise of its predecessors. Unfortunately, the book quickly shifts into a \\"wild west\\" cliche, with plot twists that are unbelievable, characters that don't deliver, and endless pages of \\"California gold rush\\" descriptions that are unoriginal and ultimately, boring. I found this book to be a real disappointment, especially from a gifted writer such as Allende."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughter of Fortune is another Allende winner","review":"Daughter of Fortune was a magical book. While it lacked the depth and spirituality of some of Allende's other works, it was a wonderfully executed novel. The characters she created were alive and real. They had depth, and behaved in a way that reflected their time and their circumstances brilliantly. While undoubtedly a romance, this in no way detracts from the quality of Allende's prose or the quality of the book as a whole."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Chile to San Francisco during the Gold Rush","review":"Isabel Allende is a wonderful writer and her book, Daughter of Fortune, was a delightful read. This book combines all of what I personally read for-interesting characters, new information (about the Gold Rush and China in this case), and good writing. Allende has a technique that is unusual in storytelling. She drops little hints about the future as she writes that you might overlook if you don't read carefully. Then she withholds information about past events and lets you find out about them unexpectedly. Allende is not a writer that you can \\"skim\\" through. I found myself reading more slowly, more carefully, so that I would not miss any of her delicious details. My book club selected this novel to read and everyone enjoyed it, although some found the plot somewhat unbelievable. I did not have that opinion myself. I thought the characters were very nicely done."},{"rating":"2","title":"daughter of fortune","review":"Excellant book! Allende writes with a poetic hand that makes it hard to put down the book. The characters are strong, very real personalities. It was a joy to watch each life unfold as the character grew up and encountered sadness, happiness, and finally contentment at the end. So many books have endings that I would like to re-write, but not this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"daughters school book needed","review":"The book was in good shape, it just took way to long to get, I learned from this experience, if I need something right away order directly from amazon"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just scratching the surface","review":"Having to read this book for a book club was the only reason I got beyond the first 100 pages of this poorly crafted book. After reading Memoirs of a Geisha and The Poisonwood Bible ( two of the best books I have read in a year), this was an enormous disappointment. I felt the character development was shaky and with so many \\"life stories,\\" I was at times unclear who the protagonist was. I never felt myself rooting for Eliza (was she the main character! ). I find it disappointing when all of the love stories begin with love at first sight...seems a bit Danielle Steel-ish to me. Too many countries, experiences, ethnicities, cultures, and characters...just develop people that I want to know more about and the story becomes a rich part of their experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"After hearing the author speak on a local radio program, I was intrigued enough to pick up this book. What a letdown. After reading 70 pages, I have to stop. As many other reviewers have noted, it is full of one-dimensional characters, cheesy and unbelievable romance cliches, and hokey mystic references. Save your money and your time, don't buy this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"I just could not put the book down!!!","review":"I am very happy that I was introduced to this novel. Not only did Daughter of Fortune keep me on the dge of my seat it also opened my eyes to a variety of cultures and history. This novel reveals how striving for perfection and sheltering yourself from gossip will only lead to a life a misery, however following your own path will only make you stronger.I started the book on a Sunday and finished it on Tuesday. I just could not resist not knowing what was going to happen next. The only flaw would have to be the ending. I expected a more dramatic and descriptive excerpt. This was my first time reading a book from this author but I was not disappointed! I am anticipated reading more from this author. Don't hesitate read this book now and indulge yourself in a whirlwind of culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Oprah book that is actually uplifting!","review":"It's about time Oprah picked a book that is a pleasure to read. Her books are so depressing--rape, childhood abuse, depressed women, oppressive men...ad nauseum. I read this book way before Oprah chose it and loved it. It's gotten to the point for me--if Oprah picks it--I won't read or buy it. What happened Oprah? This is a book about a strong woman in a man's world. True she is looking for her \\"lost love\\" but if you ignore that part, it's a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Epic Novel, a 3.8 on a scale of 1 to 5","review":"Isabel Allende's \\"Daughter of Fortune,\\" is a beautifully rendered, impressive novel. Allende tells the tale of a young Chilean orphan, Eliza Sommers, who follows her lover to California during the Gold Rush. She travels incognito and lives in a rough world of single men and ladies of the evening. Allende's far flung canvas captures mid 19th century Chile and California. Her world is one of raw beauty and rough living.Eliza makes both a physical and a spiritual journey as she eventually must decide what \\"following one's heart\\" really means.I enjoyed this book though I felt at times Allende lost her way. Overall though, I commend her effort.I would recommend this book to individuals who enjoy fiction on historical eras, particularly \\"woman themed.\\" (It was an Oprah Book.) I would not recommend this book to those inviduals who need plots and settings served up quickly and neatly.overall, it was a worthwhile read for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking vitality and substance","review":"I should have listened to the review that warned me that Daughter of Fortune was dull. It was dull. The book lacked vitality and substance. Eliza as a character was never really fleshed out; she was lacking in character and was totally uninteresting. The story seemed disjointed. I'm sorry I spent the money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good potential, but ultimately disappointing","review":"I thought this was going to be a good old-fashioned historical epic. Instead, it was a deadly boring diatribe about the sordid conditions of prostitutes and people of color in Gold Rush California. Eliza wasn't a compelling central character. Miss Rose was much more interesting. And am I the only one who noticed that Isabel Allende co-opted characters and an exact scene from that Antonio Banderas film \\"The Mask of Zorro?\\" Maybe Harry Love, Joaquin Murieta and Three-Finger Jack were real historical figures and this was their true story, but I found that a discordant note in what is supposedly a prestigious novel by a revered author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Average","review":"This book is too violent; the gory descriptions make it hard to concentrate on the supposed love story. Tao is the only truly interesting and deep character. The book does get more interesting towards the end, but my suggesstion is read something else. (Memoirs of a Geisha or I Know this Much is True)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Formula Romance + Adventure","review":"Girl gets boy, girl looses boy, girl finds another boy. Sorry but I did not find this to be an epic novel. The characters seemed very formula driven to me. However, the adventure and historical pieces I did find of interest -- 19th century Chilean society and economics, sailing from Chile to California, the California Gold Rush, the early Chinese immigrants, the birth and development of San Francisio and the state of California."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"no end\\" story","review":"Allende's book is about an abandoned girl who was raised up by an English family living in Chile. When she grows up, she falls in love with a Chilean boy who later decides to go to California in search of gold.The young girl then travels to San Francisco to find the boy and resume their love story.The plot, as you see, is not very original although the end certainly is: there isn't any."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy ending","review":"you know what, i have mixed feelings about this book. At times it was interesting, but in the end i didn't feel i knew as much about the characters as i would have liked. It did drag many a time, only to lead to a most unsatisfying ending, seems almost lazy on the part of the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ","review":"Extremely disappointing! The only redeeming factor was the historical content and the somewhat interesting look at the gold rush California years. The story (if one finds a story) in itself was choppy and just sloppily written as if the author became bored with it herself. Parts of the book were just too unbelievable to even imagine and the ending was ludicrous with too many loose ends. Come on, Oprah....we know you like books with strong female characters, but next time could you please pick one that at least tells a good, believable story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange book, not sure it was worth the effort","review":"This was a difficult read. I've never read Allende before so I assumed that maybe the problem was in a translation or something. And then I read the other customer reviews which says that this is simply not her best book. On that, I can't comment. But this was not my favorite either. I was tempted to abandon the book at several points. It got mildly intriguing when the \\"California gold rush\\" got underway, and I found this book to take so many bizarre turns, I stuck with it. I think Allende was trying to make too many statements about disjointed social issues and ultimately, her point got lost entirely. There's social class issues, gender issues, race issues, moral issues (the prostitutes were memorable), ethnic issues and on and on. What was her point? ...Don't know if I can recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Daughter of Pain","review":"I was more than disappointed in this book. When I got to the end it felt like it had never really started and I wished that I hadn't spent the time reading it. I have heard her other stuff was better... but trust me skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfying Ending","review":"I read 400 odd pages for that ending?! I enjoyed the characters however there were too many of them for the author to thoroughly explore. The end of the book was abrupt - seemed as if she had used up her word count and had to finish the book in a hurry. And similarly the fantastic locations (Chile, California and China) were only touched on. A very frustrating read."},{"rating":"1","title":"read something else...","review":"reading this book was a waste of time. a predictable romance novel with characters as interesting as shallow mud puddles -- was trying to walk around them the entire read. cant believe this is what is being passed off a good modern literature, her writing style reminded me of some cardboard I ate when I was a child -- I have seen more compelling sentences bill boards. now I know what I have *not* been missing by skipping best sellers -- will *not* be selecting any Oprah Book Club selections to read in the future. read bukowski, joyce, colin dexter or mary karr instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pulp Romance","review":"This book is simply a pulp romance attempting, I suppose, to fictionalize a point in history, the mid to late 19 century and a Chilean foundling's misadventures, sans corsette, among the plunderers of the California gold rush and beyond. It is a surprisingly weak addition to Oprah's book club."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snoozeville","review":"This book was flat and boring -- reading this book seemed like chewing cardboard. Spare your brain cells the pain of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I had hoped","review":"I was really disappointed in the main character, Eliza. I thought her aunt was much more of an interesting character and the book should have been more about her. It definitely felt mediocre to me. I finished it just to see if it would redeem itself in the end. Bummer. But not terrible, just blah!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliffhanger!","review":"For as many pages I read, Daughter of Fortune came to a weak climax, and in my opinion never had an ending. It seems like Allende got tired after part 3 and just put her pen down and sent it off to the printer.As other reviewers before me stated, there were to many unfinished story lines! I've got to say, despite my criticisms, that if another book came out completing the tale of Eliza Sommers, I'd buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughter of Fortune","review":"I read the book before (from the library) and decided to buy it so I could read it again, which I did and enjoyed it again. Wonderful descriptions of life in California during the gold rush."},{"rating":"2","title":"daughter of fourtune","review":"Amazing work. One of those books I know I will read several times. Have already recommended to family and friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leaves Me Wanting a Sequel","review":"As a lover of historical fiction, I found this book to be great fit for me, even though it is not about a historical figure. The event in United States history that is described, the Gold Rush, is one I had not done any previous reading about, and found it fascinating as a socio-cultural phenomenon. Weaving the story of a young girl in search of her true love, and the lengths she was willing to go in order to do so, into the Gold Rush story was an excellent vehicle for describing both human behaviors and psychological processes. I especially found her relationship with the Chinese man interesting, having recently read Lisa See's novel, \\"Peony In Love,\\" which intrduced me to the Chinese belief system regarding ghosts. In all, the book was fascinating and engaging, the characters believable, and the story line extremely interesting. Now I want to know what comes next for the heroine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE PRODUCT","review":"I sent this as a gift to my sister.

Within an 1/2 hour after I ordered the product I tried to go in and do a change of service, simply add a card to the gift basket, however I couldn't because the system wouldnt allow for it. I called customer service and spent hours debating with different levels of customer service, to no avail. They simply didnt have a system that would allow for a simple change of order.

Inside there were 2.2 ozs of tiny ordinary cookies laden with palm oil and made in Indonesia. The 2 oz.\\"California Pantry\\" gourmet water crackers were edible with the Wisconsin cheese but had a lot of trans-fat and were made in Hong Kong. The 4 oz. \\"Focaccia Crisps Tuscan Style Crackers\\" were ho-hum, slightly not-crisp crackers, made with palm oil in Indonesia. A 2oz. slice of \\"Italian Rasperry Cake\\" was dry.

But you really can't be mad at Comm for trying to uplift the current stagnant state of Rap. \\"That sums it up pretty much.

Now, I'm not against artists expanding their musical horizons and making different music, but the music should at least be good! There are a few tracks on EC that are unlistenable. Electric Wire Hustler is awful, soul power is right up there as well. I was so disappointed after hearing this album, granted there are a few tracks on it that made me bob my head, (track 7 especially), most of it just had me skipping to the next one. its as if Common tried TOO hard to make this album souind different, I think he was a unique rapper before but that just came naturally on Like Water for Chocolate.

But overall, it's not innovative, it's just different - for Common. Remember Stankonia?

All of his collaborations have been flawless.Until now. I bought this album day of release, as I am a HUGE fan of what this man has represented.It seems to me that Pharell \\"Puff Daddy 2\\" has gotten into Common's head. Common has always been so real. And now he's using that straight-shooting personality to make money.Somehow I don't think it's his fault. But either way, although what he says is still pretty real, it's put to jiggy beats and way too refined. He doesn't accentuate his voice on this album.

(Did they confuse it with \\"Inside The Electric Circus\\" the lame third cd by 80s shock rockers WASP?)At times, Common's reach exceeds his grasp, yes. And he should stay away from ballads most of the time. But other than that EC is a terrific CD in the tradition of Public Enemy's greatest. He dares to go places others won't in this day and age. The musicianship and production are out of this world, adding a new language to the often hackneyed and cliched lexicon of rap-rock.Buy this CD and if you have an open mind that appreciates left field hip-hop (OutKast, the Roots, eL-P) ol skool, (BDP, Tribe PE, Paris) or black-rock (Fishbone, Hendrix, Living Color) you will love this disc.

The only reason this album seems to have been slept on by so many is because there are only a hand full of people out there like me who are tired of the rim flossin, drug dealin', ho pimpin' hip-hop/rap. If common were to read this review I would tell him that this was the best move you could ever make. Even Outkast didn't take such a giant step. Be true to yourself and those who are true to themselves, and are not just robots, will be your audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant in every single way","review":"I think people that didn't like this album didn't understand what Common was trying to do, or it could be that people aren't just ready for something new. Common still spits the best metaphors out there. He does a great job of adapting his rhymes and flow to the \\"bizarre\\" beats in this album. This album is trippy without question, but it's still 100% Common and his talents as an MC are still there despite people's distaste for his new love of rock and roll in his music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Electric Circus","review":"This CD has 13 songs. I personally enjoy 9 of them : Soul Power, Aquarius, Electric Hustler Flower, The Hustle, Come Close f/Mary J Blige, and Star 69, are very funky off top, you will enjoy these period if you like Common. \\"I Got A Right Ta\\" is alright, but it doesn't do anything for me. \\"Liberation\\" is also cool and mellow and funky, with some sexy singing goin on. \\"I Am Music\\" is a uptempo jazzy type song with trumpets going, its alright but I wasn't into it. \\"Jimi was a Rock Star\\" is a complete mess, I dont know what Common and Eryka were doing, but its some unlistenable garbage that dont belong on any CD. The last song \\"Heaven Somewhere\\" is a nice outro, funky, slow, with Bilal and Ceelo doin their thing..damn!..then some Mary and Jill. 9 out of 13 is tight to me, when most CDs only have four good songs on them. Despite 3 forgettable songs this a tight Common CD. Recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointment to a solid common fan.","review":"This album was a complete dissapointment to me. I was waiting to hear more of his rapping because his voice is smooth but what I heard was not common at all. For a second I thought I bought the wrong cd because it sounded nothing like \\"from water into chocolate\\" or \\"one day itll all make sense.\\" I think this is the wrong direction common should be going. Mos def has also gone to this rock type of hip hop it just doesnt work. Please dont buy this album if your used to commons tight beats and lyrical mastery.Peace. One love."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't classic Common Sense","review":"Well,I'm supprised to see how well Common's reviews have been getting on here. I do give props to the true MC's who venture and try something new. But at the same time, when it is a sound that's not them, I can't stand. Common seems to go against everything he has preached against. Which is selling out. With the artists that are featured on here, it seems like that's what he's doing. It sounds like he's trying to do new things to gain audiences. I could be wrong, but look at who he has on his album. People can implement new sounds and still sound nice. Listen to Mighty Mos Def's new cd. It still sounds like he has the rawness that got him the respect back in the early 90's with Urban Thermon Dynamics. I hope Common will at least go back to some of the raw sounds that truly gave him a lot of respects from pure hip hop fans. I hope he can go back to being the real mc we all came to love."},{"rating":"2","title":"DRG","review":"Anyone who can't respect a man's evolution...in this case Common's...does not truly respect art. Listening to Common's progress from \\"Can I Borrow a Dollar?\\" to \\"Electric Circus\\" is amazing, and should be lauded. Too many artists attempt to relive the glory days they never had. Big respect to Common for doing what he feels."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of most favorite albums of all time","review":"i've been listening to hip hop since the sugar hill gang, fat boys , ra, big daddy, nwa , and a whole list of others. the thing that keeps this album as one of my favorites is the fact that it's so out there. i mean com could've easily release another like water but this album is classic. the soul, the experimentation, the overall journey of this album...just made it a certified classic. ten years from now i could still bang this with no hesitation. people dissed this album but for the obivious narrow minded reasoning ... i loved that it took hip hop to a different all encompassing place. to me it was one of those albums for folks who generally diss hip hop for it's 'lack of creativity' a big reason to shut up. thanks dilla, com , and ahmir for taking a chance and going against the grain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised","review":"I bought this little unit on a whim, and I am happy I did. It is plastic (so it won't rust), and it has four places to put things. The small round brush you buy for Oxo for the left hand side fits perfectly, and the bottom is perforated so the water drains out the bottom. The top part has two rounded parts where you can put other larger brushes (again Oxo brushes are made to fit in the slots). Finally the bottom metal cross piece is a good place to put a Dobie. I've had this unit for over a year, and I think it is great: functional, easy to keep clean, and attractive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"This is wonderful! I use it with the OXO Good Grips Squirting Brush, a baby bottle brush, and a small dipping bowl in the round spot where the soap dispenser is supposed to go. I prefer disposable soap bottles, b/c I find the dispensers always clog up too easily. And using a dipping bowl in that spot gives me a place to put my wedding rings while I'm working in the kitchen.I've had no problems with rust or anything like that. Once every couple of months, I will pop the bottom off and run it through the dishwasher and wipe down the top (stainless) part, but that is it. It's fantastic and looks great and even better, it corrals my brushes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine kitchen accessorie","review":"Oxo Good Grips Stainless Steel Sink OrganizerGood item for the kitchen brushes etc.,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Product... minus one fatal flaw.","review":"Let me begin by saying that this product is well put together and holds the OXO brushes well. I like the design and it is easy to use. Emptying the tray is simple. For the first week the product was exactly what I had hoped for.Now onto the fatal flaw. This product is clearly advertised as being made of stainless steel. There is even a big sticker on the bottom of the tray reminding the user that it is stainless steel. This is a false claim. The product began to rust within two weeks of moderate use. Every part of tray that water touches (basically the entire thing) is clearly showing rust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced, poor design.","review":"I bought this at Bed Bath & Beyond for $24.99 recently - I have no idea why - I think I was intoxicated by the wall-o-gadgets and the bright lighting. Anyway - I'm returning today. It's lame! My complaint is mostly with the Oxo brush and sponge scrubbers that go with it (you have to purchase them separately) and the way they LEAK dishsoap down the handles. I'd understand if it was happening with just one of them - things are duddy sometimes - but this is happening with BOTH of them. Poor design.This tray, though - it's basically a petri dish for growing bacteria in the gross water it catches. You have to clean it out all the time or it will literally stink up your kitchen. JUST SAY NO. You don't need trendy matchy match stuff for your kitchen. If you think the cheaper (but better made) sponge holders are ugly, stick them under the cabinet. This thing is just a total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"sink organizer","review":"looks nice; but is not functional.

Its beginning to be too difficult to return things on Amazon. Sorry just not pleased at all with Amazon or product purchased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rusting now","review":"I bought this in September 2009. It is meant to be near water. It is rusting at all the junction points. I'm disappointed. It works pretty well as an organizer although things do tip out of their slot at times. You have to hold all the items in it to empty the plastic water catcher below the stainless steel drain. If it is stainless steel, why does it rust?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rusts very easily","review":"Great looking design that works well with the other Oxo sink accessories, but the fact that it rusts easily is a deal breaker.

Again Great Product and Great Price! Thanks Amazon & Oxo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD SMALL SINK ORGANIZER","review":"Like the other Oxo products I have tried, this is a well designed product that makes kitchen life that much easier, cleaner and more organized while lending the operation some handsome looks to boot. My only complaint would be the organizer's size, which is pretty dinky. While it's a plus that it's narrow enough to fit behind my sink -- I have a small kitchen and need all the work space I can get -- this product really only holds two dish brushes and a cake of soap or small sponge. My brushes used to hang from push pins, or more often lie in the bottom of the sink. Now they have a home in this stainless rack complete with draining tray. This is a better solution, but size-wise pretty marginal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Organized Bliss!","review":"When I stumbled across this as I was looking for Christmas gifts I thought I had died and gone to heaven! This was just what I had been searching years for! It's a way to neatly organize sponges, wands and scrubbers. I've had the OXO wands for years and loved them but could never find a way to store them neatly and w/o taking up alot of space. This is fantastic! Looks good and works great! I love the fact that the water that drains from the wands (etc) after using them is gathered and kept away from everything. A quick tip of the unit into the sink and away goes the mess!LOVE this unit!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great organization for the sink!","review":"This is a great product from Oxo. I am finding out that Oxo makes many, many great products and I plan to buy more. This organizer is perfect for the brushes used to clean dishes. It allows them to be stored upright and it allows any water or soap to drain into the organizer's little reservoir. There is the perfect little space to the left for something round. One pictures shows the soap dispenser. I chose the palm-style scrubber (also by Oxo). There is even the little perfect space for the standard rectangle-shaped sponge. You can have 4 different items perfectly organized on this space-saving little platform. I love it and I would strongly urge anyone to consider this as a housewarming gift. It will get great use! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I have this product and all the accessories that go with it. I love this little thing. It keeps my soap dispenser and all my brushes together so I do not have to reach all over the sink for them. You do have to drain the water out the bottom every few days but I don't find it to be a problem. If you like organization like I do I would recommend this to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rusting after 3 weeks.","review":"Looks sharp, but it's rusting after 3 weeks of use. The brush holder fits a soap dispenser nicely. They need to make it out of aluminum or stainless steel, not this \\"stainless\\" steel they claim to make it out of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, poor design.","review":"The rusting and collection of stagnant water in the tray are a problem, yes, (the first is avoidable; the second inevitable) but the worst for me is that OXO's own brushes don't fit into the holder well. They fit, but not right. The rubber push-pad on the brush handle hits the top of the wire holder if you put the brush into the holder with the bristles over the drip tray. This is the most logical way to place the brush so that water drips into the tray and not onto the counter, but because the wire holder comes up a scant half- or even quarter-inch too high, I have to turn the brush outward, with the result that the drips go onto the counter instead. I've tried this with both types of OXO brush holders, the all-steel one and the plastic one; it's the same with both, although the plastic ones seems to fit a bit better. Apparently no one at OXO actually tried these together. Maybe they weren't meant to be used together? If not, why not? Not the quality I expect from OXO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rusts!","review":"Considering it's a sink organizer that's bound to be near a lot of water, OXO really should make it less prone to rusting. As it is, it quickly develops rust spots within weeks of usage.So no, definitely not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sux! Do not buy.","review":"Bought this product and within a few weeks it started RUSTING! Rust and dishes are not a healthy combination. Chinese stainless steel for you.

I loved it at first. It looked nice and held both our dish brushes and our soap dispenser. However, after several weeks, it started to rust. Not only that, a black stain started to form underneath it on our counter. No matter how often I cleaned the bottom, the black stain would come back and it was very hard to get clean. After a couple of months of dealing with this rusty organizer and stained counter, I just gave up and threw it away. I really wish it had been made better and been able to withstand being wet. This is not a good product and I do not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great...in theory.","review":"I have to agree with the reviews that say it looks nice and hold the brushes well...but it rusted almost immediately.

You choose a character and then your character has to fight another monster in a room, which varies with each level. There are many different rooms to choose from, but the problem is that there is no story line; it's all fighting. My son likes games which have a story and puzzles to solve, etc. Monsters Inc.

There's no loss of rawness or urgency whatsoever, though, which is what's missing from latter-day punks much of the time. No sense of just going through the motions, like I get with Rancid.I have to mention that I found it weird that the singer seems to get his \\"r's\\" right on about 2/3 of the cuts, and only sporadically on the rest.

I barely knocked a pot on the center divider and the surface chipped, showing the black underneath. The bottom of the bowl started to look worn after about 2 years with fine scratches and stains. The stains come out with BKF but you have to use it every other day to keep the sink looking clean. I even used a plastic mat in the bowl when washing dishes by hand so as not to scratch the sink, but the surface is just not as durable as necessary for daily use.

The tale is set a few years before the crown assumes control of the sub-continent from the East India Company, as India makes is greatest (but ultimately failed) attempt to drive the English out of the region by force.

I felt stronger and could see muscle definition in my legs after a month of doing this video 2-3 times a week. Yes, the instructors are peppy and the music is a bit cheesy, but I found the workout itself to be worth the money I spent on the video. I also like this particular tape because it is only 30 minutes long and I have time to do the workout and jump in the shower while my kids are napping. My only complaint is that the tape itself is poor quality. I returned it twice and just decided to live with it when the third copy came the same way (the static bars show up from time to time and no amount of tracking adjustment seems to get rid of them) I've read other complaints about this feature so they must be coming from the company this way."},{"rating":"2","title":"30 minutes of sports like moves","review":"This video consists of 3 segments, based on in-line skating, martial arts, and ballet.

I think this is a great lower body work out, with adequate warm up and cool down. (30 minutes long)Instructor comments: Robin leads this one.

The only downside is that the old Tiler gets crabby toward the young Mason a lot more often than I think is necessary to get the point across, and thus doesn't reflect as well on Masonry as it could.

The smell was still there; though not as bad, but our cat could still smell the spots without a problem.Just a waste of money in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet another decent old-school black metal album fro Abyss.","review":"Just like their other album, pick this up if you're into the old-fashioned blast-beat black metal stuff from before Dimmu Borgir. This is fast, raw and agressive, though don't expect anything like Hypocrisy or PAIN."},{"rating":"1","title":"useless","review":"This is not a dictionary by any stretch of the imagination. It is about 200 pages long and all it contains are little summaries of people who appear in the plays. It will also tell you what \\"act\\" or \\"scene\\" means, but never tackles the countless words that appear in Shakespeare which the modern reader doesn't have a clue about...at least I don't.And Amazon is charging a $100 for this silliness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere....","review":"I'm not sure who this book is targeting. This criticism applies to not just to this book but many OS-specific system administration books. I don't believe this book should waste the reader's time with tutorial instructions to shell programming and explaining the use of basic unix commands for which the man pages are more than sufficient.If you are new to system administration in general I recommend that you pick of a copy of Frisch's Essential System Administration. This is the best introduction to unix system administration. If you are experienced with unix adminstration and wish to learn more about administering Solaris, read the online Solaris adminstration collection publish by Sun: the documentation there is better than you'll find in any Solaris administration book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated 60's Band","review":"I got this some time ago and it is a nice album to listen to hear and there, I even hear songs that Genesis with Peter Gabriel could have covered & a few have a Steve Winwood vocal sound. Anyway, noted to me is \\"Whiter Shade Of Pale\\". Just too bad it's just the mono version even though it is great in its monophonic sound. I also have a couple other studio versions of it though, one is a stereo version the same timing as the mono version here and a 5:47 long version. Anyway, had this on vinyl when first released and being that it is on CD, thought a few bonus tracks might be added. Anyway, still a good listen aside from \\"Whiter\\" with standout tracks \\"Homburg\\", \\"A Salty Dog\\" & \\"Simple Sister\\". Check it out, nice collection of tracks.Drop by my website for a visit @ \\"JudeMac Forever\\" & say \\"Hi\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound is off","review":"This CD sounds as if it is a reproduction of a reproduction.

Purchased these small vice grips for a project working with small devices. The first attempt at use yielded two screw heads being scratched/messed up due to the vice grips continually slipping off the screws. I carefully looked at the jaws of the vice grips and immediately saw that they are mis-aligned from the factory - it looks like they are molded improperly. Irwin - that is bad, bad, bad; unacceptable, no excuse. Amazon - my guess is all the 4WRs have mis-aligned jaws."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par - DVD wise.","review":"This movie is the original of the re-released version known as Red River Valley, a VHS copy of which I have. This DVD is of medium quality as it appears to have been made not from a film print but from a VHS tape. The double shadows and ghost effects are obvious. MY Goodtimes EP mode VHS copy was far better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Restrained, haunting tales","review":"What the other reviewers say is true. Aickman's stories are painstakingly crafted, or at least appear that way, to maximize a feeling of subtle dread and darkness. There is rarely blood or death, but horror is always lurking, in these and other more poignant forms, just beyond the periphery. The titular story is indeed excellent, but I'm partial to the gloomier \\"The Trains\\", \\"Your Tiny Hand is Frozen\\" (which actually raised goosebumps once or twice), \\"Into the Wood\\", and \\"The Stains\\".Highly recommended for horror enthusiasts and non-enthusiasts alike. These are just great stories!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clive me a break","review":"I open this tasty looking collection with great anticipation. On the first page of Peter Straub's introduction I find a quotation mark that is never closed - most distracting - another (obviously nothing to do with the first) that is back to front, and - also on this first page - a reference to \\"Give Barker\\". I have no doubt that Peter Straub, a great scholar of the strange tale, originally wrote \\"Clive Barker\\". Does the once distinguished house of Faber no longer employ copy editors or proof readers? I am for the moment too scared to continue reading. But not for the intended reasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small!","review":"This nifty looking hook will not fit onto a standard Occidental tool belt (3 inches wide.) Occidental tool belts are the construction industry standard. I am a contractor, and this hook would be very helpful to me, but oddly enough, the \\"heaviest duty tool hook available\\" won't fit the heaviest duty tool belt available. I think it was designed very poorly in that aspect. And if you look at the pictures, you'll see how ridiculous it is. Who wears a tool hook on their regular belt around their pants? They say it'll hold 200 pounds on their website, but the only belt capable of that is the one the hook won't fit on."},{"rating":"2","title":"No \\"Bloodshot Eyes\\"","review":"What a great boxed set. There are almost no weak songs and little or no filler, but imagine how much better it might have been if they had included \\"Bloodshot eyes\\" and \\"Lovin' machine.\\" Worth 5 stars even without them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beguiling Talent - Why Father & Son?","review":"This is a very good live recording (few are) and a good retrospective on a short but highly promising singing/songwriting career. In Australia we get 3 extra songs at the regular price (nice one). I've read about Jeff's troubled / non-existent relationship with his father Tim Buckley (of Greetings from L.A. fame). That tension seems to be tangible in his music. There is a sadness which seems ever present. Two great talents, now lost but not forgotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fitting Farewell","review":"Jeff Buckley glowed with the momentary spirit. His live show was spontaneous and improvisational. I had the privilege of seeing a few of these shows, and each time he played the same songs. But, each time the songs were completely new and fresh. His love of music and of his fans was always apparent in the live setting. Mystery White Boy captures this love perfectly and really gives the listener a sense of what it was like to see Jeff Buckley in concert. His passion is entrancing. The music has a bit of a harder edge than his albums, but it also drops to a delicate whisper on some songs, showing the rollercoaster of emotions that was a Jeff Buckley concert. All of it is completely beautiful and will make you wish it would never end. This is grace."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best live album EVER","review":"It's such a shame Jeff Buckley died so you, but he left some wonderful music for us to enjoy. My favourite song is, of course, \\"Hallelujah\\", but I also love \\"Lilac Wine\\" and \\"Mojo Pin\\" as well. Every song here is great and Jeff's voice is clearly the centre of these performances. If you love Jeff Buckley's music, you definitely need this and his other live album for your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"What might have been...","review":"It's really sad to think the world will be deprived of a future innovator and true song-writing genius. Like Kevin Gilbert and Nick Drake... Jeff Buckley, we hardly new ye.This is a great start to a catalog of some of the most heartfelt, sensitive, and honest songs on the planet. Sometimes it pains me to listen to them. Soulful and melodic at the core, they are even more gut-wrenching live.Buy it and listen to it on a quiet evening out on your porch with a close friend and a bottle of wine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good energy, only 1 standout track","review":"This is the only stuff I've ever heard by Buckley. I bought this CD after hearing \\"I Woke Up in a Strange Place (Live)\\" on Pandora. Definitely a great track. Other reviewers were right, the sound quality on this CD is good and most of the tunes are intriguing. Still, nothing really grabbed me. I'm gonna try the \\"Olympia\\" recordings and hope they deliver as promised by other reviewers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Live Album Out","review":"This is the best live album I know of. It is one of the best albums period that I know of. Every song is captivating. At 78 or so minutes for 12 songs, each are epics. And you must listen to them all. I wish I could write more. I guess I'm not a very good music critc. All I know is I absolutely love 'Grace', so on the same day I bought 'Mystery White Boy' and 'Sketches for my Sweetheart the Drunk'. And both move me so deeply. You can feel the emotion dripping from each note. And I firmly believe, even if they don't buy it, everyone should hear either 'Grace' or 'Mystery White Boy' to hear what music really is."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FIT AS A LEGACY","review":"I picked up the cassette of this after not hearing it for several years and realised why it stayed unlistened to for so long. Apart from the encore - Leonard Cohen's Halleluja (I've seen this done live much better by John Cale), this is a total disappointment - mostly self-indulgent and fan-unfriendly . His Grace album is sadly the only decent thing he ever did. Sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"I want more!!","review":"I want more recordings of Jeff Buckley live!!! This is a wonderful album and we are so lucky to have access to these recordings of Jeff. It's a must have for any Buckley fan. If you are a first time Buckley listener, I might steer clear of this album until you have heard Grace. It's best to be familiar with the studio recordings in order to appreciate the genius of Buckley's live improvisations.I also have to say that this album captures the talent of Buckley's guitar ability - as well as the intuitiveness of his fellow bandmates. Wonderful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mystery White Boy","review":"I was really excited when i bought this as I have both grace and live at sin-é but this was very dissapointing. 'Dream Brother' and 'Mojo Pin' are good but i found 'Hallelujah' pretty poor. He sings in this wierd tone like he's had anaesthetic injected into his mouth. Don't get me wrong, I'm as big a Buckley fan as anyone but steer clear of this, by far not his best live performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget the laundry -- read this book!","review":"Forget the dishes -- let 'em soak in the sink.

It is tragedy that this book is so bad - it has everything in it that I could have wanted in a novel - foolish self improvement fanatics, health and diet fads, the delusional and annoying baby boomers... Ferguson even invokes the Great Randi (every sceptics hero). How did he get it all so wrong?Well, I lay the blame squarely at the feet of his editor. It is a crying shame that the editor did not take more care with this book because there are times when you can see this writer *can* write. Unfortunately, this book is grossly repetitive. And you will become very frustrated with the errors (and typos!) in it.I only finished it to see if I could spot more typos and to see how many more times I would be told that happiness is not a state we want to achieve.A sad sad waste of talent.

It chronicles the decline of civilization due to a self-help book that actually solves the worlds problems, and makes everyone happy. Will Ferguson's writing has improved dramatically since this book was written, but this is far and away the most clever book that he has written. The events are forced at times, and it shows all the trademarks of a first novel, but it is extremely amusing nonetheless. Certainly worthwhile for a light and original summer read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars for great premise and wit; 0 stars for ending!!!!","review":"Ok, the book was funny at some parts, annoying at others. While the premise was cleverly set up, seemingly to gather steam and roll towards a rollickin' good end, the ending was way too much of a let down with huge chunks of dialogue as exposition that went on and on and on. It was disappointing. Here, the author was setting up some end-of-the-world scenario with a scary book and its mysteriously evil author as its villain, only to reveal.... Groan! Again I say, without giving away the ending, that the ending was miserable. Truly, the ending was so pathetic as to not make the read of the first 4/5s of the book worth it. While Mr.Ferguson does write with a sure hand, he sure runs out of creativity in the crucial final act. Unfortunatey so.I feel cheated!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same songs, different title","review":"I have reviewed the titles on this CD, and am not going to buy it. I get sick and tired of certain artists that use the same material to release more and more albums with the same material.

That I'd be happy to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD, but just one thing missing","review":"If you've seen Joel live, you'll love this CD. All the classics are here and the sound is fantastic. You can hear the crowd singing along on several numbers which just adds to the overall \\"live\\" effect.The biggest disappointment however is the omission of Joels' signature song \\"Piano Man\\". As most Joel fans can attest, this song played live is one massive sing-along. Not including it is sacrilige. If you want that one song live, you'll have to buy the Joel boxset, which might have been part of the reason.With over 2 hours of hits such as My Life, Only the Good Die Young, and Scenes from an Italian Restaurant; this CD is a can't miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother! Save your money for the 12 Gardens CD","review":"As much as it pains me to say it this live cd is not a worthy billy joel release. In fact one wonders why it was released at all. Billy's voice is strained and is prone to over singing and the arrangements are overblown. From the sound of things Billy sounds like he was drunk or on medication. A lot of the running time is waisted with lengthy monologues with the audience. Why this was put on the CD is anyones guess but it just neans less songs!However the good news is that this CD has now been blown away by his superb new 12 Gardens CD in which Billy is the Billy of old. The one who sung well and sung the songs straight as they were meant to be sung. 12 Gardens is crammed with 32 songs rather than the 26 on offer here and there's no timewaisting audience chat!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mood Music","review":"I have been a Billy Joel fan for approximately 25 years.

That night in Kansas City those two gave an awesome performance. This concert was just like his performance at that show. He does have a lot of his hits like \\"Only the Good Die Young\\", \\"River of Dreams\\", \\"We Didn't Start the Fire\\", \\"My life\\", and \\"Big Shot\\" All of these performances are strong and they hold up well. There is one major flaw, Piano Man was not included in this set. I don't imagine Billy Joel can do a concert celebrating the new millennium without doing Piano Man. Where is it? Who was the [genious] that decided not to include it in the album? The concert is still incredible though and Billy Joel didn't dissapoint. I would recomend this to any Rock and Roll fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"The piano man has another classic","review":"This cd is great! I usually do not enjoy live music because many times the live versions sound too much like the original ones, except the quality is not near as good. This cd is an exception. Every song on this double live cd is a keeper. The mastering of this live recording is excellent, as is the song selection. Many fans were upset by the omission of \\"Piano Man\\", but it really does not sound that different than the studio version.

Still, a wonderful goodbye album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Billy Joel Rocks In the New Millennium!","review":"I was really impressed when I heard this live CD set. The sound quality is exceptional. The only letdowns are 1. He didn't do \\"Piano Man!\\" and 2. He did do \\"Honky Tonk Women!\\"; I guess just because the song does mention \\"New York City\\" He probably just wanted to continue to emphasize that New York was \\"the center of the universe\\" that New Millennium's Eve. I love the track \\"2000 Years\\" and every track on CD1. This 2 CD set is well worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music For Those Who Couldn't Attend!","review":"What can I say? I didn't want to spend a huge amount of money on a concert ticket, but I did want to hear the show. Low and behold a CD of the concert comes out. Now I wish I was at the show. From what I hear it sounds more like a party than a concert. The music is great, as it always is with Billy. I have never heard a better version of Go To Extremes. This is deffinately an album worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joel Cut Short.","review":"Any one who knows me, knows I am a huge Billy Joel fan. This live album with loved songs and a clear recording is great! The Millennium Concert was 3 hours plus and this double CD set is a drop over 2 hours. At this concert you heard songs he doen't play live often and was really a treat for those who were there. But these songs were removed. Souvenier, Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway), This is the Time, ect.. And how can you cut out Piano Man? Not only is Joel known as \\"The Piano Man\\" but he ends the show with this and he goes back and forth with the crowd. This is really a lot of fun. Will you like the album? Yes, a great album for even a casual Billy Joel fan. Could it have been more? Yes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Billy Joel is the greatest","review":"I went to the NYE concert, it was great.

The only thing that I didn't like about this album was some of the drumbeats.

Her reading was so animated that she got a big applause and a prize. She was absolutely mesmerized by the story in the book. So, it was only natural that I would get her the video/movie. When it arrived in the mail she called me to thank me profusely. She called me again after she viewed it. She was ecstatic. Except for a few parts in the film that didn't follow the book (needless to say she was looking for each detail - as kids do), she totally loved it. The fantasy of the story was carried out beautifully in the video. The quality of the DVD was perfect. Delivery was timely."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Secret Garden","review":"A beautiful movie that is good for young and old.

It is sad that anyone would even in the slightest consider a brief view of a little girls chest/nipple to be \\"nudity\\".

I think it's time to dispel these sick, silly ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weird experience, but love the movie!","review":"I was in the mood to see this movie again and was super excited for its arrival. I took off the plastic and put the DVD in without looking at it. When I turned it on, the menu for \\"A Little Princess\\" was on my screen. The wrong DVD was actually in the \\"The Secret Garden\\" box, wrapped in plastic and everything. I was able to send it back and have it replaced. However, it was a lot of inconvenience for an inexpensive movie I could have bought at Wal-Mart."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful rendition of the Secret Garden!","review":"I love this movie so much, that I just bought it for a friend of mine. My copy is so old its in VHS. This edition of the Secret Garden has an artistic spin on a classic tale.

Got a question for you.","review":"I'm a 37 year old guy who will watch Hellraiser and listen to Front 242 and then curl up and get a little teary with The Secret Garden (I'm a Gemini of course). I love the kids in this movie, Maggie Smith (boy, does she look familiar!), and Lord Craven (John Lynch) is earnest and touching without being saccharine.I found the landscape photography visually intriguing and beautiful. What interested me most was the rather sudden transition from mature forest and green lawn to purple and red moorland. I haven't read the book but I can surmise that the estate is in the middle of the moors and is an \\"oasis\\" of woodland and greenery-kind of like Hound of the Baskervilles, which I *have* read. The main house is incredibly intriguing, inside and outside, and is luxuriantly decorated [...].My question is where was the movie filmed? In Hollywood (horribile dictu) or on a genuine estate in some windswept moorland? Lemme know."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantastic Film For ALL!","review":"'The Secret Garden' is one of my favourite films ever. It is a superb film experiance for any person, and a superlative example of film production in every area. The adaptation, the script, the acting, the directing, the score, and the production are exemplary.The DVD offers no extra features over the VHS version except the obvious technical quality, yet the standard of the film is such that it demands a copy in the DVD format, if only from a pride of ownership perspective. I already owned a copy on VHS when the DVD version was released, and didn't hesitate on buying it again on DVD for posterity.Don't ever rent this film: BUY IT.It will become a joy to watch over and over again, each time bringing a new level of understanding, and returning ever more to the viewer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Secret Treasure!","review":"While most children probably would not care, the directing and the cameraworks are superior in the film (as it is always the case with Agniezska Holland's movies). Casting is superb as all characters act at their best. You will love the soundtrack for this movie written by Zbigniew Preisner.There is nothing comic in this movie as it usually is in children's films.This definitely is a great film to watch both for children and film afficionados."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show for any age","review":"I have loved this movie since I was a little girl and bought it simply to remind me of childhood. Watching it as an adult has still been a great experience, I think it's a wonderful movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice family film","review":"This was a nice family film. My kids (9) and (12) enjoyed it. Suitable for all ages. It followed the book well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The first thing to note is that this movie deviates significantly from the plot of the book. In theory this could be okay, but the choices of what to change seemed to diminish the joy that is at the heart of the book--making Mrs. Medlock into a mean, vindictive woman; making Master Craven into a man just this side of lunacy; making Mary's parents die of an earthquake instead of cholera and forgoing some of the key delights of the children: their attempts to keep Colin's progress a secret and the presents of food from Dickon's mother, for example. The movie on the whole was a lot darker than it would seem that Hodgson Burnett had intended, but without enough intent to make that darkness a virtue.Second, the movie itself just wasn't very good. The editing seemed off, and a lot of the lines were unbelievable. Mary's and Colin's characters were played well, but a lot of the other characters weren't.I recommend trying another version of this wonderful story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cultivate your own \\"garden\\"","review":"This movie is visually stunning and the children are remarkably agile actors. I loved the book as a child and have seen various versions of the story including one for stage. This one is by far the best.

I have read the book, and it quickly became one of my favorite. This movie is true to the book. I have read a lot of books this past summer, and I have seen the movie versions of them also, and on some of them I did not like what I saw. But this is a realy great film for girls. But do not watch it unless you read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable movie","review":"I purchased The Secret Garden after reading the book. The movie was well made even though it deviated from parts in the book i.e. how the key was found and character interaction.It was overall great. A good book and movie for families looking for clean, appropriate viewing material. The children actors and actresses did very well. The scenery and sets were beautiful. I recommend this movie to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inferior to BBC version","review":"This version of The Secret Garden should be titled \\"Ms. Burnett goes to Hollywood\\". It's overwrought and clichéd. If one has been raised on a steady diet of Saturday morning cartoons, this film will appeal. Otherwise, get the BBC version. While it was obviously made with a much lower budget, the BBC version is FAR more faithful to the original story, the actors have the correct regional accents, and it captures the magic much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"This was a great deal when I bought it. So good in fact, that I actually bought 3 of them. However, be aware that it is a full-sized guitar. When I purchased it, the description said \\"ages 5 and up.\\" It probably should have been ages 12 and up. That said, it really is a fantastic starer guitar that any kid, or adult, will enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product. Good Service.","review":"I received my book in good condition and in a timely manner. I would definitely buy from this seller again. Thanks for a job well done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Woman Tells Boring Story","review":"As I read this book, I kept thinking it would get exciting, eventually take off....but it never did. Linda is so ordinary...I wanted to scream...I love colorful, quirky, interesting people...She's as drab as a worn eraser. I could imagine seeing her on a reality TV show..answering the question..what have you that's unique, interesting? The answer a long \\"duh\\".....Why is it that the eternally boring and clueless become therapists? Misery loves company??? Linda never came to the conclusion \\"what have I to offer\\"...instead it's always me! me! me! like a three-year-old. Courtney had a twisted father and a wimpy mother..I didn't realize what an exciting person I was til I read her book....If I wrote my memoir it would floor you....but I don't want the numerous miscreants I know...to come gunning for me...I'd like to live a bit longer.."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Unkindest Cut","review":"Linda Carroll plainly had self interest motivating her to write this book. It is incomprehensible how any decent mother could write the things she does about her daughter. She obviously wants a forum to dispute what has been written about her as Courtney's mother. I'm not a fan of Courtney Love and I've read nothing about Carroll until now. Poor Courtney! Linda Carroll, in trying to justify her mothering, only proves how bad it was. Other reviewers have commented that they don't understand why people are reviewing Carroll's behavior instead of her writing. But since she is writing about her behavior, I think it's fair that both are commented upon. Her writing is fair and her behavior appalling."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is as horrible of a book as she is a mother","review":"Can I just say that I'm disgusted that this book evens exist. I think it is completely ridiculous that she found the need to write a book justifying her being a bad mother. This book is poorly written and quite frankly sad. It breaks my heart to think about what Courtney Love was put through as a child by her parents. And if you are looking for a good book on her check out Queen OF Noise or Courtney Love : The untold story. But this book? It's a waste of time and money. It wouldn't be so bad if she knew how to write or tell a story. But she spends the whole time making excuses for bad parenting instead of owning it. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Read - a review of \\"Her Mother's Daughter\\"","review":"I picked up this book because I heard a short blurb about it somewhere (perhaps NPR or CNN?) and I was keenly interested in the take a therapist might take on their dysfunctional family history.I never suspected that the book would be so well written, nor so clever in it's presentation. Using scenes from the past (without psycho-analysis btw) you are moved forward in history in an unhurried manor and end up at a present that seems very logically arrived at.Four Stars. Fascinating read. Well written. An interesting look at a time in American history that is frequently recalled in glowing terms. [So much for that] What you really find is that life then, as now, can be very complicatedCourtney fans, should there be any, will find out some interesting facts such as that she was a precocious child; walking early and using short sentences at only 12 month of age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad excuse for a Mother and a Therapist...","review":"Sadly, my own family has been \\"taken in\\" by this very poor excuse for a \\"therapist\\" and a mother. It is tragic that such damaged people are licensed to practice therapy on other people's problems when they have so poorly managed to conduct their own lives and help shape the lives of their own children. Linda Carroll opened herself up to criticism when she decided to justify her own personal actions with such a visibly emotionally distrubed child. \\"Physician heal thyself...\\" Don't bother to read this book, isn't her child Courtney sad enough to get the picture!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mysticism and Charity","review":"In spite of all the bloodshed and shame Catholicism has caused people over the centuries, Her Mother's Daughter is a fine example of the best of the religion. Linda Carroll is a very mystical woman and she related these experiences with a understated grace. Her description of her adopted parents, her ex-husbands and her disturbed and often cruel child was certainly an exercise in charity. Although she left the church at a young age she took the best of what she learned with her and it has caused me to reflect in a kinder way on my own Jesuit education and the way it has influenced me for the good in my life.There is one scene when she is in a morning Mass and she everything in the church becomes alive with color and light. I had that same experience as an alter boy and haven't thought of it again until I picked up her book.ALthough I am ten years younger and a different gender, I can relate to so many things she talked about.Terrific read, I hope she keeps on writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrifce,Lots of action,fun","review":"This was a terffic movie about someone who trys to kill the president and the kid tells the United States Secret Service."},{"rating":"1","title":"This could have been a great album","review":"What is with the echo??? It is terrible. However, the music is great. It really upsets me.

Why?It could have been great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great!","review":"I really wanted this cd because I love the song \\"Golden,\\" and I thought at the rest of the album must be at least passable. So it was surprising to hear how bad the rest of the songs are, mostly due to the gimmicky \\"echo chamber\\" sound to all of them. \\"Golden\\" is so different from the rest that it seems like it was done by another band altogether.

Why? Becuase they take you on excursions of the mind. It Still Moves is a long album, and the first time I heard it I was a bit overwhealmed with the length. My first thought was, 'this is a bit much for one record.' But once I realized that this was a band that was in no rush to tell you what they doing it all clicked. It clicked on a sunny afternoon by the pool. Spend some time with this album and the sun. Watch the sunset as Steam Engine roars to the end. Absorb yourself in the the atmosphere created by Jim James.MMJ is the best kept secret in the music world right now. Let's keep it that way. What ever you do give It Still Moves the time it deserves to appreciate it. I think it's quite possibly the best album recorded in the past 15 years. Call me crazy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as much Pop, more depth","review":"Not as many catchy singles as At Dawn or The Tennesee Fire (both great albums) but the band is finally coming in to it's own and shows it with an album with more depth and stronger coherence.You won't be dissapointed with this or any other MMJ albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"This is such a solid band, and one of their greatest albums.

Love to open the windows and take my time making delicious food and listening to It Still Moves by My Morning Jacket! The entire album is fantastic, with my favorite track being I Will Sing You Songs. I really like this on vinyl and I have a pretty Low-Fi sounding player, so it makes the experience somewhat romantic and dreamy. I would recommend these tunes to anyone wanting to relax while filling the air with sweet sounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sit back and dim the lights","review":"This is an amazing album. There are albums with a mix of good and bad songs. Then there are albums with all great songs that just don't flow together. This album has some good songs and some great songs but the most impressive part is how well they all flow and fit together. The whole is better than the sum of it's parts. The songs are long and laid back. They are etherial versions of songs reminiscent of \\"The Band\\" with a twangy country tinge that keeps them out of the 3 Doors Down category of music that doesn't matter. (Sorry 3 Doors).Try just sitting in ambient light and relaxing or talking with a friend while listening. Good music for the end of the night.It may be my favorite album in the last 5 years.

I didn't think so at first, but I've only grown more and more hooked as time wears on...as for the reviewer who thought the revelation was gone, I have to disagree (as entitled to his/her opinion they may be). In my mind, an album can't be tested for greatness after the first few listens, except that the hint is there if it keeps calling you back, if it keeps challenging you (in a rewarding way) to pay closer attention to what's going on. Heck, the music is beautiful...there's nothing as easily accessible as \\"Lowdown\\", \\"Heartbreakin' Man\\", or \\"Just Because I Do\\" on here, but \\"Mahgeetah\\", \\"Dancefloors\\", and \\"One Big Holiday\\" are every bit as kick-ace, and the humongous soundscapes seem to have an added dimension of restraint this time around.Heck, this is their best record yet...it may not be what I would have done, but that's what keeps me coming back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I found it","review":"There's something inspiring about it.

After a few listens, it almost lives up to it's hype. I'd say between the singing, and the country-rock feel, it reminds me most of \\"Neil Young\\". But some of the music also has a spacy-ness to it, that almost recalls \\"The Verve\\". \\"Master Plan\\" sounds like the big single, and \\"Golden\\" has a catchy guitar part that would make it good for country-cruisin'. \\"One Big Holiday\\" and \\"Just One Thing\\" are good as well.

I only heard and read great things about this band, from many reputable sources. After (painfully) listening to this drivel, I am much more careful about recommendations from anyone about anything. It is that bad, that over-hyped. Listen to it and find out for yoursel if you dare. The only reason I gave it one star is because the cover art is quite cool. And the only reason I keep it around is because I bought it right after doing something I shouldn't have done and it appears I was punished immediately with this crap.

The haunting pedal steel guitar intrigued me. This is my first exposure to this group and I've now only heard this one CD. I'm very disappointed in their music and perhaps this current CD is not representative of their other work. On many of their songs, I find the instruments not very well played. I remember bands of kids when I was in school in the '60s that played better and had a more polished sound. And what's with all the reverb? Back in the '60s there were those boxes you could put on your car radio that gave the sound an echo. It sounds to me like the lead singer discovered one and can't get enough of it. Perhaps his voice isn't strong enough to carry the lead without the reverb, but then they add it to the guitar on some tracks, too. There is little to recommend about this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"no, not good at all. quite unlistenable.","review":"it all boils down to whether or not you would enjoy an Allman Brother's coverband with crappy reverb saturated vocals.

Somehow this band was touted as a fresh indie sound. the sound could not be less fresh.

Boy, did I waste my money. There is a grand total of three decent songs on this album, and that's being generous. \\"Golden\\" is excellent and two others are listenable. The rest of the album is pap, it's filler, and this band should not have been given license to put out an entire 70 + minute CD. I couldn't wait for it to be over, and I did something unprecedented in my music-buying history: I didn't finish playing the CD. I stopped the CD halfway through the last song. That's how much I disliked the majority of the tracks. Other reviewers call MMJ's music dark and somber (or synonyms of those adjectives), but overall it had the same effect on me as the sickeningly sweet goo that the dentist uses when he cleans my teeth.I give this album 2 stars out of 5 for \\"Golden\\" and it alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your hard earned money please!","review":"As a 1970s music freak I do not know exactly what to say about MMJ. As I sit listening to the real Neil Young while writing this review I can only say there was Elvis and there are Elvis impersonators. If you have ever tried to sleep while your neighbors new puppy howled all night tied to a tree then you can get a feeling how listening to MMJ is worse. The lead singer just wales and whines until you just have to get up and say \\"I surrender\\".

MMJ's move to ATO works. The production and mastering are better than this Shelbyville, KY band has ever enjoyed, and \\"It Still Moves\\" may be considered at this point, one of the best relases of the year. Yes, topping Radiohead. Jim James' writing, vocals, and the playing as a whole from the band are fantastic. The songs range in length, but all are well executed.

Despite that, much of this stuff is baleful, turgid, melancholy and INTERMINABLE.

I bought the album because I liked the leadoff track, \\"Mahgeetah\\", and my local adult-alternative FM station was touting them highly, and the special-intro price at my local record shop was enticing. Yeah, they are a proficient group instrumentally, and I hear echoes of everyone from Uncle Tupelo to early Neil Young. But that's the primary problem here: \\"echoes\\". This album is so self-conciously lo-fi, it sounds like it was recorded from the other side of a public rest-room door. The lyrics are all but unintelligible, and the lead singer strains his range throughout the recording. And several songs seem to have a hard time finding their ending.

If you like wild rice, this is the one to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Sound","review":"I found the poems in A Greater Sound by Far to be a refreshing resurgence of traditional forms as well as a presentation of free verses of substance. The powerful messages in most of the poems in this compilation by Skylar Burris can be clearly understood by the reader without being trite. Surprisingly, I enjoyed the introduction as well as the poetry that follows. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys traditional forms, savors comprehensible thought-provoking themes, and appreciates poetry with a moral and/or religious base."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was very good for basics.","review":"This book was very good for basics.

The Complete Beginner's Woodcarving Workbook truly lives up to its title as being a superb introduction specifically designed for the novice woodworker in practicing an entertaining and creative hobby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful illustrations","review":"Tom's style is delightful. I especially loved all the sub-jokes throughout. The style is deceptively simple. Yet there is so much going on, you'll want to reread it and see what you missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What are YOU So Grumpy About?","review":"I was very disappointed in the \\"Oh Poop\\" comment written out to the side of the picture where the boy received underwear for a present. I was also disappointed in the suggestion that the boy had been lost in his grandmother's bosom. I guess I am just old fashioned but I didn't find either one of these things appropriate for what I want to show to my child. As a result, I returned the book for a refund. It was cute but those two things in the book offended me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Angry about sexual content!","review":"I cant believe the illustration of the grandmother's breasts in this book. I was outraged at this as well as the nude and *detailed* art figurine of a woman. Really offensive and I hope this author gets a clue this isn't what you present to children. Bad judgment!Edited to add: I really wonder just who is leaving \\"not helpful\\" votes on my review. Anyone with common sense can take a look through this book and see how trashy some of the pages are. After some time has passed, I feel even more strongly this book is not positive for children. 1 star, and I hope the author, who is really funny, chooses to do other books without the racy content that children can enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This book begins by trying to figure out why this child is feeling bad. The book then speculates about all the (very funny) reasons why the child is feeling this way. It is a great book that both my 2 and 5 year old both appreciate. It is sometimes hard to find books that they will both sit and listen to. I was very pleased with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look out--quite inappropriate","review":"I hate to write a negative comment because this is basically a fun book with great illustrations. I was looking to buy this for use in my classroom. OOPS! Thank goodness I read through it first. The, \\"Oh, Poop\\" comment wasn't too bad, but the reference to grandmother's bosom, which I could live with in and of itself, comes complete with illustration. YIKES! (...)-cleavage and all! Perhaps for reading at home this would be a fun book, but not for a group of children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as other reviews led me to believe","review":"I bought this based on the reviews of how funny & entertaining it was. Sort of a flop at our house. She's 3 1/2 and adores books, but this is a book that is never chosen. The part about a bird on the lip is about the only thing she can relate to. Everything else was just beyond her & she never really got the joke. Wrong side of the bed, toilet seat up, clothes for presents, doing too many chores, food touching food and siblings touching her etc. are just things she doesn't see the humor of. The child has to be old enough not only to do or have done the things the book talks about, but be able to look at it & see the humor. A 3 1/2 year old is still in the silly mode, which means she finds humor in a bird on her lip & not understand going to a boring museum, because in the end there's no such thing as a boring museum, because she can run, jump, see things she's never seen before & that's still an adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"This book is hilarious for young children and adults. My 6 year old Grump asks me to read it to him repeatedly. He loves it! The illustrations are beautiful. The inside cover with tips on curing grumpiness are an ingenious bonus to the story.

I use this book in my third grade classroom when we learn about emotions. The only drawback is that some examples are not appropriate for discussion in the school setting (a character's big bosom) so I select only certain passages during my read alouds."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great book","review":"Bought this book recently for my 6yr old son & he absolutely loved it.

The scenery is beautiful, however!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmmm....","review":"I was actually BORED doing this workout. And I love Leslie Sansone's workouts. I mean, I kept asking \\"when is this going to be over?\\". It was just THAT boring to me. I've kept it around because I keep thinking maybe it'll grow on me, but so far, it hasn't. I dread it every time I attempt it. The music, the moves, even the instructor all bore me to death. For my money, I'll stick with Leslie Sansone."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than I expected","review":"After briefly reviewing a clip of this DVD, I expected a mild workout - nothing special. Was I wrong! By the end I was sweating like crazy. If you really concentrate on the moves and do them properly you will get an amazing calorie burn. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 b/c of the light weights in the sculpting segments. I would have liked to use 5 lbs instead of 3, but the fast movements made that impossible.Debbie's cuing is a little \\"off\\", but that's OK. She is motivating and her tone is soothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"a decent workout but...","review":"This is a pretty good workout. My biggest complaint is that after you finish a segment, you get to do the exact same segment all over again. I would love this DVD if she would have mixed the segments instead of making you go through the exact same one again. I thought the toning/sculpting segments were excellent. The full workout gets long at times because she doesn't mix it up enough with the segments. With that being said, you do get a decent workout and the toning segments are well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really loved it","review":"This is my first time trying anything by Debbie Rocker, and i truly loved it! I felt like it was a perfect workout for me--challenging but not so challenging that i will dread doing it next time. Afterwards, i felt so great, it was maybe the best \\"natural high\\" i've ever gotten from exercising. I am excited to do it again, and i know i will see results. I did find that her lack of mirroring was distracting, but i didn't let it bother me. If i were a total beginner, that might really throw me off, though. Other than that, i would have given it 5 stars. But it's definitely one of my VERY favorite workouts now, as far as the actual workout goes. The flow of her pace is really nice and effective."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL RAINBATH SCENT!","review":"Neutrogena has ruined the best shower gel ever! The wonderful scent that so many of us have enjoyed for years has been turned into something perfumey and unpleasant. Another post suggested it was to attract more women -- well, I'm a woman and I loved it the way it way. I called Neutrogena and asked to speak with someone about where I could find the original scent and they didn't even call me back. If anyone knows where to find the original scent, please post the information! And if others are as unhappy as the rest of us about this change, please let Neutrogena know! P.S. Amazon, please make it clear in your advertising that this is NOT the classic Rainbath scent that people know from the past -- it is dramatically different, and not the clean, crisp scent we know and love."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the \\"original\\" Rainbath any more!","review":"As with some of the other reviewers, I am very disappointed in Neutrogena's decision to change the fragrance of the Rainbath shower gel. I have used Neutrogena and loved the rich, relaxing fragrance for 40 years, since I was a teen. The new fragrance, though billed as \\"original\\", has a sharper edge, and is not as lush as the REAL original. I am very disappointed in this, and after 40 years of using Neutrogena, I do not plan to buy any more. The new scent is really not that different from many other bath products on the market. I hope Neutrogena reconsiders this. And, regarding one other review speculating that the new scent will not appeal to men, there are many women like me who also do not like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smells Nice","review":"The bottle opened a bit during shipping, which left a sticky mess.

For much of my teenage years I was plagued with acne and even after I was able to get it under control, I could never bring myself to stop using the Neutrogena Body Wash for acne, for fear of my problem returning. However about 2 years ago, I used the Rainbath at a friend's house and since then I've been hooked. I currently reside in France where this product isn't even available, but I still order it and get people visiting me to take it here. It's refreshing, has a great scent and makes my skin feel amazing.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst bike shorts ever","review":"I bought a pair to try out because they were so cheap. I got what I paid for. The chamois was smaller than other bike shorts and it barely covered my equipment. In addition the chamios was not nearly the thickness and quality of the more popular brands like Pearl Izumi or Cannondale. It that enough bad news? It got worse. When my wife washed them, the black bled into my other clothes. I am amazed that there are people who like these shorts unless I got a factory second. I bought them from the manufacturer on eBay."},{"rating":"1","title":"ouch","review":"i followed the sizing chart on the page. said i should get a medium according to my waist size. they got here real quick. but they are unbearably tight in the crotch. like, \\"ruin your day\\" tight. they were cheep and i took a chance, but i think I'll be spending a little more at a bike shop or sporting goods store from now on just so i can try them on first. and I'll probably look at the baggy short style. was planning on just wearing them under a pair of normal cargo shorts (wasn't ready to be \\"that guy with the really tight shorts\\" yet) but i regret even trying. well, live and learn i guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad company","review":"I bot the \\"long\\" version of this short.

So good luck to you if you buy from them. You'll need it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable, and Well Worth the Price","review":"The title says it all. Having seen biking shorts for up to $150, I consider anything under $50 a good deal. These are comfortable even for a 50 miler, and they stretch nicely since I stretched not so nicely after a 10 year hiatus from biking. It would have been nice to have a key pocket or some such, but I guess they're waiting for me to spend as much on a jersey or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cycling Shorts","review":"These are reasonably priced cycling shorts - nothing fancy. I wear these a lot in rotation with another pair. They get washed a lot and no extra special treatment. I get about a year of good wear from them, then they start getting ratty. I can still make do with them even then, though, if I have to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pair of shorts","review":"This is my first pair of mountain biking shorts.

I would caution that the riding bones (the bottom of your pelvis) aren't protected with padding - perhaps that's because I'm a big-boned kind of guy :-p Overall, they're very sleek and comfy. I definitely appreciate the padded crotch, despite it not covering all of the rear...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Padding is thin","review":"Just received the shorts tonight and went out for a quick one hour ride. The padding is thinner than anticipated and doesn't come up the back side very high - about mid-butt is all. It wasn't comfortable walking around in them as I always felt like they were out of place. On the bike, they felt much better. After the ride, I felt the raw, sore inner thighs I endured before I broke down and bought biking shorts (maybe not quite as bad). I'm comparing these shorts to a $45 pair I purchased at a national chain sporting goods store. Given the choice again, I would have spent the extra $10 and got something higher quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"great bang for the buck","review":"These shorts are great product especially for the price!

The best thing is they are made in the USA."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Set of Shorts for the Price","review":"These bike shorts have proved to be comparable to other riding shorts and they typically cost about one-half of their retail value, so I highly recommend them.

My synopsis is as follows:Cons: The disc plays directly from insertion and does not offer a main/start up menu. Horrible video quality which would be barely suitable for VHS, in fact it appears as though this version was created from VHS. As another reviewer wrote, this is from Sting's (very) early and yes an even more pretentious stage in his career. Audio quality is equally horrible.Pros: I like Sting and I have a fancy, new expensive Sting coaster. I have learned to never buy blu-ray on impulse, without first reading reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible sound, interesting material","review":"This film is an interesting mix of interview, rehearsal, and finally performance, of Sting's first solo effort after the Police.

Sting is a goofball in his interviews, but forget about it, his performances both in rehearsal and concert are astounding.And Omar, did I mention Omar? His drumming is fabulous all the way through. Two of the best all time solo performances perhaps ever captured on dvd are herein:1) Omar's drum solo on 'I burn for you'.2) Branford's sax (clarinet??) solo on 'Children's crusade.'I've watched this probably 20 times at least and still love it.Stings rendition of 'message in a bottle' closes the dvd out and tugs at heart every time..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone wishing to be a pro musician should view this movie","review":"Perhaps the most enjoyable music documentary I've ever watched. Sting's perfectionistic ways and the rigidity of rock mix wonderfully with the loose, exploritory feel of Jazz. Seeing \\"Dream of the Blue Turtles (perhaps his greatest solo effort) deconstructed is a true music lesson for any person who aspires to be a musician/songwriter/performer.My favorite scene involves Branford Marsalis pulling out a tabloid and playing off Sting's true name (Gordon Sumner) and comparing his rags to riches upbringing and life, as written in the tabloid, to that of George Jefferson. Hearing Branford calling Sting, perhaps the most pretentious musician out there, \\"Little Gordie Jefferson\\" as the band breaks into \\"Well we're moovin' on up\\" was a total riot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sting during his pretentious phase .......","review":"Probably my own fault but I hadn't realized that this is a quite early video dating from the period not long after Sting left Police. It isn't a full length rock concert - it is more of a documentary - and it was probably very enjoyable in its day. However, it isn't much of a spectacle as a Blu-ray offering and I'm afraid that, despite being a fan of Sting and his work, I just didn't enjoy his persona in this recording. Maybe Blu-ray has just the raised the bar on recent recordings and hence, in comparison to other offerings, my expectations were not met here. Most Sting fans will like this but will probably also own the DVD already - there is nothing in my mind to justify the increased cost of Blu-ray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Sting, Bring on the Night","review":"Got this one for my girlfriend, she loved it. Both DVDs came in about 5 days. (She especially enjoyed that the insert had lots of pictures of the Eiffel Tower, she really likes that.)We would definitely buy from you again.

Sadly, a couple of the takes from the movie we're were replaced on the album. For example, the movie version of \\"I Burn for You\\" outshines the album version.

It is a mish-mash of things that are rather geometric. It uses some terrible new designs that detract from the otherwise wonderfully executed designs by the original designers. There is so much Stickley presented here it should have a different title. Some of the best of the Prairie School is not included. This book had a chance with the great cover but after flipping through it, looking at the photographs, it went right down hill. Taking time to read the text took it right to the bottom. Someone should try this subject again, with an understanding of the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little of worth here","review":"I moved next door to the Babson house in Oak Park in 1990 and can guarantee that the photo in the book is from the street and not the back yard as the author suggests. A couple of years later I moved just around the corner from the Charles Barr home. This is in River Forest, not Riverside.

In order to enjoy this movie you must love sci fi films, rediculous graphics, plot, and actors. If all this appeals to you you will love this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A decent giant bug movie","review":"I actually wasted money renting this instead of watching it on the SciFi channel on Saturday night which, around my house, has become Bad SciFi Movie Night. The spiders are obviously CGI and occasionally appear to be from a different movie. Most of the actors are unknowns and this movie won't be aiding them in their efforts to get noticed by Spielberg. The recycled plot is that scientists have been studying spider silk (stronger than steel and flexible) and, for some reason, one scientist genetically engineered the spiders, which grew larger and larger and then escaped.I like scifi when it's big and dumb (hey, I watched MST3K for nearly 10 years) but, honesly, I've seen better giant spider movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"government scientists and spiders just don't mix","review":"What can be said about movies that deal with nature biting back? Writers should seriously think about ideas before spending five minutes to write a movie and hoping that viewers won't want to demand their money back. I'm a fan of science fiction. Arachnophobia...original, Tarantula...interesting, Eight Legged Freaks...hilarious. But mixing genetic research and spiders, just doesn't mix, unless you want to make another Spider-Man. This movie is in a long line of straight to DVD releases about the ramifications of playing God with nature, and fails miserably. The special effects of the movies about spiders back in the 50s and 60s were 10 times better as well as the acting. I laughed more when I should have jumped with fright.

The album is nothing like Shara Worden's debut. It just takes samples of her amazing voice from BMTW and works them into dance music. This disc is very disappointing. Some of the remixes really miss the point of the original song. If you are really into house or subterranean, you may find this album great, but one of the best parts of the first go through was that Shara wrote all of the music herself. Buy at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good mix","review":"Unlike \\"Bring Me the Workhorse,\\" a wonderful album, \\"Tear it Down\\" really does not hold up to more than 1 listen, if that. Basically, this is a re-working of the songs from \\"Bring me the Workhorse\\" into techno/electro music by various artists. Other than maybe the first 2 tracks, I don't think that the mix of MBD's music with the techno sound is successful. It comes across as an esoteric mutilation of \\"Bring me the Workhorse.\\" If you're a huge techno fan, you might enjoy this. But for those of us who are not, but nonetheless fans of My Brightest Diamond, we can only hope that their next album will showcase their talents more effectively."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A RIPOFF!!!!","review":"I just received this piece of junk, cheap copy of a DVD and am very disappointed.

The majority of the videos are of obscure (at least to me!) artists that I've never heard of and have no interest in. Also, I live in Brazil, where there is a large DVD pirating industry.

If you want to give your hair a treat, try Ted Gibson's hair products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells good, watery consistency","review":"The shampoo smelled great, but it was so watery I had trouble keeping it from running between my fingers. Once I got it on my hair it really doesn't clean well, I now have to wash my hair in sections, with a handful of twenty dollar shampoo per area. It'll be a while before I live this purchase down with my husband. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it the Real Thing?","review":"A few months ago, I received the product as a gift and loved it. I was thrilled to find it on Amazon. Unfortunately, the product I received from Amazon is thin, watery and has a less pronounced scent. I now use double the volume for my hair to not feel or smell as good. Either it's a knockoff or the product has changed from just six months ago. Would not buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY OVERPRICED!!!","review":"Okay, first, I don't actually own this. However, I was very interested in this line of products because I suppose I was swept away by the name, glamor, and glitz. I was also a chemistry major in college and before determing if I was going to spend my hard earned money on a consumable and upon seeing the list and order of ingredients, I promptly decided not to buy this.The first ingredient is water, followed by sodium laurel sulfate (a lathering ingredient), and some other very common shampoo and conditioner ingredients that are exactly the same as the $1.00 bottle (and double the volume in the bottle) of Suave shampoo and conditioner. Which is really suave? You be the judge. Either way, it's your icky hair gunk and money that literally go down the drain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album, bad soundtrack","review":"There are some great songs on here, and it's a nice album. I haven't really heard of most of these artists before, and I don't remember any of the specific songs in the context of the show (but it's been a year). But the songs do fit with the mood of the show and complement what I do remember, which is the amazing score. Originally, this album was supposed to include some cues from the show's score. I've been anticipating this album all year just for a chance to get my hands on some of the enchanting pieces that Michael Suby of S3MX wrote for the show (he's also written some stuff for Butterfly Effect 2 and Robot Chicken). But nothing is here. What kind of a soundtrack doesn't even include the opening theme song? Most of the songs on the album are youthful and upbeat, or mellow and enchanting. My average song rating for this album is 4.4/5 (some slight skew upwards for novelty factor), but I'd have to subtract at least a star for the lack of score music."},{"rating":"1","title":"FINAL DESTINATION ,THE USED BIN","review":"Final Destination is a super natural thriller about well death,so how could it be so bad,let me count the ways. First off the movie starts out with a plane like we have never seen one of those turn on the news. Next the movie drags slowly with kids that decided to get off the plane get questioned which drags on too long. Finally some dies by falling in the tub from water seeping under a toilet(this scene could have been so good,but instead its got a supernatural feel to it)and next more deaths continue kinda of boring a guy on a bus gets hit,like we have never seen that either. Lastly at least the movie could have some sex appeal to make up for the slowness but the movie fails again Ali Larter looks like a poodle,I don't understand in Varsity Blues she looks pretty darn good but in this I didn't even recognize her. HOPEFULLY FINAL DESTINATION 2 WILL MAKE UP FOR MY LOST TIME WITH THE FIRST ONE"},{"rating":"2","title":"Final Destination","review":"Four friends are going to Paris for a class field trip. While on the plane, a guy named Billy has a premonition of the plane exploding. When he wakes up, he warns his friends of what he saw. He makes a scene on the plane, and gets himself and three of his friends kicked off the plane. When outside, the four see the plane take off and EXPLODE. From then on, the people who didn't die in the crash (the four who escape the plane), they die one by one in mysterious ways throughout the movie. the deaths are disgusting and unrealistic. Overall, I thought this was a good movie to watch, but if you are the faint at heart, then I recommend you not watch it. I love this stuff, but some parts I had to cover my eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did we get to this point?","review":"In a world of great technological improvements, this movie is proof that the horror/suspense movie genre is actually DEVOLVING. How did we get from Hitchcock to Final Destination? Poorly scripted, poorly acted -- the list goes on and on. The opening plane sequence is well-staged, but from there this movie spirals out of control, piling implausibility upon implausibility. One of the worst movies I've ever seen, in any genre -- this movie is a waste of 90 minutes of your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad, Sad, Excuse for a movie","review":"Why Why why? I dont understand how this movie get such good reviews...Just like the Scream Movies, etc. The Teen slasher era has to end, these movies are boring and just a waste of money that coulda been used towards a better movie. The story is far from original, a guy who sees whos gonna be taken by death next. Please, i think Micheal J. Fox's performance in the frightners was good enough.

The plane crash was just incredible and so real! I was shaking the whole time.The actors (especially Devon Sawa) were great.

GREAT MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most original thrillers in a long time!","review":"Final Destination is definetly my favorite thriller ever! I went and saw it in theatres with a friend and she screamed throughout the whole movie! It was definetly better than The Faculty (my other favorite thriller) and it will make a big sensation in DVD! A must get which deserves more than 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Work Of Death","review":"Imagine that you unknowingly cheat death. A group of teenagers do just that only we learn that death does not take kindly to being cheated. As these teenagers begin to learn that they should have died and didn't they also begin to learn that Death hasn't forgot about them. This movie is a interesting look at the idea of death. The plot is good and the acting is not half bad. Although the end of the movie may take one too many twists for you to keep up with."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"I was surprised by some of the negative reviews here, as I found this movie refreshingly different and entertaining, in a freaky sort of way. The thought that when it's your time, there is no escaping, is frightening enough... but imagine really knowing that it's your turn to die? The methods used to kill the cast in this movie are quite far-fetched... some awfully unusual \\"accidents\\". However, anyone that can watch a movie and understand that it is nothing more than a movie, can sit back and enjoy this. If you are looking for more reality, this is not the movie for you. Sit back, watch, and just enjoy.... then think about the theory this writer/writers had about death, and escaping death."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holds you from start to finish","review":"I admit the opening scene in Scream scared the [heck] out of me the firsttime I saw it but opening scene for this movie scared me so much thatmy legs were still shaking 15 minutes after it happend. Devon Sawyerstars as Alex who is surpose to take a school trip to Paris but beforethe plane takes off he has a haunting vision of it blowing up andgets kicked off the plane for yelling that the plane is gonna blowup ,6 others get kicked off as well. Keer Smith plays the marcho bullythat's [mad] at Alex because he caused him a trip to Paris untilall of a sudden the plane does blow up. Death gets [mad] when peoplecheat death so now the seven survivors are being stalked by deathin the order they would of died on the plane. The result is a nailbiting edge of your seat thrill ride that never lets up until theclosing credits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange Thriller with Slasher Setup, but in a good way","review":"Final Destination was mainly aimed for the teen audience. Some people may think it's a psychological thriller at one time, and a slasher thriller at another. Besides the theme mixup, Final Destination was still enjoyable, at least more enjoyable than other horror flicks. The plot involves a teen who visions a plane crashing - and it actually crashes. Those who were removed from the plane, including him (Alex), were left frightened and confused. The rest of the story involes how they \\"cheated death\\" by getting off the plane and not dying there where they were supposed to, and then being picked off by some supernatural source to make sure they die like they were supposed to. So, Alex finds out \\"who's next\\" and it's a race against evil for survival. There are the usual humorous one-liners, and the usual romantic sub-plot, but otherwise, this horror flick does involve suspense, entertainment, and fun. A great DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will Leave You Shaking and Paranoid","review":"Upon looking at this cover of the \\"Final Destination\\" video/DVD/poster, I thought that this film was just going to be your average teen-slasher flick, but it turned out to be much more, a lot scarier because here the killer is not a person but Death, powered by Fate itself. It's hard to tell how, when or where exactly the next person is going to die, and each gorey murder will leave you clutching to your seat. This film also promises more-in-depth characters than we are used to with the typical teen film. Devon Sawa does a great job as the unfortunate soul who foresees the deaths of his classmates, Ali Larter offers a beautiful AND intelligent on-screen female character, and Seann W. Scott (best known as Stifler from \\"American Pie\\") gives great comic relief to the film. All in all, this film will have you scared and paranoid for days, wondering if and how death might take you at any second."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been good","review":"\\"Final Destination\\" contains some of the silliest death scenes I have ever seen. I actually held out a little hope that it would be at least a little bit above average given its premise. But, no it is a typical, by-the-numbers game of \\"who's next?\\" If that's what you're looking for then have at it. I guess I just shouldn't have bothered. The movie I really wanted has already been made. Rent \\"Fearless\\" instead. Its a serious explorarion of how it might feel to cheat death."},{"rating":"2","title":"It will leave you breathless...","review":"I show this great thriller at theaters before 4-5 days... I think that it was the scariest movie I've ever seen, and I will never forget it! I am now looking forward to buy the Dvd (the price is good :) The script was great and all the effects seamed to be so real... If you like action and scary movies, don't miss this one. Notice that this movie contains lots of hard scenes and mustn't be viewed from children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply frightening","review":"The horror genre has been revived in the past couple years, particularly with some good movies (the Original Scream) and some not so good movies (Hause on Haunted Hill and a few other stinkers) Final Destination, however, has to be on of the most thought provoking of them all. Not only is it top notch for edge-of-your-seat thrills, but it tackles some pretty intense topics (destiny and mortality.) I bit my nails through the whole thing, as it was one of THE SCARIEST films I've seen to date. I'll never feel the same way about crossing a street, boarding a plane, or any other everyday \\"dangerous\\" activities! I highly recomend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"brown trousers time","review":"OK, SO IT'S NOT REALLY BELIEVABLE, BUT IT IS QUITE SCARY WITH PLENTY OF GORE. BY TAPPING INTO OUR WORST FEARS(DEATH AND WHEN IS IT MY TIME) THE FILM PROVIDES THE SCARES AND JUMPS THAT RECENT HORROR FILMS(SCREAM 3 I'M TALKING TO YOU) LACKED. AS WITH MANY HORROR MOVIES THE RELATIVELY UNKNOWN CAST AT TIMES CHEW THEIR WAY THROUGH THE PROCEDINGS, BUT RIGHT FROM THE OFF SET WITH THE VERY NASTY PLANE CRASH, FINAL DESTINATION WILL LOCK YOU IN AND KEEP YOU ROOTED TO YOUR SEAT, WITH JUMPS A PLENTY AND MORE THAN IT'S FAIR SHARE OF GRISLY DEATHS. SIT DOWN, SWITCH OFF YOUR BRAIN AND ENJOY THE FAST PACED ACTION."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"This movie must be one of the best I've seen in a long time. It's tipped to be scarier than Scream, but I'd disagree, it's not scary like Scream was, it's shocking, it's the unexpected that shocks, not the senseless killing that Scream fightens with.Kerr Smith, in a departure from his character of Dawson's Creek is excellent, as are the other actors. It's believable, it's shocking, and it's fresh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Film Falls Apart After Great Opening But Still Worthwhile","review":"The film basically falls apart after a terrific opening sequence. Everything leading up to the plane crash and its aftermath was amazingly well done - a mix of humor, Hitchcockian suspense and foreboding. The director even strived for poignancy and pathos - after the crash, he even included clips of the presumed search and rescue operation and showed how a real plane crash would affect survivors, from the funeral to the high school eulogies. I was impressed by how detailed this attention was to the loss of human life in what presumably is a typical teenage horror film. From this high point, however, the film degenerated and became a typical slasher film, absurd and rather silly. By the end of the film I had lost interest and it became nonsensical. What a shame - if only the end had lived up to the beginning of the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"final destination","review":"Final Destination is awesome movie it's right up there with Scream in the horror movies category. And it's right up there with Idle Hands in the Deven Sawa (Wild America) category. The plot is that Deven Sawa can see deadly accidents before they happen. Anyway it's really good you should buy right after you get done reading this review. Bye."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting idea, bad execution","review":"I found the story idea for this film very interesting, and the writer and director could have done so much more with it. However, as it stands, the movie is quite boring. There are so many elements to this movie that could have been fleshed out more. What comes to mind, particularly, is the surrealistic encounter with the man at the funeral home. They could have brought his character in again at a later time for some more interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOR-","review":"-ING. OK if you have nothing else to watch.

The basic idea is lifted from the classic SOLE SURVIVOR (not to be confused w/ the wretched SOUL SURVIVORS). However, the updated, tweeked storyline is interesting enough to make FD an excellent movie in its own right. The idea of cheating death, only to have death track you down, is very cool when handled properly. The various \\"accidental\\" deaths are well-conceived, w/ the first one being a standout. FINAL DESTINATION is a superb creeper..."},{"rating":"2","title":"New fascination story","review":"It's quite a while ago when I watched this movie. I did watch all movies of this series but have to say that number one is actually the best by far.Why?It was a new story, everything was new fascinating and surprising. All the other followed the same kind of story. There was no surprise anymore :-(It's the same as with Matrix.Number one: Wow, Number two and three... same story different pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"the beginning was cool, but after the plane crash, blah!","review":"there's not much to say about this movie. it's just a bunch of pretty teens running from death because they were also meant to die in the plane, ok whatever. so, the rest of this movie is over an hour of teens running around, looking attractive and getting killed in the most silly ways. yeah, the director tried to make the deaths brutal, but with the cgi effects, it just looks dumb and phony. the 70's-80's horror movies that had all these death scenes looked a lot more realistic, even the real cheesy ones. they looked a lot better than this i assure you. also, none of the deaths come to you with suspence, it's the same formula over and over. formula=one false scare, then the real thing. for example: boy plugs in radio, water seeps up to him, no not an electicution, instead boy slips on water and gets strangled by a cord, and repeat about 5-6 more times and there's the formula for the deaths."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpectedly good","review":"This could have been just another gormless teen flick if it wasn't for the delightfully wicked premise and the obvious relish with which writer Glen Morgan and director James Wong exploit its potential. The air disaster which kicks off the story is only the first of many major shocks which will have you squirming till the end. The mainly teen cast acquit themselves well, striking the perfect balance between horror and disbelief. This is stylish, frightening fun which will leave you wishing Morgan and Wong had longer resumés."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very clever, very cool","review":"You think you can cheat death? No way! The movie has a great premise (kid has a premonition of a plane crash, gets kicked off plane - with some friends - plane really does crash).But death feels cheated and in the most intricate, wonderfully choreographed ways it gets revenge (or tries to) on all those who avoided dying on the plane.What lifts the movie above the cliche is the ways you are kept guessing as to who is next and how they will go. Also there is very little gratuitous gore or violence, something else that sets this movie apart.You get some nice extra bits with the DVD (alternate ending - which I think is not as good as the original)but for the movie alone, this is worth buying and playing to your friends again and again. Just try to count the coincidences required to pull off a death! No wonder the grim reaper looks tired if he has to go through this effort to pick us off!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic! Best horror movie of the year!","review":"This movie will leave you thinking twice about life! I saw it in theatres three times and it was great everytime! This movie is not like all the horror movies like Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer. Instead of a killer running around killing everyone with a knife, the killer is the in the wind. It's Death. The airplane crash was so vivid and real and the deaths were great! I highly reccomend this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Movie Is Really Wierd","review":"I guess you could describe this movie as being...well...different, but different isn't really always that great. The movie centers around a group of high school students going on their senior class trip to Paris. Right before the plane takes off, he has a vision of it exploding. He an others escape off the plane before it takes off, and predicitbly, explodes. The surviving members of the flight(3 boys, 3 girls) are strangely knocked off one by one, through odd strings of events(I.E. strangulation, hitting by bus, impalment, explosion, decapitation, and other sorts of justt..well just yewwwwyyy sorts of deaths.

This film has a sort of supernatural twist to make it stand out. Death is an essence is the theme, the essence you can't escape. This is just antother formulaic teen horror flick packed with teens in fashion mode, with a few bloody wrecks along the way. What I can't tell is, is this film using its stupidity of the supernatural undertones as a joke the same way Scream flicks use thier overt stupidity, or is it really meant to be taken seriously. Either way you should really skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great horror","review":"This was a great horror flick to me.

After a very smart opening, the movie spirals into one obsurdity after another. If you're looking to be scared, forget it. However, if you want to laugh, not just at the movie, but the fact that someone actually sat down to write this, then see the movie. The only scary thing about it is that it took three people to come up with this drivel. I gave the movie two stars because humor is not deliberate. It has to take you by surprise. And if the filmakers meant for this movie to be funny they certainly did a good job."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best movie of the year!","review":"When I first heard about this movie I thought it wouldn't be very good. But now that I rented it I thought it was awesome!

This is a very good movie. Go rent it and you will like it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good at All","review":"The movie starts out well enough, but as it goes along it gets more contrived. The plot is ok, but the acting and script were terrible. Stifler from American Pie was completely miscast.

I was expecting more after seeing the crash. It had my attention until after the teens started getting killed. The first one to go in the bathroom was interesting. But the others deaths were pretty lame. A rehash of what we have seen already. This movie didn't make me jump once. I was waiting to be scared. The ending was terrible. They should have left it like it was before showing them in France. An ending can ruin a movie. Final Destination was a good idea gone wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Feces Of The Species","review":"My sister dragged me to see this awful movie when it first came out, telling me how good it would be and how it was going to be as scary, if not scarier than \\"Scream\\". Yeah right. Maybe if you're a 12-year old Slaughter fan who's never seen anything more adult than \\"Lilo And Stitch\\" it would be scary. The long and short of it is a stupid, spoiled rich (I think he was rich...shows how much I paid attention to this stinker) brat who goes to Paris with his equally useless, boring and bratty friends and sees their deaths or something like that. I wouldn't know anything else about it because it was such a turkey that Butterball could cut it up and sell it as lunch meat and that's probably the reason both my sister and I fell asleep partway through it.

Perhaps, but as a horror, it could be no worse, the plot is [weak].

Luckily for the cast, one strong willed gent has figured out this plan of death's. he takes matters into his own, powerful, ingenious hands. even after this \\"hunk\\" realizes out he can't stop it, he goes ahead and tries anyhow, very very very courageous of young vern. if you ask me, this guy is a little light in his loafers. final destination couldn't hold the attention of an invalid, sat in a chair, in a locked room with no way to shut off the tv, and nothing else in the room. i hated this movie with a passion. i hate the fact that somebody could possibly like it. and i believe my review reflects that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry but Far from a classic ...","review":"I'm sorry to say that I lost my time watching this movie ...

The best horror flicks are those that have a plot that revolves around what humans fear, but are too afraid to talk about. Death is something that people fear the most. Final destination hits all of the tender spots when it comes to death, holds you there and then drops you. This is definately a must have movie to own, it will be a classic.

After a few deaths (which I might ad are extremly random and could rarely occur) Devon Sawa thinks that there is a pattern to which these deaths are occuring, and basically the whole movie is just watching people die then watching people try to escape the death. Although the movie did try, and the look of the movie is great the overall movie is a mess. And before watching notice the R Rating this movie drops the F- Bomb thousands of times and many times its pointless."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good thriller.","review":"This is a \\"killer\\" teen movie with a new twist.

After seeing movies like 'Rec', or even respectably good horrors like 'Exorcist III' , movies like 'Final Destination' feels so boring, so forgettable, so dull, you wonder why you are wasting your time. I hate half-assed movies like this one. For reasons I don't understand, they are hyped, as well as movies like 'Screams'. On IMBD this film has a rating of 6.7. A good movie like 'Exorcist III' is rated at 6, yet the latter blows 'Final Destination' out of the water. I'll go back to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"come on","review":"This movie was just disgusting, not scary. The plot was weak and predictable, and most of the cast was unintelligent. The acting wasn't too bad, but it certainly wasn't top-notch. I hate how most of these teen slasher movies are all basically the same argo most if not all cast members die at a certain point and the main character is sitting down and drinking champange at the end and of course he doesn't die because then there wouldn't be a movie.

First off the script is poorly written. Then the direction of the script is poorly executed. Oh, let's not forget the casting.

The introductory segment of the film sets up the story with great suspense and drama that is so rare in horror films. Many people I know cried. The set ups in the bathroom and kitchen scenes have people uncomfortably anticipating the outcomes, and the bus scene is so shocking and innovative that many films will start emulating it for years to come. In fact, Scary Movie has already tried, but since it was a comedy it was more predictable and less shocking. A great film in the theater and I hope it can be captured as well on video and DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Plot! One of my favorites","review":"A scary, twisted nail biter.

It had an interesting premise yet there were several things we should point out:1) Girl friend dies yet there's no reaction whatsoever, I mean, it's plausible right after it happens due to shock yada yada, but I mean... throughout the rest of the movie there's no hint of distress... confusing to say the least.2) After his best friend dies, and goes to the morgue, he doesn't seem to worried or sad... that's just not right.3) Why the hell does death finally strike back RIGHT AT THE PRECISE MOMENT when they realise something's wrong, and that they shoud be dead by then? Why not before? I mean... come on.Well, I hope you agree on these glitches if you HAVE seen the movie, and if you haven't yet... DO WATCH it, and don't worry... these are minor details... no spoilers =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inventive story, but just not for me","review":"I thought the story behind 'Final Destination' was great.

Too depressing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, it made me laugh.","review":"I saw this movie in the theaters, and saw it again (not by choice) on DVD. Both times I felt that the film was more of a comedy than anything else. Anyone with any sense could predict what was going to happen next.And that's the good part, because at least it was funny! The acting was terrible, the special effects stunk, and it was just an overall bad film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent entertainment","review":"This book is part of a great trilogie. The story is base on the idea that humanity is back in some kind of middle age era after a big disaster that kill a lot of the people and reshape the earth. The universe the author has created is fantastic, fill with great tribes and complex caracters. The author, trough is characters, philosophy a little bit on humanity's great achievments and errors.

The history itself is not boring or confusing at all. In fact the story of the Mercury 13 women is very interesting and should be taught to everyone. Reading this book is a tiresome and irksome task for even an veteran reader. Martha Ackmann mutilated a historical event.

Highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"While these were obviously fine, capable women, they just weren't in the same class as jet test pilots with engineering degrees. The type of flying hours was more important than simply the number of flying hours. Their flying hours did not require the fast thinking and reflexes of a dogfight, or the precision flying and ability to remember and record every minute detail that test pilots were trained to have. I am not saying that they were not capable of that, but the requirements for the space program at the time were to be a test pilot, and most of the early astronauts had engineering degrees. Just because they wanted to be astronauts did not mean that they had the qualifications."},{"rating":"1","title":"A True Story?

It appears she had free-standing memories of the \\"abuse.\\" I remember her telling Woodbury that the incest with Dad was \\"groovy.\\" (???!!) Apparently she enjoyed it! What's more, she seemed to have been a consenting partner as if she were her own biological father's \\"other woman.\\"I wonder why the authors wrote the book.

To end on a positive note, i will say the packaging was done extremely well, with a color dvd to match the red packaging, a pack of cards with a stick of gum, so in that respect someone took some time and care into the dvd process, just not in content."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Really bad","review":"Boring.

Why this has anything to do with the title is beyond me to answer. Very little references to go by with seemingly overall irrelevant information, or the information is generalized to the point of irrelevancy.

Check the netgear discussion forums...everyone is having this problem and there is no solution.

I wanted an easily removable adapter, so I could remove it if internet interfered with homework. The install was fine; I always find it easiest to install updated drivers from the website rather than the install disc. they are always outdated. So I downloaded the drivers onto a jump drive on my pc, then installed them onto his pc. Attached the usb adapter and set windows zero config to run the wireless and it has worked flawlessly ever since. I did not install the Client software that came with the adapter. I use StatBar to monitor my access (freeware). I have not had issues with overheating as mentioned by others. The unit is powered up 10 hours a day. I like having the extension cable so we can aim it towards our router (2wire).

The install happened without a problem, the adapter connected without a problem. The connection speed is fast.However; in the two days I have had three blue screens (complete hard crash of the XP machine).

Not that there is some thing mysterious about it, nor dose it speak in tongues. I feel it is right to say that in this album the whole is much larger then the sum of the words written about it. It is complete in the sense that every track is good as a stand alone jewel, it is complete in the sense that combined together they are even better. This album IS about music, and there is little to add in term of labels, for any cataloging will fail dead in its tracks.This album is not for the faint hart, for the seekers of serenity, it is not for those who listen to dwell in soft ambient light. It is hard and fast. It is the rock and the hard place.It gave me many hours of pleasure. A pleasure that came from deep down inside."},{"rating":"2","title":"STUNNING !","review":"The long awaited return of Stero MC's \\"Deep, Down & Dirty\\" is a mind-blowing album that sounds like no other act does in dance music.Listening to this album you'll realize how influential this guys were for a whole era of music and continue to be. There's not even one bad track here. From the mesmerizing title track to the set's final piece \\"Shameless\\" it's a 50 minute of amazing techno-funk and groove.Worth every penny and the nine year wait! Listened to it 3 times back-to-back when i first got it and seems to be impossible to get enough of.

What's wrong with that? Stereo MC's older stuff is great too. The Stereo MC's know how to lay down a beat better than nearly anyone I can think of, and this album is evidence - in particular, listen to Graffiti parts I and II, and Sofisticated.

However, I regretfully have to give this product a one star review thanks to the Ultraviolet digital copy included with the Blu-Ray. Until recently, purchasing a digital copy meant downloading through iTunes and sharing with whatever device you pleased. With that being said, Ultraviolet requires that you download two programs onto your computer and make several new accounts. Once you complete all these steps, you can download the file in an MP4 format. Unfortunately, the MP4 wont play in any programs. I can't even figure out how to play it in one of the programs required for download. Hopefully, the creators of Ultraviolet will realize the error of their ways and understand that consumers want to choose how they download and view their movies. Until then, avoid Ultraviolet at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Watching","review":"This has to be the worst sequel to any good movie. Granted, the first hangover movie was hilarious, this one was a terrible rehash of the first with a small difference.

That is really skewing the reviews for this. Doesn't make sense to me. Are you reviewing the movie, the Blu Ray, or just the UV digital copy? If \\"just the UV\\", are you giving the entire product package a fair review? Matter of fact, have most of you one-star reviewers even seen the movie? You definitely haven't seen the blu ray since most of your reviews are dated before the release.Anyways, please ignore all the 1 star reviews related to the UV copy.

If you have a data plan on an iPad or smartphone, you will reach your capacity simply by viewing this movie. Why did Warner Bros. make this change after offering an ACTUAL Digital Copy with previous releases? I for one will be refusing to purchase ANY releases that include an Ultraviolet Digital Copy as they are completely useless.

Sure enough, two years later, audiences were treated to a second outing with the \\"Wolf Pack,\\" namely Phil, Stu, Alan, and Doug. If you've heard or read anything about the movie, you know that the typical summary offered is \\"It's pretty much the same as the first one, except that it takes place in Thailand.\\" This time around, it's Stu who's getting married, so the gang travels back to his fiancee's homeland for the festivities, and again, it's Alan who inadvertently brings about another forgotten night of mayhem that the fellas must piece together the day after. What the first movie had going for it -- namely, the element of surprise and a sense of joyful mayhem -- is largely missing from this sequel, which sports raunchier jokes and a much darker tone.

The only way to view digital copies with Warner Brothers new \\"Ultraviolet\\", \\"Flixster\\" mess, is to download yet another app and view the movie through that app. It can't be imported to your iTunes library which for me = WORTHLESS DIGITAL COPY. Not to mention the fact that if you read about \\"Flixster\\" on Wikipedia, after you sign up for an account, the company automatically emails everyone in your address book to get them to sign up for Flixster. What a joke. I will never buy a Ultraviolet Digital Copy again. I'm all for competition but, I should still have the choice on which program I would like to use. In my case, iTunes.

It seems that there are very few comedy writers left in Hollywood nowadays. It is such a pity to see so much money spent to produce such garbage. The movie put me in a very bad mood for several hours. No wonder, a lot of people are quitting going to the movies. What I hated the most about this movie, was the total lack of creativity. Very boring and repetitious. Too bad. The acting was actually pretty good, but the plot and storyline, was very, very bad.

Although they give you more of the forgotten night thru glimpses this is almost a copy of the first. Now why a gave it five stars, this movie is as funny of a movie as I have ever seen, Super Bad funny. So funny that I didn't even care it copied the first Hangover story line.

I'm glad I was open-minded enough to actually watch the movie because it sure was funny. Granted it's basically the first film transposed into Bangkok but how awesome is it to juxtapose the glitter of Vegas with the squalor of Thailand? (The monk boner/monkey scene shows how much further they could have taken it) As in the first each cast member does an excellent job of contributing their brand of comedy to the film and I did not feel at all like the cast members where trying to one up each other.

However, it was very disappointing. A recycled script to say the least. No originality from the first movie other than a change in location and, in this, an opportunity to get trashy by incorporating only the stereotyped aspects of the seediest side of Bangkok.

I must have seen it in the theaters 4-5 times. When I heard there was going to be a second (and third and fourth) movie made I was very excited. This movie just didn't compare. As many people had said before me, the humor/jokes/plot points were all recycled from the first movie. That isn't my main complaint though. The jokes in the first movie seemed natural and just flowed. In this movie they really felt scripted and you could really tell they were TRYING to be funny. I just couldn't enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the right product","review":"It said that you get the special edition well I got the plan blue ray copy not happy about it at all"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"Very entertaing, funny and silly. Recommend this to anyone who has seen Hangover I. A \\"Must see\\" movie. You will laugh until you cry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time and $5","review":"Loved the first one so we thought we would enjoy the second. WRONG. Plot is same as the first only not so funny. Full frontal nudity is getting old. Alan is mean and rude and generally unlikable. Not much to laugh about that hasn't been done before."},{"rating":"1","title":"They should have left Hangover Part I alone.","review":"Just like everybody else is saying: They should have just left the first Hangover alone as a classic in its own right...but they HAD to try to copy the same formula and almost un-originally make a part II that was just a carbon copy and LESS funny. The movie really sucked....and it was so predictable. Sure...the first one had its crazy and unrealistic moments...but it was still kind of believable in most parts. This one just takes it even further and many of the scenes are so unbelievable it's not even worth writing about. I don't even want to waste too much time writing about how disappointing this was. It's just like Grease 2.....a HORRIBLE follow-up to a classic (well, kind of a classic)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"We rented this for a dollar at the Red Box, I feel ripped off. This was such a horrible movie. Watch the first one, forget about part two."},{"rating":"2","title":"very, very funny","review":"I liked Hangover part 1 a little bit more but this was a worthy follow up.

I have watched it multiple times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Came up short","review":"The beginning was more of a slap stick comedy with Alan being more of an idiot than previously believed to be. Disappointing......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only a few laughs this time","review":"This sequel tries to take the first movie to Bangkok but just cannot deliver the laughs, although the actors try their best. Not much else to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment","review":"Those expecting to see more of the same in this sequel to the highly-successful original will be very disappointed. While the first Hangover movie was a side-splitting, wild ride, this sequel was devoid of any humor and had a dark tone that made for a very unpleasant viewing experience. In this go-round, the characters seemed joyless and the director relied on girlish screams to try to induce laughter (didn't work)instead of giving the characters actual funny situations to deal with. Especially annoying was the character of Alan who turned into a mean-spirited version of his former self. I had to watch the original after watching this wretched sequel just to get the bad taste out of my mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"UltraViolet is no good! Don't buy!","review":"UltraViolet digital download is no good, you have to create accounts and it will not work with itunes. In order to watch the movie on your computer you have to download a software, you can only watch using their software or stream onto devices. I made the mistake of purchasing the Green Lantern with UltraViolet and learned the hard way. Buy just the BluRay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not cool","review":"A rehash of the first film, almost to the T. Seriously, you guys were drugged and had another incomprehensibly crazy adventure. It sucks that this film had zero originality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay Movie. Worthless Digital Copy.","review":"\\"Digital Copy\\" does not exist. You can \\"stream\\" through Ultraviolet's crappy service. No internet connection? No digital copy. JUNK. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware not a true digital copy","review":"This review is strictly for the format as the movie is as funny as the first one. I wish I read the reviews first but not needing a review on the movie I did not think I needed to read them. I expected a true digital copy as with most Blu-rays that I could download into ITunes but this is not that. It is some horrible Ultraviolet digitial that forces you to create a Flixster account and download software to view a streaming or local copy.I am going to return this to Amazon and wait until a real digital version is available or just buy the cheaper blu-ray with no digital copy if available."},{"rating":"1","title":"an embarrassment to the acting and movie making community","review":"We rented this movie to unwind after the long Christmas weekend. The writers, editors, filmaker, actors (and i use this term only as an adjective, for there are no actors in this movie)publisher and producers should be ashamed of themselves for putting this kind of sloppily finished product out for the public. Not only does it insult the average person's intelligence, it slams whats left of todays morals by their crude shock and awe language and images. Shame Shame Shame. It is pretty sad when one stoops this low to make a buck; at another's expense; giving nothing back, stealing what they can get. If I had read the reviews I would not have rented this trashed vulgar movie; the only good thing from it is the lesson i wont forget for a long long time, read the reviews before buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"copy cat movie","review":"I loved hangover #1, but the second one was not very impressive. the entire movie was a copy cat of #1 just in a different place. It probably would have been better if they came up with some new ideas, but they just kept with the same ideas, but shot in a different location. This was a waste of film and money.Would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible waste of time and money","review":"I really, really liked the first Hangover. I have watched it several times and still enjoy it. This second movie was a huge dissappointment. The jokes and plot were like leftovers that have gone bad. The characters were just annoying this second time around. I don't know why they made such a fuss of Mel Gibson, he might have actually added something to the move. If you don't have Hangover 1, get that movie instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"No contest","review":"No matter how times you watch the first Hangover it is fantastic & always a great laugh.The second... no contest... the producers should have left it alone. The actors &setting in Thailand was great but not enough to pull it off. Very disappointingbecause I was so looking forward to a great laugh again. Whoever hasn't seen it, my advice isleave it & keep watching #1. (Note I do not see the Blue Ray copy)"},{"rating":"2","title":"GO OUT OF YOUR FREAKING MIND,... OR STAY AWAY!","review":"Let me just say,... if you liked part 1, then you're going to GO OUT OF YOUR FREAKING MIND with part2.If you didn't like part 1, then STAY AWAY (seriously) from part 2. This is some serious INSANE SH..., I mean, stuff.Yes the basic-plot is similar, and yes a bit of it is predictable. But what happens in between,.... is just super crazy!Five stars,.... not enough,... I'm giving 10 stars! (wish I could).The only thing I'm missing in this moive, is the \\"DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME, OR ANYWHERE ELSE\\" warning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny","review":"Another crazy movie for a good laugh. It was a little more raunchy than I like, but it was still a hillarious comedy that we like to watch on a stay home move night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was ok","review":"Not as good as the first one but funny I love Steve G. He is halarious so anything with him is great. I liked it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the first one","review":"I had gigantic hopes for this movie, it failed them. I think the only aspect that made this movie worth while was Zach Galifianakis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Felt like I was watching the first one again","review":"I guess Todd Phillips and crew must of ran out of ideas because they pretty much recycled the first movie screenplay and set it in Thailand. Some funny bits. Worth the 3.99 for streaming but it's nothing special."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time.","review":"Not even funny. I think I laughed twice the entire movie. Very poorly executed, unoriginal, and almost a complete copy-cat of the original. But this time around the jokes weren't funny. This was obviously nothing more than a cash cow for the studio."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOWN WITH ALL ULTRA-VIOLET COPIES!!!!","review":"Ultra violet copies are a useless ploy to try to get us to subscribe to more things!

Mainly wanted the iTunes version, getting the BluRay disc was just an added bonus. If I can't play the movie on AppleTV or iOS devices, it is useless to me. Guess I'll just have to buy the digital only versions from iTunes. Oh yeah, saw the movie in the theater, pretty funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitiful Excuse for a Sequel","review":"Horrible. Ladyboy s*x = not funny. If you want to find out what I mean by that comment, please, by all means rent this movie. If ladyboy s*x with one of the main characters is not your thing, then run."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOVED THE FILM; HATE ULTRA VIOLET COPY!!!!","review":"I just picked up the Blu-Ray/DVD/Digital Copy here on Amazon. The movie is great but the product itself sucks. Including Ultra-Violet copies of the film instead of the standard digital copy was a poorly thought out idea. It speaks volumes to me (and apparently the majority of consumers here) that Warner Brothers has elected to insult their customers this way. Why irritate people with a locked down, Internet-only copy of the film for portability? I might not be able to speak for all movie buffs, but I enjoy taking my films with me on the go. The Ultra-Violet copy requires an Internet connection for viewing which isn't always available. What a mean thing to do to your customers, Warner Brothers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could've Been Better","review":"The second Hangover does not come close to the original Hangover movie. It is basically the same storyline but not as funny. Only watch it if you definitely don't have anything else to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digital Copy from Flixster Hangover Part II","review":"I purchased this digital copy along with my DVD, but had I known what Flixster was all about I would not have. I wanted a digital copy I could download to my ipad and my ipod. So Flixster sent me a digital copy, but when I tried to download it through itunes it would not work. So I contacting Flixster again. Again they sent me another digital copy. And when I tried to download again through itunes, again it did not work. I brought this movie back on December 9 and here it is February 1 and still I do not have a digital copy. I am so fed up with this. I will just go buy a digital copy somewhere other than Flixster for sure from now on. This is the first time a have written a review on anything. I am just so furstrated with this. It is not complicated to send a digital copy that works. I have downloaded digital copies before and since. I just do not understand why I can not seem to get a working digital copy from Flixster. The movie was good and very funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This was the most disappointing Movie Ever. The story line was exactly the same as the original they woke up having lost one of the group and could not remember anything. I only managed to watch 1/4 and turned it off it was that bad. What a waste of my hard earned money.Adrian"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing, vile, not funny at all","review":"I concur with just about everyone else who watched Hangover Part II just because we enjoyed the original Hangover. The original was good for about a thousand laughs and was so original. The sequel is just depressing and was good for maybe 1/2 of a laugh. No hot women in this one folks, instead you get to see male junk. The torture they put the characters through is a bit unbearable to watch, you think you are watching a horror movie. Couldn't they have one joke in this movie at least? One laugh? The screenwriters probably wrote the script while high on coke it seems like. In any case I didn't watch this movie in the theatres thank god even though this movie became the highest grossing Rated R movie of all time. Just awful, don't see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"unbelievably bad","review":"if you think funny is watching a grown man cry like a blubbering little girl because his \\"buddy\\" told him they are no longer friends, then you will find this movie hilarious. this must have been written by high school kids... no wait - 8th graders!! I was a huge fan of the Hangover (1st one) and I when I heard they were coming out with a sequel, I couldn't wait! however, after watching this drivel, this movie was absolutely pathetic! it was the opposite of funny. same plot, but the writing was completely dumbed down. really mindless humor... I think the \\"Ernest\\" movies are funnier than this and I hate Vern! the only reason this movie was made is one reason: MONEY. they knew no matter how bad a movie it was, with the success of Hangover 1, they would rake in the dough... I don't know how it did in the box office (it was a Netflix rental), but I do know I'm glad I didn't waste my theater money watching it. don't waste your time on this crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"stinker","review":"These actors should be embarressed to have released this piece of junk.My wife left the room in the middle of it and my son and I felt sick after watching it.It has no originality,has gross scenes with a \\"HE-SHE\\" and is over the top stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"replay of the first movie, except not funny.","review":"This movie was a huge waste of time. It's just not funny. I normally LOVE all of these actors, and I did enjoy the first movie, but this is embarrassing.

DISAPPOINTED"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful ... substituted crude for funny","review":"First movie was about 10 times better than this and had me laughing from start to finish. This one was poorly written, too crude, and forced to be funny rather than naturally so in the first movie. DUMB. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a waste","review":"turned it off after the 1st hour having not laughed or even chuckled once. what a waste - terrible sequel, and too bad since the first one was so funny!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hangover Part II - poorly written, filmed and acted","review":"I was terribly offended by this movie. The frontal nudity and sexuality were not necessary. If I were a transgender human being, I would be deeply insulted by the portrayal and as a Thailand citizen, I would be very angry. I think the movie strove to shock us as much as possible and to insult. It was a harsh and mean spirited movie and lacked substance. If you are a parent I would definitely not allow your children to see it. I think even zero stars would be too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conned","review":"Whereas the first film, even though it wasn't great, had pace and originality and humor and decent writing...this seemed forced and labored and tragic and like an aggregate script written by several people in isolation from each other. And the story was unbelievable. The only thing worse than renting this would be buying it. Extremely disappointing. And as far as comedy goes - if you think watching people suffer is funny, well, then this is for you. One star for the monkey. I want my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny movie","review":"Hangover Part II is a great movie if you don't mind the same overall plot but in a different place with another twist...ect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"The movie was just as promised.

I hate that I had to download ANOTHER program that doesn't even work. I haven't been able to view the final Harry Potter and now I can't even see the Hangover 2. Flixster is a pain in the a$$!

I made the mistake you can only watch it when online"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, strange, bizarre, and classic...","review":"This film may be similar to the first one, but I don't mind that, as the first Hangover was one of the best comedies I'd seen in years. It may not have been as good, but it still was a pleasure to watch and had plenty of funny moments. Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis steal the show, and Bradley Cooper is very good as well. There was one scene that totally made me almost cry laughing...but I'll let you find out for yourself. It might have been a little dirtier than the first one, but not by much. Paul Giamatti makes an appearance, as does Mike Tyson, but Tyson is only in the last scene. Overall, a great comedy, but the bar was set pretty high from the first one, and it doesn't quite measure up, but still is worth a watch as it is much better than most comedies out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"I WILL NEVER BUY A BLU RAY THAT INCLUDES A ULTRAVIOLET DIGITAL COPY!!!","review":"This review is strictly regarding the scam that is the ULTRAVIOLET \\"digital copy\\". I was thinking about picking this movie up since I didn't get to see it in theaters but after the debacle of the ultraviolet \\"digital copy\\" that was \\"included\\" with Green Lantern I will never pick up any movie with the name ultraviolet in it, IT IS A SCAM!!!!! It looks like this will just be a one time rental."},{"rating":"2","title":"hangover part 2","review":"the movie is mad funny , i liked the party with the drug dealing monkey. i recommend it to anyone who isn t easily offended by transvesites , because there is a part about trans sexual strippers. that just scared me."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"i don't know why people thought that this was not a grade one comedy. i have seen lots of moviesand this was a great sequel. every bit as good as the first film. the first one was more of asurprise. i was expecting a lot and this one delivered. i loved it. perhaps because i havebeen in bangcock. but not really. it was a great plotted and delivered film. don't miss it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worse Sequels Ever!","review":"Two stars is really to generous! I think this is one of the worse sequels ever. It brings nothing new to the table. Talk about a pitiful sequel. They didn't even bother to write a new story. It is basically the same story minus the humor. It is so bad. I don't think there is a single scene as good as one in the first movie. I also wonder why no bad guys in the movie were Thai only foreigners as they call them in Thailand. If you've seen the first movie, I'd say this movie is a 1 star. If you didn't see the first maybe you could give it a 2 stars, because it may seem a little funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"ITS GREAT!!!!!!!!!","review":"This movie is one of the best movies i have ever seen.It has many funny clips. I highly recommendwatching this movie. bye"},{"rating":"1","title":"Adventures in Babysitting 2","review":"Where's Teddy, where's Teddy? You know, I just don't care about finding Teddy. The jokes are so mediocre. Completely boring until halfway through the movie, when the money transfer plot begins. I again lost interest, however, near the end of the film. Most of the antics the characters get into are cheesy and just plain dumb; i.e. started a bar fight, went to a strip club, did drugs and stuffed someone in an ice box, etc.The overall plot, aside from finding Teddy, was actually interesting, but the lame jokes and acting brought down the fun factor a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why bother? Oh yeah, to rake it in...","review":"This was a waste of my time. Re-hash of the same plot from the first movie, just changed up the scenery.Very disappointing. There are probably some fans of this, but you got to admit there was nothing original about this movie in comparison to the first Hangover film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hangover Part 2","review":"Sophmoric humor part 2. Will appeal to men in the under 35 age. Way TOO MUCH use of the \\"F\\" word. I bought this product with the Bridesmaids, and Hangover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The first movie was great, hit it out of the park. I had high hopes for this movie, but it didn't come close to meeting them. I bought this for $3.00 with $2.98 shipping, its a movie that i think is worth four of five dollars, but I wanted it off my wish list so I picked it up. I doubt there will be a third, but if so they need to listen to the audience of the second movie and highly improve how they are going to do it... there is so much room improvement. I would recommend this movie to someone who hasn't seen it yet and has a open afternoon with nothing on TV and nothing else to do anywhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I think the best word to describe this movie would be 'boring'.

Shipped quickly and as described on website. Did not need to contact the seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stunk","review":"If you liked the first Hangover, you might not like this one as it is not funny or very original. One and done for me.

I bought both of the Hangover movies anticipating an enjoyable back to back escape from reality after having surgery and taking my pain meds. While the first one barely passed for humor, this movie actually had very little to do with humor and IMHO the actors should have refused to do the material as it is so stupid. I didn't laugh during the film and I was under medication. The acting/actors in this film are the worst and I'm pretty sure they will not be seen again for even going along with this plot.

It tried very hard to replicated the zaniness of the original and fails badly,, The writing is poor...with poor puns...and plays on words being used to help the comedy along...The story is too close to the original version, and Zack Galifinakis seemed underutilized,,,being given poor comedic lines and plot opportunities. I am a fan of Zack...but this was not a good effort from him..his character was largely irrelevant...Teaching a real monkey how to smoke a cigarette..That is supposed to be funny? No."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultraviolet isn't that bad...","review":"Obviously I must be missing something with the Ultraviolet digital copy because I'm not finding it to be near as bad as everyone else is saying it is. First off, you can download it onto multiple computers...and even if you don't have it on a certain computer you can stream it from flixster (for three years). I've got an app on my iPhone that I can stream all my Flixster movies to. I'm thinking this is much better than your standard digital copy...but hey I seem to be the only one with a favorable opinion of the service!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Movie Ever","review":"I loved the Hangover movie. The first movie was so hilarious! It made me laugh until the end of the movie. The Hanover part II came out- I was so excited to watch it. Then I was disappointed with the movie... it did not make me laugh at all. I felt that there were many parts in the movie where people had to suffer pain. I did not find it funny at all. Do not buy it. It would save you a lot of money- trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This is just an excuse for a sequel and has no redeeming qualities.

Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry for you if you purchased this movie, if you received it as a gift OMG!!!","review":"The first Movie was Great. This second one was totally stupid. I forced myself to laugh once. The acting was lame, story line had promise, writer and producers should be embarrased. Mike Tyson singing!! Give me a break. I am most thankful that I waited to rent this from Redbox. Only out of a buck and change.Not stuck with a movie that even Goodwill would refuse as a donation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sequal","review":"I'm not sure what all the negative reviews are about. I saw the first one and I would have given that one an average rating. This movie was much better/funnier than the first movie in part because I know the background of the characters having watched the first movie. I was expecting another average comedy but it was surprisingly funnier than the first one. I haven't laugh that hard watching a movie in a long time. Especially near the end of the movie. I would definitely watch this movie again and recommend this movie to friends for a good laugh. I think if you have seen the first movie you might enjoy this one more since you already know the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"UltraViolet is sucks!!! don't waste your money buy this edition","review":"Ultraviolet Digital copies are not compatible in iTunes !!!! every time you watch it, you need an Internet connection. which means you are not able to watch in plant, subway any place without wifi!!!!

I eagerly anticipate their next effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thankful - 4.5 stars","review":"Mary Mary burst onto not only the inspirational but also the r&b; music charts with their dynamic first single: SHACKLES (PRAISE YOU). This single captured my attention with its message regarding the need to praise God in times of strife as well as times of plenty and the bombastic beat obviously also caught the attention of those who may have only listened to r&b; music exclusively.This disc has stayed in almost constant rotation in my cd player because of the many inspirationally thought provoking songs which were excellently produced & sung.To this day my favorite tracks are the aforementioned SHACKLES, ONE MINUTE, STILL MY CHILD, THANKFUL, WHAT A FRIEND, CAN'T GIVE UP NOW & GOOD TO ME (beautiful collabo with Destiny's Child).If you're building a gospel, inspirational and/or contemporary christian music collection, then THIS cd must added to your collection (and at the current price, you won't be wasting your money in maiking this purchase!!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC-GIVE GOD THE PRAISE","review":"Mary Mary is a wonderful album and I especially love \\"Can't Give Up Now\\".

These soulful sisters, have compiled a lovely CD. Some of the songs like--Wade in the Water--are creatively remade in a more modern upbeat tempo. This style was of particular interest to me, since I am not as big a fan of \\"ole' time gospel.\\" I love the message, but the style is a bit dated. Each of the songs addresses pertinent issues in the Christian walk. It will inspire you and get you singin'. I recommend this CD for anyone who likes to praise and dance to the Lord. If you like folks like Fred Hammond, Kirk Franklin, Winans Phase 2, then I think that you will enjoy Mary, Mary's \\"Thankful.\\" It will bless you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the soul","review":"Easy listening, beautiful harmonies and just enough gospel and praise that you know what kind of music you are listening to.

I am waiting until the children get out of school so they can listen to this CD as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thankful indeed! Worth 10 stars...","review":"Mary, Mary consists of two very giftful and blessed young ladies. I was first introduced to their music because a local hip hop station plays \\"Shackles\\". I bought the single \\"Shackles\\" which I listened to every morning when I got to work (Great way to finish waking up!). Shortly afterwards I got the \\"Thankful\\" CD. \\"Can't Give Up Now\\", an awesome song. You should listen to it, a powerful message: \\"I just can't give up now, I've come too far from where I started from. Nobody told me the road would be easy and I don't believe He's brought me this far to leave me\\" \\"Shackles\\" will remain my favorite, but \\"Can't Give Up Now\\" and \\"One Minute\\" are definitely in the running. Not religious? Don't believe? Get this CD for the beat, it's definitely there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I heard \\"Shackles\\" on the radio and knew immediately that I had to have the entire CD. I was pleasantly surprised to find the entire CD is wonderful. The song are so optimistic and these young ladies sing them with such obvious joy and an intensity that speaks to their own relationships with Christ. \\"I Sings\\" is a jam, I don't care what you say. I love it more than \\"Shackles!\\" And didn't they turn \\"What A Friend\\" and \\"Wade in the Water\\" into serious powerhouses? Most of the lyrics speak about humble beginnings and about the real need for God in our lives. That's what's really going on and Mary, Mary delivers the message loud and clear. I recommend this CD to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shackling","review":"A very good scriptural gospel album. Stunning album which catches instantly you and stays in you CD loader for a long time. My best pick are the \\"shackles\\" and \\"I Sings\\". I noted that there are traces of too much ad libbing on some songs. Its a pity they used the same producer on all songs making some songs sound similar. All in all arguably the best gospel album of the year. Its a must have CD though will definitely not linger as a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I love this CD. This is Fresh Contemporary Gospel. I can listen to this CD and move to it,but at the same time I get the message that is being sent of how Good God is. Unfortunately there are alot of Comtemporary Gospel Artist out there and based on the sound of the music and the words, I have to wonder who exactly are they talking about. With Mary Mary the message is clear. Thank you Mary Mary for a wonderful CD. I Can't wait for the next one. OFF THE HOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd is FANTASTIC!","review":"This cd is IT!

My email address is kre@.com so holla at a girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good album","review":"I totally, respectfully disagree, with Ms. Johnson, because I think this album does in many ways distinguish them from secular artists. The lyrical content on the album is totally in line with the Word of God, and many of the songs on the album are very up-lifting. Sure, there is an R&B sound to the album, but other than that, I would definitely would recommend this album to anyone who loves the more urban contemporary sound of Gospel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest to God","review":"Mary Mary sings with honesty, passion and the love for God and this is evident in their music. They sing the name of Jesus unashameably and testify boldly what God has done in their lives. It's not a wishy washy sort of a album but touches the heart and the souls of the listener. Everytime I play the album I can't help but be thankful for God's grace in my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED!","review":"I was not impressed with Mary Mary's debut cd. I expected the songs to be of higher quality. All of the songs sort of sounded alike. There was nothing about the songs, the voices, or the music to really grab my attention. I listen to secular and gospel music, so it's not like I'm a gospel \\"purist\\". Even the song they did with Destiny's Child was weak to me. I hate to say it, but this is not a very good cd in my opinion. Hopefully their next effort will be worth the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mary Mary NOT YESTERDAY","review":"I searched the website for Mary Mary song called Yesterday and this is what I got. Being new to ordering CD's online I did not see where I could check to make sure the song was on this CD and I did not feel A need to since I searched for the song that I wanted for my birthday. Well I got Thankful which is A CD that I got from my daughter when it came out years ago.

There is not one bad song, and this cd is well worth buying even if you have never heard them or even if you have all of their cds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Stuff!","review":"I really appreciate the rarities on this cd - they are all very good, and I woudl've never heard them otherwise. The live version of \\"Circle Of Friends\\" is worth the full price alone. The remixes are different, but I like them. However, I would've appreciated remixes of their more recent songs, i.e. from \\"Life, Love...\\" on?

Some of the songs are done very beautifully, but some I have to skip over and not listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT their best","review":"After receiving and loving their Steady On CD, I was looking forward to this one, especially after reading the reviews, but was somewhat dissappointed. Most of the songs have that overly-produced sound, that miss the heart and beauty that is evident on Steady On. Maybe this sound is a favorite of teenagers, which I am not. Many of the lyrics are common, uninspriring and overdone by other artists. They're great singers though, so I'll give their next CD a try (that is after I listen to it first at a music store)."},{"rating":"1","title":"great music terrible disk","review":"I bought a copy of this from a store and i put it in my player and it wouldnt work.

As she said, I was in fact referring to the 1969 original not the remix, which went to no 1 in the UK, thereby warranting its inclusion. (This information was obtained from the RCA boxed set \\"Elvis:From Nashville To Memphis - The Essential 60s Masters I\\").But, I take issue with Mr Bronsgeest's implication that my review was \\"nasty\\".

My personal view of the CD is that it is actually better than the ELV1S. The reason why is because I have always enjoyed his 70's music best. I played 'Promised Land', 'Moody Blue', 'Always on my mind', and 'American Trilogy' over and over again. The re-mix was very good but I did enjoy 'A little less conversation' better.I heard that they planning to make E3 next year with lesser known songs. I sure hope that they could put more later( post Elvis 68' comeback special)songs on. I think some great songs, would be... My Way, Unchained Melody, Polk Salad Annie, See See Rider, Steamroller Blues, Hurt, She still thinks I care etc. A great 1950's elvis song to put on the new CD would be 'I beg of you'. Of course some gospel songs would be great too.

I'm very disappointed that she doesn't have plans to write the sequel. It's really leaving us hanging. In this book I actually fell in love with Calder Hart...a powerful character in whom Joyce lets us see strengths and weaknesses. I empathized with Francesca in her defense of him. Come on, Brenda, one more time with Deadly...PLEASE write the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"Brenda Joyce fans, Francesca Cahill is at it again, this time her fiance is accused of murdering his former mistress. In my opinion, the story is fast paced. I quickly finished the book even though I tried to read it slowly.It shows Calder Hart's vulnerable side and how Francesca supported him during his darkest moments. I liked Francesca's spirit, intelligence, courage, love and recklessness. I appreciate that Calder tries to be noble only because of Francesca.It seems that there's a budding romance between Evan Cahill and Maggie Kennedy, Sarah Channing and Rourke Bragg. There's not enough story about them though, they only touch upon their lives. And what about Rick Bragg and Leigh Anne? Not enough about them, but then again it's a Francesca Cahill series. If Ms. Joyce gave enough focus on all the characters then the book would be 1000 pages long!Overall, I enjoyed the book very much. I liked the characters and the story, to me it was exciting, romantic and funny. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning to fans of this series...","review":"I am a fan of the Francesca series and love the first 6 books. I am sorry to say I will not be picking up another after this read. Here's why, Francesca is no longer believable. Yes, I know this is romantic fiction, but I found my limits of 'suspension of disbelief' completely overtested with this one. Francesca is a noble character, but her nobility regarding Calder's secret was too much. Secondly, I have a bit of a problem with continuity...Calder explains something about the romantic nature of his relationship with Daisy that is completely contradicted in 'Deadly Affairs' I know this is picky, but the author seems to be trying to rewrite her character's history. It just seems like with the switch in publisher's the bar was lowered in terms of story and character development. Frankly, it's boring. I am so sad that a series that I loved, is now something I will be passing by on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Worthy","review":"This book has been long awaited by many fans of the Deadly Series. Once I purchased the book, I could not put it down until I was finished. Many of the character plots are becoming more complex. I suspect this is to keep us all on a string until the next book arives in a couple of years. I was a little disappointed with Fran's character. Really, how noble can you be when the man you love may go to prison for a crime that he did not committ. In this installment, I believe that Fran's character is finally growing up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Remotely Comparable to Her Earlier Works...","review":"I utterly loved the whole Francesca Cahill series, it combines romance, suspense, and humor altogether. However, Deadly Kisses just does not live up to the brilliance of the previous F. Cahill novels. The premise of this is bland, and Miss Joyce is too forcefully trying to make the characters sound funny. I am really disappointed with Deadly Kisses. I will admit, I have been waiting for it to come out since last year. I don't think I will continue reading this series any further, however good the next book may be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Homes & Garden Story book","review":"Old collectible book with older stories.

Like them, I think O'Brian died too young at 86; the twenty books in that series were not enough.In hopes of finding a bolt of lightning like the ones I had found in earlier readings of O'Brian's work, I picked up The Unknown Shore. I am pleased to report that I was not disappointed.As a stand-alone volume, it lacks the density and momentum of the Aubrey-Maturin books, but it definitely shares the same parentage. It is very entertaining, both amused and amusing and, ultimately, familiar. It was like finding money in the pockets of old clothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing less than an excellent Aubrey-Maturin PREQUEL!","review":"Fans of the Aubrey-Maturin series will not be disappointed.Here again is the real, witty dialog, the warm (and evil) characters, the all-too-real scenery made possible by what can only be called preternatural powers of story-telling.You won't be disappointed in experiencing O'brien's failings, too: complete disregard of tying off the loose ends of a plot, complete lack of any epilogue.

The firgurines are similar but the base and position of the sword are different. Also, mine has gold accents on the helmet, sword and the shield on the horse's chest.

On these cuts, all but 1 guitar riff and Bono's vocals are stripped from the song making the remixes sound terribly forced, not to mention poorly paced.On the other hand, \\"Big Girls Are Best\\" is an EXCELLENT outtake from the \\"Pop\\" sessions and a must have for any U2 fanatic.Thumbs up on the cover photo as well, these guys still look great after all those years !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK for fans of 'Pop' and dance mixes","review":"This single features the same version of \\"Stuck in a Moment\\" as the record, 'All That You Can't Leave Behind.' So why buy it? \\"Big Girls Are Best\\" is an outtake from the 'Pop' sessions, much in the same vein as the other b-sides from that record (like \\"Holy Joe\\" and \\"Happiness is a Warm Gun\\"). The remixes of \\"Beautiful Day\\" are interesting if you are into dance remixes (and if that is the case, check out the Perfecto Mix single of \\"Even Better Than the Real Thing\\"). Otherwise, pass this one by."},{"rating":"2","title":"Australian's are best!","review":"This is an exclusive U2 Australian import single with four (4) tracks, including: Stuck In A Moment You Can't Get Out Of (album version), Big Girls Are Best, Beautiful Day (Quincey and Sonance Remix), and Beautiful Day (The Paul Oakenfold and Andy Gray Perfecto Mix). As far as remixes go, they're not bad. I'm just not usually a fan of them. But if you wanna host a U2 rave, you'll love 'em. Big Girls Are Best was produced by Flood and Howie B and is obviously a leftover from POP. It's gritty and fun with heavy bass, jangly guitar, great harmonies, and a '60s Britpop feel to it. Big Girls Are Best alone makes this a worthy purchase for any U2 fan. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great cd!","review":"I don't care what anyone else says-this cd is great. It reminds me of Neil Young's \\"Comes a Time\\"-warm and accessible. The Jayhawks have been a favorite of mine for some time and I hope this disc sends them straight to the top. All you have to do is listen to this cd and one of the disposable acts on the top 40-which would you rather listen to?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Jayhawks' \\"Smile\\" is the sound of summer!","review":"\\"Smile\\" is my introduction to the Jayhawks, and it is a revelation. Great harmonies, compelling lyrics, Beatles and Traveling Wilburyesque arrangements-- it inspires me to turn people on to this album. Play it at picnics, play it at the beach, blast it in your car. This is an extremely special collection of songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Music for Long Lonely Drives","review":"SMILE is on repeat as I write this. It's currently a new favorite discovery. I was actually quite surprised that I like the album this much since I sort of forgot they existed after TOMORROW GREEN GRASS. SMILE has a very earthy, neo-late-60's feel. And it works. Songs such as \\"I'm gonna Make You Love Me\\" and \\"A Break In the Clouds\\" have choruses that are catchy and will have you humming along in no time. The lyrics are mixed between hopelessly romantic and cautiously optimistic--I like that. Then there is \\"Broken Harpoon\\" and \\"Mr. Wilson,\\" which are just well written and heart-warming songs. SMILE is an album I'd take with me on long car rides. It's a perfect album to daydream along to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good?","review":"I didn't expect this to be quite this good. I purchased on another positive review and was pleasantly surprised at the quality. This is definitely a more pop direction for the Jayhawks, but I think it solidifes Gary Louris as the real talent in this band. The overall quality matches their previous high marks reached with Hollywood Town Hall and Tomorrow the Green Grass. Not a weak song in the bunch and several outstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the?","review":"I have been a HUGE Jayhawks fan for a long time. This record, unfortunately, misses in a big way. I have no problem with bands trying to \\"spread their wings\\" or explore new musical soundscapes, but this is just a mismatch, plain and simple. The songwriting suffers, the production is bland and embarassingly close to sellout, and if it didn't say \\"Jayhawks\\" on the front cover I wouldn't know which cut-and-paste band of the week I was listening to.This can't be the same band that created the beauty of Hollywood Town Hall and Tomorrow the Green Grass. Instead of beautiful melodies we get boring, unoriginal riffs and (shudder) drum machines. Fine for some bands, but the Jayhawks do NOT play to their strengths on this one. There are a couple of nice songs, but I can't bear to listen to this thing straight through."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mismatch of the Century","review":"This CD makes me very sad. The Jayhawks were one of my favorite bands. Artists need to expand their horizons, yes, but this is the mismatch of the century. Bob Ezrin made great Alice Cooper records in the Seventies. Twenty years later, should he be redefining the Jayhawks? That's a matter of opinion, I guess. There are good songs on here, don't get me wrong. Some work pretty well. (Mr Wilson, Smile) Others are embarrassing. If they wanted to merge their style with a more modern approach, (drum samples, loops, etc) they would have done MUCH better with Mitchel Froom producing. This CD may grow on me. I wasn't impressed with Sound of Lies at first and grew to kind of like it. It's doubtful, though, that I will, since I have never grown to admire an album that made me cringe on first listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overproduced","review":"First, I *LOVE* the Jayhawks. I have worn out the last 3 disks and Golden Smog's \\"WEIRD TALES\\". But if I wanted to listen to Air Supply or the Traveling Willburys, I would have bought their albums. This album is terribly overproduced.So while this is still better than almost all of the music out there, please don't let this be your first Jayhawks album. I'd recommend \\"Tomorrow the Green Grass\\".p.s. I was too harsh. At least a 3.5 star album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the earlier Jayhawks","review":"No no no... After buying \\"Hollywood town hall\\" and \\"Tomorrow the green grass\\" you might think that \\"Smile\\" will sound the same - well it doesn't.

Skip this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dish drain","review":"Not the item I expected to receive. Seemed more plastic and smaller than I needed.

She would always compliment me on my wooden $5.00 rack I purchased from IKEA well over 4 years ago. So I thought, certainly I won't get a really good friend a $5.00 gift, let me search for a more expensive one. Well, this rack is very massive, much larger that it appears in the picture. Surprisingly, it is excessively flimsy. It is designed for glasses to be placed on the upright prongs, but unless you have enough items to balance the rack, the glass will bend the prong and slide right off. Trust me I am speaking from experience. I wanted to see the gift I purchased in action. Here's what happened: I went to my friend's house and I saw her glasses sitting on the side of the rack. (maybe she realized the shaky nature of the rack and didn't want to say anything). I show her the \\"proper way\\" to use this gift of mine...and of course her glass fell off and shattered.

I returned it to Stacks and Stacks and it was delivered to them on May 1 but as of May 12, I still haven't received a credit for the return.

Most of the football stories are relayed via photos; you can find more dynamic material on YouTube for free.Considered that Beckham is still writing great new chapters to his own story with the Galaxy and his resurrection in Capello's England squad, we'll hopefully see a better retrospective on his career sometime in the future.

It's very up-to-date, and well written and thought out. It has lists of all of the cars, with the early ones priced by color so you can keep track of which ones are more or less expensive. The colors in the color guide don't look that good to me, and since there are so many shades, I didn't find it that valuable, but the price guides are very good. They aren't completely up to date in and of themselves (how could they be?) but they're as good as they can get, and you can use them to judge how much one color will cost as opposed to another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Wheels guide probably indispensable","review":"I have an interest in older Hot Wheels, and was looking for values and prices. This is the only book that differentiates between the various colors of the early cars, and those colors make all the difference in value. As a result this book is almost indispensable. The color guide itself is only so-so, being particularly difficult to match up with some of the brighter colors. There were so many shades that sometimes the guide is only so-so too. But since this is the only book that even bothers to attempt to divide the cars by color, this is the one to get."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's OK","review":"Honestly the latest edition is just a tired rehash of the last one. No effort to clean up errors, just seemed to be rolling the same information over and smacking it with the lastest edition number on it. The pages fall out of every edition I have owned. If you are a Redline enthusiast, there's a new game in town. The Ultimate Redline guide by Jack Clark and Robert Wicker is it! It's a hardback, has really neat history of the cars. Beautiful pictures, and lists all variations.I like a little more substance than what the Strauss book has offered lately. Hopefully Clark and Wicker will release more books soon and put this guide out of it's misery!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tomarts Guide to Hot Wheel Collectables","review":"As others have said before me....the guide is a rehash of previously error filled versions. I have collected since 1994 and would only use this book to identify what the car looked like and possibly the year it was manufactured. Strauss promotes his own limited editions with high prices over more valuable limited editions. Accuracy is not one of the attributes of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Page-Turner!","review":"If you are looking for a story with a rich, potent plot that will hold your interest right up until you've reached the back cover, this novel is for you!

The government corruption is right on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, LOUSY LOUSY transfer","review":"This is one of Clint's best, but the transfer is awful.

Movie 3 stars, transfer 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"8 million bullets, 3,000 cops, no one hit a tire?","review":"So, so story rendered totally unbelievable by the climactic scene in the bus. All they had to do to stop him was shoot out the tires, but not a single cop in the entire police force could figure that out, not to mention with the amount of ordnance they expended, statistically all the tires should have been shot out accidentally anyway. It really is pretty insulting, when you realize you're supposed to be able to suspend disbelief through the scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay for an action movie","review":"Plenty of suspense, running, shooting, dodging, and betrayal. This movie is really not realistic in some parts, like when a bus gets shot up about 1,000 times and none of the bullets hits the fuel tank. Nor can I say the movie has much depth and the plot is relatively predictable. The only good part about it is portrayal of police corruption, although this is certainly not the only movie to do so, and a strong female character, which is usually terribly lacking in these types of films. Considering it was made in the 1970s, maybe some of the cliche scenes can be forgiven."},{"rating":"2","title":"a \\"nothing witness\\" for a \\"nothing trial\\"","review":"If you like Dirty Harry you should like this show. Lots of good one-liners, an Eastwood movie staple. Eastwood calls Blakelock after escaping two near death experiences and says, \\"Someone doesn't want your nothing witness to testify at your nothing trial\\". It's amazing how the bus they're in gets riddled with thousands of rounds of ammo but they never bother to shoot out the tires. But who needs realism in an Eastwood movie? The show is as much a comedy as action adventure. Realistic it isn't but entertaining it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gauntlet","review":"I figured I'd check out some old movies I liked, redone for Blue-Ray.

It's nice to see peoples faces, details and such clear. The train was neat!I'm looking forward to checking out some others. I got Logans Run (someone on the show Redeye mentioned it and sure eonough Blue-ray!) but I haven't watchedit yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another fine Clint Eastwood cop flick","review":"\\"The Gauntlet\\" is yet another fine Clint Eastwood cop flick. In this one Eastwood is a down and out police officer, out of favor with his superiors. He is detailed to escort a prisoner back to Arizona to testify (Sandra Locke). Naturally, there is more to it and a conspiracy brewing, and more would be telling. The main focus of the film is the interaction between Eastwood and Locke, and the chemistry is very successful. In fact Locke is perhaps the best female lead I have seen in any Eastwood flick--she is perfect for this role and kind of runs away with this movie.While I'm not sure I buy the ending, this film is great fun that every Clint Eastwood fan will enjoy. Recommended.

Leckie has a lot to be proud of, and a lot to be honored for, those were not the things.Still, this book was very informative and gives you a great insight to the daily life of a Marine in the pacific during WWII.

Now, having read his book, I wonder why he joined the Corps? A lot of the book is about liberty and getting over on SNCO's and Officers. His self-serving way of life often got him into trouble with the officers and SNCO's whom he generally regarded with contempt for holding him accountable. The end of the book was disappointing. About six days into Pelelieu he gets wounded - September 1944. The next thing you know the bomb is dropped on Hiroshima. Nothing for a year and for all his experience and trials he ends the book with this \\"big, BAD bomb\\" ending as if the US cheated the Japanese. The book's a crock!

I've read With the old Breed and then China Marine, both by E.B. Sledge. I watched the HBO series, The Pacific. I've read The Last Stand of Fox Company (which admittedly was about the Korean conflict). As such, I'd regard myself as having some basis for \\"observing\\" the war in the Pacific.Leckie's book, Helmet for my Pillow, in comparison to the above,is,in a word, \\"blah\\", i.e., maybe a fun book for some, but definitely not a serious read for students of WW II. Frankly, I was looking for a companion read to the Sledge \\"Breed\\" book. But, after getting about a third of the way through this book, I found it too boring to continue so returned it to the library (other Kindle readers, take note!).

He is a warrior and good soldier, literate and loyal to friends, as well as rebellious, cantankerous and irritating. I wonder how Leckie's family feel about the film, though it is much kinder to Leckie than his own account of his adventures during those early campaigns in the south Pacific. The omissions and condensations in the film are understandable and do not contradict the spirit of the book. I am grateful to Tom Hanks and the others who have spent so lavishly of time and resources to bring this story to the screen, to actor Dale for his masterful recreation of Leckie, and to Robert Leckie himself for writing this remarkable book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written memoir","review":"There are hundreds of first person accounts from surviving veterans.

It is well written, verging on poetic at times, and conveys a feeling of ingenuity uncommon in today's war literature. It is at some times gently humorous, and portrays Leckie and his fellow marines very believably. However, like many people, I felt after finishing it that it was more a portrayal of the friendships of the characters and minor events with little to do with the war than the war itself; For instance, events like Leckie's escape from MP's are very detailed, whereas the Battle of Tenaru is a fairly brief and vaguely described event. Overall, this is still a stellar novel that should not be missed.

But she soon gets captivated by their children. By living there, she earns their (and their mothers') confidence. I am in awe of the children, but this I am not surprised about: I know how resilient and creative children can be, even in the most dire circumstances. This film shows that brilliantly. But I also greatly admire this woman, Ms. Brisky, not only for her artistry, but for her heart and committment. She doesn't go in and grab the story and leave these beautiful children to their difficult lives, as many photographers and filmmakers do. Instead, she keeps coming back to them. She offers them classes in photography, she offers them new experiences, she fights for them. By her tenacity and caring, she offers them hope. 5 stars is not enough, but it is the most that is allowed here.

Whether they go to boarding school or into prostitution they still have some important life experiences that they would not otherwise have had.This movie is both enlightening and depressing.

The head (the part the speaker is supposed to sit on) is rounded off, which makes the speaker wobble - it is impossible to make the speaker face forward, it will only sit pointed slightly up or slightly down. The clamp at the base that keeps the shaft from sliding down is a screw, and it is very hard to screw it in tight enough to support even lightweight speakers.Cheap price, cheaply made.

I could not believe how some of the \\"members and former members of GA\\" could actually say so much and be so hurtful to people. Every church have disagreements, but do not broadcast it to the whole world. Many of the statements in the book are not truthful.It is also upsetting how Christine can have the word \\"true\\" on the cover of the book and inside (in much smaller print) she states some statements are imaginary or unsubstantiated. Also, why did she use some fictitious names for some of the people and not others?

The media has presented one viewpoint of what happened in April of 2003 but it was not the view shared by all members of the town or the church. I did not have a close family member who got sick but that might have helped me be a little less biased.This book has looked at the situation a little more objectively than any of the media outlets did. Young portrayed a true picture of some of the events that went on within the church community.

I'll save you the trouble- it concludes that there is absolutely no evidence that the papyri (the supposed subject of the book) ever existed and if they did whatever was contained in them was taken to the grave by Carter and Lord Carnarvon. The book goes on completely unrelated tangents (such as mini biographies of the Rothschild's, the \\"true\\" location of Mt Sinai, etc.) all to \\"prove\\" that the Jews don't have a right to Israel!

This gets you to know Mace Windu's character much better, showing you his roots, as well as his place of birth.

I was sure I had heard of it somewhere, and it was in the used clearance bin, and it was on Nuclear Blast, so I figured what the heck. Was I in for a surprise!Dark and depressing is the only way to sum up this romantic gothic/doom album. I've rarely heard a female voice go to the depressive levels that Mariana Holmberg goes to on these tracks. There's no low-end growling (Theatre of Tragedy) or operatic attempts (Tristania, Nightwish). Instead, her soft and brooding voice fits the band's musical style perfectly. The music is relatively simple, but very well arranged and performed. Very deep and heavy, yet slow and very captivating. It's easy to get the melodies stuck in your head for days. The best track is probably \\"The Wounds of Bitterness\\", but many others are close behind. Watch out for the last track--it's sounds like a different band! Really heavy and brutal. What a perfect way to end the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Great stories from one of the best writers in the comic book industry of the last decades. C'mon, it's Alan Moore!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Series","review":"Moore is a brilliant writer. What he did with the Swamp Thing franchise-- totally reinventing it and making it better must not have been an easy task. The explanation of Swamp Thing's resurrection after having been blown to bits was clever, and recreating the very essence of the monster was well played also. The writing is dark, gritty, poetic, and inspired.This is the perfect place to start if you want to get into the Swamp Thing.Also, this is a franchise that could use a re-imagining on screen, and the Alan Moore material is what should be used as its source. There lies the potential for DC to have another Dark Knight-like success in cinema if they get the right people involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very over-rated","review":"Ok, lets get this straight...a comic book has to be good at 2 things...story and art. If you just want a good story, read a novel, if you want art, buy a painting. A comic book should be both. The artwork in this is horrible. I know there are different types and styles of artwork, and im fine with that ( ie. Dark Knight by Frank Miller...very different style, but you can still tell its well done for what it is). This is just plain bad. The artist Stephen Bissette needs to find another job. The story itself is just mediocre. Im a comic book fan and horror fan, but this just does not cut it. Amazed people rate it so highly, when compared to Dark Knight, Watchman, Sandman and others. ( PS . .this artwork reminds me of first few issues of Sandman book...ALSO horrible art, although great story at least)."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"What can I say.

It presented the viewpoint and supporting research in a way that was both interesting and informative. I use it in my undergrad human sexuality course to start discussion about this topic.It is not really a drawback, but this video really changes course in the last ten minutes. It goes all humanistic to try to make the inherent determinism of the behavior genetics approach a little more palatable for general audiences. It moves from research to philosophy.

To our minds, the story is like a rubber band, forever stretching, chasing the color away as the story line grows thinner and thinner. While reading Abigail Hobbs's trial, we were falling asleep.

And, most importantly, I realize that he is famous for stunning twists at the endings of lots of his books.Keeping all that in mind, I have to say that I was shocked and hurt by the, well, absolutely horrifying surprise ending to this book. To say it came at me out of left field would be a massive understatement. It's more like I was standing at home plate in Dodger stadium and was hit by a ball thrown from left field in Yankee Stadium. Truthfully, I never saw it coming. And I was horrified by it. I finished the last pages with my mouth hanging open.And I feel betrayed as well.

Unfortunately I found this book a huge disappointment. Patterson is a talented writer but he seems to be in a \\"money hunt\\". That is, he is capitalizing on his success by churning out 3 - 5 books a year. Sadly, most of these are joint efforts, in which I suspect the secondary author writes the book and Patterson acts as editor. That would explain why the quality of his work is diminishing.I'd love to see 1 really well written novel a year from this author that is written by him alone. Beach Road is certainly not it. It is a completely mundane work with a weak plot and lacking in the usual Patterson suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take this road","review":"Let's get one thing straight: Patterson doesn't write literature material. I don't doubt he could, but he's all suspense and thrills. So the characters are a little flat, so the chapters are short, but isn't that final twist what we're all waiting for?The twist in this story shocked me. It almost got me a bit upset. It's not a happy ending, but a bittersweet one. I believe Patterson (who, by the way, has answered the question of how he tag teams with his co-authors)has created a thriller. Period. Let's put aside the court details ... the man isn't Grisham. Put aside the intricate fleshing of the characters ... he's not King. He's not a Rolls Royce or a Meditterranean-style villa. He's a Ferrarri, an F-16, a bachelor's condo. He's Patterson: thrills and speed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheat Road","review":"WARNING - POSSIBLE SPOILERWhen an author chooses a first-person narrative, he is obliged to be honest in expressing the character's thoughts.

Reminded me of \\"Murder of Roger Acroyd\\" by Agatha Christie.

In case of Beach Road, the end comes as absurd rather than surprising...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame and shame on Patterson","review":"If this had been my first Patterson book I would have never wanted to read another.

Shame on Patterson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tricky Twist","review":"Although I have noted that many reviews were disappointed in this offering by Patterson and DeJonge, I found the story engaging and well done. However, I listened to it on an audiobook,and that may reflect my overall satisfaction. Unlike most CD books, there was a variety of actors, a different one for each of the many characters. This provided a very interesting listen since I felt the readers characterized their roles with considerable skill. Since the story was told from the variety of viewpoints, one chapter devoted to one voice, it was possible to keep the reader/listener unaware of the villain's identity. The twist at the end took me completely by surprise, but was a satisfactory turn of events for this story. The tricky device of multiple points of view allowed the authors to keep the reader/listener 'in the dark' until the unusual climax arrived. This book doesn't measure up to an Alex Cross novel, but it has merit and is a good crime drama."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Trick","review":"The book was not great but at least it was mildly entertaining...until I got to the ending and that totally ruined it.

It made the entire reading experience a big waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Thriller","review":"Great Book from James Patterson.

Not one that I would recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining.....but just barely","review":"A bit simplistic....I've always been a Patterson fan, but it seems that the prolific churning out of material is having a negative effect on the end product. It's still a lot of fun to get through a book in less than a day, but much in the same way as watching an episode of CSI or SVU or one of the many franchise cop shows. Character development, plot development are starting to fade away along with overall quality of writing.

As for the \\"surprise ending,\\" Agatha Christie already did that -- and a much better job of it -- with The Murder of Roger Ackroyd 80 years ago.

Glad I didn't pay for this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The surprise is unbelievable...in the worst possible way.","review":"I won't spoil the \\"surprise\\" twist, but will say that the reason it is a surprise is that it makes no sense. When a character speaks in first person throughout a book, then is suddenly cast in a totally different light, it feels like the author cheated.Love the Alex Cross books. Wish Mr. Patterson would focus his considerable talent there and stop with the cheap tricks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left A Bad Taste!

I am a big fan.this book, has a poor ending, and not believable.disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ending made this a piece of junk","review":"I was enjoying this book until I got near the end. The ending was a piece of junk. It was unbelievable and made me feel as though the whole book a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly written","review":"I can't understand why James Patterson is so popular. This is the third (and last) book I have/will read by Patterson, and remain unimpressed by the strength (or lack thereof) of his writing. The characters are poorly developed and the \\"twist\\" in this book falls flat--definitely not a page-turner. Ultimately, I have been disappointed with Patterson's books and will be sticking with other 'tried and true' authors (e.g. Deaver) whose books I find far more enjoyable than Patterson's."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad ending","review":"There are enough reveiws on this book that I don't have to write a synopsis - read the others. All I have to say is that I hated the ending so much that it ruined the entire book for me and I'm throwing it right in the trash. Certainly an author of Patterson's ability could have come up with something else more plausible and digestible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Different Perspectives But All Dull","review":"I couldn't finish the book so I never got to the outlandish finish other reviewers commented on. As each character h took over a chapter and had their say I would think \\"OK this character is dull but maybe the next one will be better\\". No they don't get any better. It was a real chore just to give the book a fair chance before taking it back to the ship's library (I was on vacation). Thank God I didn't have to pay for this mess. Patterson has done some good \\"junk books\\" for beach reading or business trips but this isn't one of them. Stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Still mad","review":"Like another reviewer, this is my first review on Amazon. But this book made me so angry that I immediately sat down and wrote a blog entry titled \\"Aaaahhhh!\\" Guess it's a good thing that JP is such a bestseller, because otherwise NO editor would have allowed that ending. He jerked his readers around with this one. I'd burn it if I had a fireplace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful...","review":"Reads like a bad daytime soap opera. I left my copy in the pocket of the airline seat. Whoever finds it is welcome to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I don't usually care for James Patterson's stand-alone books, but since I enjoyed \\"Honeymoon,\\" I thought I'd give this one a try.All through the book I found it to be pretty boring -- it moved very slowly with really the same thing happening over and over. Then some small thing would happen which served no real purpose to further the book and which was really never explained and we'd go right back to Tom and Kate working on the case.The ending was a surprise but unbelievable. And after it was sprung on us, it seemed to go on way too long until it was finally wrapped up.In the future, I'll stick to the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"a comic strip without the drawings","review":"I picked this up at the airport and stopped reading after 100 pages. Each chapterette is about 2 pages long, and the book reads like a series of comic strips. It's a page turner in the sense that you have to turn the page to find out what happens in the next strip. I might have stuck with it if there had been drawings to look at, but the writing itself doesn't hold much interest.I think the author(s) have relied too heavily on a formula for contemporary novel writing...using rules about words/sentence, actions/page, twists/book. Reading a book ABOUT the formula (e.g., The writer's little helper by James Smith, Jr.) is so much more interesting than reading a book so blatantly structured USING the formula."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Ending","review":"Just finished Beach Road. I usually like James Patterson, but this book left a lot to be desired. It is like he did not know how to finish the book, so he just slapped together a \\"twisted\\" ending. It did not make sense when compared with the storyline. I was disappointed and somehow felt cheated. The main story was good, but the last few chapters belonged in a totally different book. It could have been so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"RUN, don't walk, away from this book!!!!!","review":"I have read and enjoyed many James Patterson novels in the past but I have found that lately the books not involved with his two biggest franchises (Alex Cross & Women's Murder Club) have been so uninspired and really bad. I mean like brand new to writing should have never been published bad. Here Patterson, along with his coauthor (whatever that means) gives us a tale tell in the Hamptons but sounds stolen from John Grisham's Ford County. It goes from trivial and predictable to strange with the addition of real celebrities for no other reason than to name drop. Then the twist is bizarre, implausible, and mostly ridiculous. I'm racking my brain to figure out how I could have disliked this more but I did finish it so that has to count for something right? Anyway, this should be avoided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooo!","review":"What a disappointment! Strange for James Patterson to release such an amateurish book. There were very unrealistic ridiculous scenes with real life characters and that should have been the first sign but I kept going. Then the twist comes and it's just completely unrealistic and out of left field, completely unbelievable. Suspension of disbelief is gone in an instant and it's all been a waste. What a drag!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your time","review":"I love Patterson's books... this one does not hold up on any level. I was anxious to be finished because the characters were so shallow. Then the only one who seemed fleshed out and likable turns out to be unspeakably evil in the last few pages.A cynical and amateurish plot twist... all in all very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do you waste your time or money","review":"The story doesn't make a lick of sense. A lot of 2-page chapters which seem to be his thing. Writing is bad. Oh, no, it's not just the ending. The whole book sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"There is nothing quite like a James Patterson to brighten your evening. He is one of the great mystery writers of our day. His stories are full of twists and turn, heart thumping excitement, and even heart touching moments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Summer Read!","review":"The team of Peter de Jonge and James Patterson have done it again. Just like their bestseller \\"Beach House\\", with \\"Beach Road\\" they've crafted a thriller you can't put down. The ending will not leave you disappointed.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"This light-weight book definitely qualifies as a \\"beach\\" read. You can zip through it in no time and when you get to the end you'll wonder why you wasted your time. The ending is so off-the-wall it spoils what little appeal the book had. I'm all for plot twists but they should at least be believable. This one wasn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beachroad","review":"Did not read the middle to the end of this book, jumped to many characters. Did not like the book, could not good into it, the funny thing is I am a James Patterson fan because I like the way he writes smaller chapters, but did not like this book! Big fan of his women's detective series!wdheisey@npacc.net"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the paperback...","review":"After seeing all of the commercials tempting the wonderous twist to the ending, I purchased this book for a summer read. I had completed it in two sittings. To say the least, I had expected much more from such a well-known author. I found the changing points-of-view to be rather tiresome. As an elementary teacher, I found this book to have less than developed characters, and I was not impressed with the word choice of the writers. To be honest, I have read more developed, creative pieces from my sixth grade students. Overall, I was left disappointed and rather miffed that I had waisted two afternoons reading this book. If you have to spend several hours on a plane or stuck in the airport, it might be worth checking out from the library. I certainly would suggest spending money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Pulp fiction is what it is, a fun, cheap escape. It's cotton candy for the soul and something many of us can use every now and then. Patterson and De Jonge use their craft and deliver a cheaply fun read, then ruin it with the ending. Of all the arbitrary plot twists, this one takes the blue ribbon. Patterson and his co-author devote an entire book to developing the protagonist--Tom Dunleavy. We get to know his character and personality. At the end, the authors turn on a dime, take away every single thing they've told us about Dunleavy and expect the reader to be gleeful, or at least sensationally scandalized, with this \\"brilliant\\" turn events. Even without the disastrous ending the book was mediocre escapism--with it, it's a slap in the face. You have better things to do with your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"SECOND RATE PLOT, AND HO-HUM CHARACTERS","review":"I love Patterson's Alex Cross series, who doesn't, he is a master at the game of psychological suspense. Beach Road did absolutely nothing for me. When an author finds his niche, why does he have to turn a twist and venture off in another direction?In Beach Road the character of Tom Dunleavy just didn't jibe with me. Professional basketball player turned attorney - give me a break. Dante Halleyvale, the young upcoming basketball star is tried for murder and Tom comes to the rescue. Then, throw in Kate Costello, the young attorney whose heart Tom has already broken, but she is back for round two and willing to give the relationship another whirl. The characters were weak, the plot just average.James Patterson has won our hearts with Alex Cross, please stick with what you do best and give us more of him and less of this drivel. No offense, but I have come to learn that every time I see the name Peter de Jonge on the cover, the book will be a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"God-Awful","review":"James Patterson is just signing his name to these books so they will sell. Does he even write anymore?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Puerile","review":"Fess up now, whose high school class wrote it? Beach Road reads like it was written by kids in a hurry for an audience of their peers. The characters are tinfoil thin, the plot is downright ridiculous.I read another Patterson novel right before this one: Along Came a Spider, published in 1993. And while it had many small flaws, that book at least had richly textured characters, plenty of atmosphere, and an interesting plot. So I know Patterson (& Co.) can write. Or could write. It seems downright cynical to crank out an inferior product like Beach Road just because your devoted fans will buy anything with your name on it. But not forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Awful Book","review":"I've never read Patterson before, and I never will again. This book strains both credibility and \\"Unreliable Narrator\\" Device. I wish I had not spent so much time on it; and, now spending more, I will conclude. Don't buy this book--you will see better courtroom drama on \\"Law and Order\\" or in a Grisham book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so well thought out","review":"I was enjoying this book until it got towards the end. Without giving anything away, I felt the ending was sudden and completely unpredictable. While this can be good, looking back, there were no indications that the final resolution might have been a possiblity - it seemed somewhat far-fetched and not very well thought out. I felt that the final resolution was much like the work we tend to do as youngsters ... working hard to do a good job, but then dropping the buck at the end because we are sick and tired of the task. All in all, I was disappointed in the book. I would not recommend this read to any of my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time","review":"I enjoyed most of the book until the plot twist and from there only read it to finish the book, not for enjoyment. It seems to me that Patterson wrote the first 90% of the book without even he himeself knowing how it he would end it, then came up with the most absurd plot twist he could think of, regardless of the fact that characters were inconsistent and information was conflicting. I haven't done this yet and I'm' not sure if I will, but I'll bet if I reread the book I'd find several places where the story doesn't keep. I don't care about his warning about 'characters lying'...people don't lie to themselves in thought. I am totally unfulfilled by this book and unless you feel like rolling your eyes constantly in the last 20 or so pages, do not read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Fluff","review":"Patterson writes great books and commercial fluff--nothing in between. This is not a good effort. I had to force myself to finish it, and the usual plot twists and surprises seemed contrived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falling Off the Cliff","review":"This book sails along fine through the verdict on a murder case about 85% into the book. Then bango, there's a plot twist that is completely implausible. I don't ever remember being so angry at a mangled plot twist like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beach (Dirt) Road","review":"I'm a real fan of the Alex Cross series, but this novel was a huge disappointment on all levels. I will say that it had a pretty good twist, but it was overall such a negative experience that I will probably not buy Patterson any more. On the other hand, if you think all males are redneck, racist, sexist scum, you'll probably breathlessly lap this up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Patterson's better novels","review":"This novel highly disappointed me and I'm a big James Patterson fan. The usual short chapters don't bother me, but this novel was running over with characters...okay...so I don't like too many characters that I have to remember. But I stayed with the book and when it came to the ending, I kept telling myself...NO WAY. But, it ended the way it ended. I purchased this one, but I think maybe I'll get the next Patterson release from the library. I think the two star rating pretty well sums it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope ... not this time","review":"I used to be the first to buy Patterson. But, this \\"team\\" writing just doesn't work for me. Too bad, too. I liked Patterson a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Publishers Weekly - I'm with you!","review":"Maybe we can blame this one on Peter de Jonge - because I didn't like the \\"The Beach House\\", either. I thought the characters were thinly drawn - and I really couldn't get close enough to them to care much about them. And, I felt strongly that the story took place in an entirely wrong setting. It was like staging West Side Story in West Palm Beach.Despite the above, I am a huge James Patterson fan, own all his hardcovers, and salivate when I hear a new one is coming out. Rarely does he let me down. But, this time, I have to agree with Publisher's Weekly - this one was thrown together in time for the \\"beach reading\\" season - and even though there is an \\"aha\\" twist at the end, by the time you get there, you don't really give a darn."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so","review":"Not Patterson's best by a long shot. The character development was seriously lacking, and the identity of the killer was not only a shocker, but a disappointment. You are not really given the tools with which to learn to care about these characters, and all the different voices are a tad confusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story, bad last few chapters","review":"I couldn't but this book down. It kept me reading and I was so eager to read the next page. I liked everythin about it until the end.. Come on...Every thing i loved about the book Didn't make sence after i ready the last chapters. I think they tried to hard for a Shocking endng that the messed the whole thing up."},{"rating":"2","title":"different but good","review":"Beach Road seemed very different to me from other Patterson books. It was told from the point of view of several of the characters. It was a quick read and the ending knocked my socks off!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst Patterson Novels","review":"I am finding a pattern here that whenever Patterson co-writes his books (which he is doing more and more) they come out terrible. I have been such a huge fan of his for years now, but this may be the last Patterson book for me. There is no suspense anymore and I am finding his books and his endings extremely predictable, and utterly unbelievable at that. Where did the old James Patterson go!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's going on?","review":"I side with the one star reviews. The book was obviously written very quickly, very poorly and solely for the bucks. But has anyone noticed that with a lot of the Patterson books that when the negaive reviews start piling up all of a sudden there appears lots of five star reviews with glowing words and when you check to see the other reviews these people have written, there aren't any! The last four reviews on this book are all five stars, sound very similar and all these \\"folks\\" have never written another review. I'll admit that this is my first review, and I'm only posting it because I noticed this weird stuff going on. I mean just a few hours ago the avg. rating for this book was 3, and now it's 4. Coincidence, maybe, maybe not. Check out some of the other books by this guy and you'll see the same pattern. Who knows if it's happening, but if the ratings are being manipulated somehow, it's a pretty dirty trick and doesn't speak very well of whoever's doing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beach Road","review":"After having written what should have been a four star novel, Patterson and De Jonge wrote an ending which ruined the whole book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suspenseful but ultimately unrewarding","review":"I've just finished this book, having started it this morning. As other reviewers have said, it is a holiday read for when you have time for something mindless and gripping. I was entertained by the book and wanted to find out what had happened. Yes, the writing could have been better, but in a book like this I value an interesting storyline over high literature! I did feel invested in the main character, Tom, who is likeable and the best fleshed-out, and also in the plight of Dante, the accused teenager. The twist at the end was startling, but it spoilt the book for me. When I saw it coming I thought that it must be a double bluff, as the resolution of the story unpicks the entire plot and makes the story meaningless. I was disappointed with the way the end of the book played out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beach Road","review":"Never read James Patterson and never plan to again. This would make a good Hollywood B movie but if you're looking for good writing and a good storyline, look elsewhere. If you must read it, borrow it from the library because it's not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Page Turner!","review":"Another example of James Patterson's ability to keep his readers guessing right up until the end!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Shot!","review":"I liked this book all the way through the trial, but the post-trial revelation was, at the very least, ridiculous. It did not come across as a \\"Sixth Sense\\" shocker but a cheap shot out of left field. It was stupid and didn't fit with the story, at all. The author didn't need it and should have tied up the loose ends a different way. I can't even look back on the book and see how it all it. It didn't. Throughout the book, even alone with his own thoughts, Tom didn't reveal his true character. This book was a huge disappointment! I would not recommend that anyone waste their time. In the end, when all is \\"revealed\\" nothing makes sense. No matter how hard you might try - it doesn't fit, at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Aaaaaaaaaand Flop.","review":"I have to say, I was so excited for a new summer Patterson read. I scooped it up, tore into it, loving the feeling of familiar with the style, short chapters, different voices, loving it. There was, however, an unsettling feeling throughout this book, that I hadn't felt before. Come to the end of the book, and I now I know it's my subconcious telling me to RUN DUMMY, RUN. The ending was. . . . just distasteful. The book was better, deserved better that that. So. Here I am, with a book I've been so excited to share with my friends this summer and all I have to say is FLOP. To each their own. I still love the writer but this one seemed rushed, flimsy. Next time you throw us a bone, give us some meat, eh?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"I've got an hour commute to work, so my friend turned me on to audiobooks. This is my first James Patterson and I'm so hooked. Beach Road left me craving for more of Patterson's reads. I've gone through several audiobooks in the past few months. Besides the suspense, what I liked about this audiobook was the different character narrations. Billy Baldwin's narration as Tom Donlevy fits the character personality to a tee, right up to the end, which blew me away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprise Ending went too far","review":"Although Patterson seems thrilled he gave us such a surprise ending, for me his surprise went too far and ruined the book.I enjoyed his book until the last 50 pages after which I threw it in the trash.And I am a Patterson fan who always reads and usually enjoys his books. I will think hard before buying his books again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Logical insult","review":"My wife and I listened to this book on CD during long car drive. When halfway through, we discussed the ending. I thought up the most illogical, stupid ending I could think of and said if the book really ends this way, I will hate it. Yes, my guessed ending was the ending of this book. Very sloppy construction. A total insult to the intelligence of the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Will Never Read Another Patterson After This One!","review":"Please don't even bother with this. The ending is so horrible that you will feel a huge disappointment that you read the thing! Makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.

I am usually a fan of both Patterson and the twist ending. I'm so glad I borrowed the book from a friend rather than paying for a hard cover or even a paperback. I am terribly disappointed in James Patterson."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was awful","review":"I had a freshman English professor many years ago. I wrote what I thought was a good short story.

So do I."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unremitting schlock","review":"Don't usually read these kinds of books but gave it a whirl since they had a new CD copy at my library.

That said, I listened to the whole thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst writing EVER!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Perhaps my one star is not fair because all I could get through were the first two chapters Amazon provided of this disgrace. I can tell you this though, the writing is TERRIBLE. It's time for James and his gang of ghostwriters to either write something that has a hint of quality or give up and go away. Seriously, the descriptions, scenes and dialogue are elementary. I understand JP isn't literature, but it doesn't have to be this bad. Wake up, people.

He misleads the reader in the beginning of the book such that the \\"twist\\" at the end is not a twist but completely unbelievable and a farce. Essentially, he lies to the reader--giving one storyline built on a set of facts and then a conclusion that flies in the face of that storyline. I agree with the reviewer that said that introducing aliens would have made more sense-- it would have also been more honest with the reader. While many other reviewers have said what needs to be said about this book -- that it did not make sense, desire to throw it in the trash, etc... -- I disliked it so much that I needed to weigh in because I feel so cheated for having read it. I don't mind reading a book I don't like or I find bad every so often, but the dishonesty in the book is what really got me.

Quite simply it was stupid. Absolutely unconnected with anything in the book which preceded it. Turned an already weak book into a horrible one. Fourth, I picked this book up at a thrift store for 25 cents. I overpaid. Lastly, if this book is indicative of his other books how does this guy continue to get published?

Unfortunately the way it was \\"tied up\\" was so lame I'll never waste my time on another of his books.I don't expect literary value from a read like this - I just thoroughly enjoy the escape.

I was looking forward to the amazing and shocking twist at the end of the book, but found it utterly ridiculous and it spoiled the entire book for me.James, or rather Peter, didn't take the time to ensure that the pieces of this puzzle were linked or at least made sense. I suspect that if they had, they would have realized some crucial missing elements and general logic gaps. I have never written any sort of review before - but feel that I should warn other readers not to waste their time, or money. I often pass my books and/or recommendations on to my friends - but passing this one on would be an insult to them.Either James should not be sharing his co-authorship with Peter any longer, he should start proofing and approving things with his name on them, or he should stop writing altogether as his reputation is at risk.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beach Bust","review":"Like many other Patterson readers, \\"Along Came a Spider\\" and \\"Kiss the Girls\\" are among my favorite detective/crime novels. However, \\"Beach Road\\" falls far short of expectations.You can always expect a twist at the end with Patterson novels, and \\"Beach Road\\" is no exception. Perhaps he's exhausted his creative talents, but the twist in this novel is completely expected, and the 300+ pages that come before make the \\"surprise\\" hardly worth it.Among other flaws, the dialogue in \\"Beach Road\\" is just painful. Nearly every spoken interaction in the novel had me squirming in awkwardness. Patterson may be a good story teller, but he fails miserably when it comes to interaction between characters.While not a complete waste, I most definitely would not recommend \\"Beach Road.\\" Instead, read some of Patterson's earlier work, or read other detective/crime novels by authors such as Jeffery Deaver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfying Ending","review":"I have read many of James Patterson's books and have liked most of them except for the extremely short chapters. This one kept me entertained most of the way through but I absolutely hated the ending. I found it completely unbelievable and unsatisfying to the point that I wish I hadn't read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have read many of James Patterson's books and have never been disappointed. This book however, was a big let down. I almost didn't finish reading the first few chapters because I had difficulty following it, they were choppy and confusing. After the shaky beginning, it was much better and I found myself enjoying the storyline until the end. The end was 'stupid' for lack of a better word. Twist, yes, it was a twist, but in a direction that made NO sense. WHY?? I thought he would give some insight into the purpose of the ending, but he didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget Patterson","review":"How could anyone say anything good about this book.Only because he has made so much money for the book sellers was this book out in print. the charcters are idiots. The plot does not go anywhere, and defies all logic.The ending is to say the least the worst I,ve ever read. I read a lot of his books and put up with his poor writing because he has such good villians.But put me on hold for a long time unless he does better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun, But a Cheap Ending","review":"The book starts out well, it's a little fluffy(But it's a beach book, so that's okay) but it's fast paced with likable characters. The end is just Wrong! Several times Agatha Christie pulled a real shocker of an ending, but she always played fair and left plenty of clues. This book didn't do that. The ending feels as if it were just tacked on in an effort to shock us, and it comes completely out of the blue. Very unfair. The character of Macklin is also rather puzzling . Even the last page feels rushed. A fun book ruined by a cheap ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great...","review":"Beach Road by James Patterson is a typical thriller/mystery novel. Tom Dunleavy is an East Hampton local and a former NBA star turned unmotivated, mediocre lawyer. When three savage murders occur in East Hampton, Dante Haleyville, a local black teen is charged with the crimes. Tom agrees to take Dante's case, investigates it and tries it, with the help of top Manhatten lawyer, Kate Costello.This book was a very quick read - I read it in one day in between concerts. It's a typical Patterson thriller - short chapters, told from many different perspectives. It's pretty shallow, albeit in an entertaining way. The ploys and twists used by Mr. Patterson were nothing new for him or for other authors, and it was somewhat predictable. It's a beach read and nothing that will challenge how you think about yourself, the world or anything in it. I would stick to the Alex Cross series if I were picking up a Patterson novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"drivel","review":"Why did they waste paper for this novel...though there must be better term for these substandard outpourings....\\"spiritless life-sapped\\" paint by the numbers plot outlines?\\"It's like a poor version of verbal hip-hop...you just keep moving fast..and changing the scene...what is the point? There's no heart...no engagement....cardboard characters...sophomoric over-the-top histronics. This should be labelled pablum for the grammar school set or mentally challenged adults.Patterson should go back to his old day job...but why should he when this \\"hip-hop\\" verbiage is making him rich?He's like an older version of \\"Paris Hilton\\"...garish, over-the-top\\" childlike, all flash, no substance...but at least she has an excuse..at his age, Patterson should know better....And who wrote the rave reviews...his \\"buds\\"?? Patterson wonders why books are a distant third or fourth in the entertainment hierarchy....Look no further."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie Maker","review":"Hollywood needs to take this one and make it into a movie. This was my first James Patterson novel and now I must read all his novels. Narrated from each characters viewpoint made it hard to follow at first. Incredible suspense and hard to put down. Details of the Hamptoms and surrounding areas very visually correct. Get to the end quick because that is the best part of the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written by Committee","review":"Patterson coauthored this book with Peter DeJonge. I was really disappointed. It is evident that two people wrote it. The ending is a complete disconnect from the rest of the book. It is supposed to be a surprise ending, but it looks like one person started the novel and another finished it. It isn't worth the hardcover price."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"A lot of name dropping. The characters lacked development. We listened to it in the car on a long western trip and it passed the time but was hardly remarkable.Tom the main character is a obvious sociopath but dual idenities are shaky to say the least.

That is why I give this book 5 stars/"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a bad read, ruined by an awful ending.","review":"After reading a James Patterson book several years ago, I swore I'd never buy another one of his books. I picked this one up at the airport and didn't realize who wrote it until I was on the airplane. I was thoroughly enjoying the book until the ending. I love plot twists, but they need to make at least a little sense. The ending to Beach Road didn't fit with anything that came before it and it was truly unbelievable. I will NEVER buy another James Patterson book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one","review":"This was my first -- and last -- James Patterson read. The characters are flat and predictible; the women are especially stereotypical. (Gorgeous, highly sexed, blah blah blah.) The pace zips along, which I suspect is what makes him popular, but the story is poorly plotted and the improbable \\"surprise twist\\" feels like an afterthought. In the end, the story doesn't hold together. Disappointing on every level."},{"rating":"1","title":"All over the place","review":"Although I see nothing wrong with trying a different narrative approach, using a first-person perspective that jumps from character to character makes confusion inevitable. Even if you are paying attention, you will, at some point, think a different character is narrating during the numerous chapters.I also thought the ending made the rest of the novel make very little sense. I would also suggest that if an author is writing about lawyers and court cases, that he have a lawyer read through and edit the book. There were several parts that were just silly in regards to the legal aspects of the novel. Maybe I am spoiled by reading John Grisham novels, but an author should do a little research.Overall, the book jumped all over the place, the first-person style led to occasional confusion, and the ending was ridiculous, and made the rest of the story make little sense, without explaining away the inconsistencies. Obviously, I didn't care for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I've enjoyed this book much more than I thought I would. The story is quite good so far. The writter seems to know just what to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio Book - Too pretentious for listening","review":"I do a lot of driving and I enjoy listening to audio books. I could barely listen to two disks of this book. The strange voice providing the chapter number, title and silly music destroyed the book for me. I neither know, nor care, how the rest of the book progresses."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"I have to admit that I didn't finish this book. I needed a couple of books for a long car ride and picked this. Having read Patterson before it seemed like a good choice. If I had read the Amazon reviews prior to purchase, it would have been a more enjoyable trip. Don't waste your money or time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply awful....","review":"I purchased this book a while ago and for some reason, never read it. My Kindle seems to be on the fritz, so I've been scrounging around for some reading material. I picked this up and wondered why I never pursued it when I bought it. I guess I read the jacket and wasn't impressed or just had too many other books I wanted to read first.At any rate, it was simply awful. The \\"twist\\" was so bad - and the whole concept of the novel just SO poor, SO unremarkably predictable - it was hard to get through. I was bound and determined to read it though, and I did. I hated the short chapters, the writing style and the whole name-dropping, \\"star studded\\", pretentious dialogue.Do yourself a favor and take a pass on this - I'm sending my copy off to the Goodwill. No more of these for me. There are FAR, FAR better writers out there and publishers just keep churning out this drivel and taking away from a writer who DESERVES to have works published!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money/time","review":"I am sorry to report this is the last Patterson I will buy. This book tries an unusual technique of telling the story in a series of first person chapters. I find it annoying and disruptive to the narrative. I felt grossly manipulated at the wrap up at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beach Road","review":"I was so unhappy with the ending that I threw this book in the trash and I am a person who recycles everything. I felt betrayed, disappointed, and found the story implausible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good!","review":"I had to get used to this Patterson way of writing.

I'm not normally a fan of light \\"beach\\" books, but I had seen the book at the library and thought I'd give him a try.

Don't waste your time!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beach Road","review":"Book arrived as promised, great condition, good price, will definetly shop for books like this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Disappointment","review":"Not up to Patterson's standard. Lots of holes and i could find nothing in the story to support the ending. D-"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is James Patterson lending his name to somebody else?","review":"I can't think about any other explanation for this silly, stupid thriller if you want to call it that. I can't believe that the writer is doing so badly. I am most certainly disappointed with this book. In the last couple of years, I think he had lost his steam. Plus, why does he have to come up with 15 books or so a year? Why does he not read his own book before he sends it to the publisher? It's time for me to move on to another writer....I would advice readers to not to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written; poorly read fromat.","review":"Books should draw your attention; pulling you in from the world, into the fiction generated by the author.This book doesn't do that at all. You have to concentrate like you did in Western Civ. class. From the abundance of 'page filling prose' so the book will be longer than 10 pages, to the many readers assigned to read this book. It's just BAD!!I like a man and a women reading so they can gender-specific the read. This book has like 5 readers and yet a woman reads a man's character. Why? It seems more like a reader relay going on.I have read Patterson and liked him, but he must only be placing his name on this book, or he has lost his touch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clearly, putting \\"James Patterson\\" on the cover DOESN'T mean he wrote it!","review":"I used to run out and buy each new James Patterson novel within the first week of publication, but that was back in the days when he actually wrote the books, not just allowed his name to be splashed on the cover! Anyone who has read Patterson over the years can clearly tell who actually writes these \\"co-authored\\" books, and Beach Road is no exception.This \\"book\\" is little more than a short story, with large print, wide margins and 1-2 page chapters! I no longer spend my money on Patterson's books, but rather borrow them from the local library. It is sad to see a gifted writer sell out for profits, and I could not recommend purchasing this book, but for those of us who MUST read the latest Patterson and Co. books, I say borrow, don't buy! A guilt-free solution to a quickly read, average quality book..."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I have been a little disappointed in Patterson's latest books, but this was better. It did start to drag a little toward the end (before the dramatic twist) but that may be because I read it in two sittings and I was getting tired.I would suggest this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst ending ever","review":"The ending is the worst I've ever experienced. Don't worry, I'm not going to spoil the ending for you if you still decided to read this book.The ending is totally implausible for many, many reasons. I mean, it's ridiculous to the point of being a satire of a mystery. I just couldn't believe James Patterson allowed this to be published.The rest of the book is obviously hastily thrown together and definitely not up to Patterson's previous standards.My first thought when I finished \\"Beach Road\\" was, \\"I want my money back.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Beach Road","review":"This is absolutely one of the worst \\"beach reads\\" I have ever read. His characters are pseudo-Nelson DeMille (DeMille wins). His twisted ending would have been fine if it had been part of \\"Atonement,\\" where it worked so brilliantly. But this is a pathetic, name-dropping, inside-joke-attempt to a clever read that fails. A rush to a surrealistic ending that would have never even made the first draft of a Hitchock screenplay. I pity all the people that took this book on their vacation. My recommendation, skip this entirely and go to anything Nelson DeMille has ever written. Start with \\"Gold Coast.\\" A truly superior look at the real and beyond the normauthentic Beach Road of the Hamptons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally and completely STUPID!!!!!","review":"Even before I got to the ending I didn't think the story made any sense. Way too many gaping holes in logic and believable behavior. Then I finished it and nearly threw it in the fireplace. HOW STUPID! It would have been more believable if aliens had been introduced at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pull-ease","review":"I'm with the reviewers who thought this book was ruined by the ending. I'm all for twists, but this was completely ridiculous and incongruous and dumb.The book tells the tale of Hamptons small-time lawyer Tom, who had a brief career as a professional ball player. Apparently sometime in his youth, he dumped the woman he truly loved, Kate, who became a hard career lawyer in NYC. We know she's hard because she smokes, and has no friends, but in the end, they band together and find true love while defending a young black ball player from a multiple murder death-penalty charge.It's twisting and turning and super derivative, but mostly it's satisfying. Until the last few chapters, when the writers throw in a major monkey wrench that turns the books into a joke.I felt as if the entire reading experience was false, and a waste of time. Badly done. Cheap.Patterson's books may not be the best, but they ususally don't make you feel this cheated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reader: You've been Punk'd!","review":"This book has a shocking, last minute twist a la Sixth Sense. The surprise in the movie, Sixth Sense, however, works. Your view of the story is suddenly turned on its head and you're left wanting to go back to look for the clues that you missed before. In the case of this book, the twist was completely unbelievable and even felt a bit obscene. To make it every more frustrating, I thought the book was actually a good read, and I kept reading thinking the mystery's solution would be revealed and the intriguing questions would somehow be tied up. Instead, the ending left me rolling my eyes and feeling duped rather than entertained. This Beach Road leads to nowhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"OUCH","review":"I have been a James Patterson fan for years, however this book was a huge disappointment. Soap operas are more convincing and realistic than this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst ending I ever read","review":"I was actually enjoying this book until the ending.

This is it for Patterson. All new characters without the depth i have come to expect. I would have trashed it by page 50 were it any other author.

In this easy to follow book she gives real life examples of situations that would have turned ugly if not for her advice such as, giving the benefit of the doubt, seeing things through their eyes, looking for good intentions and much more than that.Everything that happens to us good and bad is a lesson learned; these are the teachers.

And it is so much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inner Strength without Resistance","review":"In \\"Unlikely Teachers,\\" Judy Ringer guides us from inner resistance to inner acceptance. Judy's open hearted anecdotes and gentle words of guidance bring the reader from everyday instances of personal and circumstantial conflict to the possibility of connection and personal discovery. What makes \\"Unlikely Teachers\\" such a 'likely teacher' is that on top of the contemplative wisdoms it is a veritable \\"how to\\" book. Aided by specific and detailed practices, Judy discusses the specifics of becoming aware of and disengaging from conflict, how to redirect our thinking and behavior, and especially how to begin to allow ourselves true empowerment, an inner strength without resistance."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Absolute Best!","review":"Mandy Moore's soulful voice graces this excellent CD. It's a whole new side to Mandy that shows how much she has matured in the past few months. The best song on the album is the \\"So Real\\" remix.

This is definitely a must buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but no cigar","review":"Mandy is a cute girl, but that doesn't make this CD good. Just because she is young doesn't make it OK to have a bad voice. Sorry, but it is true. After listening to this CD, she really needs to stop acting so much like Britney.

Get Christina Aguilera's CD instead, its so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"She doesn't even compare to Britney","review":"Mandy sure shows her lack of talent here.

However, that is enough to tell that Mandy does not sing \\"bubblegum pop\\"...at least not anymore! \\"I Wanna Be With You\\" is a beautiful soft song, complete with soulful lyrics and a lovely voice to go with them. This ballad was the perfect theme song for the ballet movie, \\"Center Stage.\\" Though I haven't yet seen the film, I have viewed Mandy's \\"I Wanna Be With You\\" video, and it is simply stunning.

So Real, Lock Me In your Heart, Walk me home, I like It, Candy-they are all the same exact recordings as on the first album. Then she puts a remix of Candy on here too. It's my fault; I bought the cd without even looking at the songs on the back. If, however, you don't have her first one, I recommend this cd because it has about half of the ones on So Real."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Like It...","review":"Of all the teen starlets currently flooding our airwaves I am most fond of Moore (along with Billie from the UK), for being a regular 'teen.' I admit when I first heard 'Candy' I was like, \\"oh god!\\" But then I saw her perform \\"I Wanna Be With You\\" I was really taken aback. So I bought the album out of utter curiosity. What can I say? Pure ear candy.Though it's obviously not the most awe inspiring release of 2000, I can't stop listening to it. Catchy pop gems like \\"Everything My Heart Desires\\" and the remix of \\"So Real\\" are addictive. But nothing beats \\"I Like It.\\" By far the best track on the album. A great retro groove, backed with great vocals...I LIKE IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good CD at all!","review":"Let me put it bluntly- this girl can't sing!

Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"she's soo really ok","review":"mandy moore is just another teen queen pop singer. i don't like her voice. it sounds like a 12 year old star search contestant. i like her songs even less. i hate britney, but i have to admit, britney's songs are better. mandy, maybe you should get better song writers, i think it would make you sound better. but i do like the 4 new songs better. they are actually the only songs of hers that i like. candy is a good song. one of the few. i really don't like the remixes, or for that matter the whole cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money...","review":"The only song worth owning off of this cd that is not on Mandy Moore's mediocre debut album is the title track, which is a great song. However, besides \\"Walk Me Home\\", no track on this album is worth listening to at all. The remixes aren't all that good, the new tracks are week, and all in all this album is a wasted purchase. The best part of the album is the videos, which are nice. Other than that, buy her debut album, download the mp3 for \\"I Wanna Be With You\\", and get her good third album..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very lackluster and clumsily put together","review":"I like a few of these songs on her album, but only a few. IWBWY is sweet, but doesn't stand out as being a memorable tune (unlike Oops I did it again). Mandy may have a few fans, but the fact remains that she has no staying power and is already fading from the pop scene. This album is an attempt to save her, but it fails miserably. She doesn't have the talent, style, dance moves or charm of Britney Spears, nor the voice of Christina or Jessica. Sorry Mandy but you have nothing new to offer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Her Number 1 album","review":"I like it! Her vocals are smoother than Brittany and Jessica. It is very upbeat and great for a party of simply nice to relax to. The background music is exceptional..the remixes are done very well and the \\"I wanna be with you, Soul Solution Remix\\" is my favorite for its trancelike riffs and great vocals. This remix was worth the price of the whole CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I admit, I'm mostly a country music fan, but I've recently gotten into the new pop music, and this CD was recommended to me by a friend. I haven't heard Mandy's entire first CD yet, but this CD is really good. I love \\"Everything My Heart Desires,\\" \\"So Real,\\" \\"Candy (Wade Robson Remix)\\" and \\"Your Face.\\" In my opinion, I think the Candy remix on this CD is better than the original track on her previous CD.I'm very selective about my non-country music choices, but this CD is great and I will be purchasing Mandy's debut CD very soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why listen to Britney when you can listen to Mandy","review":"This CD was so nicely put together. Mandy has a really great voice. She's 16 and she sings like she is, unlike Britney who tries to sound 6 years old when she sings. There are such beautiful ballads on this Cd (I want to be with you, Your Face) and it has so many songs someone our age can relate to (Wanna be with you). If people don't like this CD then they obvious are just trying to give her a bad name. It's really awesome and I think everyone should buy a copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIPPED OFF by Sony Music","review":"anyone thinking that they are getting the full remixes of 'candy (wade roberson remix)' and 'i wanna be with you (soul solution remix)' will surely be disappointed with the 3:00 and 4:00 edited versions. c'mon 550music, epic and sony... how can you be more misleading to your buyers? if you're going to put the EDITED remixes on the album you should say \\"EDIT\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"Suprisingly, this cd is really good for pop. I think the best song on the cd is 'your face' it's just unlike any of the other songs. It's very beautiful and passionate. Mandy Moore really does have some talent, and she doesn't get enough credit. If you're in a pop mood, BUY THIS CD! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"more teen-pop garbage for tin ears","review":"Mandy Moore is beyond doubt the most irritating presence on MTV these days. She hosts a program where she sits around with a bunch of dumbs giggling girls and introduces videos. Her witless banter is enough to make me want to throw something at the TV.Any critical evaluation of her 'music' would be a waste of time. I mean, who really cares? Her audience consists of young girls whose other favorite 'artists' are Britney, Jessica Simpson, Christina Aguilera, et al. The only other significant group of people who like her are older men that feel Britney has gotten 'too old' and need to fantasize about someone that could still put them in jail."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY?","review":"Give me a break already...What is she trying to prove...Her voice well you can tell she is 15 or 16..Young anyway..Not a mature voice, too needy...Trying too hard...The song has faded already so why the new cd... with a repeat of songs from her first album...Money hungry? Didn't she just come out? Stop trying so hard, Mandy! Stop pulling a Britney, if you want to get out of her shadow get out of the business..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice CD to listen to, even if some of the stuff is old.","review":"I wish that this whole CD was new songs, but the ones that are new are good enough to make up for the old ones. My favorite tracks were 1 (I Wanna Be With You, 2 (Everything My Heart Desires), and 4 (The Way to My Heart). The CD is worth buying just for the new songs, even if you have Mandy's first CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good first album.","review":"I bought this cd because i LOVE 'Candy', and i have to say this is very good for a first album. I love the songs, 'Way to my heart',, 'So real' and 'What you want'. I'm not sure about 'Everything my heart desires', this is a cover song by a British artist which erm, failed to light up the charts. It's better than the original but is sung quite weakly.Apart from that this is a brilliant cd, recommended for any pop fan. The love songs are actually good (Oh my God!) Which is pretty rare for teenage girls (i name no names).Even if candy isn't exactly your favourite song of all time give this album a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is very good...","review":"I like this CD a lot, but it gets old pretty fast and most of the songs are just Britney Spears imitations. For me, that's a good thing. I like the chorus of \\"I Wanna Be With You\\" but the rest of the song is a little... blah! I like \\"Want you back\\" but it's certainly not a new song, not even a novel idea at the time. All the remixes are cool. Especially \\"Candy\\" \\"I Wanna Be With You\\" sounds much better mixed and \\"So Real\\" gets a whole new meaning to this beat. By far, MUCH better than the first album, \\"So Real.\\" Good job, Mandy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Promising","review":"Although Mandy Moore's voice still lacks the depth and volume compared to her contemporaries, her efforts are slowly being noticed. \\"I Wanna Be With You\\" is getting much attention and airplay here. I think people are noticing that she chooses her songs carefully. Her climb to popularity is slow but sure, and it is indeed better than all-out hard-sell promotions. One other song that's getting a lot of requests over the radio is \\"Walk Me Home\\".Good work, Mandy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awsome!","review":"this cd is totally awsome! I love how you can watch walk me home and candy videos. I love the song I wanna be with you buy the cd now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gimme a break","review":"I really don't like this album. All of a sudden Mandy comes out with a (quote-unquote) Special Edition album. No. If they'de just taken a minute to find some new GOOD songs, maybe my rating would be higher. All of a sudden they thought they should give Mandy a single that's not even on her first album and launch a CD around it. It doesn't work that way. This album only contains that single and a bunch of other trash put together to support it. Mandy, stop worrying about being as popular and sell as many records as Britney! Be your own artist and personality, and you might do better than this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uggggh!","review":"I really disliked this. They are trying to show off Mandy's talent in all the ballads, but she actually has none. The ballads are boring and sappy. Everything else is a little better, but too sugar-coated and corny. Mandy is not half as good as her peers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for Britney's album","review":"Britneys sophomore album is gunna rock based on what I've heard. There aren't as many ballads and every song so far sounds like a potential single. Mandy, on the other hand, has a reeeeeeeaaaaaaalllly bad sophomore album. The ballads are corny and she sounds awful, like she is singing through her nose. Worse than her forst, definitely. So I would save your money for Britney, she is what girl pop is all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"A companion to SO REAL. Mandy's EP/2nd album.","review":"It was only about 9 months after the release of SO REAL when Mandy Moore released I WANNA BE WITH YOU. I wasn't sure if that was the right move. Then I found out that it wasn't really an album, but more of a companion to her debut SO REAL. On I WANNA BE WITH YOU Mandy's voice and singing style improved a lot. This album features 5 new tracks, 6 tracks from SO REAL, and some remixes. The new songs are awesome. It shows Mandy moving into a more pop/rock sound. The remixes of \\"so real\\", \\"candy\\", and \\"I wanna be with you\\" are OK. I WANNA BE WITH YOU is worth getting just for the new tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"Mandy's not bad!But in the video \\"Candy\\" she tries to sing like Britney Spears.In the video \\"I Wanna Be With You\\" she acts like she's out of breath,and it is kind of annoying.But her look is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"perhaps a better attempt this time","review":"Sold, failed, pulled back, repackaged and back on the shelves again. This is Mandy Moore. \\"Another one of those people-we-love-to-hate\\". Despite failing the first time, this child does not give up hope and decides to try on the ballad departments. She showscases nice ballads, though her weak vocals cannot carry much on the emotion and the dexterity needed to convey the message. Many will be left smitten with the breeziness of \\"I Wanna Be With You\\" though even on her strongest song, her vocals quiver to reach her notes. I really don't know if it's safe to say whether this repackaged album will do anything to help Moore improve her standings. But if you see her, tell her she'll improve all standings if she takes proper vocal lessons first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect!","review":"This album is surprisingly good, despite lack of originality, and a few mediocre cuts, ('I like it' springs to mind). The album shares a blend of typical teenpop ('Candy' and 'So real' which easily could have been mistaken for a Backstreet boys choon), with some classy, mature moments thrown in 'Lock me in your heart', 'The way to my heart' and 'Walk me home'. It kind of feels like Britney, Christina and Jessica thrown into one. I strongly suggest this to any pop fan although have the control ready to skip over the yawnsome, ucky, luvvy duvvy 'Want you back' and 'Your face' which never fails to bring a 'DISGUSTED' reaction whenever i hear the amount of corny cheese dripping from it! This is no overreaction. Basically, don't hesitate to buy it as long as you follow the above instructions."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love mandy","review":"This is a wonderful cd. It is 30000 times better than her first one, and i loved So Real! If you're not sure on her, I just want to say she is realllllllly nice. She was at our mall signing autographs and she was very grateful for all the fans. Her bubbling personality reflects off her poppy music. Great job Mandy, you are the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"She's awesome!!!!!","review":"I got this cd for my birthday and was pleasantly surprised! I didn't really like her first debut album,but this is much better. I really love the song \\"I Wanna Be With You\\". The soul solution remix is great too. 1.I wanna be with you~awesome track. my second most favorite on the cd. 2.everything my heart desires~my favorite track on this disc!! 3.want you back~another favorite 4.the way to my heart~it's okay 5.so real~really cool!!! 6.lock me on your heart~another favorite 7.walk me home~kinda slow and long,but it's a good love song 8.i like it~a good track 9.so real~cool 10.candy remix~another favorite 11.your face~awesome ballad!!!!! 12.i wanna be with you remix~it's cool!

I really think that the only fans Mandy has are below theage of 8. At least Britney has some fans who know what real music is. Mandy's cd is a cheap rip-off of Brit. She sounds awful on the love songs, and all the new songs are bad. Mandy is really trying to rip us off with this cd cause it only has one new song that is worth it. Her old stuff is pretty bad too. Sorry Mandy, but don't quit your day job!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Installation disk not compatible with computer","review":"I am disappointed because the installation disk would not work with my HP7-1234 computer.

It has the most incredible passionate music with wild funky sultry rhythms. Lots of 9/8s and some 7/8s. Mind blowing violin playing, clarinet and drum. Words can not express how wonderful this is..buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a final sequel that shouldn't have been made","review":"After the disappointment of Police Academy 5 and the improvement of Police Academy 6, you would think this final sequel would have been a nice finish to the series. Wrong! Police Academy: Mission to Moscow is the worst of the films. It even makes Police Academy 5 look somewhat good. Most of the actors from the previous Police Academy movies have left the series by now and with good reason. The plot is no good and not even Captain Harris (G.W. Bailey) could have saved the loss of humor in this movie. If you are a person who has never seen any of the Police Academy sequels or have not gotten past #4, do yourself a favor by skipping #5, watch #6, and avoid this final sequel at all cost! To sum up this review, only watch Police Academy 1,2,3,4, and 6."},{"rating":"1","title":"The perfect anti-comedy","review":"Police Academy started to lose steam after Their First Assignment. The third was decent but still passable but the next three were weak. Mission To Moscow hands down is the worst of the series.The plot is stupid beyond belief. It details the Police Academy going to Moscow to stop some Russian mobster(played by Ron Perlman) from taking over the world with a video game that consists of some bear running around punching people.Yeah, that is the movie in a nutshell. Half if the original cast is gone and the ones who are still here look bored to death. The jokes and gags fall flat and for a Police Academy this one is pretty boring. This installment makes City Under Siege look like a comedic masterpiece. Even if you like the Police Academy series skip this turd. Showgirls is funnier than this nightmare. YES, its THAT bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck happened!","review":"The 6th one was better than this. Read the other review it says the same thing I want to say.

The one sin I haven't heard enumerated yet by other disappointed reviewers is that PT Anderson demonstrated so little storytelling ability! Two main complaints: first, the dialogue was on the nose. Every character yelled about how awful their lives were and how much they hated each other. Second, Anderson repeated characters and scenes so literally that they weren't thematic, they were redundant. Two old men dying of cancer who lament the fact they cheated on their wives? The repetition diluted the impact that either scene would have had on its own. The only saving grace of the film was Aimee Mann's aural presence. Spare yourself three hours of film agony and go buy her latest album instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"bleh!","review":"a quaint, but irritatingly sterile character study, this has to be the most overproduced, useless, plotless poop since american beauty. think of a really, really long soap opera with two-dimensional characters and predictable, melodramatic \\"twists\\". over two hours of film with about 13 minutes of content. the star is for the score."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magnolia","review":"This movie sucked worse than an old Hoover vacuum cleaner. My God, what did the director think he was doing?Now, I know there are a lot of pseudo-intellects out there who see something deep and apocolyptic in this film. To them I say get off the drugs and try reality. This stream of unconsciousnes crap is the worst of a very poor year in the movie industry. The notion that Cruise was nominated for this is ludicrous.The great climax has power only in its ability to turn ones's stomach. That the director took three hours to tell this tale shows how sadistic a person he must be. Half the people in the theater left when I saw it originally. Trying it a seond time with two carbon enhancement, didn't help either."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage.","review":"this movie was garbage. it was boring, too long, unintelligent, pretentious, and had lots and lots of needless swearing and tantrums. there was no subtlety, no real depth or intelligence to this film, and best of all there was a cast sing-along. the plot - what plot? oh yes it was a film about coincidence and redemption that takes place all in one day in the san fernando valley. uh huh. overall, it was a miserable moviegoing experience, which means it should find wide appeal with wannabes, film critics, sensitive people, whacked-out film students, psuedo-intellectuals, emotionally unstable people, and holdovers from last decade's coffeehouse scene. in which case, enjoy, you have found your pied piping prophet"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Movie to Open Your Wrists By","review":"From Aimee Mann screeching through a unending, fingernails-on-a-chalkboard rendition of \\"One is the Loneliest Number\\" which drowns out all of the dialogue at the beginning of the movie to the unconventional ending which frankly was way too little, way too late (most well-adjusted viewers would have called the suicide hotline by the end of the second hour), we're presented with nothing but miserable people doing miserable things to make their miserable lives even more miserable.Appealing only to sheltered college student/art types who love to revel in misery and constant over-the-top profanity.

Now, I use Magnolia as my rating for the worst film ever made....After an hour into the film, I wanted to leave but was certain that it had to get better. After two hours, I felt I had vested too much time in it to leave.

Reilly, Julianne Moore, Tom Cruise, William H. Macy, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Jason Robards and more....) that do their best to get this contrived story of random lives coming together for a strange, artificial climax. It is a movie that only certain people will enjoy. It was unbelievable overall, and the plots contrived to fit the ending. The movie has both comedy and poignant scenes as the vignettes strive to gain your interest. The lives of several people in the San Fernando Valley hit a wall together and we watch the unbelievable blow up before our eyes-including frogs falling from the skies.Overall, it is hard to follow and the outrageous plots tire one's imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Of The Worst Movies Ever/ Fans of This Should Be Ashamed","review":"Really! This movie has impact and impressive enough acting, but is it really worth praising with SO MANY MISTAKES?

I say PHOOEY TO YOU! Even though I liked particular actors in the picture and was able to at least sit in the theater for three hours waiting for a conclusion to the various plots, the \\"reptile storm\\" was both unnecessary and poorly executed, propelling this movie from a bad film to a truly despicable one.

The movie itself is good and enjoyable to watch. You start to become very interested in the people's stories and just want to see more, hoping it won't end, although the movie is long. The thing is that you might not be too into watching it over again too soon, because it is long and carries a lot of dialogue. The extras are great though and are worth the purchase alone. The extra with Tom Cruise's character is just so funny, you will want to show everyone it. You have never seen Tom this way, it is great, I have watched that extra over and over.

WHAT'S UP WITH THE FROGS?","review":"I loved reading the reviews on this one. Some really loved it, others really hated it. Some in between, too. I would not call it great, but I really did like it. It's hard to believe it was over 3 hours long. I thought EVERY actor was VERY GOOD, VERY GOOD. And I was never bored. I do think it was kinda' strange. I would only recommend this one selectively. The word PRETENTIOUS came up often in the negative reviews. I do not agree with that. Different yes, pretentious no. Not for everyone on a number of levels. Die Hard it's not.It is difficult for me to understand how anyone could find Tom Cruise' performance anything other than stellar. I really liked John C Reilly in this, and I normally don't. Macy was fabulous and so was Moore. Robards was really good and so was Hoffman. A really great cast, and EVERYONE was at the top of their acting game.

Try getting your own sense of style and DIRECTION."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love it or hate it = rent it before you buy it","review":"You will either love it or hate it.

Please rent before you buy and you decide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remember \\"Short Cuts\\"?","review":"I think I already saw this film in the early 90's. It was called \\"Short Cuts\\". Altman directed it. I guess no one remembers because you never hear anyone coming out and stating the obvious... \\"Magnolia\\" is a stone rip-off. How clever can it be? It's got the same style w/ the interesecting storylines, LA county setting, and \\"riveting\\" ending. They even swiped one of the lead actresses! Give me a break. See \\"Short Cuts\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnolia - One of the Greatest Movies Ever!","review":"\\"Magnolia\\" was a great movie for many many reasons. The intricate plot, with amazing character work...and even though the movie is three hours long, it really moves along nicely. Tom Cruise is absolutely spectacular...his finest roll EVER. Playing the larger than life motivational speaker that can \\"Tame\\" everyone and everything in his path...to breaking down at the bedside of his dying father. All of the intricate plot lines and character analysis is what makes the movie an amazing joy to watch. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! You really are missing out on something if you miss the movie...it can really change the way you view life."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was the Point?","review":"I consider myself open minded, well read, and not afraid of movies and books out of the main stream. But Magnolia was one movie that left me wondering...\\"what was that?\\" The movie began with \\"urban legend\\" anecdotes to show how life defies the odds and even the impossible can happen. Is it fate? Or is it just the way life is? This is a movie of characters facing great challenges in their life and how each individual challenge is linked together. The acting is terrific, the use of music superb, and the view of life as a depressing weather forecast is clever. But the \\"patchwork\\" unravels and the personal lives of the characters aren't tied together as strong as they could be. This is not a film with an occasional downpour of emotion. It's Noah's deluge! And in the end when we look for the sun breaking through the clouds and a dove returning with a flowering twig, the rain continues to fall. Life continues and I guess we need to wait for the sequel to see what happens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a weird movie","review":"This movie is a movie that makes you think, and makes you think yourself into nowhere. It's like deciphering old Egyptian code to find out it has some lame message. The performances are really good, but it doesn't matter because the movie is to nuts and takes you out. I really think P.T. Anderson was trying to create something brilliant and almost did, but didn't and there for it really sucks. The best part of this movie is the song by Aimee Mann called \\"Save Me\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Film","review":"A fantastic film, from a fantastic film maker.

I watched the whole thing hoping that it would get better and also hoping that it would somehow make sense in the end. I guess it was not supposed to make sense ... it was just supposed to show you how people's lives interconnect. There are a some good things about this movie though! Such as the music, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Melora Walters' BIG and beautiful smile at the end. My heart went out to Stanley the Whiz Kid and I cried for him. Great acting by Blackman, Hoffman and Walters. Also, Cruise plays a great egomaniac!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A modern day classic","review":"Magnolic is going to go down in history as one of the top 10 movies of the 20th century.

However, after spending THREE HOURS trying to give the director the benefit of the doubt, I was very disappointed. The music is the only redeeming factor about this film, so do yourself a favor and skip the DVD and just buy the soundtrack. And I'd also like an explanation about the frogs. Is it some weak biblical allusion??? If so, where are the locusts???"},{"rating":"1","title":"As my interest ebbed and flowed....","review":"not unlike the current of an ocean forged of crocodile tears, I found myself intrigued by how such a monumental epic of sap and plot diversion could possibly end. Even after three hours of self-conscious weirdness and dialogue, only effective to the most gullible of viewers, I still felt that something could be salvaged. But how can you end a film full of hysterical sobbing of the obnoxious kind? Well at the end of the film, as the viewers were bounced from plot to plot, each cut featured a big, fat sobbing face. A film can only earn that kind of emotion with fine writing, a great performance, and well-conceived characters. Trying to coerce intense reactions from audiences is a poor method of message delivery in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ","review":"Too long.

BORING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the worst ever","review":"This movie is a total piece of...! The director is so self important. The story is even worse than Boogie Nights. Tom Cruise's performance is unimaginative and overrated. The frogs are about the worst thing I have ever seen on film. An absolute joke of a movie. Please, please save your money so as to save yourself 3 hours of agony and hopefully prevent this director from making any more films."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretentious, boring mess...","review":"this movie is a hodgepodge of ridiculous religious symbolism and overwrought melodrama. intense profanity masquerades as dialogue with actors often screaming obscenities at the top of their lungs for no apparent reason. The frogs falling from the sky is stolen from an X-Files ep and the intertwining stories seem lifted from Robert Altman's MUCH superior movies. a wildly overpraised movie that will leave you with an intense headache from its length and volume as well as three hours gone from your life. avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Garbage","review":"This pretentious trash is horrible. It is THE worst movie of 1999, hands down. Even with the great cast they had, P.T. Anderson must have been drunk through the entire directing process. My god... why did he do this to me? Why Paul, why? Fear this movie, but if you like spending three hours watching a bunch of whiny adults feel sorry about themselves and and try and redeem themselves by whining more about how dumb and whiny they are, you will love this movie. Ugh...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run, do not walk, as far away from this movie as you can","review":"I wish I had the three hours of my life back that I wasted on this movie. The characters are unsympathetic and uninteresting. The opening works hard to set up some big cosmic payoff that will link all the lives and coincidences together into something coherent, but it never happens. Tom Cruise's character is ludicrous and Julianne Moore is literally unwatchable. And then there's the frogs. Somehow, nothing says that the director didn't know where to go with the film quite like having really big frogs falling from the sky. The best thing about this movie is that Aimee Mann did the music and the only truly excellent scene in the whole 3 hours is the few seconds where all the characters (even the unconscious ones) sing along to one of her songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magnolia","review":"Worst movie I ever seen.

Yes, I can see how some people like it. It seems like people either love this movie or hate it. It's sort of like Mulan Rouge - a kaleidescope of confusion.For me, I like something that is a bit more grounded. It's definitely original, but expression without a thought or care of what the audience might like is like throwing darts. You can hit your target or miss the mark."},{"rating":"2","title":"The DVD set is a bit lacking...","review":"I would LOVE if they re-released this movie with a commentary track by the director and possibly the cast. I feel the movie could certainly use a little more explaining and the DVD feels very empty without the said feature. And, as long as the movie was, I'm sure there were more deleted scenes/outakes than those provided in both the \\"color bars\\" section (on disc 1) and disc 2. I just enjoyed the movie so much, I wish there was more material to dig into... Fincher has spoiled me with his excellent Fight Club and Se7en DVD sets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stylistically Fascinating","review":"This movie is worth seeing, simply because you have never seen anything like it. Anderson jumps from story to story, weaving a quilt that casts a sad spell over the viewer. I think Anderson is trying to bring you his vision of life: it's painful, we do things we regret and can never take back, happiness is elusive but should be grabbed where it can and a few caring people can make a difference in the lives of others.I liked this movie much more the second time I saw it. The first time it was a bit hard to make sense of - all the story lines, the weird intro about coincidences and, of course, the frogs. The second time I saw it I had digested the style and come to appreciate it and could concentrate a little more on the stories. There is also the wonderful Aimee Mann soundtrack - I became an Aimee Mann fan as a result of hearing her in this movie. There are some snippets of dialogue that come right out of the Aimee Mann songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful.","review":"While this movie isn't \\"action-packed\\" or spoon-feeding a clean and simple ending to you, it is simply gorgeous and honest. Movies often fail at portraying more than one side of a character's personality and this movie does so realisticly. This movie is subtle at times, and there's no doubt that it's long, but if you possess any attention span, watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Exhausting Exhilerating Thrill of a Movie","review":"This was my favorite movie of 1999. I can understand why many did not like it, but for me it was a treat from beginning to end. It's true that it feels almost like stream of consciousness with no editing (in length anyway), but that is part of it appeal. It is an outpouring of emotion and energy. The performances (especially by Hoffman, Moore and Cruise) are exceptional. The music is astoundingly good. I CANNOT wait for the DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Original Artistic Masterpiece","review":"This movie is a must see for anyone who appreciates artistic well thought out movies. If you are dumb then I don't recommend it as you will be unable to comprehend it's brilliance, most of the time these people will dimiss it with negative reviews just because they don't get it..... And I quote Bob Dylan ' Don't criticize what you can't understand'A unique film run with fantastic acting and an undercurrent of genius.

I'd give this film a 'zero' but Amazon limits the choices from 1-5. This movie is a waste of time. The beginning starts out with a review of odd circumstance, as if this work should be watched with that it mind. It doesn't help. The frogs at the end does absolutely nothing for this film, either. Artsy!? Not hardly. Tom Cruise can still play the young hot shot he's been trying to perfect in Top Gun, Jerry Maguire, et. al. I heard he got an Oscar nomination for this?? What, was this another bad year for films, like the year Fargo came out? Do yourself a favor--miss this film--use the time to dig a ditch, spread fertilizer, or clean the toilets at the airport.

You, the viewer, get treated to a 10 minute version of \\"One is the Lonliest Number\\" (at earshattering volume), a seemingly endless parade of pathetic, one-dimensional losers who are impossible to care about, an actual music video (! ), two major characters dying of cancer, and finally an EVENT which is supposed to tie everything together in some sort of profound way (it doesn't.) PT Anderson seems like too nice a guy to tell his actors to tone things down. I can't remember the last time I saw so much hammy acting: everybody is crying and screaming and/or cursing all of the time. Anderson is great at moving the camera, and he has a good eye for lighting and composition. He would make a wonderful commercial director. And the special effects during the EVENT are a lot of fun to watch. After watching this film I really appreciated what Robert Altman accomplished with \\"Short Cuts\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"i'd rate it lower if i could","review":"This movie was trying to make a point that could have been done in half an hour, or in that actual first 10 minutes of the movie.

The problem is that everything is turning out and you finally get bored after half an hour.The story is about .... Love, Pride, Hope ... and it's completely flat, flat, flat ! It just happens nothing except a frog rain at the end that also means nothing ! It's for sure one of the most boring movies of my life. The one star rate is really for the actors only ! The rest is garbage !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uhhhh... NO!","review":"I can't say much about this whole movie as I turned it off after around 30 minutes. After an almost nonstop onslaught(well, it sure seemed like it) of the F word and really coarse and vile language from Mr. Cruise's first convention I had had just about enough. The opening song was alright but it seemed to go on forever and did somewhat drown out the beginning dialogue. I said to myself that if this is the pattern for the next 3 hours than I'd rather watch something else. So I turned on the dvd player and watched more of the 80's Hunter show. I don't get the hollywood frenzy on movies like these? I had heard about Tom Cruise's performance over the years but realized it was so talked about because it was way over the top! Now I know better.... I hope!

The pretentiousness, overacting and sheer wwfullness of this film sets a standard that is hard to follow. The same acting contingent which gave a professional and enjoyable performance in Boogie Nights is reduced to a shrill, gasping ensemble trying to make some sense out of...nothing.

Some do a decent job while movies like this do it in an untasteful way. For example, in this movie, you will hear children use the f word and cuss like ugly adults. We all know some kids do that in real life, but I do not believe children actors should cuss like that for a movie, which is simply a form of entertainment. I think film makers should use discretion while trying to show the realities of life.All in all, if you really want to hear the f word 100 times (I think it was about 100 times), go ahead and watch and enjoy the ugliness of humanity.

Nor are the individual characters in the movie intermingled at all, as the film purports they are. There isn't any cohesiveness. Great performances by he actors...all did a charming job...but the stories were mostly boring and had almost no depth at all. And way too much music. Half the movie was a music video for Aimee Mann's great songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Emperor Has No Clothes","review":"Read all of the five star reviews if you don't believe me. None of the reviewers get this film, so they default to the \\"brilliant\\" rating. This really is a film student's wet dream and that's about it. This flick reminds me of many of the songs from the late sixties, all fluff and no substance. Write about flying purple elephants and all the nomads need to attach some absurd, satirical existentialist meaning to it.I have lived in the SF Valley my whole life and yes I've known people like those in this film. So what, they are not worth knowing long. Whine, whine, whine, everyone has a sad story. I was hoping for them all to kill themselves by hour two.

I guess PT Andersen doesnt really think you can get his art so he hits you over the head relentlessly - Oh the emotion!

Spoiled brat with camera at large!","review":"This is only a kids way to see \\"Short Cuts\\" (which, by the way, was heavily overrated as well).

Not one single theme in the film is treated with any depth. The actors are all terrific in their handed roles but the roles themselves are idiotic. If this is the way people are in America, then indeed: \\"God Bless America\\". But it isn't. The only role that was half believable was the male role of the nurse of Jason Robards.

My mother even tried to have a conversation with me - I just couldn't stop watching.The begining is incredible. Aimee Mann's soundtrack is incredible. When 'One is the Lonliest Number' was playing, and all the characters were being introduced, I was just amazed. I got goosebumps and shivers up my spine. It was such an incredible moment in the film, probably one of my favorite moments in film-making itself.I liked the extras on the DVD, too. You get the full 'T.J. Mackey' infomercial as well as tons of diferrent trailers and lots of information. But the movie speaks for itself. It's simply a masterpiece.

For even more fun, try and figure out what they mean.Wow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"Just hearing a movie is three hours inspires gasps in most of world. How can anyone stay in a seat for three hours? Well, just try. Magnolia is such a detailed and fragile tale that seems like it will explode at any moment.

I say it is movies like Magnolia that seperate movie fans into two categories: those who are willing to think during a movie and those who just want to sit back and be entertained. I think that Magnolia was a brilliant movie full of symbolism and art. If you want a light, easy-to-watch movie, this is not the one for you. If, on the other hand, you don't mind to think and take in the symbolism, sit back and relax...you're gonna love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnolia","review":"Magnolia is a long film at 3 hours but well worth it.

In the end youll either love it,or you will curse the day you ever thought of seeing it(and ask yourself why you listen to me).

But PT Anderson creates engaging scenes and dialogue (watch Henry Gibson at the bar) and pulls you all over the place. Guess what? It's a fun ride.It's possible to be a fan of Altman and enjoy this movie. In fact, go watch Short Cuts or Nashville right after watching this.It's also not for everyone. It's dark and it meanders and be advised that it's profane. That's what the R rating means. Watch it, then go check out Hard Eight and Boogie Nights and watch for the same camera tricks PT Anderson has been using since his first film. Coffee anyone?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, but not for everyone","review":"I had heard so many bad things about this movie that I when I borrowed the DVD from a friend, I had very low expectations. I wanted to see it out of curiousity more than anything. But this movie really surprised me. Yes, it is a tad too long, but the strength of the story, the characters, the acting, and even the soundtrack more than make up for the length of the film. Bottom line, it is one of the best films I have seen in a long time. If you ever have a little time on a rainy day and want to see a truly unique film, go see Magnolia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"The only thing as painfull as sitting through this three hour plus self indulgent nightmare, is enduring the \\"Magnolia diary\\".

I thought this was going to be great. A few story lines that all tie into one big ending. Oh I was pumped. Three hours later... a waste of my freaking time. Imagine someone taking an episode of Family Ties (one of the \\"Very Special Episodes\\",) a bad Trapper John M.D. episode and a cable access program, splicing them all together so as they jump around and none of them have an ending that relates to anything else, and you have just made the sequel to Magnolia. Save your money, buy a can of paint, pour it onto your floor, watch it dry then clean it up. That is much less a waste of time than watching this flick. Almost as bad as English Patient (that is saying a lot.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"pointless pretentious garbage","review":"proof that if you try hard enough to make something as dull as possible there will be a sizeable part of the population that will consider it art.there is only one redeeming feature - the end"},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back and...","review":"After renting this movie, I felt the need to return to the video store and not only demand my money back but my hourly rate for the three hours I wasted as well.This movie, sporting an excellent cast, had great potential. The first ten minutes of the movie made me feel I was truly in for a great movie. The next hour and a half kept me on the edge of my seat waiting for how the plots were going to come together.While watching the last hour of this movie, it became obvious that they never would. The dialog became slow and the characters lost their interest and the common theme that brings the movie together in the end is...I so wish I could tell you how this movie ends just so you WON\\"T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY ON IT!

I couldn't wait for the old guy to die, and the only reason I stuck around for the end was to see what I was sure HAD to be an incredible cliffhanging ending. It was so disappointing. Sure the acting was great, but these actors are always good. The story was TERRIBLE!I read in many reviews how the movie was so \\"beautiful\\". Tell me how dead frogs and drug addiction are beautiful.Actually I lost respect for the academy for even thinking this was a good screenplay when so many other GREAT films were out last year.

After sitting through 2.5 hours of helter skelter excitement, I turned to my wife, and said \\"This movie could now end a million different ways\\". I think any one of these million ways would have been OK- But the makers of this movie chose number 1,000,001.

The story could have been told in less than two hours. By the first hour, an average viewer would already have an idea of the characters. PT Anderson thinks the viewers are dumb enough not to understand the characterization hence the long movie...waste of time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MAGNIFICENT!!!!!","review":"Magnolia is one those rare films that I can watch over and over again and am always moved to tears by the final frame. This is filmmaking at its brilliant best.The scenes that stand out and touch me the most are Julianne Moore's emotional ourburst at the pharmacy, William H. Macy's heart wrenching speech of having love to give but not knowing where to put it, the goosebump inducing musical interlude to Amy Mann's touching \\"Wise Up\\" and of course the frogs. Who can forget the frogs.Everything about this film is perfect. THIS is what movie making is about, a film lovers dream.

The film begins with an introduction to the subject. Hypothesising events that cannot be held under a pure coincidence, and suggesting that some things are more than chance: they are destiny. The film introduces our protagonists and follows them through an extrordinary day. All the characters are in search of redemption, all the characters are convinced to find it by the end of the film. While I found the film to be at times melodramatic (screaming, crying, etc.), the film overall was powerfull and innovative."},{"rating":"2","title":"It left me stunned. just BEAUTIFUL","review":"This is what movie making is all about. A story that reaches into the human sould and reveals all of the dirt and all the beauty. It is human and that is probably the best term that I can use to describe this epic story. One way that you can tell how good a movie is the response that it generates. And everyone that I have talked to that has seen this movie either completly loves it or hates it. Well I loved it and I will tell you why. It was real. And I don't mean the coincidences or the frogs, but the people. The way that they had been affected by the traumas of the past and the various ways that they became victims of those traumas by trying ti sooth them. It is a classic case of Mythology and Psycology intertwined to give the viewer an deeper look into what it is like to suffer and that the only way to move past our past is to recognize why we do what we do and then let go and move on. It is what we are and it shows what we can be.

PTA uses his signature stalker sequences, and beautiful crane shots in his third film, and his best, \\"Magnolia\\". It's great to see him maturing as a filmmaker, and to also see him still writing about life situations/plots. I love this film so much, and it's on my X-mas list for 2003.It contains a \\"refugee\\" cast from \\"Boogie Nights\\". Macey, C. Reilly, Moore, Hoffman, Baker Hall, and Guzman. With a few new faces....Tom Cruise, and \\"Buck\\" from \\"Kill Bill\\", don't know his real name, just refer to him as \\"Buck\\".This is the true definition of a five star film."},{"rating":"1","title":"A compelling film but not for everyone","review":"This a movie you either love or hate. We almost stopped the movie, but then decided to give it a chance. The best actor was the girl who was molested by her father. She is a wonderful actress and did a supurb job with her part. I have such mixed feelings about this film. It was bizarre as well as compelling... and I made it through the entire film. The foul language might be offensive to some. I don't think I would see the film again...once is enough. It made me very nervous and uncomfortable at times. Where does the title \\"Magnolia\\" come from? I must have missed the connection in the movie. Also, the frogs were horrible... biblical meaning or not, I was disgusted. I can't say anything bad about the acting, because everyone did a great job, but the movie was not what I expected and it was quite long."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Whatever Film","review":"Magnolia is a haunting 3 hour tale of.................whatever! At times it seems this film is meandering recklessly around in circles, never touching upon a significant point. Subtle plot lines appear and then disappear into another newly introduced plot, keeping the viewer constantly transfixed, but always baffled. Magnolia has moments of brilliance, like intense performances by the red haired actress (her name escapes me), and an unconventional style of directing by Paul Thomas Anderson (king of the zoom in close up!). The music of Aimee Mann also works effectively for this film, giving it a stately presence of somber bleakness. The ending of this film was quite bizarre, but original, leaving the viewer in question. Do you have to be a cokehead to understand? Who was talking to her? What the hell were they talking about? Why was she smiling? Was it a coke thing? AGGGGGGGGGG! Whatever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!!","review":"This was perhaps the WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN!!No plot. Too long. Characters who had to cuss and pitch fits in order to convey their \\"feelings.\\" A terrible soundtrack of several 15 or 20 minute long opera type pieces that just drone on in the background.And then there's the cast sing-a-long as all of the characters whine about their self-created poor me misery.And then there were the frogs?? Are you kidding me!!\\"Boogie Nights\\" was mildly amusing at best.\\"Magnolia\\" was an abysmal and irredeemable mess.Everything was so amateurish about this film. Especially the writing. Even the two most seemingly interesting characters -- the cop and Tom Cruise's character -- could have been done SO much better.Oh, man, this film was just something excruciating to have to sit through.A ZERO-STAR lemon-flop-dud-bomb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decidedly disappointing","review":"I adored Boogie Nights and thought the cast and director could only top it. Unfortunately this was not the case. It was too long and bloated. Some of the scenes and characters were very engaging but the interlinked stories did not add up to anything desperately interesting and the build up did not lead to a decent climax.You cannot beat 2 DVD disc special additions for learning about a film inside and out. The second disk seemed to reveal a pretty amateur produtcion effort. I wish it was better but it wasn't. Take a look at something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh how my bottom aches","review":"Straight to the point, this film is overrated. Over ambitiousis the best way to describe Andersons work. Boogie Nights would have been perfect if the last half hour had been cut, but with Magnolia he would have needed a pair of garden shears. What exactly was he hoping to achieve here? You never suspect for one moment that the movie will culminate with a reasoned and satisfactory ending. Its messy throughout. I felt itchy just watching it. Am i the only one who squirmed as the cast sang the aimee mann track?Some of the characters and scenarios were interesting, and as ever, William H Macy gave us a watchable portrayal of a man struggling to come to terms with middle age. But its no answer as to how this film ever got the go-ahead.Yes, we all like films like this, films that are different,challenging,thought provoking and over long!

I appreciate the ideas behind it, but it's an ending that'sless emotional than the film that proceeded it. And a fewmoments of irony are forced. That was true in 'Boogie Nights' too, butbecause that film had a lighter, more self-mocking touch, even theheavy handed moments didn't stick out.None-the-less, this is a must see film, overflowing with greatperformances, unconventional storytelling, heartbreaking moments, andan honest look at where we are and who we are as a society."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRAP ALL THE WAY","review":"ART???

I thought and thought for some connection or metaphor that the frogs could represent. Did I miss something? What so brilliant about raining frogs? I could think of that.

Anderson. The intro to this film was so worthless, but sadly, seemed the film's greatest attempt at being clever - and it goes downhill from there. Lack of editing seems evident throughout all of his films, but this one offends like no other. The idea of great actors + no script = art house success is a crime to the idea of cinema. This summer held too much evidence that the end of cinema is near, this movie is the swan song of the decline. I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy. Well, maybe... Depends on how much I disliked them. Avoid like herpes. But then again, my favorite directors are S.Kubrick and W.Allen - and I didn't get the joke in Boogie Nights.

On the negative side: 2) The movie is bombastic, hammering out its messages without any subtlty. 3) There is no variation in the characters' voices. Every single charcater mouths the exact same obscenities and has the exact same speech patterns. After a while, you realize that you are hearing a chorus of the screenwriter's didactic shouts, with no variation in tone, vocabulary or message. 4) The magic realist ending (the frogs) were a cute devise, but they really pointed to the fact that the screenwriter did not know how to resolve the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magnoila is Magcrapia","review":"After seeing the brilliantly entertaining 'Boogie Nights', what a dissapointing film.

Furthermore, there does not there seem to be any reason for them to be in the movie other than the intellectual self-gratification of the movie's creators.

A REAL American Beauty","review":"For all the reasons that audiences praised \\"American Beauty\\" for depicting the human experience on film, \\"Magnolia\\" adds a more realistic, relatable, and multi-layered version of modern day themes of humanity. Many are quick to dismiss the true genious of P.T. Anderson as they fail to process his many subtle but powerful symbolic gestures (the rapping black prophet kid, the use of drugs as a release, the allusion to raining frogs...). It is a reflection of our own lives, flashing back to us a reminder of what's important in life and how it's never too late to make amends for lifelong mistakes.On a technical note, the soundtrack is beautifully implemented and the picture quailty is very detailed and clear. Most important, this is a movie where the extra disc full of bonus materials will help to illuminate the mulitple dimensions and deeper layers for the film.Simply put, this film is an amazing work, more deserving of Best Picture than \\"American Beauty.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Something to Talk About","review":"This movie provides heaps of existential ideas that will be talked about for a long time.

From Meaninglessness and coincidence become themselves a meaning. Paul Thomas Anderson has created a masterpiece. He uses fresh tecniques to tell a complex set of stories about sorrow, cancer and corruption, that instead of being depressing, is a life-affirming expirience. The stories are dark, yes, but not without hope, and not without humor. Many of actors adeptly portray fascinating characters, Tom Cruise in particular is a suprise with a fresh new style. I can honestly say, without reservation, that this is the best movie I have ever seen. Watch Magnolia. Its an expirience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnolia blossoms","review":"The plot of this movie is nearly impossible to explain. The whole length of this three hour movie covers only one night and consists of several interweaving vignettes. Tom Cruise shines in this movie as a boisterous chauvinist self-help mogul. It is a compulsively watchable movie, even if the ending is a little inaccessible to the audience. Still, I'd recommend this DVD on the merits of the movie alone. Still, it doesn't hurt that it comes in a 2 Disc package with awesome extras and a few interesting easter eggs (click on the color test bars feature and there's a few takes of interesting scenes). In this case, the DVD is chockful of interesting features, most of which are definately not weak filler and are worthy of your time. This is a must for anyone interested in how films are created, from the concept to the script, to the actual shooting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh my god, what a movie","review":"Yeah it's long. The first time I saw it I didn't think it was anything special, either. But I watched it again and you see all the suffering caused by selfishness and resentment and life is too short to hold on to the hurt and the only way out is forgiveness.The movie's scope falls like a net over these people who are all tied back to the two dying dads. I found myself identifying with every single character in one way or another. Combine that with the excellent performances and the masterful direction, and what you have is a beautiful interlocking mosaic of a movie that may take two or more viewings to fully appreciate. And the the very ending, after the frog rain, is almost too much to take in its emotion.

Calling this film \\"awful\\" or a \\"waste of time\\" is just a small indicator of the bigger problem in the world. That's the irony: How do you tell a fish in water that it's wet? It is because most people are walking around begging to be told the obvious -- in a constant search for another cliche -- that they miss the profundity of this movie. This movie is a cinematic epiphany -- nothing less than that. If you don't get it you must ask yourself what you think \\"good\\" is. Then look around you at the rest of the herd of sheep you are in the middle of.Wake Up."},{"rating":"1","title":"indulgent melodrama needing some heart","review":"There's no shortage of superb actors in fascinating situations and all in the hands of director-genius anderson...so why did this movie leave me so bored? Because it feels like melodramatic junkfood -- lots of emotion with little real heart or understanding. We don't really get to know any of the characters or care about them. The viewer is simply transported rocket-speed from one crisis to another, each of which is presented with feverish emotion. There's no silence or insight to enable the viewer to better appreciate the chaos onscreen. At least the tom cruise character is so over-the-top that he's fun to watch. Way too self indulgent for anyone out of high-school. give pt anderson credit for going for a grand slam here (and many feel he got it), but in my opinion he struck out."},{"rating":"1","title":"How could you screw this up","review":"I watched this movie recently, and was quite disappointed. There was a great story, incredible actors and performances, wonderful photography and production values, but a butchered screenplay and editing job. The movie couldn't decide whether to be a thriller or a farce, and lost on both accounts. Crash got 4 1/2 stars from me, this gets 1 1/2 stars, strictly for the technical work and acting. There is a good reason it was a dud at the box office with the incredible cast it had, folks didn't like it. I wouldn't say don't see it, but expect a disjointed, confused viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 hours of my life that I will NEVER get back","review":"Look folks, I enjoyed \\"Boogie Nights\\". Slightly long, but overall a pretty solid, interesting story. I had about average hopes for \\"Magnolia\\", imagine my suprise when I found even those were to high!There were a lot of great stories here that suffered from the format. If they had cut the character count down even say 25%, this movie would have been a 4 or 5 star movie in my book. Yes, I know, dysfuctional life movies are being done left and right, but there was some really solid stuff here. It just sadly was slaughtered by the constant changing of storylines. As soon as I found myself getting really into someone's story, *SNAP* \\"Time to change lines!\\" *grumble*Watch it on cable folks, don't buy it, don't rent it, just watch it if you have nothing else to do for 3 hours.

The falling frogs does not \\"save\\" the film, but only highlights what pretentious crap it is. Cruise manages to shine, delivering an energetic and overall excellent performance. Save your time and money though. And be weary of all the great reviews. It seems like they have an \\"Emperor's New Clothes\\" type of feel. In the future, I will try to avoid movies billed as \\"ambitious\\". Yuck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read a good book instead. Waste of time.","review":"Watched this video for 30 minutes and decided that was too much time invested. Loud, crude, senseless. Language was overdone. If you like PBS, A&E, BBC and uplifting, educating, or absorbing stories, this is a movie to avoid. The repetitive singing of One Is A Lonely Number throughout the beginning was over the top annoying. The chronic use of the f-word was numbing in its repetitiveness.

I have read through many of the 4 and 5 star reviews and I saw a lot of people who liked the film and thought it was the wrok of genuis, but no one gave any evidence that they actually understood the frogs. So am I missing something here guys? Ifso help me please! The movie was interesting at parts, and notso interesting in other areas, but it was very long and the ending was very unsatisfying to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Movie of the Year","review":"This is a fantastic movie, on every level. It manages to capture perfectly the mood and themes of America at the end of the 20th century. To name just a few, the quest for redemption (the biblical plague of frogs leads to that); the adversarial relationship between adults and children, captured in the \\"adults against kids\\" game show and the relationship between the host and his daughter; how isolated and desperate for connection people are; men feeling emasculated and manipulated by women, turning to Tom Cruise's character for help . . . so much there. The acting is superb -- Julianne Moore should have been nominated for an Academy Award for this movie, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman & Tom Cruise were also terrific. This movie, largely overlooked by the prediotable Motion Picture Academy, will withstand the test of time better than \\"American Beauty,\\" which, though good, had largely been done before. See it more than once!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"I was really surprised to see that I am one of the few people who did not like this movie. Although the actors did a very good job I think that \\"Magnolia\\" is way to long and hence gets pretty boring after a while.

It's true that it tells you how many intruders there were and the many combinations for passwords, but sometimes when you're setting the password, you don't even blink and it counts it as a blink. When i FINALLY got it to work (after about 1 hour), i managed to put it on my door and i tried it out. It kept thinking i was an intruder because when it senses someone trying to pull it off the door a siren goes off. I was just trying to put the code in!

My favorite part is when I put my code in, I get to find out how many \\"intruders\\" tried to get in. If someone blinked a wrong code (examlpe: red,red,red) or tried to move the room guard off the door, I'll be told by the voice that I had intruders.

Also, she repeated much of the same information in several different chapters under different sections. Perhaps she wrote the book in between her many voiceover auditions. The information in this book is outdated since the industry has changed so dramatically since its publication. Terri Apple has proved that pretty voices should only be used when they have something to say. And that a pretty voice can be an ugly read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was the editor?","review":"The book contains good information, but it is so poorly written and edited that it is, at times, incoherent. I could not get past the first thirty pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating Read and Repetitive","review":"There are so many typos in this book that it is actually frustrating to read. There is also so much repetition, not in general, but huge paragraphs that can be found word for word three pages earlier. Terri Apple is very good at cheerleading and she obviously knows the business but there's too much emphasis on LA contacts and way, way, way too many text errors to recommend this book. And I'm not talking about grammar. I'm talking about \\"The re\\" \\"and and\\" or whole words left out. I found myself struggling to read this book. Since it was published in 1999 some of the advice is out-of-date, like carry a pager (pre-cell phones) which is not Ms. Apple's fault, nor her editors, if she had one. I do find her responsible for the content of her book. With so many books on voice-overs out there, I would recommend another."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Pro's or beginners","review":"I read Terri's book with great anticipation. I wanted to see how much she knew; how much I did or didn't know and what she could add to my knowledge.

AND - from the prospective of a beginner, she also spells it out without painting any rainbows. It's being told \\"as it is.\\"This is a very helpful publication to those of us to need to sharpen our skills and continue learning to hon our skills and a wonderful insightful glimpse into the workings of the world of voiceovers.I recommend this book to Pro's & Newbies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not exactly what I expected","review":"Personally I expected more helpful hints and techniques for improving your skills in voice-overs but instead most of the book is concentrated on advising how to promote your talent.

I was wrong! The book doesnt cover anything new that cant be found in the NDK documentation. It even uses Novells code samples. It references code on the CD that is non-existent, a common occurence now-a-days. The author obviously did not do any research or hands on work with this book. Do not buy this book, read the NDK documentation and you will be ahead of the game in NDS development."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hits its mark.","review":"This book seems to contain a little something for most programmers.

I definitely feel like this book is the answer that I have been looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good and Bad","review":"I learned about the non-diet approach from Jane Hirshmann and Carol Munter's book, Overcoming Overeating (or OO). What I love about OO is that they understand how important self acceptance and size acceptance are to REALLY letting go of emotional eating. As long as there is a voice within saying, I'm only good enough if I'm thin enough, the world is an unsafe place to live. And those of us who use food to soothe anxiety, will turn to food to soothe that unsafe feeling.Geneen's books always seem to hold that other viewpoint - that thin is better. It's often veiled our couched in terms of acceptance (which, to me, makes it a little creepy). If you want to learn about your compulsion to eat to soothe your feelings, then stick with Overcoming Overeating, or the sequel, When Women Stop Hating their Bodies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use your time elsewhere","review":"This book was only okay.

I tried her suggestion of eating what you want, and found that I was not eating a very balanced diet. Maybe some people naturally gravitate toward a proper diet, but I am not one of them.

As an evangelical christian reading this book was like reliving the Book of Acts over and over again. Jesus promised His church that He would send the Holy Spirit in power and throughout the whole book on Maria Woodworth-Etters ministry we see the evidence of the awesome power of our almighty God. The book is full of documented supernatural healings and sermons given by Maria Woodworth-Etter. She had no formal theological training from man but she had the best Teacher their is, the Holy Spirit himself. She stayed in the Word of God and used it as the ONLY measuring tool to walk with. God also revealled in her mininstry the importance of the body of Christ working together. Although Maria was the team leader she had many brother(s) and sister(s) in the Lord that worked along side of her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"I bought two of these.

It follows the group of men into the disastrous Gallipoli campaign. I limit 5 stars to books that I want to read once a year (at least) and 4 stars to books that I will re-read at least once.

Furthermore, I haven't been able to find a way to complain. GVJ has been bought out by Jones. The saleslady at Penney's has heard about this from other customers, and knew exactly what I was doing when I shook out a pair to check the pocket, but she didn't have any contact info.

My daughter was so exited when she opened it and wanted to play with it right away. My husband had to monkey around with it for 10 minutes just to get a color picture, which was terrible anyway. She had to stomp on the flowers and she was bored with it in 10 minutes. My son was so disappointed that he had wasted all that money on a useless game.

The music is canned, extremely repetitive pseudo-jazz and it quickly becomes tedious to listen to; it certainly doesn't inspire the \\"light-hearted\\" dancing Moreno mentions. The moves are uninspired and have little to do with dance today. The choreography reminded me of the worst kind of jazz/Broadway routines that you might see on a cruise ship \\"80's Night\\". I did break a very light sweat while doing this workout, but only because I used the many boring, repetitive marching sections and teaching sections to do my own thing or continue at the slightly higher intensity of the actual dancing.

Ms. Moreno has zero personality, she takes forever to show the simplest of steps in the slowest way imaginable and then the actual dancing part is over in the blink of an eye. I don't know what kind of shape the other reviewers are in but this tape is clearly not for somebody who actually wants to bring their heart beat up, break a serious sweat or have a bit of fun in their exercise routine.

Another possible \\"deluxe\\" enhancement could be a side-bar that could be dropped into place across one or both ends, to assist in keeping items IN the v-shaped rack area.Nonetheless, I would probably buy this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not purchase","review":"All those other reviewers who said that this dish rack is too small for actual dishes are correct. It doesn't fit standard sized plates and certainly not stuff like cookie sheets, etc. (as did my most recent dishrack). THis is due to poor design, not size. Do not buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Folding dish rack","review":"I purchased this dish rack after using a similar one for over 3 years. The plastic on the old one cracked and then rusted. I could not find a similar item in the stores and was happy to find this one. It was a better price than my original rack but it only has room for cups on one side instead of two. But I am still satisfied with my purchase. It is sturdy and have not had any tipping issues. The best part is it folds and fits in the space between the top of my frig and the cabinets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't stand up","review":"It seemed simple enough to pull it open and stand it up, but the grooves in the bottom are too smooth and it doesn't catch. Quite worthless as it doesn't stand.

It folds, and unlike the bamboo version of this design- I thought it wouldn't get moldy. Upon arrival, the rack set up nicely, only we discovered it is too large for the large dish drainer board we ordered with it. So it slides around a bit. And then it collapses when you put large dishes on the rack- so basically it's useless unless you wash only 5 dishes at a time. Disappointing, as the design is a good idea- just looks like it was shoddy in the execution. Waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"flimsy","review":"I received it yesterday and went ahead and used it. The thing collapsed after I put a few items and broke a few glass items.

Mmmm, delicious. So, a few days ago I got this Mahatma mix. I don't like Mahatma's white rice, but I liked their Long and Wild Rice mix, and have had their yellow rice a few times, although it is sort of bland in large amounts. I wish I had gotten Zatarain's now, because this stuff was edible, but the spices in it are rank. It's almost a bitter taste. I tried a little bit with some hot sauce, and it was awful. I don't think anything can fix this rice. I sometimes mix pintos and basmati together, and that tastes better than this. Although, one time I mixed black beans and basmati, along with some other things and that was worse than this, so this isn't the worst rice I've ever had, but it is the worst mix.I'd recommend going with one of these instead:Mahatma Long/Wild Rice mixLipton mixes(I like Herb/Butter and Long/Wild the best)Zatarains Red Beans and Rice"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best brand","review":"Wife loves this as well, great with Salmon.

But after getting over Almaas' metaphor I found this to be one of the best spiritual practice books I have come across. Inquiry, when done properly, is an amazingly powerful practice. Almaas takes you step by step into a deeper understanding of how to do this practice. That said, this book is not for everyone. I would suggest that someone should have read Diamond Heart One and Two (for most people these are a better starting point than the Diamond Mind series) and also have at least a couple of years of sitting meditation experience before working with this book. Without that foundation, this work might only engage you at the psychological level. This is also a \\"workbook\\" with lots of inquiry exercises-take your time with it. I would suggest setting aside some time to work with it two or three times a week. The inquiries will take 15-20 minutes each and shouldn't be skipped if you want to engage this work fully."},{"rating":"1","title":"None the wiser re Inquiry","review":"If you are seeking understanding, knowledge or a functional exposition on the processes of Inquiry, don't bother with this book.

On \\"Sea of Faces\\" they have began to explore new territory with meldoic vocals and background keyboards.The result is more creativity, but less edge. My favorites are \\"Not what you see, better for you, sea of faces, let you in, and treason. Sophomore slump, NADA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even stronger than the debut","review":"from track 1 until the last beat, this album stays strong. It has a clear Christian message throughout it, though there are no slower songs like the beautiful Grace & Love from Kutless' debut. There also are not nearly as many heavy songs, Let You In is the only song that has a scream. But really screaming isn't what makes this band so great, it's making beautiful Christian songs that flat out rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great CD","review":"This is a good CD. The lyrics are great, and the music is great. The only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars is because although Kutless has 2 guitarists, they barely use them. Basically 2 guitarists do the work of 1 guitarist. But other than that, it is good.Check out the only Kutless fan site... http://www.kutlessrocks.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Then Their 1st Album","review":"Kutless is a typical rock group, except without the trash. Their songs aren't only entertaining, but they also talk about God, and I think that's really good.

I would recommend this CD to any rock lover, Christian rock lover, and any parent looking for a good rock CD for their child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suck fest","review":"Kutless has released a new record and I bought it at Best Buy because it was on display next to the Death Cab For Cutie.This record is a crapfest of music.

I get it and I wanted to end life right then and their. This is horrible effort to keep things going like they did. I also think this record sucks for the fact that on the last record they ripped creed off, and now on this cd they rip Live off. The song Treason is exactly like the song from Live off of the Secret Samai record. Kutless sucks and when I go to Sea Of Faces concert. I will leave before they go on stage and Pray to God all mighty that this bands breaks up."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say? It's Kutless!","review":"This is an awesome album!

I found out about them after reading reviews of other bands that mentioned this release. After nearly wearing out the song samples on Amazon, I bought the CD. As my title suggests, it's straightforward hard rock with a positive spin. My favorite song is probably \\"Passion\\", although every track is worth listening over and over. My rating is really close to 4.5 stars. A couple minor setbacks keep it from a perfect 5. The couple little rap diddies the singer does, I feel, are unnecessary. Also, the songs are too short; it's sort of a pet peeve of mine when a really cool song is only about 3 minutes long. Adding another minute or so, even a guitar solo, would do wonders. But, it's easy to get over that when the main objective is the message in the song. I now have another good band in my CD collection. Great Job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The most pleasurable listening experience","review":"The music on *Journey of Man* brings to mind a spring evening.

It's one soundtrack that can truly stand apart and be appreciated on its own.From listening to this cd you will be invited to feel a beautiful kind of melancholy, revitalizing energy, and subtle strains of menace.

Missiles were flying, planes were dropping, and the world seemed like it was taking a turn for the worse. Luckily the Schimdt's were there to cover for us and bring us back to the happy go lucky lifestyle we have today.Harlow's style was gripping and very entertaining. The love interest very subtle and infact only implied.

Bill Harlow's use of scene-shifting, humor, and genuine Navy knowledge and experience left me as if I'd just come out of a really good film,which I hope it in fact becomes. So many books of this type are better classified under science fiction. They are not even plausible.

I liked the Schmidt brothers, I was pleasantly surprised by the lack of profanity. Even though this book was written several years ago, it was incredibly relivent to current events.What initially drew me to the book was that it was written about the USS Winston Churchill (DDG81). My son is currently assigned to the USS Roosevelt (DDG80), he thought the book was good and did a good job dipicting life on board ship.It's an easy read, gripping in spots, especially toward the end.

Mmmm, add: too little incentive to care about what happens: everyone's down in M'ia, everyone's hanging around being civil to each other, hop along comes an English nurse (who is not all that funny or clever, the narrator), and then we're supposed to figure out why someone is dead. Poirot is called into the scene late, for those interested. The saving glimmer in this book is a bit closer look into Poirot's own character when he responds to those around him. Christie takes more time with that than she does in some other works, making it a frustrating but nice tidbit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of her better efforts - very very implausible solution","review":"AC's mysteries usually end with readers kicking themselves for not having seen the clues that point to the murderer. In this case, the solution is so far-fetched that it beggars belief. The only redeeming feature is that the murder was committed in a fairly ingenious manner. But all in all, the only kicking you'll be doing is on yourself for having wasted ten bucks and around 4-5 hours of your reading time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Paced, Not Witty, and Implausible Premise","review":"I love everything Agatha wrote (well, more or less), but this book is far from her best. It drags, as other readers have mentioned, and the Christie wit is less pronounced than usual. Worst, the premise is probably her most dubious. Remarry a former spouse and not recognize him? Not likely."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll Figure Out What Happened Before M. Poirot Does","review":"Honestly, I knew with certainty who the killer was before Poirot showed up, on page 76. It was very difficult to anticipate how the murderer did it, because basically that technique wouldn't have worked more than one time in a hundred. And the motive was difficult to figure out, basically because there wasn't one. I bought my copy in an airport transit lounge, and it served the purpose of killing two hours and introducing me to Agatha Christie and to Hercule Poirot.

It was a refreshing change to have such an intelligent, dependable heroine as Poirot's assistant - she almost manages to steal the show from Poirot. I did miss the descriptions of whether or not Poirot was dressed as if he was in London whilst travelling in what was obviously a place with a hot climate - this usually provides for an amusing aside in Poirot books. All in all, an enjoyable read, as guaranteed when one picks up a Christie book and especially when it features the inimitable Hercule Poirot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting There","review":"In spite of its flaws, this is one of Agatha Christie's most unique and memorable books. It is a Poirot mystery, but the book truly belongs to its narrator Nurse Leatheran, a strong female voice. In fact, Poirot doesn't make his appearance until halfway through the book, and when he does it is interesting and amusing to observe his interactions with the nurse.The book does have its flaws, including a lack of character development and the kind of implausible solution one comes to expect from the author; but as with other Agatha Christie novels, the reward is not in the resolution, but in the development. To quote Poirot (from this novel), \\"Bismillahi ar rahman ar rahim. That is the Arab phrase used before starting out on a journey. Eh bien, we too, start on a journey.\\" With Christie, it's not about the destination; it's about the getting there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loeb still a classic","review":"Wyatt's revision of Murray's classic translation updates the English text.

Before you begin reading about Desmond Ruck's adventures, find a comfortable chair because your mind will ignore your body. Like some spiritual master with a bottle of Wharton's, you'll be transported into a new dimension. It's a wheel squealing ride across America's Highway to Heaven.Think the fast pace of the Da Vinci Code, only more intense, as if Hunter S.

The book is recommended and the information provided is not to be ignored if one is to be prepared to stand in the coming days for Christ."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIP OFF!","review":"HORRIBLE!!!Bought a 10-pack and 5/10, literally HALF of the discs were UNFORMATTED and UNUSABLE!

This is one of the worst textbooks I have used however. It is very inconsistent. Some chapters are overly simple and progress too slowly. Others are short, difficult and lack sufficient examples and explanations. The book rarely explains the origins of a formula enough to get a good understanding of its use. Furthermore, there are frequent misprints throughout the text. Unfortunately, most of the people who purchase this book have no choice because it is required for a class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stewart gives the classic tale new life.","review":"This, the latest version of Dickens' \\"A Christmas Carol\\" is superb. All of the actors put in a fine performance, the special effects are extremely well done, and the film makers did a fantastic job of re-creating the look of the era. But even with all this, the film would have been just another \\"pretty good\\" version were it not for Patrick Stewart. Absolutely fantastic performance that elevates the film to the level of greatness. When it comes to acting, Patrick Stewart can do no wrong. I mean you could have two hours of him eating a salami sandwich and it would be oscar worthy. His portrayal of Scrooge is more complicated than just a cartoonish villian who sees the light. The opening scene with Marley's death shows he's got SOME good in him even before the spirits arrive. Trust me folks, this man has the range to play the captain of the Starship Enterprise to a role like this perfectly. Watch this one today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boldly done! Stewart is a Remarkable Scrooge...","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect with Patrick Stewart at the \\"helm\\" of yet another adaptation of the now oft-filmed Dickens classic, but Stewart loyalists will not be surprised at his stellar performance; his theatre background is aptly displayed. Even the slightest movements seem unrehearsed -- he is so fluid -- it's as if he really IS Ebenezer Scrooge. A truly brilliant, classical performance.I also enjoyed the technical aspects of this film -- the ghosts looked very real -- too real for my nerves! And the sets were very well done. Overall, I feel this is worth a buy -- the performances are very, very good and the technology is far more advanced than any other version while still maintaining the purity of the text. You'll definitely want this one in your library of Christmas classics.Cris Cunningham"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most faithful adaptation?","review":"This made-for-television production became the most completely faithful adaptation of Dickens' novella at the time it was made. Many small details, omitted from previous productions, and some renamed characters will be noted as there are virtually no non-Dickensian scenes. This filmed version of A Christmas Carol has excellent production values and some wonderful performances. The roles of The Ghost of Christmas Present, the entire Cratchit family, especially Mrs. Cratchit, and Mr. and Mrs. Fezziwig are particularly well played. This is a particularly faithful adaptation of Dickens' story, leaving practically nothing out and inventing very little as well.

Of all the versions I've seen, this version of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" is my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding rendition of Dicken's classic Christmas tale!","review":"I am a Patrick Stewart fan. From first seeing him in \\"Star Trek The Next Generation\\", I have enjoyed his acting. I heard about 12 years ago that Stewart was doing a one man act of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" and how it received rave reviews. I was very excited to learn that he made a movie of the story. I remember when it was on TBS and I purchased the DVD when it first came out. His acting as Ebenezer Scrooge is one of my favorites. He portrays a coldness that truely makes talking to Scrooge an unpleasant experience. I enjoy the special effects of the movie especially seeing Marley's Ghost in the fireplace tile. The atmosphere of 1840's London is quite accurate as well. All around a fine cast! One of my favorite scenes that I have seen only Patrick Stewart do is when Ebenezer Scrooge finds his laugh again. A great scene! This is HIGHLY Recommended to anyone who enjoys \\"A Christmas Carol\\" and great acting and scenery!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An entertaining version with stunning visuals","review":"Patrick Stewart heads a brilliant cast in this, the most recent film version of Charles Dickens classic story. Taking his interpretation of Scrooge from his one man theatre performance, Stewart brings the character to life among the rest of this well~chosen cast. A well~written script allows each actor to bring the characters to life throughout the story. I hold this production in the same regard as George C.

But I am biased as this is my favorite Chritmas story and so far I like all versions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magic of Christmas","review":"Not many christmas films add that magic of emotion,Patrick Stewart\`s role as Scrooge is an inspired performance.It seems this adaption is true to Dicken\`s novel,an amazing fusion of special effects and christmas wonder to meaningful characters that have universal appeal.We watch this every year and fight back the tears by the end.Merry Christmas everyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A great disappointment after hearing him read the story","review":"I LOVE Patrick Stewart and think he is a wonderful actor. I have seen his one man play of A Christmas Carol four times and enjoyed it immensely. I have given the tapes and CDs of his reading of the story for several years as Christmas gifts. He has a wonderful reading voice! He captures you and puts you into the story. So I looked forward to this movie with great anticipation. I was utterly dismayed at what I saw. It does not live up to the Alistair Simm or George C. Scott versions. The actors seemed to be sleepwalking through the roles, there was no heart or soul.Instead of buying this, I would recommend purchasing the audio CD, settle in with some hot cider and candlelight, and let Patrick Stewarts incredible voice bring the true spirit of Dickens story to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bah humbug!","review":"If you like Patrick Stewart, you'll probably love this version of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" and you won't be happy with this review. If you don't care for Patrick Stewart, you probably wont' like this movie (but you might like the review;)).It is probably unfair for me to review this movie simply because I'm not a Patrick Stewart fan, But I feel that Mr Stewart did not make Ebeneezer Scrooge a real person to me. I didn't feel the emotions that Alistair Sims or George C. Scott brought to the surface with this role. I expected to see Data or Worf show up as one of the Christmas ghosts.Some went on about the special effects, but I didn't feel they were that impressive. The ghosts weren't weren't shadowy enough or perhaps I was put off by Joel Grey being a ghost. It just didn't work for me.I'd advise the George C.

The most overacted, one-dimensional Scrooge imaginable. I always thought the '38 Reginald Owen version was the 'bad' one. Once this one came out, the '38 version doesn't seem so bad anymore.Still, the '51 version with Alastair Sim is the standard, in my humble opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas","review":"One of these items was a Christmas gift.

BAH","review":"I was so looking forward to this version of A Christmas Carol as I am a big fan of Patrick Stewart. We got the audio version of his one-man show a few years ago and thoroughly enjoy it. So, I couldn't wait. That's why I was so disappointed when I finally saw this version. Mr. Stewart sleep-walks his way through the entire production; spitting out his lines just to have them said, with none of the emotion he puts into his theatrical show. I would rate this version just above the Reginald Owen version (which is by far the worst Scrooge ever produced). Sorry, I don't know what movie the rest of you were watching, but it couldn't have been this movie. The only reason I gave it a \\"1-star\\" rating is because a \\"zero-star\\" rating isn't an option. The production as a whole was great, but when the main character is played by an actor that \\"mails-in\\" his performance, the final product can't be anything more than a complete let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad rendition","review":"This would have been a good attempt on stage but the action and directing leave much to be desired for a movie format.

Stewart's dialogue seems so forced--especially when conversing with Marley's ghost. \\"Why...do spirits walk the earth...?\\" Very Shatner-esque. Coincidence?Scott is still the most believable Scrooge and Finney is by far the most entertaining. Unless you're intrigued (in an MST3K kind of way) by B movies and want to watch something much more humorous than it meant to be, save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best version of this movie so far in over 50 years.","review":"It's Captain Jean-Luc Picard starring as Scrooge. I think that says it all about this version. None of the past, present, and future releases can compete with this one. Like all good things Captain Picard can shift between past, present, and future just like Scrooge. Who better to play this role than him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls short","review":"Patrick Stewart is a marvelous actor, comfortable in the role of Scrooge. But for me the film falls flat: a 19th century morality tale told with turn-of-the-21st century sensibility.

Patrick Stewart is an awesome actor and brings power to every performance he does.I think that is why he's the only actor from the Star Trek worlds not type cast. When I see anything he's in I don't think Captain Picard but whatever role he's playing. Now I'm not saying other actors have never been as good as Scrooge, but Steward and Alister Sim in his version are the only two who could make me hate Scrooge but at the same time feel sorry for him, because he is a doomed man, doomed to spend his life in his own misery. Sterward's performance at the end warms your heart also as a man who realizes something wonderful has happened to him, he has a second chance to save himself. Because there are so many versions of this story on film I think people judge them all the same, especially the new ones, but don't pass this one by, it has become a new Christmas tradition in my home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Subtitles are wrong","review":"The movie is great.

My dad can see it despite he loves it because he doesn't speak English nor French! We live in Costa Rica, and none of them are our native languages. The worst thing is that we had already bought this movie twice: first time we assumed it came in Spanish (our mistake), and this time because ADVERTISER LIES!

What gets me is how little respect Warner Bros. pays to the classic films that built their studios. Here you have one of the best films of all time and they release it on a DVD with virtually no extras and a VERY sub-par transfer. From the moment the Warner Bros. logo pops up you can see how unstable the image is...not to mention a large amount of dirt and debris running through every scene. The sound quality isn't much better (I actually had to turn the subtitles on for some of the pivotal scenes).Isn't this film worthy of a restoration? I've run across this same problem a lot with this company's releases.

Vivien Leigh is nothing compared to Marge Simpson, and Marolon Brando just couldn't pull off the same caliber of performance as Ned Flanders.It's your typical delicate-flower-turned-crazy-slut story. And it's jammed packed with poetic moments- one after another after another until you want to smash something- which is what Stanley does."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Streetcar for All Ages!","review":"This is the movie that redefined acting. Marlon Brando gives one of the best performances ever given by any actor in the last century. Vivien Leigh also shines in a particularly difficult and un-likable role. Karl Malden and Kim Hunter are also great. The story and screenplay are memorable, but what leaves the impact are the perfectly-staged scenes between Brando and Leigh, every time Brando is on, the screen explodes. Deffenitely one of the all time greats and a great example of what great ensemble acting can do. See this movie.

The man was a true genius, still is actually. Everyone else who acted in this won an Oscar (that was nominated for one I mean) so why was Brando left out? Who knows...either way, he gave one of his best performances ever in this absolutely brilliant film."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie taught me what real acting was!","review":"I saw this movie during my third year of college. I couldn't even move my eyes from the screen. The dialogue is so incredible, writing such as I have never experienced. It is surpassed only by the phenomenal acting by Leigh, Hunter and Brando, whose other movies I have sought out after seeing Streetcar. No finer picture has ever been brought to the screen, and I doubt one ever will. Tennessee Williams was an incredibly gifted man, and I regret he is not alive today, writing films that would do away with all the high special effected and loosely written scripts that linger over today's box office. A Streetcar Named Desire should be mandatory for all screenwriting classes, to show how a perfect film can be written, directed, produced, acted and edited."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captures the beautiful simplicity of the play","review":"The utter effulgence of Brando's portrayal of the brash, uncouth Stanley was somehow overlooked by the critics. His natural charisma and sexual magnetism is overwhelming. Other than this oversight, the film was richly rewarded with many well deserved Oscars including Best Picture and a Best Actress award for Vivian Leigh's wrenching and pleasingly theatric submission as Blanche. The primative environs of New Orleans set the foreboding mood of the story well."},{"rating":"2","title":"LEIGH AND BRANDO TOGETHER","review":"The casting of Vivien Leigh and Marlon Brando in Tennesee Williams\`A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE remains one of the most legendary pairings in cinema history.

Listening to this album brings to mind riding into battle over vast fields with a broadsword in hand! Excellent album, much better than their more recent stuff. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"BM classic","review":"For All Tid contains all the elements one could expect in a classic black metal album: ferocity, harmony, emotion, contrast, dark atmosphere and speed. Vocals are great here as are the synths."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended Album","review":"For All Tid, Dimmu Borgir's first album, is one of my favorites. The entire CD, written in Norwegian, is full of intriguing melodies. The first track - Det Nye Riket is one of my favorite songs because of the melody played by Stian Aarstad on synthesizers. Shagrath's vocals on this track go so well with the keyboard and I cannot get enough of this song. Track 4, Stien, is another of my favorites because of its unique sounds, drums, guitars, and Silenoz's vocals. This CD is great, I would recommend it to all Black Metal fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a surprise!!","review":"This album resonates with the lo-fi sound of early '90s Black Metal. The production isn't great, but it isn't bad either. I've heard both sides of that argument and have come to the conclusion that this album is like watching a really good low-budget movie that has somehow been forgotten with the passing of time. An underappreciated gem that only needs to be listened to to regain its luster. The first time I heard this album was soon after hearing their masterpiece \\"Enthrone Darkness Triumphant,\\" and I see now that it was not fair of me to do that. But later on I decided to try it out again and was pleasantly surprised. \\"For All Tid\\" reminded me of early Satyricon (see \\"The Shadowthrone\\" and \\"Dark Medieval Times\\") in that the lo-fi production actually added charm to the sound rather than making it sound horrible, like so many other Black Metal bands. All in all, this is worth the money I spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Least Favorite Dimmu Album","review":"This is a very strange album. It's lo-fi in its production and the vocals are well quite bad. The worst thing about the album however is just how disjointed it feels. Some of the tracks are just outright pointless. There are some good tracks on here though such as Hunnerkongens and Raabjorn. Overall though this album is recommended for diehard Dimmu fans only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful \\"Black\\" metal..","review":"This album is horrible. The vocals are terrible,and these clowns couldn't play their instruments to save their lives...i dunno why these GEEKS are so popular when there are bands like Aeternus, Emperor and Pagan Hellfire around. Garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good film about life on the mean streets of South Boston","review":"This is a pretty good film about South Boston. It shows the mean streets of Southie and the gangsters who inhabit them realistically. The story centers around the vicious Irish gangs that run the neighboorhoods, and how (unlike thier laughable Italian counterparts)the Irish mob is a truly dangerous and brutal group of people. The film is also a great showpiece for Whalberg and McGowan, both of whom are great in the fil. The director John Shea is pretty impressive here, and we need more Irish-American filmakers to aspire to the level of excellence shown by the great Scorsesse."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great film!","review":"This film is an excellent portrail of an Irish-working class family.

Forgetting any factual references and judging this movie solely on it's cinematic merit, well, it's pitiful! Wahlburg (sp?) does nothing but scowl the entire time with his friar tuck haircut and I almost break out in hysterical laughter with the Irish mob who hang in the underground dwellings in their leather jackets, turtlenecks, and scally caps. This is pure trash all the way from start to finish with Rose McGowan acting as if this were her first role...what a pathetic performance. Please, save yourself.......don't get this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The toughest thing about South Boston is coming back","review":"Moody and intense 90s indie with Donnie Wahlberg cast as Danny Quinn, an Irishman returning home to Southie after taking time away to get himself together. What he finds is that his sister (perfectly-cast Rose McGowan) has become an alcoholic, one of his brothers owes money to a local mob boss, and his mother's health is deteriorating. Not a bad outing for director John Shea using what he can with a low production to capture that profane, drunken, and violent environment that a certain underbelly of the neighborhood has always been known for. Lawrence Tierney as an old Southie crime boss and Anne Meara as the Quinn mom give strong performances as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Indian craft book","review":"This is a great book. Heavily illustrated. It shows how American Indians made arrows, axes, baskets, and just about everything else. The diagrams are detailed enough to look like the items could be reproduced, but I have not tried any yet. A simple doll made from Cattails would be easy to do. More complex projects like arrows or baskets would need some practice. Historic fact are also included. If you are interested in how the first Americans lived, or primitive survival methods this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad case...","review":"The front panel of the case is molded EVA, and provides a sturdy padded frame for the GBA to nest in. It fits very nicely. Instruction manuals also fit well into the same pocket as the GBA unit. The back panel has an elastic mesh pocket that can easily hold a half dozen or so GBA game cartridges. To keep it fairly compact, there isn't much room for extra items such as batteries, worm light, game link, etc, but this doesn't bother me much at all. I like to keep it simple (and batteries don't need to be changed that frequently).I recommend this case to get you through the day, not to try and stow all of your gear. For that, you'll need something a bit larger, and less portable."},{"rating":"1","title":"(...)","review":"Do not buy this. i did it is a waste of money. it doesnt even hold my 2 games.

Both the Bellerophon and Anteia seem to lack power to propel their destenies forward. Bellerophon lacks not only the courage, but the spunk of a hero of his age group. Anteia seems too passive to resist her arranged marriage to King Proteus, and even too passive to express her feelings (if any) towards the hero. Bernard Evslin attempts to write this as the first fairytale, with the hero, the dragon and the Damsel in Distress. These cliche seems tiresome and if placed in the context of the classics, stale by a thousand years. When the hero exclaims \\"To Claim my prize, the fairest Anteia\\" One can only remember Princess Jasmine's line \\"I am not a prize to be won\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Really enjoyed this","review":"We watched this movie on television this weekend.

That made this a good purchase for me because it had many songs from a broad time frame. I think all the songs on here are at least good and some are great.I might be a neophyte here but I really think the live version of \\"Born In Time\\" is outstanding and is worth the price of this CD by itself. That version just shows what a great performer Bob Dylan is. I only wish the CD was a bit cheaper.Finally I hope one day Dylan releases many more of his complete live concerts like the Dead or Pearl Jam have, particularly after reading Paul Williams 3rd Dylan book because it sounds like Dylan was doing much of his creating on stage in the 70's & 80's as opposed to in the studio.

Pick the ones you really like and buy either the Image Entertainment versions (beautiful crisp prints and excellent no-hiss sound) or wait a few months to buy the new Legend Film releases (remastered B&W prints and Colorized versions on one CD).

There were a few hints of potential plot to come involving Suze and Paul's powers, but that angle wasn't nearly explored enough.Verdict: wait for the paperback, or skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible book","review":"Even though I haven't read the other books in the series, I was kind of let down.

I own All-American Girl, the entire Princess Diaries series, the entire Mediator series, and if I wasn't a broke college student, I would own all of the 1-800-Where-R-You series.

Im so excited about getting the next one... its hard not to!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunted Book Review","review":"The suspenseful romance novel, Haunted, written by Meg Cabot keeps the attention of the readers. The main character, Suze Simon, has the ability to talk to the living and the dead. Suze takes on the name mediator and later learns that she's a shifter. A shifter can go to the dead world and back again.Haunted becomes interesting because of the romance and confusion. Suze ends up in love with a dead guy from the 1800's. It becomes more confusing when Paul, the guy who tried killing Suze and haunts her every night when she goes to sleep, starts to like her. So what happens to a girl who loves a dead man and then becomes liked by the guy who tried to kill her? Read it and find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG I loved this book! @--->----","review":"OMG i started reading this book @ 3pm and ended @ 11:30 pm (I couldn't put it down) I stayed up later then that thinking about. This book has Suze (THE MEDIATOR)wondering what Jesse's (the HOTTIE latino ghost)feelings are for her, one moment he is calling her querdia (dearest on, in spanish) and the next he is ingnoring her. Plus Paul's(a HOTTIE who can also talk 2 ghosts) back in the picture and he knows how to take Jesse away from Suze. This book takes you on twists and turns is my favorite so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"awsome!","review":"Meg Cabot is an awesome author!

So I just jumped in I guess in the middle of a big plot. While the book was thoroughly interesting and keep my attention, I do not recommend this book to those who have not read the others. I do recommend All American Girl and Princess Diaries (the full set). Meg Cabot is a truly great writer, but this book I felt lacked a lot of her more creative plots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jesse, Paul, Father Dom (jk) Which One?","review":"Paul's back Father Dom is still is around but the real question is what happens after that kiss with Jesse.

So many things happened you just won't know what to expect next"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good book","review":"I enjoyed 'Haunted' very much. It was a great paced and interesting book. Simon, the main charicture, seemed very realistic and I liked her style. She's not shy but dosen't have a blue whale for an ego. Simon is smart, pretty and has a strange but totally awsome job. She is a begining mediator who helps stuck souls pass on. I would love to be able to talk and see ghost too.The best part of the book would have to be the ending. Though Simon shouldn't be she is in love with a trapt soul named Jesse. He is a charming and smart guy from the 1800s. Jesse had been murder in his room which is now Simons. She has tryed to help him remember what is keeping him back but he dosen't know. At the end he finally admites he loves her too.The conflict would have to be the most vivid part of the book. The big problem is Paul, Jesse and Simons enemy, wants Simon.

There is absolutely no label on the bottle (which is the case) but the the cap carried no label either). refrain from buying perfumes with no label. they are very easy to imitate.

The scent I received was weak and not the fragrance as fully developed as I am accustomed to. I expressed my concern about the shelf life of the product I received. The vendor assured me that they receive shipments routinely from L'Oreal (??) and there was not a problem with shelf life, further suggesting that I compare the product they shipped with a similar product in my local department store, offering a refund if I was still dissatisfied and returned their shipped parfum. In fact, I did that. There was a substantial difference...and I was careful to be comparing with the Eau de Parfum, not the parfum . At that point, I decided it was not worth the time and inconvenience to return my bottle. I will just consider it a lesson learned about reduced priced perfumes.

It really grows on you as well, sounds better each time I listen to it. It definitely is one of these albums that you have to take your time and listen through, but if you do take the time, you will love it. I has seen a very strong review of the album in Performing Songwriter which is a very credible musicians/songwriters publication and they are usually very tough on new artists, but they gave her an 'A'!! and in the same issue they gave the recent Annie Lennox album that people were raving about a 'B'..so people who know what they are talking about love it as well. Her style is laid-back and subtle, but once you get it, the whole thing is superb. Every review that I have seen by respected publications like USA Today, LA Times etc have also been very strong. I consider it one of the bext albums of the last couple of years."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums I have heard in a long while","review":"this album is absolutely one of the best I have heard for years. its interesting, its one of those records like a norah jones or sade that people either hate or love, but i love it. i think you have to really chill and listen to it, but it is really deep lyrically and musically. i don't think it should be compared to an amel larrieux or goapele, those albums are much more 'trying to be hip and cool' (which they do well, i am like amel, she is great too), but i think this is way more of a classic album than anything those artists can do. its not for everyone, but in my experience really great artists are very loved or disliked, there is no in between and its the same with ms benson. highly recommended by me and i have seen great reviews in numerous publications that say exactly the same thing"},{"rating":"2","title":"soothing music from a beautiful woman","review":"after picking up this album only to put it back on several occasions,i finally picked it up last night,and boy am i ever glad i did.this is another wonderful collection of neo-classic soul.this young lady has been compared to sade,but that's an injustice,because while their styles are similar,her sound is unmistakeable.ever since the first time i heard \\"say how i feel\\",i've been blown away by rhian.when i saw the video \\"stealing my peace of mind\\"i knew that this was a collection i would have to invest in.this is candelight music,it's something i'll listen to to wind down at the end of a hectic day,or to calm my nerves when i'm angry.i wish rhian continued success,and i hope she'll continue to make good music for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointing","review":"the ideal of a singer like Rhian Benson is much better than the actual reality. The album's lead single just happens to be the best song. I looked at the credits and saw the likes of James Poyser and the rest of the Axis music guys on deck for the music, and thought for sure this was going to be a great cd. I was more wrong than I could have imagined. Poyser puts out arguably some of his least inspiring music to date (get back with the Soulquarians James!), as the music is downright uninspiring. Rhian seems to have a decent voice, but her vocals are more spoken word than soulful displays of beauty. The potential is all there, but the execution leaves much to be desired."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST THINGS ABOUT THIS CD ARE...","review":"...the music and the jacket. The music is great to cool out with, and the cover art is easy on the eyes. The vocal performances, however, are uninspiring and do not add anything to the instrumentation provided by the musicians.It seems these days that anyone with looks and the right kind of marketing can be a star. How this artist was able to get a recording contract on the strength of her vocal performance is a puzzler.Nevertheless, the music on this CD is delightful to listen to. Just be sure not to pay attention to the vocals."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Gonna Say How I Feel","review":"\\"Say How I Feel\\" is one of my top favorite songs of 2005. It has a jazzy mid-1990s feel to it. But seriously, this woman can't really sing. She's off key and mostly talks. I have to give her credit though. She can play a few instruments and write a few good songs, but she needs to step up her game. If all of the songs on \\"Gold Coast\\" were like \\"Say How I Feel,\\" then it would've been a classic. Other than that, I'm not feeling this CD. Her vocals just mess it up. Better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I REALLY tried to like this album....but, no dice","review":"This album is a prime example of having great music combined with weak, childlike songwritting. It infuriates me when you have great producers like James Poyser and the legendary Bob Power create instant magic with thier music and have an unknown singer singlehandedly soil the fabric of that magic. This album is so bad that I had to desperatley find a reason to not slit my writs after reaching the end of the album. And what gives with the missing 13th track on the CD?Rhian's voice is too heavy and overcompensates the melodic sound on this album. She may be easy on the eyes, but looks go a long way when it balls down to talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talent, Beauty and Brains","review":"Some packages seem just too good to be true. Rhian Benson was an articulate and well educated woman (MBA) before she embarked on her musical career. So, she is able to control her musical destiny far more seriously than most artists. She is drop-dead gorgeous and her voice has a sultry quality. It's unfortunate to often hear her compared as \\"just another Nora Jones\\", when Rhian Benson's depth and intensity frankly put Jones down a notch. Benson wrote all of the songs on this debut CD which is amazing as many new artists don't dare (I was shocked to note that Nora Jones scarcely writes any of her own material, as lovely as her voice is). Ladies, listen well to Benson's lyrics on her track \\"Invincible\\". Well worth the buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely amazing!!","review":"I love this album. I have had the pleasure of seeing Rhian perform twice in LA and I was very impressed each time. To describe what this album does to me would be too difficult, but suffice it to say it REALLY moves me. Rhian's lush vocals adorn beautifully arranged tracks that transport you to a land where the bittersweet becomes the beautiful. My faves are \\"Sing to the Child\\", \\"Young Girl\\", \\"I'm in a Bind\\" and \\"Invincible\\". The music is richly organic and I kick back to it when I'm stressed out. Thank you Rhian for bringing your wonderful spirit into my life, I need it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gold Coast - A wonderful start","review":"This album has such an amazing feel and vibe, it took me away on a musical journey.

Congratulations to all the musicians who made this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Album","review":"If your only frame of reference is hip/hop then this album is not for you. If you prefer football stadium concerts as opposed to intimate jazz club performances then the album is probably not for you either.But If you love jazz, appreciate someone who can actually sing, and musicians who actually play instruments, then you will love this album. I like all of the songs very much, but my very favorite is \\"say how I feel\\". I just wish the CD were an enhanced one that had the video on it.Listening to Rhian is very soothing for me, and being a woman I very much appreciate the message in her songs. If I am lucky she will come to town so I can hear a live performance. I very much look forward to following her career and buying more of her music."},{"rating":"2","title":"RHIAN AT HER BEST","review":"I am surprise Rhian Benson never had more commercial success.

Also, the cadence of several of the recordings doesn't match the earlier recordings (and the changes are for the worse). I must wonder if the recordings on this CD were mastered from MP3 (or AAC Apple) downloads and then run through an audio enhancement program in an attempt to compensate for all the information (i.e., quality) lost when using these (and all other) compression codecs (Note: normal/commercial quality CDs use AIFF encoding and this encoding loses far less information/quality) .

The script captures that elusive \\"sense of place\\" that all the critics talk about when discussing the South - crazy relatives, old friends with haunted pasts, the importance of food and other types of sustenance. The plot revolves around wacky personalities, old wounds, and unplanned events, and even though the characters frequently despair, the show ends on a hopeful note.As with most plays, it's better to watch Crimes of the Heart than to read it, but I admit that I laughed out loud when I read some of the scenes.

I will say that this disk IS better than ATTAK. I had always assumed for some reason that my loyalties lay with Sascha K.(after the big breakup), following him from KMFDM to MDFMK and back, but after hearing Slick Idiot, I had an epiphany and have to say that the compelling element that ran through the old KMFDM, must have come from En Esch. KMFDM and MDFMK, while always kickin' ass, always left me wanting. The architecture of each song was always a great thrashing lick coupled with absolute and disruptive choad. Slick Idiot's songs are more homogenous in their creativity and construction. There are only a few songs in this world that I would say have a feeling of completeness - as in nothing that I hear and say \\"Man, I could have done without that!!\\" Slick Idiot has several of these included in this great Industrial offering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slick Idiot, an impressive follow up to KMFDM","review":"Ex-KMFDM members En Esch and Gunter Schulz have created a new band that resembles KMFDM more than MDFMK did.

En Esch does most of the vocals except for women doing back-up, a few words from Gunter, and even some guy rapping. I wasn't too crazy about the rapping but the chorus of the song ( titled \\"lazy\\" ) saves it.I am extremely happy with this album and I find myself thinking that it's just another KMFDM record.

It actually recalls the old school KMFDM vibe, with big beats, great riffs, and En Esch snarling away in prime form. Definitely a rocking CD, great for parties and driving around. There are also a bunch of not only tight songs sonically, but the songwriting has been upped greatly from some of the standard KMFDM fare, and there are some great tunes which should hit college radio hard. Definitely buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well they got the Idiot part right.","review":"How about naming this \\"Cheesy: Redux\\". The only thing consistent here is the guitar work by Schulz, although it tends to be quite repetitive. This album really sounds like a compilation of the most boring KMFDM songs set to a disco beat. En Esch shouldn't have been selling all of his equipment on Ebay. Putting it to work on this album may have changed this reviewer's opinion of DickNity.I'd say if you are an obsessive compulsive KMFDM collector you might want this in your collection, at least for an interesting coaster. Try Esch's work in Pigface for a true taste of his mildly stimulating talent. You know what would make DickNity better? ...Sascha Konietzko and Raymond Watts.If you were exceedingly bored this summer you may have caught the Slick Idiot tour and the resulting covers of \\"Godlike\\" and \\"A Drug Against War\\", by far the best KMFDM songs ever performed by a band other than KMFDM."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm blown away!!!!!","review":"Slick Idiot was founded by former KMFDM members Guenter Schulz and En Esch. You gotta check them out. This is like listening to KMFDM on crack or something, it's just super groovy...

Guenter's guitar work is great as usuall, great bone-crunching riffs and inovative licks. I especially like the trashy female vocals on this album; they sound like something out of Thrill Kill Kult's \\"Sexplosion\\"-- another plus in my book. Overall this is excellent. Don't expect to hear a clone of KMFDM, they're similar but not that similar: Slick Idiot kind of sounds like a cross between Thrill Kill Kult and KMFDM.

They would be read, but they would be shunned in congregational fellowship as 'too controversial' or 'too blunt', or even the oftsaid 'unloving'.Modern Calvinists are too accepting of Wesley andother Arminians. Toplady is not.Give me the old guys. The moderns are either too ignorant or tooafraid to preach it like it is.

The answering machine sounded very poor with a tinny sound that distorted the voices. The speaker on the base is small and the voices sound un-natural. Our recorded outgoing announcement sounded weak and cheap. The phone had an echo periodically which the callers on the other end of the line did not hear but was annoying to us using the phone. The only positive was the speaker phone on the handset which did sound good.

It does however come with and attractive slipcover and a convenient recharging cradle and \\"syncing\\" cradle all in one. And (a bonus and probably one star worth) the software that comes with it is exceptional. However the small size which to some might be convenient; to me it feels almost to light and to small but it fits anywhere you would like to place it (which is a plus for this product).

It can do everything the more expensive Pocket PCs can do at less than half the cost -- and IT'S SMALL. This guy rivals the size of the Palm V. There is no sense in spending over $400 on a Pocket PC you aren't going to want to carry around in your pocket.

It's unfortunate that this PDA is not as widely distributed other PDA units. Syncing is seemless and easy. The ability to view/edit Word and Excel files is a definite plus. The transcriber handwriting recognition program enables you to write ANYWHERE on screen as if it were a true notepad --not a 1 inch Palm text box. Purchase a memory card and you have a seemless, portable hard drive for MP3s or large email attachments. Use Microsoft money for all your finances. The OS is Microsoft Pocket PC and let's face it, it's only a matter of time before Bill Gates and the boys destroy competitors (Palm, Visor) and gain marketshare to become the dominant PDA OS software on the market (anyone remember Word Perfect). It wouldn't suprise me to soon see the extinction of the traveling business man with a laptop-- a Pocket PC PDA will soon do all the tricks.

In the first chapter of this drab tale I immediately found a discrepancy. First she examines a small enamel box at the antique shop and then two pages later or whatever it was he wraps up a procelain box for her.I found Rose EXTREMELY irritating right from the start and I wondered \\"why am I reading this\\". Infact, I stuck it out and found at the end that the only person I felt sorry for was, now what was his name????? Anyway, the guy who Eleanor and Rose are interested in. I think he was extremely DUMB to go ahead with the wedding and when he finally came out of the trenches he should have packed his bag when she was indisposed and left. My personal feeling is that Rose was ticked off when he was MIA because it made her look bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reach Beyond the Tea for the Truth.","review":"This is a wonderfully written story that easily keeps a devoted reader glued to a seat until the reading is finished. It takes an educated person to truly appreciate the intelligence of the written word. The words were chosen so perfectly to present a difficult era and display such difficult emotions. It is a book for men and a book for women. It is a mystery and a romance...a historical lesson and lessons in design. It has women's lib and women's desires. It has it all. It all starts with the life saving cup of tea which also symbolizes friendship and peace. The reader is reminded of that cup of tea throughout the novel. Something so insignificant yet so earthshaking. This novel takes the reader through so much life and love. It is endearing and stays in the mind of the beholder as tea leaves hug the cup that they once flavored. Wonderful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite story poorly written and edited","review":"This was profoundly disappointing. The premise is hackneyed, the story is predictable, and the ending is almostlaughably melodramatic. While it's a quick read (because many of the chapters are two pages long or less, as if each werewritten in a hurry), it still felt like a waste of time. It isn't even up to the standards of cheap romance novels; at leastthose strive to be entertaining. This book seems listless, as if the author was so bored by her own characters that she justwanted to get the story written as quickly as possible. Presumably the editor was in a hurry, too; the text has the sloppiestediting I've ever come across. The usage and grammar are awkward (a character \\"sort of vaguely\\" makes a gesture); the punctuation is annoyingly haphazard. If neither the author nor the editor care enough to put a minimal amount of effort intothe book, you shouldn't put any effort into reading it, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This seemed like a quaint, interesting book to read by the jacket. I was drawn to the time period and the alleged rich descriptions. I was sorely disappointed. This was something someone might have written for 12th grade creative writing.

Definitely skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"I couldn't wait to finish this book only because it was so dreadful and I always finish what I start.

While Eleanor is present, Jane stops by to see Rosemary as well as Rose's fiancee Philip. Philip takes quite a shine to Eleanor and there the tale begins."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't believe the glowing reviews","review":"The problem with the book is that Ms. Ephron does not know how to develop characters the way a writer in 1917 would.

Each chapter flows with a sophisticated elegance. The characters are wonderfully sculpted, from the popular war hero to the mysterious beautiful woman. Ephron does an incredible job of depicting the feel of life during 1917. It was truly a heart warming story that engulfed you and let you escape from the harshness of life today.

I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY disappointing -- AWFUL book","review":"The reason for 2 stars (instead of NEGATIVE 2!, which is basically what it deserves) is because it WAS a page-turner for me (although at one point, I had predicted the ending!)This book was a quick read (which I like), but the ending was terrible. I think this woman was hoping this book would be made into a cheesy tv mini-series. How it got published is beyond me (but a good guess would be because of her sister's connections).I had read \\"One Sunday Morning\\" before this, and although the ending of that one was a major disappointment as well, this book has turned me off to reading any more of her books.Waste of time for me.

Her grammar is awful; many details of the period are simply wrong; the colloquialisms (Philip tells Eleanor he's having \\"flashbacks\\") and manners far too modern (respectable women did not enter bars alone in 1917; Ephron has Eleanor going to a bar by herself and downing a whiskey and soda) and even the few tidbits she provides about New York are inaccurate (Dora's is on Sutter Street --- there is no such street in NY; in 1917 the theatre district was on 14th Street, not in the 40's the way it is today).

Otherwise, this could very well be the tale of a home wrecker in the 21st century. I finished this \\"book\\" in less than an hour, so its brevity is really its only redeeming quality. In a nutshell, a well-to-do woman brings home a beautiful, but penniless, woman to give her some food. Not surprisingly, in one glance the husband to be is lovestruck by this new woman. From there the book drags on with unfelt tension as two lovebirds we don't care about play at their deception.I note that this book comes with a \\"reading group discussion\\" section at its conclusion. In my opinion, any book that requires instruction about good points to talk about is not a book that is very good.

They are still great albums but they do not hold the level of brutality, technicality, and melodic grooves that Whoracle hosts with songs like \\"Jotun\\" and \\"The Hive\\" allow for pure musical ecstacy.

After listening to every track on the CD, my jaw was stuck wide open.Some of the tracks that stand out are \\"Jotun,\\" \\"Dialogue With The Stars,\\" \\"The Hive,\\" \\"Episode 666,\\" and \\"Jester Script Transfigured.\\" But besides that, even every other song is good.I definitely recommend getting this album, even if you are only a casual fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Real metal treat if you like growly vocals","review":"Listening to this album I am torn two ways.

I bought it after hearing Jotun which remains my favorite In Flames song so far. However, it took me a while to get used to the screaming vocals, and to this day I'm still not crazy about them, they can really ruin some absolutley wonderful songs. However, some songs (Episode 666) they add a dynamic flare that makes you smile. Overall this is one of my all-time favorite cds, having a perfect balance of beautiful guitars and bone-crunching vocals. The drums get very annoying, he does nothing of interest throughout their cds which dissapoints me since i am a drummer myself.

I matched these up with the Onkyo SR805, and boy does everything sound great. Stop shopping around. I was initially sent a malfunctioning subwoofer, I emailed C.A. and they sent me a new one for no charge, even let me keep the old one to try and get fixed at a local shop! have fun with this system! -Graham"},{"rating":"1","title":"$50 that I will never see again","review":"I agree that the slick, detailed pieces and beautifully made map are a nice touch. In fact, these points alone almost hooked me and obviously hooked most of the above reviewers. I badly wanted this game to play as well as it looked. My question is, where is the game? I enjoy a game that is well balanced and can be won from different sides using different strategies. In this game, but for the Grace of God, or an absolutely incompetant Allied player, Germany is absolutely lost. Your best chance is to power your way into Moscow and this victory is entirely dependant upon good die rolls. I prefer a game that allows clever tactics myself. All things being equal, you might as well throw dice in the beginning to determine the outcome and save yourself the time it would take to play this inane game. As for the repeated allegations that this or its sister game in the Pacific are historically accurate, believe me when I tell you categorically that it is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the pieces ?","review":"This game for me is un-playable. Unlike the original, this game does not come with the necessary amount of pieces to even set the game up. Germany, for example, does not even have enough soldiers to put one in each of it's territories, thus they cannot start the game. How can you play this ? Sure, you can use the substitute chips, but then how do you know later on if they are supposed to be soldiers, troops, tanks, or airplanes? It would be indistinguishable. I was extremely upset when I opened this and tried to play my first game. Don't waste your money on this, buy the original Axis & Allies instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"The black Beethoven's from the nineties!","review":"If you don't like metal,or never heard of Black Metal before,then i recommend you to Buy this cd and listen...(black)angels are drooooooling in your ears. Bombastic,melodic,agressive,gothic,whatever.....Excellent!!! Your Dimmu-ceedee will stay a very long time in that player,believe me! A Pixies(and Black Metal from now on)-fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, though Spiritual is more mature","review":"I loved Spiritual Black Dimensions, and so then logical thing was to buy Enthroned..First of all, I love the name of the album. I like the overall feel of the album, great keyboards with harsh guitars, with rasping vocals. Mourning Palace is an excellent opener. Other good songs are Spellbound, The Nights Masquerade, Tormentor, and Entrance.However, parts of the album tend to get a bit repetitive and the initial fascination wears fast. This did not happen with Spiritual Black Dimensions, which is highly recommended.The only element in which Enthrone scores over Spiritual is the guitar work, which is neater, while in Spiritual it sounds more like background noise. Spiritual has better keyboard bits, though.OVerall, if you liked Spiritual, you will like this. Also in a different vein, try early Tiamat, Moonspell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Black Metal band ever","review":"Third album from the best Black Metal band (In my opinion.) Although some people disagree, Dimmu Borgir plays Black Metal. Enthrone Darkness triumphant was the first Black Metal album I bought and is still one of my favourite albums of all-time. On the album there are classic Dimmu Borgir tracks like Mourning Palace and In Death's Embrace. Enthrone Darkness Triumphant is not fully Black Metal. There are also other Metal influences. Occasionally the guitarist plays Heavy Metal and Thrash Metal riffs. The keyboard player plays a lot of classical piano parts, which gives it a Gothic/Classic vibe. The vocals sound raw in the traditional Black Metal way. Although more recent albums of Dimmu Borgir show improved writing compatibles, I still think that Enthrone Darkness Triumphant is their best album. I can recommend this album to anyone who appreciates diverse symphonic Black Metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally bought it","review":"Phew today was a hot day, but going into town was sure worth it! It all started a month ago when I was listening to 'Another Black Metal Station' on shoutcast, and after 30 mins of sleepy coding, I instantly waked up when they were playing In Death's Embrace. I loved it! (thank you Shoutcast!) So I immediatly placed a couple of Dimmu requests on their site and spent some time listening. After that I went searching for albums, I first bought Puritanical Euphoric Misantrophia, and now ETD.This is without doubt the best black metal I've ever listened to. Every song is unique, and you can hear they know what they're doing. It still amazed me it was so hard to find DB cd's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I'm not much of a black metal listener, so i don't know of many bands to compare this with, but this album has to be completely overrated. Must admit the first 3 songs are great, but if only the rest of the album could have been as consistent then this could have lived up to the hype. I guess i'm a bit spoiled since I started listening to this genre through Emperor. I'm still trying to find an album in the same league as nightside eclipse, but i guess i never will. I'll just collect all Emperor cd's and dismiss the rest as garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great CD, but not for softies","review":"I listened to 'Enthrone Darkness' and i think this CD is the best Dimmu CD so far! It's pretty loud, but sometimes it sounds a bit the same. But still, it's a great band with wonderful keyboards and vocals. Especially 'Mourning palace' and the hidden track ( i thought it was called 'Raabjorn speller') are beautiful songs with feeling, although the singer isn't a Peter Gabriel or a Neil Diamond...thank god! For me the Dimmu Borgir singer is absolutely the best male in the black metal scene! Hail Satan, Zaydir and don't forget their home-based-band from hell!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too noisy, no particular guitar talent","review":"There's not enough musical talent in this group.It seems the vocals have a surronding treatment and it's so dark you may think it's a joke. Imagine someone who has never listened to dark metal listening to this. He'd just laugh at you and would give you back the CD saying \\"I'm very sorry for you if you listen to this\\". But that wouldn't be the case if there were good musical stuff to be heard : some guitar solos for example. But there are only synthesisers. And the vocals are just the same from begin to end, which make the songs almost unrecognizable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dimmu Borgir's best album!","review":"In 1997 Dimmu Borgir released their third and best album \\"Enthrone Darkness Triumphant\\". This is the album where everything came together and started working for this band. This was their major label debut (they weren't mainstream by any means though) and the first album to have lyrics in English rather than Norweigen like their first two albums. Don't get me wrong, I liked their debut \\"For All Tid\\" although I was disappointed with their sophomore album \\"Stormblast\\". To have the lyrics in English was a good thing in my opinion. Also the production quality is actually good this time and that was the best improvement on this album because their first two albums had terrible production quality. The musicianship is also awesome. I really don't have a favorite song on this album yet though. I think I'll take \\"In Death's Embrace\\" as my favorite Dimmu Borgir song. Great stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's all about the Satan","review":"Evil flows thoughout this album, and Satan's majesty and power are revealed. The only small flaw in this record is the fact that the Dark One and anti-Christianity is bascially the focus of the entire record. A song title like Tormenter Of Christian Souls and the lyrics is just overdoing it. However, what's great about this album is the shift from the chaotic to the more atmoshperic slower songs. Mourning Palace and Spellbound (By The Devil) start the album off fast, but then slows down with In Death's Embrace, which sees great use of Mustis' talents."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good CD","review":"This is a great Dimmu Borgir CD. This is (in my opinion) when they started to lose the black metal sound. If you look at them today they really aren't black metal... more power metal. Nontheless, this has some excellent guitar work on it- very melodic keyboards and some of the best drumming available these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"black metal for dummies","review":"This is the kind of stuff that gives black metal a bad name. Dummy Burger is a mockery of the genre, and everything is stands for. The music is repetitive and boring, and the keyboards are embarassing. No one seems to realize that the band's \\"image\\" is only mocking the listener. Dummy Burger was rejected by the black metal scene and now they feel they must make fun of it. Go and listen to Dark Throne or Graveland."},{"rating":"1","title":"These guys are such dorks.","review":"My banner headline says it all. The name of the album doesn't even make any sense. If you don't believe me, just listen to the ridiculous keyboard and organ effects on \\"Spellbound (by the devil)\\", as well as all the other tracks for comic relief. You'll find that to be their only merit."},{"rating":"1","title":"..........","review":"I'd give 5 stars for musicality but after reading some of their lyrics I changed my mind. Someone who writes a song like, \\"Tormetor of Christian Souls\\" are whatever the hell it's called needs therapy. They won't be calling for \\"Satan My Master\\" when they're burning in hell for all eternity. It's ashame satan won't be there to save them..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dummy Burger...","review":"UGH! These guys are exactly like CoF and Wimperor, their ONLY here to annoy! The keybpards are extremely cheesy, and the whole piano/synth thing is totally wimpy, I can't believe that people actually like when bands incorprate these things in the music, especially when they are overused, I guess It's ok if it's only for a little while, but NOT when they over do it like Dummy BUrger. Black metal is guitars & Hatred, not stupid cartoon jingles! Bands like this is what gives BM a bad name... Dimmu, care nothing for ideoolgy, they're only doing this to feed their rock-star egos! Commercialism has NO place in the realm of black MetaL! Go & listen to Thornspawn & Blood Storm, or some Impiety! That's all for now, thank You!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"The only thing that makes this music sound heavy and fast is the double bass. To David who said SLIPKNOT is for kids, slipknot screams louder and clearer and plays heavier and faster. Check the instrument tabs, yu'll see for yourself. The low growl has to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not Great","review":"This is Dimmu Borgir's first english language ablum. Although it is not as unique as their previous two (\\"For All Tid\\" and \\"Stormblast\\"), it is nonetheless very melodic and the use of keyboards is very prominent. This time the music is less melancholic: rather than playing music dominated by emotions, this music is instead dominated by sweeping layers of melodies. It is perhaps a step below \\"For All Tid\\" in terms of originality and emotional content, and its sound more closely resembles that other black metal bands than its previous two albums had. This is still a worthy purchase for any fan of black metal, but it is not of quite the same calibur as \\"For All Tid\\". At least, though, the production on this ablum is rather good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dimmu borgir, is so... So good !","review":"I realy enjoy this band's lirycs,sound, and, originality because thats what makes a solid blackmetal band !

When I first bought this book, I found some of these dharanas were very easy; others I found obscure. The deeper my practice has gone the more I learn.The key is to absorb the dharanas (centering techniques) that are obvious. Over time, as one's yogic study deepens, many of the others will become apparent. The Vijnana-bhairava was written as the original home-study, Self-study course revealed by Bhairava (God). The practice of any tantric technique is by it's very nature done by oneself as each of our relationships to the Divine is a personal affair.The amazing thing that this book conveys is a deep understanding of how we can find our connection with the Divine in our moment to moment existence.

In this day and age, the average child is inundated with such an enormous quantity and variety of media advertising and material goods that it's unlikely he or she will form a strong attachment to any one thing for very long. My niece is unlikely to be as devoted to this little bunny as was the little boy in the children's story \\"The Velveteen Rabbit.\\" This little stuffed bunny probably won't hold my niece's interest for more than a few months.

I do not like the Searchers, North to Alaska, True Grit.----------------------------------What is a western movie? You need actions and fast pace. You do not get any from this movie. There is not much plot. The pace is very slow. The old man is near retiring and it is very boring. The girl theme (Olivia Dandridge) is not entertaining. There is not much to say, just not a fan of it at all. Really boring.It is no comparison to High Noon, Hombre, Man of the West. For Indian Western, Broken Arrow is much better.

In it John Wayne struggles to come to terms with his military retirement, and decides to stay in the Army in the end. Overall, I enjoyed the movie - the scenary is awesome, and the dialogue is rather clever. The one key ingredient that it lacks to be considered a classic is a lot of action.

My lovely wife would rather do needlepoint than watch Westerns, so we won't share her thoughts here. All in all, the Wide-screen transfer was fantastically done, the panoramas shot in Monument Valley are some of John Ford's best stuff cinematically. Would have really suffered if it had been done in black and white. The color is exceptional.

While they arrived intact, they were very dusty, the boxes they came in were crushed and not useable to include in the gifting and the interior was badly scratched. They almost seemed used, not new.

The main stumbling block is the translation by MacKenna which reads majestically, but which is not as faithful to the text as it should be. If you are studying Plotinus as a philosopher then the best translation is the Armstrong in the Loeb series. However, that edition runs to seven volumes in hardback and thus is quite expensive. I must admit that I really do enjoy the MacKenna translation as art but not as philosophy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obscure but revealing as to Neo-Platonism","review":"Provides some thoughtful comments on the concepts of the good and the beautiful. Some insightful thoughts are provided as to perceiving what we truly are as a person (soul) with the focus on improvement. As the soul was an important aspect of early theological thought Plotinus can't leave the subject alone. He works the concept of soul to the point of ascribing a soul to the planets, stars and anything else that moves. One can see why ancient and modern metaphysics has had such a problem escaping from this long held tradition.Unless interested in the development of Plato's teachings and the impact upon later theological philosophy this book does not provide much worthwhile to the modern reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"must read...","review":"I read first read this book when I was 18 years old. Looking back, I was very fortunate that it was required reading in my freshman philosophy course. As a result of reading Becker, I had a much more sophisticated early perception of the world that most people only gain after years and years of experience. I knew some of Becker's ideas intuitively, but it organized these ideas and provided clarity. It has stuck with me many years later and is a must read for anyone wondering about the dilemma of \\"man\\" and \\"self\\".I was having a conversation with my brother about the nature of our culture and it reminded me of the book that I read in my youth. I wholeheartedly recommended this book to him and to anyone pondering the questions surrounding the nature of man."},{"rating":"2","title":"A clear overview of the fundamental problems facing people","review":"This book is one I go back to again and again because it is such basic and relevant information.

The colored screen was magnificent. As the previous comment said, Game Boy was hard to over take. Yes Game Boy was in black and white, but it had all of the other things going its way. For example, Game Gear is more expensive, the games are more expensive, it's bigger, and the WORST thing about a Game Gear is that it's not much of a portable gaming system because it ran on 6 AA's I believe...and it died in about 40 minutes of play. The screen being lit was nice for night rides but only lasting 40 mins or so was not acceptable. A good system if you plan on sitting next to an outlet and playing but if you want to travel with it, I'd pass on the Game Gear unless you like paying more than the price of the Game Gear on batteries every couple months."},{"rating":"1","title":"my past fools me again","review":"i bought the sega game gear because i hold fond memories of it as a kid. it was the best thing around because it had a big color screen and you could take it anywhere. but, for some reason, when i got it and started using it, what i had was not fun. instead, i had buyer's remorse. finding that it wasn't nearly as fun to me now as it was when i was a lad, well, it was nearly traumatizing. if anything good can be said about the game gear, it's that it helps you appreciate the evolution that handheld systems have gone through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hello 1993!!","review":"Love this gaming device!!

Other great tracks come from Sentenced, Dimmu Borgir, Lacrimosa and Crematory (who provide a stellar live performance of their hit \\"Shadows of Mine\\"). There are a few songs that strike me as static, or not completely well-rounded, but don't subtract from the overall experience. In conclusion, Beauty in Darkness Vol. 2 is an excellent addition for your gothic collection, and the included hard-to-find tracks only justify your reason to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"get outta here!!!!!!","review":"they call this music?i picked up this cd based on the highest reviews yesterday and the minute i put it in the cd player i thought the intro song to the album (future breed machine) was a psycheldelic one and then me and some friends were discussing how Tomas Haake's vocals sounded a lot like Phil's from pantera in their album Far beyond Driven which really sucked too there's that and it has a lot of nu-metal influence with the guitar workthe solos combined with synths are crappy and after 5 songs it got very monotnous with very little variation in sound"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meshuggah [stinks]","review":"Meshuggah absolutally symbolizes peice of [junk]music.

Fortunately, it did not make my mind up about this one. Being a fan of progressive and technical music, as soon as I heard 'Future Breed Machine', I had to get this album. The singer reminds me of old Fear Factory (but throatier), but the band is loads more technical. Time signatures fly by the wayside as these guys take you literally on a wild trip.What really sold me on this album, though, is the pure energy. Listening to this album makes me wanna go out and break something and just cause destruction and mayhem. My one and ONLY complaint with the album was the lack of technicality solo-wise. These guys obviously have the talent, I would just like to hear them show it off a little bit more. How about a band like Meshuggah combining their sound with a Symphony X style (or just with Michael Romeo)? I would pay a lot of caaaash to hear that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me an aspirin","review":"I first heard of Meshuggah back in like 96 or so when i picked up Destroy,Erase,Improve.Basically because it said undeniable Thrash Metal.Therefore i assumed like Slayer,Old Metallica,Overkill,kinda vein,boy was i wrong.I never really liked it even after many listens to this day,year 2004 i still can't get into them.I've tryed many times only to reach for the aspirin bottle,i do think they are talented but you just can't follow anything they do.I played in a band similar to this one(as the drummer)and i can honestly say it was the least fun music i've ever played.No fun,when you have to sit and think about ever polyrythmic beat your hitting.Its like having sex you don't wanna have to think about it,you just do it.Improv is way more fun.Also there is not one bit of melody to any of they're songs,so unless you like total confusion in your music,stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vocals good but that's it","review":"I admit these guys have talent but there songs just don't make any sense. You never know where anything is going. The riffs change so much that it gets so annoying.

I guess some of you people consider it talent to be able to do this however, it's not very fun to listen to. However, I do enjoy the vocals, he has a good metal voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"The reinvention of Pantera","review":"These guys remind of when Pantera first hit the scene.

But my fav is Suffer in Truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very complex, very interesting and extremely heavy!","review":"This album is definitely one that requires multiple listens just to \\"get it\\". The layers of rhythms that are piled on in the songs are truly mind blowing. The guitarists are exceptional, one minute playing a bone crushing power riff, the next a quiet melodic run. My only complaint is that despite the heaviness of the record, and its sheer volume, sometimes you would just love for them to break into a straight ahead 4/4 chug. It's almost frustrating listening to these complex beats and ryhthms and not have them all coalesce at some point during the song and just pummel you. I love this album, but it gives me a headache from all the concentrating required in listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scented Organic Salts","review":"Once you find the MASADA sea salts, you might want to try all the scented organic salts.

As you sink into your own private Rain Forest bath you can escape into a pool infused with Dead Sea salts and emerge revitalized.If you prefer unscented sea salts look for the MASADA Naturally Unscented Dead Sea Mineral Bath Salts. One capful seems to be enough for an entire bath and you can add in your own essential oil blends. I like Aroma Lands Sacred Blend or the Aura Cacia Rose Otto Balancing Blend for the skin healing properties.

It really is worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"We Killed God at Magdaberg.","review":"The film directed by James Clavel and based on his book is a dark and brooding peace depicting the world savage and cruel of the thirty years war. Michael Caine plays the Captain the leader of a band of mercenaries who come across a valley free from the ravages of war, plague and pestilence. Omar Sherif plays Vogel a teacher and traveller who too has in adversity stumbled across a promised land. The story that follows is a study of politics, love, war and religious dogma. Caine gives an excellent performance as a realist who understands only too well the nature of the latter, though finding solace and mutual education with the teacher Vogal. The films closing battle scenes could have been taken from a period woodcut of the time apocalyptic and hellish in there vision, the film stands today as worthy example of expressive rather than decorative historical drama."},{"rating":"2","title":"atmospheric and well done","review":"If you're used to Michael Caine cracking jokes or doing a 007 imitation in glasses, get ready for something completely different in this excellent but rather loose adaptation of the J.B. Pick novel (which has a different ending, though no less tragic). One wishes Caine had done a better job with the German accent, or just skipped it altogether. Still, he is eminently believable as the leader of a band of soldiers getting a much needed break from war in a valley that must have seemed like paradise indeed when they stumbled on it. Florinda Bolkan is lovely and the rest of the cast is excellent. Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"30 Years War","review":"Interesting film. It attempts to convey the chaos of the war (which is almost impossible to do in such a small snapshot) and the film starts out with a scene which is almost a 1600s version of Mad Max. Not quite the same thing but as the story line develops it gives a more complete picture of the dynamics of the war. The offensive at the end of the film really doesn't make it clar as to WHY the Captain feels he has to go back to the war, but mostly the plot makes sense.Michael Caine and Omar Sharif put in good performances and have an excellent supporting cast. The constumes are great. The music is OK, although you almost expect it to suddenly lurch into a sixties protest song."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely movie","review":"This is my favourite movie of all time - a love story, action and the best musical score.

The story, a chapter in Europe's dark history."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bleak look into the nature of the human condition.","review":"This film has profound relevance today. Political manipulation, fueled by religious and ethnic difference, remains a major threat to world stability. When this film was released in 1971, as I remember, it reminded viewers of the Vietnam War. Some of the images will suggest to younger viewers the war crimes of Rwanda and Yugoslavia. Like those recent atrocities, the events in this film underscore the fragility of civilization and the corosive effects of Christianity and other divisive mythologies.

The 5-star reviews for this product are all fake.Koch completely butchered this classic animated feature. The most notable alteration to the film was stretching the picture from its original 1.37:1 aspect ratio into a 1.77:1 aspect ratio so it will fill up the entire screen on an HDTV. As a result, Gulliver and all the characters look fatter than they actually are. Aside from altering the picture, sound effects have been added to the soundtrack that weren't originally there. Lastly, the two Gabby cartoons in the bonus features section are not outtakes from the movie.

However, this WinStar release includes the original mono mix in addition to the 5.1 and 2.0 Stereo remixes with newly added sound effects (the mono mix is unaltered!).

The dub is scratchy at best and is more often than not, washed out.The film starts out without the opening credits and we noticed entire scenes have been deleted (as if taken from a bad film version that had been spliced together). ...

In this position you are way off balance or can be taken off balance easly. Plus the punch they show that goes with these blocks can not have any power to do more than [irritate] the attacker ... If you watch the little re-enactments you can see where the defening guy would be lays is a pool of blood if they were using a real knife and not a fake, because you can see where the fake knife bends as it goes it touches his body were a real knife would have cut or stab into the body."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an advanced tape","review":"I am writing this review in response to a previous review, although I have not viewed the tapes. My 5 star rating is based on what I know of Krav Maga and its practicality in a real-world situation, and a fundamental trust in the effectiveness of the techniques when applied properly by a trained fighter.I am a level 1 Krav Maga student in Virginia Beach, VA.Krav Maga knife defense techniques represented on this tape are used in the advanced stages (level 3 and onward is my understanding) of Krav Maga training, and probably shouldn't be attempted by beginners. Don't rely on videos as your primary training. Find a Krav Maga studio, enroll, and learn the basics first. It's worth the time and effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry but... no!","review":"Hmmm... this is a pain cause I really think, that Krav Maga is one of the very rare self defense systems, that do really work when it comes to fighting outside the gym. On hand to hand combat, that is. But knives...The problem is, that in general most of the people who tell you something about defending against a knive seem to know not very much abou how to use a knive in fighting. To keep it short - some of the defenses shown here may work - if you are a very well trained, experienced and cold blooded fighter. If you are a beginner, you will end up with the insides of your arms and legs cut open - which can be fatal.Two stars - because Krav Maga is so very very effective in hand to hand combat and because some of the things shown here might work. If you are lucky or the knife-guy is a slob.Definetly not for beginners!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great entertainment, and good learning too.","review":"This is a great set of games.

They're also fun enough that the 3 year old in question was more than willing to put in the time. In fact it was hard to pry him away from them. The characters are engaging, and there are a lot of small games internally that can be played regardless of what's going on in the larger game.

And some decent metal, too...","review":"I bought this CD without any prior knowledge of the band, but as a proud metal fan, although the title is not exactly original, the cover got my attention. Tempos range from nearly dragging to fairly fast, nothing that extreme, and the musicianship is solid throughout the album. The vocalist sings/yells rather than growls, but there's plenty of aggression here. While the production could be a bit cleaner, the incredibly thick guitar and bass tones are at times thunderous. Some of the riffs and lead sections remind me of Carcass' melodies and solos off Heartwork or Swansong, but that's a good thing, because I don't mean they're imitative, just similar. In sum, Dismember's Death Metal deserves four stars, five if the sound quality was crisper. Well that's it! Pick this up if you like DEATH METAL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Melodic Brutality","review":"Dismember is one of the best Melodic Death Metal bands to ever grace the genre. They are not as melodic as In Flames and not as brutal as Behemoth. They stand in the middle of those two types of Death Metal acts. On one hand, Dismember is very brutal and down tuned in they're own right. They also play some killer Iron Maiden type twin guitar riffs in their music. This is just great Death Metal and extremely fun to listen too. Straight up mosh pit music. The vocals are always deep but understandable. This release along with Hate Campaign and Massive Killing Capacity are essential Death Metal releases. Please do yourself a favor and pick up all three."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Swedish Death Metal","review":"Though it seems impossible, \\"Death Metal\\" is arguably as good as \\"Massive Killing Capacity\\".Criminally underrated, Dismember are the apex of the Stockholm death metal scene. America may have the wild west and beautiful wilderness that still beckons us to adventure, and America has the vicious power of the Floridian and New York schools of death metal. But Sweden has frozen forests and the polar aurora and an ancient history. And they have Dismember, who combine the brutality of classic American metal with a uniquely European melodic sensibility, one that evokes craggy castles and icy wastes. Entombed are okay but they only made two death metal albums.

Sure, some of the script is predictable but the energy of Jane Wyman and the rest of the cast is infectious.All-in-all, if you have a soft spot for the old days of aviation, this is a must.

Some real good detective writing there. But as the plot builds towards an utterly ridiculous climax it is clear that Estleman was trying his hand at a different type of writing. The title implies it. He was trying to be a Stephen King, building an ominous tone and setting. It didn't work and like I said the end is absurd and thoroughly unbelievable.Fortunately the entries in the series following this have been very strong. I guess everyone is entitled to a mulligan.If you're a fan of Amos Walker skip this one. If you're not a fan, pick up almost any other one first."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete throwaway","review":"Some of the Amos Walker novels are excellent. Sinister Heights is not one of them.

It covers a variety of lawyers and law firms to give the reader a representative view of various law practices with seemingly questionable morals or ethical practices. It runs the full gamut, from Plaintiffs lawyers dealing with diet pills and breast implants, to securities class-action litigation, to lobbying, to white shoe law firms and David Boies. All these different lawyers are used to show much of what is wrong with many of the major players in the legal system today.On another note, this book appears to have been very poorly edited. Typos abound, and transitions are done very poorly. Goulden jumps around between lawyers and topics, and does not stay very focused at times. The book also should have been a bit more comprehensive, e.g. discuss what's right with the legal system, problems with conservative jurists and lawyers, etc. But on the whole, I liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Rice Ever","review":"This is truly the best rice ever, if you like spicy things.

The stories, although not always well written, are sincere and honest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice but a bit \\"watered down\\"","review":"\\"Rain\\" is a classic pre-censorship movie of the 30's. As usual with this type of film, one must do a fair amount of reading between the lines to get the full story. Joan Crawford gives a strong performance as Sadie Thompson, a trollop on the run from the law. Walter Huston as Alfred Davidson, a bible thumping, over the top preacher, is sufficiently scary. The rest of the cast puts in fine performances. The cinematography is also exceptionally elegant.The story is a bit watered down from it's Somerset Maugham original, and some extreme leaps of believability are needed on the part of the audience to accept the denouement. But the story is strong and powerful and surprisingly up-to-date considering it is almost 70 years old. It would seem the religious right has been throwing its muscle around longer than we think.I highly recommend \\"Rain\\", if for no other reason than to see Joan Crawford in the type of role that made her famous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor DVD release","review":"This isn't one of those product reviews that tells you about the movie, but a real product review.The image quality hasn't been improved, and you could even think that the transfer was direct from a tape or film in really deplorable quality. It doesn't even contain proper DVD menus, so when you're looking at content, there's no way of going back to the main menu.There's also no subtitles or caption, so only recommended for English speakers with no hearing problems.Think more than twice before getting this DVD, unless you're a really big fan of the movie already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Poor quality and the acting was not very good.

Somerset Maughm's story. A very early talkie, this movie features a young Joan Crawford in the role of Sadie Thompson, a fun-loving floozie who becomes the target of Christian reformers. Crawford (in pre-ham acting mode) is very good as Sadie, as is John Huston as the reformer Davidson. It is very old fashioned but Milestone's direction sets it apart from many talkies of the day. He utilized motion camerashots, the actors move around naturally, not tied to the close range of a hidden microphone in an obvious prop. Therefore, movie is not as stilted and static like many of it's contemporaries. Extra mention should be made for the Roan group who have done an superb job of restoration, and yet do not charge exorbitant prices. On the strength of this dvd I shall purchase more from Roan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rain","review":"The first time I saw this movie was on TCM.It was incredble!The first shot is of Joan's hand on the door then she comes around the door and we can see her face,then her body and you get the big time WOW factor. Well I bought the DVD because I loved the movie and most of all Joan Crawford. The problem is that the disc I got seemed washed out and the editing was not the same. The first time I saw this movie you heard music then saw a hand with nice polish then the face, Joan! The DVD I got in the mail did not have this beginning and it looked washed out. Not only was it changed from what I saw on TCM but the music wasn't there! Anyone who loved this movie the first time they saw it would be dissapointed in the DVD they purchase from Amazon!

Sure, it looks luxerious and beautiful on the outside, but dont let the sleek looks fool you.The camera quality leaves much to be desired, it takes very low quality pictures, and you dont have the option of caller ID.. and that's the main reason I'd buy a camera phone.. so I could literally see who's calling. Most ringtones sound horrible and washed out when you purchase them. The outer cover of the phone may look nice, but over time it wears down, tiny pieces of plastic fleck off, etc. The browser is old, the download times are much slower than most of today's phones, and it locks up and glitches up all the time.

The games on it are horrible unless you're into flying a spaceship around tying to kill little alien ships. Then you can't even download any games to it. I recommend to not get this phone. I had the X427 before this and it was not that great either. Battery life does not last. I have had the phone for about 5 months and I am on my 3rd battery. The phone often freezes and I sometimes have to end a call by removing the battery. The only good thing is the camera but if this phone had picture caller ID, that would be a great feature.

Other spoofs are great, don't get me wrong; Galaxy Quest was awsome, and Trekkies was a little disturbing to be honest, but *this* movie got me where I lived. I *know* these people - I am one of them.The 2 central characters have lives, but their lives are so intertwined with fandom that trekkisms are completely amalgamated into their world views and speech patterns. Strangely enough, they fit. It's very realistic, and intensely amusing. And the wacky hijinks that ensue after they meet Bill are worth every moment.This is a movie for every hard core SF fan, every 30 something who was a 'geeky Trekkie loser' in high school. We are the ones who will get it. Everyone else will probably just scratch their head and wonder what's up with all the Star Wars action figures.Go. Watch. *Grok*.

But I was shocked to find a film that not only accurately captures and parodies a real-world sense of just how pervasive the science fiction lifestyle can be, but also manages to do so in an intelligent, witty, and completely captivating manner.

I found it to be poorly acted & executed, amateurish and very unfunny. Not to mention BORING. I spent more time looking at my watch in the theatre that I did at the screen. Shatner is completely wasted in this film, so much fun could have been mined from him playing himself, but instead the filmmakers swerved the narrative line into an oh-so predictable love story. Also, the \\"Star Trek\\" and comic book geeks portrayed in this film couldn't be farther from the real thing. Don't waste your time with this one. Instead check out \\"TREKKIES\\" a truly funny look at \\"Star Trek\\" fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution - Defective DVD's","review":"I am really unable to rate the movie fully since the DVD does not play past Chapter 20.

After I thought it was only my copy, a person on a Trek newsgroup wrote that he had the same problem with the Free Enterprise DVD.

Go rent/buy Swingers or Chasing Amy instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only watch this movie if it is truely \\"free\\"","review":"The documentary extra of \\"Free Enterprise\\" makes it clear that the filmmakers thought they were making a romantic comedy about two science fiction fans who meet their idol, William Shatner. Unfortunately, the film is neither romantic nor comedic. At best, \\"Free Enterprise\\" could be considered a bad, 1990's, autobiographical, Woody Allen movie with all of the angst and none of the humor. It isn't even a story about science fiction fans who meet meet their idol. That, as \\"Galaxy Quest\\" proved, has great fodder for gentle humor. Speaking as an SF fan myself, these soon-to-be 30 year-old boys are just neurotic, self-absorbed teenagers, not people who revel in fantastic possibilities. Speaking as a psychologist, I'd make a perfect therapist for these two, thoughts I'd rather not experience when I'm looking for some entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks","review":"This is a badly written badly acted movie.

The only thing that I really enjoyed was the final scene which had William Shatner doing a rap/hip-hop version of Marc Antony's funeral speech from Ceaser.

Oneof them is having an identity crisis as he approaches his thirtieth birthday (he dreams he's the hero of Logan's Run). One of them is having trouble with his girlfriend and his job. The best performance in the film is by William Shatner, playing himself. He has an obsession with making a rap musical version of'Julius Caesar', and sends up himself and 'Star Trek' hilariously. My favourite line in the film is where the one who's approaching thirty, who is Jewish, is fondling a German girl and she pushes him away. \\"Considering what your people did to my people during WW2\\" he observes \\"I wouldn't have thought a little mild breast fondling was too much reparation to make.\\" This is a very funny film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swingers + Late Last Nite","review":"With a theme of Sci Fi for the comical interludes between and during relationship scenes. Hilarius and on the money in many exchanges. If you liked the above movies as well as a sci fi movie fan and in your 30's you'll want to own this one. Though I saw on VHS will buy on DVD.

However, these are not airtight as the description states which pretty much renders them useless.

To save money I bought these (China-made) containers instead and it was a big mistake. The first bad sign was a long black hair stuck in one of the containers. The soft plastic parts of the lids that seal the containers had rough edges and were poorly trimmed. The clear plastic of the containers had all sorts of scuff marks. The final straw came when I dropped one from about 3 feet and 3 inches of the lip broke off, rendering the container useless for airtight storage -- and that's assuming that the somewhat loose-fitting lids actually make the containers airtight.

It stars Abbott and Costello, a great comedy team. Throughout the film they manage to get into scuffles with girls, officers, each other, and even inanimate objects, making a truly funny film. A sub-story revolves around a singing star (Dick Powell) who attempts to live a normal life by joining the Navy under his real name. A reporter follows him around trying to get a photo to break through into the journalism business.This film has a great cast. Apart from the hilarious Bud and Lou and the adorable Powell, the Andrews sisters appear as entertainers for the boys. Some of their songs are cute and entertaining, but they prove to be somewhat annoying throughout. Shemp Howard of Three Stooges fame has a small part as a dishwasher too.Overall, this is not an important film or one of genius, but it is terribly entertaining and fun for all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Animals and Tools","review":"What's not to like if you're three years old?

Cadderly suddenly gains this superior confidence and believes what he says is right and everyone else is wrong, what ever happened to the Cadderly who weighed his options well. The expanations did not sit well with me but they by no means distracted from the book. The highlight: Ivan on his Magic Dragon Ride. If you pass this up you are missing out on the vengence book of the series.

Although Salvatore had some great characters in his other series, this one falls flat in every respect.

Thanks to Marrin, I now understand the difference.With so little known about Captain Morgan before he made a name for himself as a buccaneer, I believe Marrin does an excellent job in setting the scene by describing the world Morgan lived in. Without going over-the-top, he adequately describes the political and social scene of the day however fair or unjust it may have been. He also gives a good impression of the many injustices that were accepted as part of everyday life that are very difficult for us to comprehend today (e.g., slavery, torture, terrorism, etc.).After reading this book, I understand why Morgan was hailed as a hero in England at the time, but it is also very clear why the Spanish compared him to the Devil."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 of 4 cats used this item","review":"I have four cats and only one of them liked this product.

The book starts by dividing journalistic ethics into political, philosophical, and economic categories, in addition to issues of objectivity and privacy. This is followed by real-life case studies in which reporters and editors had to make tough ethical decisions regarding everything from crime to suicide, AIDS to car accidents, and political scandals to war reporting. The most refreshing aspect of this book is its insistence that none of these ethical crises have clear cut-and-dried answers, and that the process of examination and decision making in the face of such dilemmas is most important, while much can be learned from the experiences of the real-life journalists profiled here. This book impressively covers these very difficult questions.

Sony says thanks you stupid Americans. If both become available at the same time, I will certainly not buy the much later than promised Ipaq.

This started happening after a couple of weeks and has happened at least 10 times so far, since I use mine a lot, but using this trick I have always been able to get it out again. Just turn the iPAQ upside down and tap on the side near the stylus hole, and also try hitting the butten a few times while you're at it. This has always worked and gotten it un-stuck.

This was important since my Palm Pilot was basically useless to notify me of meetings since I seldom could hear its alarm. Things to note about the iPAQ are it's fixed battery.

By the end, you'll be floating on the sheer bizarre beauty of this film. It's glamorous and pointless and compelling--unexpectedly so, if you happen to stumble on it without prior expectations. I actually thought I'd dislike this film, had very low expectations, and rented it one night on whim. I've watched it several times since then. This is the kind of story where you keep asking \\"Why?\\" but there's no pat explanation for why the main characters act as they do--there's the superficial backstory for each of them, but in the end they're opaque--their choices, motives, and thoughts undecipherable.

Avoid this movie!","review":"Despite the fact that Eye of the Beholder has two relatively capable and interesting young actors, it fails to perform the job a good movie does...to entertain. The main problem with this movie is the fact that it is not coherent. It lacks a degree of structure and clarity necessary to allow the viewer to comprehend the story. Most of the so-called 'developments' are absurd and unbelievable. Why does Ewan McGregor suddenly become so obsessed with Ashley Judd? What happens to the mental projection of his daughter? What happens at the end? Does she die? What is she saying to him?...it's incomprehensible.

Ewan MacGregor follows Ashley Judd around for months, spying on her & supposedly keeping her safe from harm. He looks into her background - finds out she was abandoned as a child by her father, feels empathy for her - because his wife took off with his daughter. A daughter he imagines seeing throughout the entire movie. There is no real plot, other thank that and the ending is pathetic. \\"I wish you love\\", indeed! Do not waste your money or time on this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a bag of crap...","review":"This had to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The worst part of this movie were the woefully undeveloped characters of McGregor and Judd. McGregor's character has some sick and strange obsession with Judd's serial killer. The man lost a daughter. So what? This does not explain the reason he follows Judd around during the entire movie. He protects her several times throughout the film but he also nearly Kills Her! Judd's black widow serial killer is never really explained well either. Was she sexually abused, did her mommy hit her and call her names? Any thing that could have explained her character's reasons for being who she was were left out. McGregor and Judd were not to blame for this. Their performances were the best they could have been for this trainwreck. The fault for this disaster lies with the director and writer who translated this story film. With a better director and writer this might have been a taut psychological thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"First, let me say I'm a Ewan McGregor fan and it pains me to find fault with any of his films, but this one is a stinker. To those who feel you must be intelligent to appreciate this film I say: I have a law degree and I couldn't begin to tell you what this movie is about. Furthermore, anything you have to watch 4 times to understand is not a good movie and certainly doesn't deserve an Oscar much less your valuable time. A good director will not make it so painfully hard for anyone to try and figure out what they just spent two hours watching. I like intrigue and suspense as much as the next person, and I even like endings that are open to interpretation. This movie, however, is not satisfying in the least. It was slow, choppy, lacking in any attachment to the two lead characters and a basic waste of time. My advice is to skip it and find a movie with a real story."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie refutes its title","review":"I love arty, convoluted films (Mulholland Drive, Memento, etc.) but this movie is just drek.

If, however, you want a great psychological thriller with great actors, look elsewhere. Most people misunderstood this movie because they did not catch on to the true nature of Ashley and Ewan's relationship (there was only one real clue, and it was at the end). Once you realize that relationship, then the movie makes some sense when you consider Ashley's and Ewan's actions. But that completely throws reality out the door because the time frame of the movie would be absolutely wrong. If you consider the more commonly taken relationship between Askley and Ewan, then their actions in the movie make no sense, and the plot is pointless. The actors and director do everything they can to make this picture worth watching, but it is impossible to simply watch this movie for its art, and ignore the plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"this isnt as bad as other reviews make it seem","review":"Give me a break people.

Sure, director Stephan Elliott gives us some moody visuals, appealing camera angles and two performances by Ashley Judd and k.d. lang that far outclass the movie. Ewan McGregor's loneliness is so telegraphed and forced he becomes a mere tool in the film. And ultimately in spite of its artistic merits, where does it end? Why would anyone fall in love with a serial killer; his wife and daughter left him--so what, life goes on. His obsession with her, in my opinion, does not justify wanting to \\"save\\" her. She's coldblooded, heartless and intrinsically selfish. Lonely--it's her choice, just as it is his. The ending...why in the world is Judd so upset that McGregor knows what she's done?Ashley has gone on to make better movies; she's a very good actress. Too bad the script didn't use her better."},{"rating":"1","title":"..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., the end...","review":"This is the worst movie I have ever seen.

Not ONE interesting thing happened durrring the entire movie, despite our continued assurances to each other that SOMETHING was bound to happen any moment.

Unfortunately, it is all bogged down by an overly long storyline and an ending which will leave you with that \\"I can't believe I watched the whole thing for THAT\\" feeling. The performances were outstanding, but so many clues to future events that make the observer stop and take notice thinking \\"I'd better pay attention -- this is going to mean something\\" only to have them never materialize.

Everyone else has described the failures of this film, I will not. I will simply add this minor detail that to me speaks volumes concerning the futility of trying to comprehend the film or the character's motiviations: The red jacket. He's following her. Secretly. Doesn't want her to know. Spying. AND HE'S WEARING A BRIGHT RED JACKET THE WHOLE TIME. Get that? A BRIGHT RED JACKET. What? He's a spy and he wears a RED JACKET while trying to maintain a low profile? Truly unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bad--Truly","review":"I hate being negative about things, but this movie was truly awful. I am a very intelligent person and yet had hardly any clue what was going on because the movie was so unclear. The acting was okay, but not great and didn't make up for the film's poor quality. Unrealistic and undeveloped plot. Seriously . . . not worth seeing at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless Confusion","review":"This movie is just so pathetic. Ewan MacGragor follows around Ashley Judd - spying on her & supposedly protecting her (from herself I imagine). I was actually looking forward to watching this movie - I thought it looked pretty interesting. What a mistake. I purchased it & will never watch it again. Judd goes on a sort of man-killing spree while MacGregor watches her from afar. He feels sorry for her because she was abandoned as a child by her father. MacGragor's daughter was taken from him by his wife. But that doesn't stop him from imagining that his daughter is near throughout the entire movie. Her antics are just so annoying. The appearances of his daughter add nothing to the already confusing movie. Jason Priestly plays the small part of a psycho that does get the best of Judd until her \\"angel\\" comes to rescue her. All in all I found this movie boring, confusing and pointless. The end is the most pathetic of all. \\"I wish you love\\"...indeed"},{"rating":"1","title":"$3.00 Rental, 0 payoff!","review":"This movie just completely ...me off! It started out fine and gained some momentum with its twists and turns but hey, whoever made this waste of film should have realized that if you're going create these twists and turns, you have to straighten them all out nice and neat at the end so the viewer doesn't feel ripped off. It seemed like this film was an inside joke between who made it and himself. Kinda like Tim Burton with Batman. I didn't get it and I don't think anyone else did either. This was the slowest, most boring nonsense I've ever sat through. And yes, I have seen Plan 9 From Outer Space and it blows this one away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too confusing","review":"I must admit, I am a huge fan of Ewan McGregor and when I saw this movie for the first time I was hooked. But then I showed it to my friends and they weren't too happy with it. And then I showed it to my mom and she didn't like it either. The plot was too confusing. You have to know a lot of psychological stuff in order to understand this movie. When I watched it for the first time, I only watched it because Ewan was in it, but then I watched it a second and third time and I found it to be quite boring. The only part that I actually like(which happens to be my fave part)is when they sing that song \\"I Wish You Love\\" and when Ewan's \\"in love with the wall\\" so to speak. If you are absoulutely desperate and want to see a movie with Ewan in it, go see this, because that's how I was.(Also because my stupid Blockbuster didn't have any of Ewan's movies, preferably Nightwatch so I went to J.C. Flicks and rented this instead) Only rent if you are completely desperate."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a disappointment!","review":"There's a big sucking sound and it's coming from this movie. By the time you reach the end of this one you'll be asking yourself, what happened? Kind of a hard to follow plot. Judd and McGregor are great as usual and even have interesting characthers.....too bad it was horribly written. Rent it before you buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughably bad","review":"I watched this movie with a friend, and for the record we are both fans of intelligent movies. The problem is that this movie is not intelligent in the least. It is a convoluted and implausible film right down to the screaming red 80's life-preserver jacket that Ewan McGregor wears while he is \\"incognito\\". There is a fascinating storyline, but the writer/director has no sense of narrative and in the end neither character ever has a motivated action or a true emotion. The film is certainly stylish, and Elliot goes to great extremes to create a film noir look (everyone dressed in 1940's clothing, smoking French cigarettes, and of course his haphazard use of snowglobes), but none of his visuals work well together. A stylistic jumble and flat out disaster in terms of writing, this is a horrible movie, the type of movie that lowers the IQ of movies everywhere. A waste of talent and a waste of time, to be avoided at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid.","review":"I JUST finished watching this one. I knew how it HAD to end. Too predictable. About half way into the movie I became grateful that I had earned it as a free rental. Not worth the renting price, in my opinion.No great effects for those with DVD players either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Behold What?","review":"If it were not for Ashley Judd, I don't know if I would have rented it in the first place. She was, as always, very believable in her character. The filming of the movie was rich and vibrant. I don't think the editing gave you enough to go on to figure out the main character's \\"hold\\" on each other. Good acting...bad ending. You'll ask yourself what it all meant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jumbled,pointless,mess","review":"I just watched this movie last night and I was left wondering what just happened for the past two hours of my time.

Completely pointless and unenjoyable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies I have ever seen.","review":"I rented this movie because I like Ashley Judd and Ewan McGregor, and the trailers made it look interesting. I am very sorry I did. This movie was choppy, hard to follow and uninteresting. I kept watching waiting for the movie to make sense, but it never did. Save your self the trouble and get another movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, confusing and senseless","review":"I think the director attempted to make a Hitchcock style thriller but somehow this came out as confusing, boring and incoherent. I can almost see how a script readong could have led McGregor and Judd to think this could have been a taut on-the-edge thriller, but the end result was discordant nonsense. Don't waste your time or money on this mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unanswered questions, misleading trailers","review":"I have to agree almost totally with Robert Berry's review. While I myself found MacGregor's and Judd's performances solid, the entire movie, I kept asking myself \\"Why?\\" Why is MacGregor relentlessly pursuing Judd when, early on, he is \\"ordered home\\" to Britain to investigate a \\"domestic problem\\" there? What unrevealed information ties an internal investigator of the British consulate to this scheming American woman? And I always enjoy when the last line of a movie is delivered in such a whisper that you can rewind 8 times and still not know what was said. The trailers made this film look really intriguing; boy, were they misleading! I rarely feel like I want my money back for a video rental, but this one did it! Don't waste your $3.69!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT THE HELL?","review":"It's nothing but walking...left, right, left,...walking...left, right, left...Is my review boring to read? Well, appreciate it because now you've read the entire script for this thing.It boils down to this: If you want to see something so infuriatingly tedious and agonizingly boring that you have to turn off the VCR and watch Sesame Street for better character development (and overall plot), by all means, rent this sedative!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A surrealistic thriller much better than most of the usuals.","review":"Greatly acted by Ashley Judd and Ewan McGregor, this movie is very hypnotic and pretty well directed !

It never does! You would think after 100 years of movie making, they still wouldn't be putting out movies this bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Warned--The Ending's Awful!","review":"I won't go into the ending on the off chance that somebody reading this review hasn't actually seen the movie yet (and will actually want to see it after seeing all the bad reviews it's got). However, the characterization is a mess, the motivations are hidden, the direction is cruel in the amounts it cuts from the storyline. Ashley Judd and Ewan McGregor both give absolutely great performances (you can almost hear Judd pleading behind the scenes with the director, \\"Can't I give it a little nuance, a smidgen of depth? Please? No? Okay...\\"). McGregor is one of my favorites and deserves major kudos for doing such a great job with a thankless script. Still, all their hard work doesn't even *begin* to redeem the time I lost watching this ridiculous film. (And, like many other people, I read the book after watching the film. Don't even try--you'll feel ripped off all over again.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Story, Bad Execution","review":"\\"Eye of the Beholder\\" is the rare example of a \\"bad good movie\\". What I mean is that the story of a British secret agent (Ewan McGregor) pursuing and protecting a young woman, Joanna (Ashley Judd), who he is supposed to stop, has a haunting, well-written story, but the result on the screen can be uneven.The editing can be a bit dissorienting, but I found myself enjoying the acting and the smooth, dark look of the film. This film feels familiar --I'm sure I've seen something like this before, but I don't know where.If you can get past some of the noticable flaws, you might find yourself enjoying and admiring the effort that went into making one of the most noirish, twisted, emotionally-searching movies that you are ever likely to see. This film is definitely not for everyone -- or maybe not for anyone -- but it can be appreciated on several levels.It is worth a look with your beholding eye."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much ado about nothing","review":"My fiance and I watched this disc, the whole time hoping that there'd be some explanation, some plot point, that would make all of the cross-country travel, wardrobe changes (and wardrobe oddities, like the red coat) and snow-globes seem worthwhile. The end reveals no explanation at all, just a take it or leave it, as-is ending. We'll be erasing the two hours spent with this disc, instead to place our high IQ's on better topics. Skip this one, please."},{"rating":"1","title":"What? They actually made a movie of that???","review":"....that's what I was thinking at the mind-numbing end when I realized I'd just sat through a two-hour (almost) cinematic tribute to a story with no redeeming value whatsoever. The story should have worked only if made into a comedy, but seems the makers had some outlandish notion that there was uplifting drama here. Some customer reviews seem to reflect a similar attitude, but as for me I was hoping throughout for something like someone slipping some ex-lax into Ashley Judd's coffee, for that would make things happen more interesting than anything in the actual movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ashley Judd is only actor who can make kd lang seem wasted!","review":"I never would have expected kd lang to be an actor one would much be pulling for. But as a voice of reason trying to reign in the obsessive indulgence of \\"The Eye\\" (played by Ewan MeGregor), lang's character is the one we can most sympathize with herein. It might have worked to make lang look like a character actor to take note of. But what dooms it all to failure is Ashley Judd playing an absurdly extreme caricature of her already well-know \\"ballbuster\\" persona. As such the movie plays like a nightmare. Not in an entertaining sense, but as if the viewer is caught in the nightmare of having to watch the movie -- indeed a nightmare of living in a world where such a movie would ever be made and deemed entertaining. The mood is all totally putrid and the story beyond preposterous."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR YOUR MONEY...","review":"While boasting an excellent cast and an intriguing plot, this film simply tanks. Ashley Judd plays the role of a black widow, a female serial killer, who systematically kills off every man she meets. Ewan McGregor is the British intelligence officer who is hot on her trail. For some incomprehensible, mumbo jumbo reason, he ends up being protective of her.In fact, incomprehensible is a good way to describe this entire film. It is poorly edited and shuffles along at a snail's pace. Despite the excellent cast, the action plods along and the movie is dead before the first body hits the ground. One finds oneself having little sympathy or empathy for any of the characters in this cinematic fiasco. Do not waste you time or your money. This one is a turkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sick, artsy-fartsy movie","review":"*Eye of the Beholder* is the story of an obsessional psychotic, led to distraction by constant visual and auditory hallucinations of his lost daughter, following the murderous trail of a female serial killer, who changes wigs to seduce men and kill them, before crying out hysterically \\"Merry Christmas daddy!\\"A fan of Brian De Palma's voyeuristic films (from *Dressed to Kill* to *Blow Out*, *Body Double* and *Mission: Impossible*), I rented this cold, obscure, depraved movie for two dollars, expecting something completely different.

Ashley Judd did this movie before Double Jeopardy and Ewan McGregor did it before becoming Mr. Jedi. That said, it still was an awful movie. The plot had potential but the terrible writing just gave no flow whatsoever to the film. No one explained the origins of McGregor's obsession with his target (Judd). And does anyone truly believe that the agency you are working for would allow one of their operatives to run off on your own crusade? Duh!...And the ending of the movie is even more incoherent.

In a sea of negatives, this film's only positive was Ewan McGregor, who was brilliant in spite of a script that was weak in structure, characterization and psychology. It was easy to believe that he was obsessed with her--it just wasn't clear WHY. Ashley Judd, normally an adequate actress, wasn't up to par this time around.

The reading is easy and provides just enough information on each breed.The first section of the book is alive with pictures of various dogs and instructions from puppy care on through the life of a dog. It is well suited for a beginning dog owner due to its thoroughness and explanations of care. It is also a good selection to help you determine which breed is right for you.In contrast to other dog books we have seen, this one offers several photographs of most breeds. This is important.

The book is just about a tomboy who does weird stuff with her neighbors. Like going up on roofs. Weird. And I was trying to put up with the book, because I like to give each book I come across a chance. But, I was on an AIRPLANE reading this. As if the flight is not boring and nauseating enough, the book made me fall asleep. I guess on the positive side, I got a good nap in before the plane landed.Please do yourself a favor.

Second of all, I don't want to encourage the names she calls her neighbors: Freeko and Fattabutta. And, third, I don't like having a book that jokes about \\"Mary is going to strip!\\" and girls being naked and Charlie being naked. Or about throwing booze bottles around.

But I did enjoy the book anyway. It was quick and fun. It's like taking your kids to see a Disney film only your not watching anything and the images are much more amusing for it.

I admire Jakes for beginning this book in the 1840s and tackling the pre-war era that is so important for fully understanding the war. So many historical fiction writers begin their works just as the war begins and the background is not properly set. Jakes' charcters, especially those of Orry, George, Charles, Madeline, Ashton, Brett and Billy are well drawn and capture the reader's sympathies.

Ive heard the announcers say the same thing but ive had the game for 2 months now they have A LOT to say. in franchise mode your players either get better, worse, or stay the same after every game which is one thing i dont like. it is very unrealistic because i dont think your going to be that much better after just one game.

So when i finally rented the game i put it in, played it and whooped the computer by about the final score of 70-3. After a while of beating the computer terribly bad i decided it wasnt very amusing any more although the fast game pace and good graphics is impressing, it just seems microsoft cant decide if it wants to make a blitz type game or a madden type game. i am a football and a football video game fanatic, but this one just didnt seem to get me excited.

I dont like the fact how if your not one of the coverage players, they do not make an effort for the ball or do much of anything. they will keep on the man and follow his routes, but i find it very hard to change quickly from a linebacker charging at the quarterback, to a strong saftey or a conerback and intercept or knock down the ball. to sum up the game, its a waste of money, so dont bother"},{"rating":"2","title":"Problems with this game","review":"Being a gamer, I was excited about Fever 2003.

I returned it after 1 hour of aggrevation to Toys R US and got another one. When I got this one, the game appeared alright at first. However, after the firts quarter, it began to freeze and do all of the asme things. I called Microsft and they suggested removing stored info from my hard-drive, but there was none.

Graphics, gameplay, etc., are all inferior and unrealistic. I played a game with the Rams, using their throwback uniforms, and they don't even look close to the actual uniforms. It's like the people who made this game have no background in sports at all, and are just going by memory, by the way an old Genesis game might have been about ten years ago. I've been a loyal Madden fan for years, but I'd have to say that the Sega NFL 2K3 game holds the top spot right now, all around. I don't know why NFL Fever 2003 has so many good reviews here.

Not anymore. NFL Fever has the easiest gameplay I've seen. Which makes it not as hard to play with more advanced movements. The franchise mode is great, and when you win the Superbowl, the game adds great historical players to other teams you face. For example, guys like Jim Brown come back and take you on.

One tip - if you plan on using it to cook a lot of baked goods, get some flat cooling racks to use with it as well and transfer whatever it is to the rack after it's been out of the oven a few minutes (or longer, depending on what it is). The flat racks fit on this perfectly and the extra air flow lets things cool even more quickly.

I could not make my cookies without it. It folds up for easy storage and serves a dual purpose of holding up to four cookie sheets or four cooling racks. Once my cookies are baked, I put my cookie sheets on the stand to cool at the recommended times. Then I transfer the cookies to a cooling rack to set which I place on the stand. I decorate one of my cookies with several thin lines of melted chocolate from a pastry bag. This rack makes it posssible for me to line my cookies up closely on a cooling rack at a comfortable height for me to efficiently accomplish this task. You do not have to open all four tiers; I frequently only us the bottom three. The only caution I would advise is don't bump the cookie sheets or cooling racks on the stand."},{"rating":"1","title":"great idea but crooked","review":"Loved the idea of this rack... whenever I entertain I end up with half-sheet pans all over the place.

I always carefully check reviews before ordering, but missed the one (out of close to 70 mostly glowing accounts) with a similar complaint.

I gave it an early test run to make sure there where no unexpected unpleasant surprises when I needed it. It performed wonderfully. I had no problem with unbalancing. The rack is sturdily built. I was able to make dozens of cookies without the usual overcrowding and overflow of pans and cooling racks on my table and limited counter top space. Storage is a non-issue. I keep it folded in it's narrow product box and it's stored on it's side with my serving trays.The only design flaw was the rough edge on the bottom of the metal perpendicular legs. They will scratch any surface it sits on, though sitting it on a folded dish towel is an easy quick diy way to resolve the problem. This is why I gave it 4 out 5 stars instead of 5 out of 5.

I put 2 cooling racks on the shelves and then have my cookie sheets loaded up, ready to go on the other shelves, no problem of anything tipping over. This saves so much counter space (not to mention my sanity when I'm trying to find somewhere to put another cooling rack. It folds up very thing, taking up much less space in my pantry than the stackable cooling racks I had. I am just loving, loving this product and telling everyone I know about it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"Bought this for when I bake pizzas each week.

There is no question that my computer is older technology having had a WIN 98 O/S which I upgraded to WIN ME. After talking with tech support and trying all the recommended solutions, tech support recommended I get a replacement or refund under their warranty program.

So the only way I can use it is to unplug stuff from the back of the computer or a powered USB port. There is no excuse for making a thumb drive that sucks that much power. I don't know if it is the fault of the LED light, but whatever the cause for it being a power hog, it severely limits the usefulness of this product. I recommend you pass on this one and shop for a thumb drive that will let you connect it to any USB connector. I'm back to using my old one. Really poor engineering decisions on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works as advertised, bad cap design.","review":"This drive was a good price, and it works as advertised, but the problem I have with it is that the cap does not snap on; it just slides on.

The actual letters are without any value, being a short postcard paragraph usually saying that Ludwig was not well, apologising for not writing and craving for human contact. There is some background biographical information which is inferior to accounts by von Wright and Norman malcolm. A chapter by Engelmann, a non philosopher, on the Tractatus is tortuous.

This CD contains some of the best music ever written, likable even to people who generally hate this type of music. And if you've seen the movie (a true classic, see it if you haven't)it is all the more enjoyable. Songs like \\"Peter Gunn theme\\" and \\"Sweet Home Chicago\\" will never grow old.

It was also meant to \\"maintstream\\" the blues culture, and it worked.There are many people in the United States who think, in fact, that \\"the blues\\" is what they heard in this film twenty-plus years ago.In fact, the film and the film's music is a cartoon. It is a commercial celebration of the blues, but it is not the blues at its most fundamental.Enjoy it anyway! It's like a great Warner Brothers cartoon version of the blues, and it's impossible to hate.

For those of us who can remember John Belushi, it's a trip down memory lane. For those who never knew him, it's prime John Belushi. Dan Aykroyd will surprise many with excellent singing talent.

It didn't teach me a great deal about Lenny's story, but then again that isn't the purpose of this book. The people who contribute include his friends from prison, from his bare knuckle boxing career, fellow actors, and of course his wife and children. It also goes into more detail about his acting career, short as it may have been, and his final battle with cancer, which he ultimately lost, but not without facing it head-on to the end. It gives more of an insight into the man he really was, and it is a fantastic tribute to the man who was, and always will be known as \\"The Guvnor.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Read McLean's autobiography first","review":"I am a casual fan of biographies of hardcore criminals. The last book I read on the genre wasUnderboss: Sammy the Bull Gravano's Story of Life in the Mafia, and this book pales in comparison. Prior to reading \\"The Guv'nor\\", I knew nothing about Lenny McLean. I found \\"The Guv'nor\\" on Amazon during my search for a book on some of Britain's \\"hardest bastards\\". Mr. McLean's life is indeed worth a book or two, but I wouldn't recommend this particular book unless you're a fan of his, and have read Mr. McLean's autobiography first. \\"The Guv'nor\\" is too disjointed with friends, acquaintances, and anyone who may or may not have ever met Mr. McLean recounting stories. As a result, there is little progression of Mr. McLean's life. The book reads like a compilation of blog entries on an uber-fan's web site and should've best left to that forum.

The King Tyr, plotting to become a dragon, must be stopped at all costs. So it is up to a slaveholding noble, a half-slave magic using girl and a man-dwarf gladiator to start the revolution. This may not seem that interesting, but the blend of cultures, from the greedy elves to the hairless dwarves, from the great ziggurat to the desolate sand wastes, really hooked me. The author does everything to bring out a different flavor to the setting. He refuses to give us the same old same old. I suggest at LEAST picking up the first book to check it out.

There's a lot of sex in this book, almost too much, so if this offends you be aware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"I have read quite a few historical fictions, and this one is definately sub-par. It is inspired by real people, but the author herself admits that one of her main characters is based on someone who existed nearly 100 years BEFORE the events in the book.

However, in his search for commercial success, he has abandoned all the inspiration that once brought out some rockin' albums. Don't get me wrong, I am not stuck in the 80's and I don't expect Nuno to be either. But, I am eager to see how Nuno has grown as a rock guitarist and overall musician, rather than the crap he is experimenting with just to fit in to modern day music circles. Population 1 is just another modern day pop/rock band that plays without any feel or emotion. There is not one song on any of teir releases that makes me want to hear it again, not one asssage, not one verse, notone riff that stands out.

Even so, it's one hell of a read. It's got everything one comes to expect from Big Jim. A dispicable, yet somehow endearing, likeable protagonist with a predilection for alcohol and women who bring out the worst in him. Thompson's descriptions of the binge drinking are excellent. Even if you've already read Thompson's \\"best\\" works, I suggest you give this one a try just for that. As in his other books, Thompson once again hits the nail right on the head when dealing with the profession of his lead character. This time around, it's a former army-man working at the Courier, a small town newspaper in Southern California. I caution the critical reader; you may find this a tad unoriginal of Thompson if you've read a lot of his other works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A singular crime novel","review":"Although \\"The Killer Inside me\\" and \\"Pop. 1280\\" are better known, this novel is one of Thompson's best as well. While most of his books have slack passages, this one is tight all the way through, and the character, a living metaphor, emobodies the idea of the book in every word and deed. The extreme toughness of this book is more subdued than other Thompson books, but that makes the effect of the novel that much more powerful.

If you're that hardcore gamer and need that much space to fit all your gaming needs, this is surely going to save you money, as buying 2 memory cards separately cost approximately 50 dollars, about the cost of a brand new just-released game.

It is a relationship like no other; friends of mine who have gotten dogs assure me it will change my life, and this book details the many reasons why, both the wonderful and not-so-wonderful ones. I find it lovely and touching. 4 stars only because Ms. Knapp keeps saying \\"the dog\\" every now and then for effect, in a kind of overly stylish way. Otherwise, I couldn't wait every night to get to it and read more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thoroughly enjoyable book.","review":"For anyone who has ever owned a dog, this is a wonderful book. I kept stopping and reading aloud some of Ms. Knapp's descriptions of her experiences with Lucille. And I found myself nodding throughout the entire book, indicating I knew exactly what she is talking about. I have had many of the same experiences with my dog, Shoosh. There is nothing else in the world quite like the human-dog relationship. There is something so rewarding about this bond.

She goes from being an average loving dog owner to some political dog owner nut. Not everyone believes that your dog should have a blue ribbon in obedience to be a good dog.

Too bad, it could've been a really good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A psycological portrait of a person who also has a dog","review":"This is one of the dullest books ever. Ms Knapp must be in therapy daily. She forever tells of her phobias,problems and concers. Somewhere there is a dog. So little is said about the dog. Its all about her and this weird relationship with a dog. The book is a true waste.Why did she write this book except to talk about her anxieties>Probably worst book of the year.who would care...."},{"rating":"1","title":"A wordy examiniation of needy humans and their canines","review":"Descriptions of mentally healthy humans and their relationships with their dogs are few and brief. Largely, Ms. Knapp's prose concentrates on people who treat dogs as if they are children or at least semi-human. She focuses on reclusive and troubled people who, having failed in normal healthy human relationships, turn to canines. Dogs are intelligent and friendly animals who try hard to please the pack leader. They are not antropomorphic little humans. Sadly, few examples of this more commonly held view exist in this book. A much better book about the human/canine relationship is \\"Understanding Dogs\\", by Clinton Sanders."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I've had dogs most of my life and consider myself a dog lover. I've read many good dog books and many good dog-people books. However, this book has very little to do with dogs or even one dog - the author's dog. It's really about a poor, neurotic person who latches onto a dog as a substitute for alcohol. A few years ago Ms. Knapp wrote about her alcohol addiction. Now it's a dog addiction. I'm hoping she has a life and finds something else to write about because she's not a bad writer. Too much is too much and this book is way too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for review, but not very much cell bio","review":"I love this book! It's so easy to read and it provides a good review for students taking molecular biology. However, I wouldn't recommend it as a resource for someone who is just starting to learn. The writing style assumes that you know the basic concepts already and sometimes skims through material quickly. However, I would have to say that this book is very readable and contains some excellent illustrations.However, my one complaint is the lack of coverage of cell biology.

Admittedly, the 5140 driver seems fragile, and that can be frustrating. But the clarity of the print, even in draft mode (which I use for many, many intermediate printouts) and the inherent lack of smearing that a laser printer provides, make it worth the small amount of trouble.If you have problems, try this: Remove the USB from your system, hook up another printer, install it, delete the Brother drivers.

Despite a full house for Christmas and all that goes with it, I still found myself compelled to return to it again and again, reading late into the night so as not to be disturbed. I finished it in only three days.The story is magical; the writing, brilliant. The language alternates between the lyrical voice of the Chinese Empress and the modern narrative of the author herself, transporting the reader back and forth through time and space with an almost effortless grace that defies description. In fact, this book simply is not to be *reviewed* as much as it is to be *experienced.* Read it, and you'll see what I mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"\\"Offspring of a Deathless Soul\\" tells the compelling story of the author as she unexpectedly adopts a Chinese girl. While the story is certainly an interesting one, it is told in such a fatastical voice with all manner of flowery language, hyperbole and mixed metaphors, that this reader is hard pressed to know whether the author has ever encountered a good editor. Neither a novel nor a memoir, the book reads like a cross between an article for a women's magazine and a standard issue pot-boiler historical romance.Strong editing and better self-control over her writing would surely have made this a far better book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Summarization","review":"Another classic Anne Rice book featuring the ever enticing vampire Lestat.

A must have for Vampire Chronicle fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was amazing; the best of the vampire chronicles.","review":"Wow! This book was wonderful. From start to finish, I couldn't put it down. The storyline by itself would've been kind of silly, but Rice has a way with words and she uses her gift so skillfully as to make us believe in the world of the vampires and even make us pity Lestat for being in the way of Akasha's evil plan. So intricately woven are her words, one might find themself picturing exactly the tone of Akasha's skin or what the Miami skyline must look like to a vampire, one of the \\"living dead\\". Altogether, an astounding book and definitely the finest of the Vampire Chronicles."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have!","review":"After Lestat becomes \\"Moiseur Rock star\\", he is captured by the infamous Akasha, the first vamp ever made.

Truly a must-have; I was captivated by every word!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A chilling tale","review":"Queen Of The Damned takes us deeper intot he dark world which Rice so masterfully creates, albeit an overly descriptive and wordy world. This tale is probablly the most intricate of the first three books and has the strongest storyline. The action is plentiful and at times you can even have more sympathy for Lestat than ever before. In this, our antagonistic hero is at the mercy of an overpowering entity that confounds his senses and emotions thoroughly. His mores are more in question and it illustrates adequately his torment. A step up from The Vampire Lestat, but twice removed from the more delicate Interview With A Vampire."},{"rating":"2","title":"GENIUS","review":"This fascinating story is about the origin of Vampires. Lestat discovers the Queen of the Damned aka Akasha, a beautiful woman who has a grand plan for the world. I really don't want to give away any more then that for it will ruin the story for you.Believe me when I say that there is no comparison between the book and the movie because it is so different. The movie skipped over all of the important details about how Vampires came to be and that is what makes this book SO good.Anne Rice is the master of creating theories about legends. Everything she writes is believable and you can really tell that she does her research well. I fully recommend this amazing book. Read it and treat yourself to a journey that you will never forget. It will change your view on the Vampire legend forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good.","review":"This is my favorite novel by Anne Rice, probably because my favorite character, Khayman is in it, and no other book has him that I know of.

If you saw the movie than dont assume its anything like the book. I liked the book a lot more than the movie. The background history of how vampires became is in this book.

Oh well I loved it :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Queen of Horror does it again!","review":"Rice reveals the history of the vampires, gives us beloved old ones and interesting new vamps alike in this riveting read.

Bite into it, folks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Third Book of the Vampire Chronicles","review":"This is the third book of the Vampire Chronicles. The story is largely a re-telling of the story of the book 2, Vampire Lastat, from the point of view of the other characters. It goes beyond the build-up and climax of Lastat though and ultimately explains the origins of all vampires. The ancient queen and originator of all awakes and destroys all but Lastat and his close circle. In the end it is the ancient witches of an even older order that kill the Queen of the Damned and peace is restored.Fun read for fans and a strong close to the opening trilogy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Anne Rice, Enough Said!","review":"People who have seen the movie need to read this book, because it is completely different from the movie story.

It seems that there are a lot of wasted characters. What's the point?! The only thing I can think of is they are introduced in this book, and they will apprear later in the series, or in another one. I was also sick of people bellyaching about how Lestate wrote a book about the \\"secrets of the vampire ways\\" and his songs are \\"dangerous for humans to know their ways.\\" Okay, we get it, some vampies are peeved b/c of what Lestate did...does every character have to moan about it? I sure hope that Tales of the Body Theif is much better.I have a problem with Rice's style of writing...she's to wordy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE READ ENTIRELY!!!

I am a huge Anne Rice fan and when I heard of people selling her autographed bookplates, I was appalled. [...] This is Anne Rice's fan page on Facebook. In the upper right hand corner of her timeline it states all you need to do is send a self addressed stamped envelope to receive 6 autographed bookplates.

I will never use Jackster again. I now know why they are the cheapest. They are worthless."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite of the Vampire Chronicles, and I love them all...","review":"I have always enjoyed reading about ancient Egypt. Anne Rice depicts pre-dynastic Egypt vividly and with historic accuracy in Queen of the Damned. She creates a fascinating mythology with a vampiric Egyptian queen who comes from a time before the great pyramids. Mrs. Rice concocts a rich, delightful tale here, and I strongly recomend reading Interview with the Vampire first, The Vampire Lestat second,then the Queen of the Damned last in order to guarantee a most splendid fantasy escape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vampires turn into flying super heroes","review":"I have read the vampire trilogy, from \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" to the \\"Queen of the Damned\\". The best book in my opinion is the second one, \\"The Vampire Lestat\\", although it does have some problems. \\"QOTD\\" is the worst. The broody and loquacious vampires of the first 2 books turn into flying super heroes which gather in a kind of bloodsucking Justice League against the Mother of all vampires. Lestat's rock songs have awakened this Egyptian beauty contest winner from six thousand years of catatonic trance and she has the key to world peace: wipe out all men from the face of the Earth (except one percent of us, if I am not mistaken). Apart from the very weak plot, what really bothered me in \\"QOTD\\" was the profusion of useless characters (Pandora, Santino, Eric, etc.). They have absolutely no bearing on the story and are clearly only teasers for future vampire books."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Epic in Boredom!","review":"Contrary to the general public, I find Anne Rice someone who got lucky with one book (Interview with the Vampire) and seemed to rehash a lot of the plot in the unnecessary Vampire Lestat. With this third book she again rehashes the first book and adds a lot of boring characters and endless subplots. I was willing to forgive the liberties that she took with the vampire legend in the first book because it was well written and had interesting characters and subplots. But this one is so boring and painful that I only had myself wishing it would end soon.The theater of the vampires and the characters there were so interesting the first telling but very boring in The Vampire Lestat. The Egyption vampires were so boring in Lestat and painful to read about in this epic of boredom.If you want to read a good vampire tale I suggest Dracula, Interview With the Vampire, or the early Stephen King novel dealing with vampires (the name escapes me now)."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Vampire book of all time","review":"To date this is still my favorite vampire fiction book. It is the only book I have read that actually explains how vampires came to exist in a reasonably plausible way (I mean it is fiction after all). The vampire history that Anne Rice gives life to in this book is just amazing and so in depth. It will keep you reading well into the night if you are a true fan of vampire lore. The movie version was a crying shame as it left out ALL of the actually tale. If you saw the movie and have not read the book, definitely read the book as it is a 1000 times better than that farce of a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great As Always","review":"I knew this one would be great, and it does not disappoint. I especially liked the renuion of Marius and Amadeo at the end of the book. I enjoyed the way she used dreams to weave the story together and bring it along to the finish. Is showed how connected all the Vampires in her world really are. As usualy, there were alot of new characters introduced and some were more memorable than others. Lestat is captivating as always, but he really does not dominate the central theme of the book as he does in others. You really get to see how some of the others think and feel more so than in other books. Kayman was very interesting! This book explains alot and ties up alot of loose ends. I will definately read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Non Stop Page Turning Epic","review":"Any Author who can create an abundant amount of characters as is in Queen of the Damned and leave the reader rooting for each and every one of them, except for the antagonist is a prolific writer and Anne is - just that. One of the most prolific writers of our time. From Interview With The Vampire right on through to Blood Canticle, Anne has created her Vampire Chronicles in epic form. She will always be the greatest writer of Vampire stories. Queen of the Damned is a mighty gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, completely enthralling from the very first page!!!!","review":"My new favorite series. Anne Rice is an amazing author; her word usage makes you feel as if you're there, living the story with all of the characters in the book. She also brought the characters to life, made them loveable (as ironic as that is seeing that they're all-well mostly-vampires), and make you want them to succeed in their journies to come. It also really makes you think, which I love. It was interesting, and I really can't say enough good things about it. I LOVED IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A little hard to swallow...","review":"But I still enjoyed it. I just found Ann Rice to be a little hard on men in this one. Seems as though she might've been having a bad \\"man\\" day when she wrote it. Still pretty good though."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book kicked!","review":"This novel was a great follow up to The Vampire Lestat. Finally a novel that picks up where the reader actually knows what is going on, though it takes so many twists and turns in the plot that it is so entising and difficult to put down. I would highly recommend this book to anyone that wishes to have to stop for a moment because your brain hurts from the comprehension!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vampires or X-men? A waste of words!","review":"First let me say that I loved the first 2 books in the Vampire Chronicles and eagerly picked up the third installment (QOD). What the hell happened? The vampires now seem to have turned into the X-men! Most of the characters in the story are completely USELESS, and are probably mentioned so that Anne can write future vampire books about them! The origin of the vampires SUCKED! The ending was SO ANTI-CLIMATIC! An utter waste of words! Anne most likely was under a deal to crank out a certain number of vampire books after the smash success of Interview with the Vampire. I sincerely hope the fourth book is better.Who knows what kind of liberties the movie will take to make this story a good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over written, over wrought","review":"A great example of an author not knowing when to quit.Interview and Lestat were both great fun, but in trying to give her story a universal theme [ie: the end of the whole wide world! (gasp!)], Rice completely looses the 'personal' aspects that made the earlier works work.In attempting to create a sweeping epic, Rice gets swept away in her own excess verbige, and would have profited greatly from a through re-write. Its breathtaking in the asmatic sense: everything in it is so BIG! and IMPORTANT!! that the reader simply stops caring. This book either needed to be much shorter, with 90% of its exposition excised, or much larger [a trilogy unto itself] allowing some modulation in the scream a minute pacing.Still, it does fill in some interesting blanks in the history of Rice's vampires, meriting a second star.But really, only die-hard fans need bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing (understatement)","review":"I tried to give this NO STARS but the system wouldn't accept it.\\"The Vampire Lestat\\" is a magnificent work. If you loved that book \\"Queen of the Damned\\" will be a huge disappointment. I kept turning the pages in this boring book hoping the story would pick up, the characters develop. (It didn't happen.) Shallow, uninspired, gross, and more than a little sleazy. Unless you are an Anne Rice fan who needs to read this book in order to say you have read \\"everything\\" I wouldn't bother. Haven't seen the movie but I can hope that a scriptwriter developed the characters and kept the action moving."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT IMPRESSED","review":"Contrary to popular opinion, I really did not enjoy this book as much as the previous two (Interview and Lestat). The book contains many characters which I didn't connect with or cared about. The reason being that the story jumps from one character to another without any real character development. By the time the story ended, I didn't care about Akasha or what happened to her. Only that it would end."},{"rating":"1","title":"A FALL FROM GRACE","review":"After the highly original and well-done Interview With the Vampire, Anne Rice certainly fell from my good graces with this mishmash of the supernatural. Rice has committed the beginner's cardinal sin (she was still a beginner when she wrote this) by peopling her novel with so many extraneous characters just to keep the pot boiling we need a scorecard to keep them straight. Many of them seemed to have nothing at all to do with the story. And where, for goodness sake is the plot? So many readers and reviewers talk about Rice's lush, gorgeous prose but I think purple prose is a more apt description as far as this novel is concerned. Sorry, Anne. You can't cover bad writing with flowery prose and get away with it. Your readers are just too smart!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally! Everything explained","review":"Whenever I read \\"Interview With the Vampire\\" and \\"The Vampire Lestat\\", I always had one question in mind: Where did all these vampires come from? Well, I got my answer in \\"The Queen of the Damned\\".Lestat is the narrator of this book; well, at least of the first part, and of a few chapters to come. Almost every main character has his or her own chapter, all told in the third person, except for the ones in which Lestat is the main character.The setting of each chapter takes many different twists and turns, from San Francisco, to Egypt, to Nepal, and so on.One of the best things about \\"The Queen of the Damned\\" is that it tells the history of vampires and how they came to be. And once again, it feels like Lestat is the author of the book instead of Anne Rice.It would be best to read \\"The Vampire Lestat\\" before reading this one, because it picks up where \\"Lestat\\" left off."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of all the novels","review":"I think this novel is the best Anne Rice has written in the last 4 years.The plot is excellent,the characters are cool(especially khayman and Marius), and the ending does not dissapoint. I have all the V.C.(from interview to Armand)and i read Queen about 5 times.This and memnoch r the best out there.( a few people didn't like memnoch because she fools all of us but that's another review).

There is also an introduction of some new characters which we are sure to meet again in the next books, Pandora being one of them. Akasha has great ideals and we can realise where she is coming from! It is also nice to learn more of the history of the vampire generations and we begin to understand them in more depth. So flawlessly written that we really can begin to believe in them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book of the Vampire Chronicles","review":"To me this was by far the best book of the vampire chronicles; the only other that could come close is Interview with the vampire. Akasha was beautiful, sad and terrifying and the mythology surrounding her is also rich and heartbreaking. Her relationship with Lestat is one of understanding and beauty and I started to feel for her even though she was an object of terror and evil. Anne Rice does a great job of transporting us and terrifying us in this book. I will read this again very soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Queen is not as helpless as she seems.","review":"Third book in the Vampire Chronicles.Lestat is back, narrating another book and breaking more rules. Lestat traces his vampiric roots back to ancient Egypt and we meet the first vampires, now as still as statues, seemingly unaware of the world around them. Lestat wakes Akasha, the Queen of the Damned, and sets an ancient prophecy in motion. Marvelous!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Vampire Chronicle Since \\"Interview\\"","review":"Out of all of Rice's Chronicles, this one has the best plot, suspense, history and characters. All of Rice's vampire characters come together in this one, making the novel very entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"unreadable","review":"I found this book to be unreadable. I could not get through it. I really liked Interview wiht the Vampire, and I thought the Vampired Lestat was pretty good, although not as good as Interview. This book though I felt was a total turd. Just ridiculous and uninteresting at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"queen of the dull","review":"Anne Rice is a very talented writer but what happened here? The book started off great, but then it just slides downhill. The part with Baby Jenks wasn't needed, the part with Armand and Daniel was unreal in its boredom, and the part when Maharet tells her story resurrected the book from its boredom but then it cuts back to Lestat and Akasha. Read this book only if you have read the first two"},{"rating":"1","title":"DOESNT COME CLOSE TO INTERVIEW","review":"The only decent book in the vampire chronicles is Interview With the Vampire. The other ones are all rubbish. The whole Those Who Must Be Kept thing was really silly and even sillier was the rock star thing and even sillier than that was that Talamasca or whatever it was called thing and even sillier than that....ect,ect,ect.It goes on and on. I wont even mention how annoying I find Lestat. Interview With the Vampire is a great book but when i read it I have to ignore all that stuff in the later books and pretend that they dont exist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing mish-mash.","review":"Vampires, witches, ghosts, evil spirits, curses, cannibalism, Egyptian mummies, telepathy, telekinesis. Just when you thought Anne Rice had crammed just about everything she could into a book, she throws in feminism. This book is a spirited attempt to weave what seems to be a universal theory of all paranormal experience, but unfortunately, it doesn't all hang together.The new characters weren't particularly interesting or well drawn. As always, Lestat is a fascinating character. I would have been happy if half of the mumbo-jumbo floating around this book had been exorcised and more of Lestat put in.Another thing that annoyed me was the constant, repititious use of 'the twins'. Yes, we did get that the twins were at the crux of the story, but was it necessary to mention them on almost EVERY PAGE? After a while, it became a joke to turn the page and scan for those two words."},{"rating":"2","title":"Languid, velvety worlds","review":"The third in Anne Rice's famous Vampire Chronicles, exquisite if you like purple prose and intricately laced descriptions of a setting now inextricably linked to the goth movement, and an inspiration to vampire fans the world over.I really like Anne Rice, because it's easy to lose yourself in her languid, velvety worlds with their heavy scents and charismatic inhabitants."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this more than once!","review":"You need to read this more than once if you don't have total recall. I didn't fully appreciate everything until the second reading. That's when I said, \\"Oh, that's what such & such was driving at\\". This is an excellent book, revealing a history only rivaled by the Mayfairs. This explains much of Lestat's personality and paves the way for future books. I enjoyed having a beginning of vampirism detailed and its consequences laid out. A definite must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bring a smile to your face","review":"Like most people I have watched Alan on the TV and not really thought any more about him. I picked up a copy of this book not knowing really what to expect. What can I say? It is a delight that had me laughing, crying and most of all remembering things that I thought I had forgotten from my own childhood and teenage years. Alan covers all the aspects of his life as a child growing up in a small community, through to the successful man he is today. If like me you are of a 'certain age', read this book, I guarantee it will delight you and bring the memories flooding back. Very well written and extremely interesting, Alan definitely has more to him than meets the eye!"},{"rating":"2","title":"City Kid review","review":"Mary MacCracken writes a detailed story of reaching out to a boy living in poverty.

If you wear this under your socks, make sure the socks go over the wrap on your ankle and you should be ok."},{"rating":"2","title":"Europe Endless...","review":"Only a European band could produce something as cool as Trans-Europe Express. This is Kraftwerk, at their height of creativity, and at the forefront of the German Electronic music tradition (a tradition faithfully kept by bands and artists like Popol Vuh, Tangerine Dream, Nik Tyndall and Klaus Schulze, to name only a few)... A very close second to my all-time Kraftwerk favorite 'Radioactivity', TUE contains the classic 'The Hall of Mirrors', a stunning and unexpected composition, which, together with Metal On Metal, Franz Schubert, and the title track Trans-Europe Express deliver one of the most delightful electronic music releases of all time. It is not hard to see, after listening to TUE, why Kraftwerk has been credited with popularizing electronic music in Europe and around the World. Beautiful, crisp sound and excellent production, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truly Beautiful Album","review":"When one hears that Kraftwerk uses basically all computers and synthesisers to make their msic, you might expect a very jagged and metalic sound. Trans - Europe Express, however, is suprisingly beautiful and very melodic. This album proves that Kraftwerk weren't just brilliant musical engineers and sound creators, but also incredible musically. This is Kraftwerk at their best. All the songs are great and flow beautifully. My personal favorites are Europe Endless and the title track. After almost 25 years, this album still sounds like it was made in the future. Trans - Europe Express is, at least, a very interesting album to listen to and at most a brilliant album, mixing melody with technology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trans-Europe Express","review":"During the 70's Kraftwerk released records at a much quicker pace then they have been doing the last 20 years. Trans-Europe Express was their 1977 release and their 6 th release that decade alone. The sound is truly timeless and to listen to synth sounds that have not been surpassed even today is quite remarkable. This record starts out with several hidden gems. Europe Endless and The Hall of Mirrors. The track Trans-Europe express is such an amazing track and verily one of Kraftwerk's magnu opus. The lyrics are quite good, and much of the singing is done without the vocoder which shows that they are much better vocalists then many give them credit."},{"rating":"2","title":"a study in genius","review":"The case can be made that TEE is Kraftwerk's best song, although it doesn't really stand out on this collection of perfect songs. Kraftwerk somehow analyzes the sounds of industrial Germany and spits out a beautiful, unhurried permutation of them. One could construct a music appreciation class around this album alone. Best if listened to on vinyl...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kraftwerk matures with their best album....","review":"While \\"Autobahn\\" blew me out of the water in 1974, \\"TEE\\" goes further! This album has gorgeously crafted sounds -- the cuts are entrancing. There is a unique mixing of elements here, classical and Eastern European, to go along with the boys' characteristic mastery of pure, pulsing rhythms. This is their BEST work, and \\"TEE\\" is unusual enough that it could appeal to people who didn't necessarily like \\"Autobahn.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"The Content of this book is like tissue paper.","review":"This book would never have been published if the author were not a federal judge. Entire book consists of \\"On the one hand, A, but on the other hand, B,\\" as the beginning of each paragraph. The rest of each paragraph is then filled with multiple quotes from multiple other persons. There is only one idea or concept in the book which is repeated over and over and over. Moreover, no matter how many times the author repeats himself, there is so much equivocation that whatever point the author may think he is making, it never really becomes clear to the reader what that point is."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent story","review":"This is a wonderful and touching story. I think the writter did a great job developing the characters and describing the story of their freindship. I'm looking forward to reading more work by this up and coming author!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just go for it!","review":"Already the first page of this book contains revelations that other books lack. Bradbury does not offer any fancy techniques or anything like that, he just - as the title promises - tells us to go back to the basics. Write about what comes up, what you care about. Even if you do not agree with him the book will stir up emotions, and help you create."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unmitigated Excellence","review":"This is an excellent piece from an excellent writer. For any would-be writer, this is an exceptional guide that will teach the basics of the creative writing process. Bradbury emphasizing writing by a method of free-association. He discourages writing that conforms to popular beliefs of society. He says that writing to please others is a great fault of many authors. One should write about his own interests and hates, this will strike passion in writing, which is a key ingrediant to success in the field. He explains that excellent writing ideas spring from the subconscious mind, or muse as Bradbury puts it. One must learn how to find his muse, feed his muse, and keep his muse...To effectively capture Bradbury's powerful message, one should read this piece of excellence him/herself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I expected - more","review":"I was expecting this to be a how-to on the art of writing.

In this book, Bradbury explains his methods to writing a story. Some of them are extremely simple. He makes writing a process that any neanderthal could understand and use.Bradbury has gathered a few of his old essays on writing that were collecting dust, and put them in this book for everyone to enjoy. He explains how he wrote his novels and how he barely got by in life writing short stories for various magazines. Some of his tales are quite amusing.This is a great book for a aspiring author. It teaches great lessons on creativity, thought process, and imagination that you can't find anywhere else. What better way to learn to write than from the master himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"I bought the book because I liked the title and admire Bradbury but somehow, I just couldn't connect to the book.

I found Bradbury's advice to be obvious (e.g., write for yourself, not for the money or market) and his techniques to be simplistic. He does reassure readers that good writing may take awhile to cultivate. Common sense. Perhaps this book is better for the Bradbury fan and not for the ambitious writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic!","review":"This book has been a powerful influence in both my writing and my teaching about writing.

I wanted to get clips where it was less strain to open and release. After I skimmed through some 5-star reviews versus the lower ratings, I thought that I'd be able to make Twixits work for me. I was surprised at how short the longest one was (product image uploaded) and the not-so-thick width that each clip is capable of enclosing. Thick bags like cereals, whole bean coffee packages, and chips were difficult or at times impossible to clip over after strategically folding the bag to a point to avoid any bulging of the bag. Bags as thin as bread packaging is ideal for these clips because it would fit the length of it too but I would not recommend it for bags that are any thicker. I'll be sticking to spring clips for the thick bags still.

I never had enough. I broke one of them and decided I really had to get more. Thankfully I found them on Amazon. I immediately ordered them. They are better than chip clips because they hold tighter and seal across the bag.

Well, none of my chip etc bags, once scrunched up at the top, can fit it any shape or form within these clips...even the larger ones. So the only thing I could do was take the very top open corner of the bag, and clip the CORNER only, by putting the Linden clip on it at an angle.I had to throw these out.

And while compared to other releases from Sepultura it fails in comparrison but the fact still remains that within the genre of Thrash, Arise is one of the hands down undisputed greats.The title track opens the album aggresively letting the listener know just exactly what they are in for with this ride. It keeps up through out the rest of the album. 'Desperate Cry' being the crown jewel off the record. Slow and crawling, sort of like death creeping.

The songs are more melodic and memorable than Beneath the Remains, but it's also faster and heavier than Chaos AD or Roots. They slow their songs down just a little and get to the right pace and speed. It doesn't have as much tribal influences as Chaos AD but it has some and shows a sign of change.

My favorite tracks are Arise, Dead Embryonic Cells, Desperate Cry, Altered State, Subtraction, and Orgasmatron. However, Murder has its moments, Infected voice has a really cool lick in the middle, and Meaningless Movements and the Intro are also pretty good. The only songs I really dont like are CIU and Under Seige. The Desperate Cry at the end is almost identical to the earlier one. Orgasmatron, originally by Motorhead, is probably the best Sepultura cover ever. The CDs musical aspect is very similar to Beneath the Remains, but rythym, notes, and time are more varied, and several songs have interesting sound effects as introductions. The overall sound quality of the CD is excellent, and the cover art is great.

Is this a tech book or a book on?Wouldn't suggest using this book as your only resource, and it's too long for a study guide.I used this book, EXAM CRAM and Self Test Software (Big Red testing software), one week of study, installing and playing with all the software (Server, CMD, DHCP/DNS, Fasttrack, NDPS, NSS, ZENWorks) passed the exam on my first try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"Book was too long and drawn out for a certification study guide.

Printing it was a disgraceful waste of trees."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less annoying, but less informative","review":"Having suffered through David Clarke's books on Netware 3 & 4, I expected more of the same with this text (i.e. technically accurate, but filled with mindless yammerings, pointless quotes and those dreadful 'Moments of Zen'). Well, someone must have complained, because there is far less filler than in his previous works. Unfortunately, there is also less technical information. Most disappointing is his nearly non-existant explaination of NSS. Also, his lab excercises seem to leave out pertinent info, and more than once I've had to go digging around other references to successfully complete the assignments.This book is passable, but no more than that. Unfortunately, I've not seen anything better than Clarke's books, at least when it comes to Novell. Fortunately, for other subjects, there's always Sybex!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Written for a 9 year-old!","review":"The amount of fluff in this book is rather annoying. (ZEN, InfoBahn, NW5 rules the world, etc. etc. etc.) Clarke, just write about the technical aspects of the NOS and skip the childish attempts to entertain the reader. The people reading this book are already CNE's wanting to update their cert to 5.x... they don't want, nor need your poor attempts at entertainment. Had the fluff been omitted from this book, it would be a nice little 300-350 page study guide (and had a few items not been overlooked). As it is, you find yourself skimming or skipping pages due to the annoying attempts at cuteness, and possibly missing an important detail in the process. Do yourself a favor and either buy another book or purchase CNEQUIZR... you'll learn more from that practice exam than you will from this book. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"yet another helpful book from mr. clarke","review":"As usual, David Clarke publishes a helpful tool for CNE's to use on their journey in becoming Netware 5 certified.

It's this very style that probably helped you through the first few of his books.

This book does not achieve that for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Technically Inaccurate","review":"I attained my CNE certification with the help of David James Clarke's CNA and CNE Study Guides. I found them accurate, readable and entertaining. Using his latest book to prepare for test 529, CNE Update to Netware 5, seemed like a natural thing to do. This book, however, is difficult to read and full of technical inaccuracies. UDP is described as \\"an IPX standard\\" (it's an IP standard) and CMD as \\"the encapsulation of IP datagrams in UDP datagrams\\" (it's IPX in UDP). The useful material in this book, all but hidden in fluff, is the same as in the student kit for course 529 and supplemental materials available from Novell's web site.

I like how everything comes in one box (flush mount, transducer, etc.). But!!! Be warned, if your boat is more than 10 feet long, you will need the extension cable for the transducer. Oh and by the way, it is a special order item at boaters world type shops as well. So if you are like me and purchase this GPS and are excited to get to the weekend to get it installed, you will be dissapointed to find out that transducere cable isn't close to being long enough.

We are on our second copy, having worn out the first one. As far as simpicity of directions, the book says everyone from beginners to master craftsmen should be able to follow the directions and most of the time the directions really are clear and concise. However,saying that beginners should be able to follow the plans in the book is a bit of a stretch. As an example, the wiring directions leave much to be desired. The \\" master craftsman\\" building my house, has had to go to other sources, such as the internet, to get the help he needs. Full blown photos of the rooms would also be a nice touch.I would recommend this book to anyone with some experience in miniature building, but be prepared to do a little head scratching and have other sources for areas outside your expertise."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hidden gem of a movie","review":"Actually a pretty amazing film, centered in only one setting, in and outside a cabin. It requires great writing and good acting to keep one engrossed to the end, but I found this movie to be a serious look at how people, friends, might react if confronted with this information. Those looking for slick sci-fi special-effects \\"entertain me\\" fare will be disappointed, as a few were in their reviews, but I was pulled in and kept in the story the entire time. If you like a movie that challenges your ideas and presents (what seems like) the impossible in a way that makes you wonder if it could be true, this is one of those movies.

It's a nice set-up and enables a wide-ranging discussion about history and humanities.Problem is, any human who survived that long wouldn't behave as the lead character behaves. Our brains are pattern-recognition machines and over time such a long-lived human would see all the clockwork of our hardwired behaviors. Such a person would feel infinitely weary, because the futility of most life would be far too apparent.Aside from this, it's a nice movie and quite atypical of American films.

This however, contains horrible acting with a horrible plot. Yes, it could be interesting if it had flashbacks included with the storytelling, but it simply has dialogue. The worst part is the fact that the writer tried to suggest the Swoon Theory could be true! Jesus faking his death? Besides asphyxiating He was STABBED! This theory has been disproved many years ago and has to be discredited every decade or so because people aren't good historians. This movie insulted my intelligence. If you have any understanding of a Roman crucifixion you will be insulted that anyone could try to suggest someone could survive it. So, this movie LOOKS interesting and the concept IS interesting, but don't be fooled--IT'S NOT REAL!

It almost appeared to be a copy of a copy....I found the acting and dialogue stilted and unimaginative. The title and brief were interesting enough for me to buy the DVD, and to my shame it was enough of a come on for me part with good money for a poor quality product. As many of us have said at one time or another, \\"If I had only known...\\" It is sad to say that the two dimensional action film of the \\"Highlander\\" had more character and meaning with the slogan \\"There can only be one.\\" than this DVD.

It takes place in a small cabin out in the middle of nowhere, so don't look for special effects or fancy scenery in this one. Good actors and actresses, and the dialog was, in my mind, very real. So often, these types of movies get pushed to ruin with unrealistic dialog.

But often times, sci-fi tends to cross the line without any good reasoning. This movie explores the improbability of an un-aging man but does so by building credibility despite obvious skepticism. A nice climax too.You could watch a movie like this 100 years from now and it would still be good. And it could have very easily be made/written a 100 years ago. Such an interesting concept. I hope that an extended version of this to be made into a TV series. There is so much more to it.I can understand some religious fanatics poorly rating this movie, but that's what you would expect if from them.I am going to read more from this author.

Forget buying it; don't even waste your bandwidth downloading it for free.p.s. I was forced to give the film at least 1 star to submit this review.Update: It's been 4 years, so I gave it another chance after a friend mentioned it. I wanted to be open-minded.

But I should have seen it coming; the inevitable rant against Christianity and the stereotypically indignant, infantile Christian who objected.

It is incredible that the entire show is pretty much one long conversation in a cabin. Little \\"happens\\" and there's a lot of talk. But what talk! It's simply a fascinating journey into the \\"what if\\" of history. Sure, it's a bit contrived and loses credibility at times, but for the most part the excellent acting keeps it from falling apart. It's been a few days since I watched it, and I'm still mulling it over. Definitely not for every taste, but if you're willing to suspend your disbelief for and hour and a half (and don't need a lot of action in a film) you might give this a shot. \\"Thin slice it\\" -- watch the first 10 minutes and you'll know if it's for you or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpectedly Stimulating","review":"I stumbled across this movie by chance while looking for something new on Netflix. The premise looked interesting, and though I was expecting scene changes, more visuals, and action, I was pleasantly surprised that it had none of these. It isn't often that a filmmaker is foolhardy enough to trust an entire movie to a conversation, and it only works when the material is this thought provoking. These actors do their job fitting into the different characters in my own mind, asking the questions I would ask.This isn't a movie for any person susceptible to modern pop media, with short attention spans, but rather those who like to ponder quietly on alternative theories in the company of a few friends. If that is you, then you will love this movie as much as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life undying isn't necessarily self realizing","review":"The prolonging of a lifetime is alluring to many. The challenge is keeping focus on what is to be gained by existence. When all about you pass into history while you continue the search for purpose beyond life's experiences, can understanding be enough to achieve the golden ring? Is death to be unwittingly defied? Life can be as full or empty as desired. In the turmoil of living, we reach for shared wisdom in our current circle of fellow travelers, with a constant eye on the life clock. When the hands of the clock no longer move forward, the question becomes why instead of when."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real make you think movie","review":"I first saw this movie as a \\"throwaway\\" because I didn't have anything to do...But after watching it I stayed up late into the early hours trying to wrap my head around what I just saw...I had to own it so I could see it over and over...It is very understated in it's delivery, to the point that you don't know what happened until it is over...then you say \\" what the blazes\\" and have to watch it again and again...I am addicted!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow Pace But Worth Watching","review":"Not everybody's cup of tea but worthwhile for real Sci-Fi buffs.

See it to believe it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not well written or shot","review":"It's a very intersting concept but just below satisfactorily executed. The writing would have been better if the narrative fit in stories with detail of the man's life over the last 14,000 years; instead the main character just provides generalities of his past life or events people already know. The viewer really would have been captivated if the main character told details of history that no textbook could tell; he didn't, putting it low in the scale of interesting. Acting was fine enough to average, just not very well directed and shot. It probably would have made a good stage play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, poor execution","review":"The story idea that someone of ancient age walks among us is not new or original, but it is an intriguing concept pregnant with possibilities. Unfortunately, the midwives of this film delivered a stillborn.The 14,000 year old man is played with little conviction, and comes across as a whiny schmuck who's gained darn little insight into the human condition. If the film couldn't offer wisdom and inspiration, I would have settled for a little juicy gossip about what went on behind the scenes. What's the deal with Catherine the Great and her horse? Was Napoleon a cheap tipper? Did Augustus Ceasar have bed wetting issues?I don't mind a film that's all dialogue. I enjoyed \\"My Dinner With Andre\\". But this film's dialogue tells us little and takes us nowhere.

It provokes thought in such a way and easily belongs up there with such films as 2001; A Space Odyssey, The Quiet Man, and any series, including Star Trek.Considering the writer of the script wrote some of Star Trek:OS most memorable episodes, it's little wonder that the movie manages to resonate so much.The story focuses on a professor who, at his going away party, reveals himself to be a cro-magnon over 14,000 years old. The score is understated, which is fine, because the material doesn't require a musical cue to tell you when to feel or think something. The material already has you.Combine great script writing with epic performances by John Billingsley, David Lee Smith and Tony Todd and you have one of the most riveting pieces of science fiction made in a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"THOUGHT-PROVOKING SCI-FI!","review":"\\"The Man from Earth,\\" the last story from legendary sci-fi writer Jerome Bixby, is a thought-provoking film about the possibility of a man living for over 140 centuries. It is terrifically-written, with some fine performances from a terrific cast. Of course, this film does deal with some themes that some will find hard to swallow. As a Christian myself, I was able to enjoy it. As with \\"2001: A Space Odyssey,\\" I enjoyed it for what it was: a good piece of science-FICTION.It is definitely a different kind of sci-fi: one that makes you THINK, and doesn't try to win the viewer over with visual effects and action sequences. If you enjoy thought-provoking sci-fi, then you will enjoy Jerome Bixby's \\"The Man from Earth.\\"Movie/DVD Grade: A-"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie","review":"This was an excellent movie. Usually, a story set in a single location, in the real world, and in a very average looking room, has to be pretty impressive in terms of plot, acting and drama. That's what makes this movie so good. It's a great intellectual exercise masquerading as a movie. It pulls you in such that you find youself asking the same questions as some of the characters in the movie. Not alot of twists and turns but an excellent concept."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected.","review":"This film is really an \\"action\\" flick of sorts for amateur historians and philosophers. Sure, the historical information presented might be sensationalized and and inaccurate at times; but the intriguing nature of the film's premise remains (independent of the horrid acting as well). The dialogue kept me glued to my television screen; I would consider this film a guilty pleasure of mine.Oddly enough, the historical inaccuracy that bothered me the most was one regarding Columbus and his expedition (unlike most offended by the religious components).It is important for everyone viewing this film to realize this film is concerned with drawing wild conclusions and hypothesizes from daily thought, not presenting factual information.Relax and let your mind wander with the concept."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Man from Earth","review":"A great thought inspiring movie. To get all the sub-text and nuance you need to watch it a couple of times. I can't help but think how I'd react if I got a chance to hear this in person.

Totally destroys any chance of the viewer feeling they are watching and listening to a real conversation.As well the great concept is ruined by pushing it to absurd limits. A man who has lived 14000 years - wonderful... That part is great. But this one person who just happened to have this unique whatever that keeps him alive also just happens to also be Jesus. And just happened to hang out with Van Gogh... Etc.And this man who has lived thousands of years and studied with the Buddha chooses a group of not-so-bright academics to finally tell his story?

I have no idea how any one in their right mind would think that a plant could survive in such a mess of old grocery bags and packing tape.(3) When I contacted the vendor to complain, he made it sound like I was going to get my money back promptly. It's been 4 weeks since he said \\"you will get your money back; expect it by this friday!\\"(4) Now, the vendor won't even respond to my emails.These sellers are a joke.

It covers Christianity, Plato, Konrad Lorenz, Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, B. F. Skinner, and Jean-Paul Sartre. It is lucidly written. One could probably criticize it for making too many generalities, but its only real fault is its brevity; one would wish it to cover many more thinkers in the same fashion."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Or Nothing? Dov'e L'Amore. Yes!","review":"There are a few good mix's of All Or Nothing on here. But There is Alot of Dov'e L'Amore Mix's They are sweet. They have good R&B. I Suggest this cd if you like the song. It was totally worth $8.00. This is a Cher Collectors Item!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby it's all or nothing!","review":"This is by far my favorite Cher song. You wouldn't believe the trouble I had trying to find this single. Patience paid off though, and I'm glad to own it! There's 4 mixes of the wonderful anthem ALL OR NOTHING, and 6 mixes of D'OVE L'AMORE. The Metro Radio Mix of All Or Nothing is nice, very much like the original, but almost better. The Almighty Definitive Mix is my favorite, Almighty always does a great job of turning the songs into anthems, and All or Nothing definately fits that bill. The Danny Tenaglia Cherbot Vocaldub is pretty cool too, so is the International Mix. The D'ove L'amore mixes are good too, my favorites are the Tony Moran's Anthem Mix, Tee's Radio Mix, and Ray Roc's Radio Mix. Overall, I had trouble obtaining this one, but it's worth it, great mixes all throughout!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Who could give this album a bad review and sleep well?","review":"This album is one of ten i could not go on living without. If i could only pick ten albums to hear the rest of my life, this is one of them. If you like serious hard core thrash, this is the definition to your collection. Most music is dwarfed by this albums power and emotion."},{"rating":"2","title":"death metal at its best","review":"this CD catupulted Sepultura into the mainstream. It had better recording quality to go with Sepultura's talent. Sepultura begins to shift to more political songs on this CD. At times the guitar/bass/drums sound almost metallicaish, but max's monotonic growl gives Sepultura a distinct sound. The CD has been compared with Slayer's masterpice, \\"Reign in Blood,\\" and in fact I myself prefer this CD to Slayer. For any death metal fan, this is a must. However, those who are great fans of the newer Sepultura work such as Roots and Chaos A.D. should be cautious because this CD is very different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"This is a landmark thrash album. It comes a bit late in the genre, but it's better than any Slayer that I've ever heard and it's almost up there with early Metallica and Megadeth. The only problem with this album is that sometimes Max's vocals go way off beat with the music behind him. It's not just that it goes slower, I don't mind that, but that it goes just plain off beat.But that's the only flaw. The riffs are tight, the leads are scorching, blazing roads of fury... it's all great. My personal favorite of this album is \\"Stronger than Hate\\". Brilliant metal album, Sepultura do not get the credit they deserve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beneath the Shear Excellence","review":"I believe this is Sepultura's best album. I love Arise but BTR is better musically. They're thrash all the way but manage to change the riffs and avoid monotony. Not many thrash bands do that. This is probably their classic. It's their Reign in Blood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Of Course!","review":"The 80's was a great time for underground Thrash metal acts like Magadeath, Metallica, Anthrax and Slayer to release classic albems, but my one of my personal favorite thrash albums, and bands came straght out of South America. Beneath the Remains is simply amazing. The lyics and drumming are unmatchable. It sounds as if there are two drummers instead of just one. Even though I like Sepultura's lastest stuff fine, they will never match their older music. Beneath the Remains is one of my favorite albums.I am a teen, but it is no supries to learn that there are lots of adult headbangers around today thanks to Sepultura or a band alot like them. Sadly alot of kids my age are stuck in a world of Limp Bizket and Kid Rock. I guess they don't know what real metal is. Long Live Sepultura!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MASTERPIECE of SHEER BRUTALITY","review":"this is my first sepultura album but not the only one i've heard and let me tell ya this album wipes the floor with any slayer cd both musically and time length igor cavalera is as good as dave lombardo or better the drum work is awesome,Andreas Kisser's guitar work takes out kerry king's max cavalera doesn't growl but his vocals go perfect with every song i only make the comparison between sepultura and slayer because both had the same sense of death/thrash metal although slayer is great i think sepultura is better this disc gets you in a thrashing mood with blistering fast yet clear guitar work and fast double pedal i wouldn't change a thing on this album even the drum tracks on the remastered version are enjoyable"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best debut thrash ever!","review":"Megadeth are my fav band, Metallica just suck and Sepultura has by far the greatest thrash metal debut album ever. This album has everything, every song is a master piece and no one can touch this band in it's classic form. I hope they do a reunion soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album","review":"This album is the best for me. I think Sepultura was at the top on this album Beneath The Remains!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrash classic","review":"This is sepultura in their glory days. Back when they could compete with any of the metal heavyweights, such as Slayer, Metallica, etc. Before they fell in love with korn's production. Before mallcore max left to form soulfly. Sepultura were thrash gods. The best tracks: Inner Self, Stronger than Hate, Mass Hypnosis, Lobotomy, Primitive Future.The riffing and drumming on here are killer. I especially like the drumming. Igor is easily one of my favorite drummers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sepultura's follow up album from Schizophrenia","review":"This is Sepultura's follow up album from \\"Schizophrenia\\",this is my fav album,it provides wicked crunchy thrash metal riffs,to pounding double bass drums,and hatefull vocals from the MAN Max Cavalera,This is my fav cd in my whole cd collection,Sepultura never gets old,And i agree,if i could give this album more than five stars,i would."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast , heavy and dark !","review":"This album kicks ... !!! if you love fast, evil , dark and in your face black metal and thrash and speed metal buy this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"That's the only word I can think of to describe this masterpiece! Simply AWESOME! This is one of my all time favorites...killer riffs, awesome drums; and the brutal aggression of Max's vocals!! Killer! A must have for any metal music fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sepultura's heaviest!","review":"Before this album, Sepultura struggled to make a decent album. Their first two albums were plagued with horrible production quality and lack of substance but then in 1989, Sepultura released \\"Beneath the Remains\\" which became an instant classic. First of all the production quality was much better and still holds up today. This is Sepultura's heaviest album and the one with the best guitar work. The best solo is probably the one in \\"Inner Self\\". This album doesn't have the Brazilian influence on \\"Chaos A.D.\\" and \\"Roots\\". This is straightforward death/thrash metal that's very similar to Slayer. My favorite songs are the title track(one of the best intros ever) and \\"Inner Self\\". This is a must-own album and is my second favorite Sepultura album. Only \\"Chaos A.D.\\" comes ahead. Avoid all of the Derrick Green [...]!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent product","review":"I purchased it very recently and the quality is so excellent....i would love to purchase more if i get at the same old price....i would recomend to my friends to buy without having a second thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Real World applications using EJB","review":"Beginning on page 17 this book takes the reader on a fantasy trip through the world of EJB and J2EE. I have reviewed this book with fellow consultant from BEA and we have found an alarming number of mis-statements about EJBs.

Based upon the word 'applying' in the title I thought I would receive a more advanced book that would delve into advanced issues of design, implementation, and the lessons learned from the first round of EJB applications. However I received just another 'learning EJB' book and it is marginal at even that task. The author does provide extensive code examples, however too much ink was wasted displaying and discussing code that had little or nothing to do with the concept that was presented. Only the most basic topics are covered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much fluff, not enough substance","review":"Readers of this book will not be prepared to use Catia in a professional environment.

We may never know why. By this time Lydon was becoming a self-parody, a whiney old man who hadn't realised that his time, as everybody's time must, had passed. 'Acid Drops', a rail against censorship, is entertaining enough, but the rest of the album is plain dull - grinding metal riffs with Lydon screeching over the top. The level of social commentary rarely strays beyond the 'religion makes us guilty / people should be allowed to say what they want' level, but it all sounds passionless, as if Lydon is deliberately mouthing platitudes to annoy us. Which, given that this is John Lydon, he probably is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh no.","review":"After the slide of the ill fated Commercial Zone album, P.I.L balanced between a sad side show with a college 'hit' and an experimental nightmare.

Acid Drops starts off promising enough, with a hard rocking riff, but then towards the end, the song is ruined by repeated samples the line \\"No future...\\" from the Sex Pistols' \\"God Save The Queen.\\" Luck's Up is kind of pointless. Cruel is the only track that is truly interesting sonically, with Lydon juxtaposing his low monotone voice with his high squealy voice. God is just a bad, pointless song. By this point I quickly lose interest. Covered and Think Tank are decent, but they don't hit me like songs from 9 or Happy. The rest of it is just boring and monotanous.I don't know why there is such a drop off between 9 and this one. The McGeogh / Dias lineup sounds stale, which is hard to believe after the two previous albums which were dynamic and interesting musically. But also, Lydon doesn't really have anything interesting to say.Overall, TWIN is a disappointing ending to PIL."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING !!!!!!","review":"Last and final album for this glorious band.1992.I love their more accessible period, that is to say, their latest albums like Happy ? but this one is dull, unimaginative, and sounds like it had been jammed in the studio, probably to fulfill contractual obligations ? .And god forgive me but it has a certain air of Rush (the canadian prog-metal band)to it.Even guitar god John McGeoch seems to have run out of ideas on this one. All tracks sound alike, and the prime appeal of the band to me, John Lydon's voice, is insultingly low in the mix.Nevertheless, the sound is incredibly hi-fi .For completists ONLY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting stuff to develop over a long time","review":"Great book. Very interesting stuff that you've heard Simon Phillips, Vinnie Collaiuta, and the like do forever. this takes the \\"mystery\\" out of some elusive concepts and gives you a systematic way to develop the tools. It's kind of like the Chaffee material in that it is very well laid out, systematized, and organized to go through all (or most) of the permutations. Especially great if you're disciplined enough to go through it a little bit at a time b/c it's not easy stuff. It can give you a bit of a headache. Once the concepts, feel of the displacements and modulations, and application of the material within a musical context are together, you're going to impress a lot of people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Characters","review":"Too many characters. Few of them really memorable. Hamilton doesn't describe them physically so they all run together. I had to write a chart in the front flap of the book to try to keep them straight.
