C'mon Amazon, what gives?!6/19-update - after it finally arrived, it turned out to be good stuff. Nice insulation, stripped easily, looks good.

Some of the information is incorrect such as the address of a particular cemetery (a fairly standard inconsistency). Is it worth its hefty price tag? Probably not. I didn't find the kind of information I was looking for. After looking over this book, I realized I had just tossed a nice piece of change out the window and would probably not use this as a source of reference in the future.

This is not a theoretical B-School analysis or some abstract case-study analysis, but a very practial, hands-on set of \\"how tos\\" the authors' have proven throughout their years of working with some of the speediest companies around. Their access to the highest levels of companies like Schwab speaks volumes about their credibility and the value of their content. Though every scenario they describe may not apply to each and every business model, the general ideas they put forth are hugely valuable for any practicing executive.

Waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous restatement of basic business practices!","review":"This book fails to live up to its hype. Within the first few pages, it becomes apparent that the authors are merely restating obvious principles of basic business practices as they tell you to look for new trends, search out new markets, observe what is happening around you, etc. Perhaps the most ludicrous example is contained on page 34 where they recommend that you go out and hire some gay employees and advisors, and if you are uncomfortable with that concept, seek out psychiatric help to find out why you feel that way. This is a lifestyle/political statement that has no place whatsoever in a book touted as being the key to business success. This book is little more than pablum for the average business person and certainly isn't worth what it costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Retitle this book to: How to Lose Credibility in Business","review":"This book lacked any new insight into business. At times it was completely ridiculous. The authors presented little regarding the basic rules of business and filled the remaining pages with nonsense.

Just Sharp!","review":"Nail clippers are not like knives. Knives lose their cutting surface quickly; however, Tweezerman Nail Clippers do not lose their cutting edges anywhere near as quickly and that alone is fantastic. Many folks including our household will use clippers too long past their cutting utility. These are stainless steel and I do not expect an edge loss for years especially the way they are working now. Clean and non-ragged cuts make the job so easy and appearances especially good. The slightly and almost unseen rough surfaces of the clippers permit easy use and a reduction of slippage. The way that the balance is used they are just easy to manipulate and use with ease. Overall, just a fine set of clippers and worthy of continued use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rusting...","review":"Nice clippers, but I paid their comparatively hefty price because they were advertised as stainless and I like to buy things that will last. The larger pair have multiple rust spots on them after less than six months. By definition, not made of stainless steel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a clean cut","review":"Pros:* They look goodCons:* Cut is not clean- thin flap left holding the trimming to the nail so that you then have to tear or pull the trimming off and then file the ragged edge.* blades are tall and vertical so that it's a challenge to get them under the nail (between the nail and fingertip)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"Ugh! Sorry, I NEVER write bad reviews but this product is a piece of trash. The little clipper sprang apart the first time I tried to use it. I finally got it back together after about twenty minutes of frustration. The finish of both clippers is dull which makes them feel cheap, and the blades are so blunt that you really have to work to cut the nail, which is not very reasuring during use.Basically you could get a much better product by spending $2.99 at your local drug store. Don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkably high quality nail clippers","review":"Who thinks about things like this? I don't think I've ever seen a pair of nail clippers as well-made as these.

Something of a minor revelation to learn that there are high-quality clippers to be had. I'm really impressed. Very useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"almost perfect","review":"These are excellent clippers and cut amazingly smooth...no hangers or sharp edges @ all...but I have to knock off one star for their lack of a nail cleaner...I really thought it would not matter to me but I have to say after a couple weeks with the new clippers I do miss the little swing out on my cheapos... worth the price and would buy again"},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR CLIPPER SET","review":"I TRIED THESE CLIPPERS AND THEY WERE NOT THAT GREAT. THEY DID NOT CUT AS I EXPECTED. THEY DID NOT SEEM TO BE SHARP. IT COULD BE THAT I RECEIVED A BAD SET BUT IN ANY EVENT I WAS NOT SATISFIED. THEY ALSO DID NOT HAVE A NAIL CLEANER - THAT YOU CAN OPEN FOR LEVERAGE WHEN CUTTING. I FEEL BADLY - THEY LOOKED SO GOOD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, I'm unimpressed with these","review":"I was so excited to purchase this set for my husband whom is very pickey about his clippers. Him and I both love tweezerman tweezers, so I figured that these would be equally impressive. Well, they're not. They are so hard to press down. My nails are thick, but my husband and sons aren't at all. My son's are actually very thin, so there should not have been any problem with his at all. If you need a real workout for your hand, then go ahead and get these, if not, consider something else. I'm going to continue my search for the perfect clippers. If these loosen up, I'll update my review, but I don't think there's any hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tweezerman : Only Makes Good Tweezers","review":"These clippers, both of them, do not cut clean. Instead, they leave sharp, ragged edged nails. I don't know why I bought another Tweezerman product. The scissors I bought for trimming my mustache pull, not cut, my hair which HURTS A LOT. I originally bought a pair of tweezers for my eyebrows that were actually really good. The rest of their products I have tried however, are junk. Stay away from Tweezerman. Go spend a little more money on something German."},{"rating":"1","title":"If it's stainless steel? Why the rust?! And cut toenails aren't shaped that way!","review":"It's nice to cut your nails when they're wet. They cut easier and are less likely to blast into someone's eye. Hence it's nice to have stainless steel nail clippers that you might take into a shower or something.However I left my Tweezerman fingernail clippers in the shower ONE day and the darned thing started rusting where the blades are welded together!So I've kept the toenail clippers out of the shower and tossed the fingernail clippers. However the toenail clippers are destined for the trashcan too. Take a close look at the toenail clipper. Blow up that picture. The shape of the cut is convex! Now imagine using that on your toenails. Most people on the planet want a concave cut that rounds your nails so they don't scratch and tear at things. However this toenail clipper gives a convex cut and will give your toenails horns!Caveate Emptor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst nail clippers I've ever purchased","review":"Instead of being the light, effective, well-designed, easy-to-use clippers available at any local store, these clippers are heavy, poorly designed (actually hurts my hands to press on them), they can't cut unless you experiment and experiment with every single angle on every single fingernail, and even then you worry that if you don't get it exactly right, you are going to end up accidentally cutting yourself. I have no idea what nail clippers all these other people are reviewing, but the ones I have don't work and turn something quick and easy into a massive chore. What a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as pictured...suspect they are knock-offs","review":"I bought this set because I liked my wife's Tweezerman clipper so much. When they were delivered, I was a little surprised to see the handles were black and not as pictured on Amazon. Also, they didn't cut nearly as quiet and cleanly as my wife's authentic Tweezerman's. Then tonight I compared the Tweezerman font between mine that I ordered on Amazon and my wife's that she got from Rite Aid and they are definitely different. I'm 95% sure these are fakes. Do not buy these. It's only $9 bucks but I'm pretty upset that I got fake crap from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rusted Stainless Steel?","review":"These are nice heavy duty nail clippers, but mine started rusting towards the back. Wait... how can stainless steel rust? I haven't figured that one out yet. At least there is no rust on the blades though. Also, the toenail clipper is a flat edge cut. It is not rounded like the fingernail clippers. I dont know about everyone else, but I like my toenails rounded not jagged. But otherwise, they are a really heavy duty set of clippers and very sharp also. Cuts through my nails like butter. I give it a 2 for the fact that we have a stainless steel item that is rusting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good STRONG Product and a Great Price","review":"These clippers are great! My husband has really thick fingernails and toenails, so it has been a challenge to find ones that actually CUT, not mash, his nails. These clipper do a great job and price is definitely right. Also, with a lifetime warrany and free sharpening, there's no risk to buying this item. Very happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"toenail cutter doesn't work","review":"Maybe my toenails are just too thick, but this cutter just is not heavy duty enough to cut them...

It is more science-fiction than fantasy, looking at a fantasy world with scientific tools. This is not only a good solid read.

My opine is that Dr. Cocker was telling it like it is.Having made a 2,000 mile trek in my twin inboard-engine 27 foot cruiser, I could relate to the problems he encountered with various governments regarding entry and exits plus the rip-offs along the way (sold my boat upon returning). Almost like owning an RV with the attending headaches. Might entice you to stay home and watch travelogs in HD. A lot cheaper, fewer headaches, less stressful, and much more comfortable!I thought his history description of some of the ports/cities he visited was enlightening and informative. His disdain with organized religion was apparent and, honestly, refreshing.All in all, I liked his style of writing and the photos which are included.------"},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"I can only wish the last two reviews had been up at the time I bought this book. While I admire the fortitude it took to accomplish the circumnavigation, I can only wonder why he did it. Hardly a moment goes by when the author isn't criticizing.

Cypress Hill's hardcore rap and the blazing guitars of Filter alone would make this worth your money, but there is so much more to this cd.

When on the phone and another call comes in, it does not display the number/name. Overall the phone works and is nice and clear/loud.

However, this first book is just a beginning. I was dismayed to learn how abruptly the book ended, and although the characters are pleasant enough, there just wasn't enough going on to make me want to continue to the next book, given that there are 8 total!

I do think that the animals in the book are cute and funny. Granted, the animals act in realistic, sometimes noble, but more often crass ways. Part of the fun in this book is the sheer absurdness of the animals and the world at all.I think you have to treat the book slightly humorously. I think humor was a great par of Mr. Foster's intent. The original cover has a bespectacled turtle on a boat with two humans and an otter. The turtle has drawers in his shell which open. I laughed quite hard the first time I looked at the cover. The hero gets to the fantasy world after smoking marijuana.

It has great graphics and sound, and it is quite different from all of the Warcraft clones out there.Unfortunately, the game has many problems. The AI is seriously flawed in combat, and when bartering with computer players. Also, the game is just too easy. It may take a while to biuld up your forces, but you can win the game without ever encountering serious opposition. Sure, the marauding parties are a constant nuisance, but they usually never accomplish more than taking over a brewery for a day or two before you eliminate them.Despite its flaws I really like what the game tries to accomplish.

It seems as though the computer is starting out with many more resources because I could never catch up to my neighbors in terms of units and resources. Waiting times between turns is way too long, as is waiting for a unit to heal. Also the lack of a small map on the bottom of the screen makes it really hard to orient yourself in the bigger picture.

This game leads the player from the basics of driving and using the controls of the tank via your joystick under the tutelage of a barking commander, gradually up to incredibly complex campaigns (controlling many allied tanks) that you'll have to play over and over again to win. Our entire family became addicted for months. You'll drive over desert, snow, greenery, and land mines in the various campaigns. You'll have to use judgment concerning whether or not to engage combat and how to best go about it. Call in air support? You decide if and when. If you get blown up, hop into another tank and keep on fighting. The main drawback is that this game does not use a mouse to make selections; the user must use up and down arrows to select.

The part where he sends Stephen 2 jail was so messed up. I like when he first gets in and that black guy goes, \\"I be yo friend\\". Great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting! I cramped in two places watching this movie.","review":"Whoever thought this was funny hasn't lived. It's more disturbing than any comedy! Even the lighter jousting scenes are brewing with forboding and menace. Jim Carrey's cable repairman is a definate threat to Broderick's character, whose innocence is frustratingly unrealistic at times. Watch it if you already intend never to let another repairman in your house AGAIN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jim Carrey at his worst","review":"After the Mask, Ace Ventura, and Bruce Almighty I didn't think Carrey was capable of doing a bad movie, but after thoughtlessly renting this movie I was prooven wrong. Carrey plays a psycho phony cable guy with a terrible lisp and does his usual routine of acting like a complete screwball, but this time it just wasn't funny. Because of dry dialogue and script and co-stars such as Matthew Broderick who only belong in serious movies this movie just bored me, and when it was done I felt kind of depressed having spent an hour and a half watching this monstrosity. Carrey fans steer clear of this dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could give it one...","review":"This has got to be the worst mouvie I have ever seen. I've always liked Jim Carrey and thought he could never go wrong, I was obviously mistaken. The basic idea of this mouvie is great, but they made it WAY to dark for a good comedy. Mouvies like \\"Very Bad Things\\" works as a very dark comedy because it never goes away, the colour stays through the entire mouvie. In this one, it never seems clear if they were going for comedy, dark comedy, or just dark. I never really understood the point of this mouvie and hopefully never will.Easily the worst mouvie I've ever seen... recemmended to no one.(Even the people I hate)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incorrect aspect ratio listed","review":"Amazon's listed aspect ratio is 2.35:1 anamorphic.

Don't expect the giddiness of the Mask or Ace Ventura here, but expect a pretty dark comedy which Carrey fits into \\"like a gllloove! \\" I never knew that he could be so creepy. I think everyone has known somene like this cable guy at one point in their lives! The movie also has a message, and it is a good one. It's fairly obvious at the end, but I'll let you discover that on your own.

Uh, Homer Simpson summed it up so appropriately there. Okay, maybe I'm being a bit too harsh. In all fairness, this was not a bad movie. But for someone like Jim Carrey who had been well-known for his goofball comedies like \\"Ace Ventura\\" and \\"Dumb And Dumber\\", this dark comedy was a bit too much, too fast for his usual audience. Throw in Matthew Broderick who hasn't been in a good movie since he ditched high school for a day in \\"Ferris Bueller's Day-Off\\" and you have the formula for a box-office disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cable Guy","review":"It has its few good moments in the movie, but the plot was just too bad.

The Cable Guy, however, is absolutely hilarious. Jim Carrey plays a demented cable guy who installs cable for free to Matthew Broderick. At first, Broderick thinks this is great until he realizes this new friend of his is completely nuts and overly intrusive in his personal affairs. As you may have guessed, Carrey is a riot in this. One of my favorite parts is when Carrey puts Broderick on hold on the phone, only he's not really on hold. I use this trick at work all the time. If you've ever had a \\"friend\\" who borders more on stalker than true friend, this movie is for you. And even if not, you'll find plenty to laugh about in this silly little flick.

For this purpose, this item worked superbly. However, after my sophomoric antics, I was still stuck with a set of bagpipes. It is a difficult instrument to play, and if you're interested in learning how to play, purchase a practice chanter. This set works okay as an intermediary between the chanter and the full set. The sound quality is pretty low, but it's a durable instrument. Also, it works well as a decorative piece. Otherwise, I would call this instrument a necessity for any returning upperclassmen going into a dorm scenario."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very sad!! :(","review":"Looked forever for bagpipes should have kept looking. they would look good on a shelf, but for a child to start learning not so much.

It's not easy to get the pipes to sound. You have to fill the bag and then squeeze while you blow--I play violin and have a very hard time. My husband, who plays clarinet, does fine. If you really want to learn to play, start with a chanter. I happen to have a son who has a chanter and still says he has to have *real* bagpipes for Christmas.

While the recipes are interesting combinations and I am sure are tasty they are also nutritionally awful! I was amazed at the amounts of sodium, cholesterol ,fat and calories in a serving . What is lost in frying in butter/oil is gained by what is added to the marinades, sauces and the addition of cheese and other meats ie grilled chicken with fontina and prosciutto, per serving 576 calories, 35 grams fat,158mg cholesterol, 656 mg sodium, 0 fiber. That is over 1/2 of what is recommended for the daily intake of fat and cholesterol and a 1/4 of the sodium intake, 59 grams protien which is over the amount needed in a day.

While the introduction was well done, I thought a surprising number of the recipes were mayonnaise-based, and that the portions were all over the place. In one recipe, two -2lb pork tenderloins (no waste) feed four people (pg. 144) as does 2 lbs. of ground beef (again no waste; pg. 156) yet in another, two 1 lb. bone-in T-bone steaks feed six people (lots of waste). That seems off. What also seems off are the calories. I noticed that on several of the recipes, by the time you end up figuring in calories for fat and various other caloric ingredients (e.g. avocado, cheese, nuts), you're close to the nutritional analysis calories before you even add the meat (e.g. pgs. 166/67 & 130/31).I guess it's just not my thing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Healthier if you don't make any of the recipes","review":"He starts out by telling you in the introduction its not a diet book.

I think this was a 'healthy' band-wagon book, if you read the recipes, there is nothing healthy about them.I'm not a Bobby Flay fan. I think he puts too many high end ingredients in one recipe and the only thing they add at the end is an increased cost per serving without adding a difference in taste. Too many expensive ingredients, or ingredients period, in a dish, does not make for a better dish. (And, I am a person willing to spend money on ingredients) Overly-complicated without purpose.

Chichiri's 'no da's were priceless, and it's sad to see them go--although the 'y'know' was pretty clever to add. Overall, I believe that if you can read and watch at the same time, Fushigi Yuugi SUBBED is the way to go. If not, the dub is an okay subsitute.

The characters are all great. The only one that I don't care for is Miaka(the main character)who's a bit niave and just... anoying. Well that's just my opinion. See for yourself. Anyways, the story plot is great and it has comedy, action, tragedy, suspence, romance and more!This mainly focuses on Miaka and her chemistry between Tamahome and there adventures trying to find the susaku seven. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that the animation quality is a little poor at times. The animators must have gotten lazy. If your worried about which episode to buy, don't. They are all great. And if you like bishonen(fem-looking guys)than this is definantly for you. Over all this is a must see anime that you will love!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What happened! When did this series become deep! Wow!","review":"In this volume, Fushigi Yuugi really makes the transition from being a fun, light-hearted, conventional shoujo anime, to being a dark cautionary tale, with real emotional depth. It can be a very startling transition. If you're expecing more sweetness and light, from here on out, you won't find as much. However, if you're looking for good writing, good acting, and excellent character and plot development, you're looking for it in the right place.

If you don't like some of the the heavier meat dishes in the original, there are plenty of vegetable, legume, and luncheon dish recipes, and the informational sections show you how to adapt recipes to your own taste.I think I'm qualified to make the call on this one, since my grandmother cooked with the first edition of the \\"Joy\\", my father used (and is still using) the 1936 edition, and my first cookbook on my marriage in 1977 was the then current edition.

Ethan has distorted this trusted symbol. For instance, in the old Joy there was a recipe called \\"Devil's Food Cake Cockaigne.\\" Under the title were the words \\"The best chocolate cake we know.\\" The new Joy also has a recipe called \\"Devil's Food Cake Cockaigne.\\" However, the recipe is for a completely different cake. Other Cockaigne recipes from the old edition, such as \\"Apple, Peach or Plum Cake Cockaigne\\" (which I use to make plum cake every Rosh Hashana to rave reviews) are simply gone.

At age 10, I took this down from our bookshelf, opened its cover, and discovered an entire world I never knew existed. It is an encyclopedia of lovely goodness, a rich array of culinary forays that only an empty wallet can prevent. And we sure didn't have all the money to make half of the things I wanted, but boy Mom and I sure try!I now have a newer version, and it does lack the original recipes of the one I had growing up, but I still refer to it often. Pancakes, rhubarb pie, pfeffernuesse, Beef Wellington... (well the latter is only a once a year thing.) Though my cupboard now overflows with cookbooks, this one still holds a dear place in my heart, and is the first resource I consult when thinking of something to make, though it may not be employed as much as Batali, La Cucina Italia, or others."},{"rating":"1","title":"PAGES FOOD STAINED","review":"PRIOR ORDERS PLACED WITH AMAZON ALWAYS ARRIVED IN EXCELLENT CONDITION.

I like color and pictures to give a hint as to what to expect from a cookbook. This one has sparse skethings of a shallot or some other food.

But this is *not* the book that i grew up with in my mother's and my grandmother's kitchens, and that i have already worn out a copy of myself, and it loses a star or so for attempting to claim it is a mere \\"revision\\" of that honourable book.Not a bad book, really, but not essential, unlike its predecessor, the *true* \\"Joy\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A far cry from the old classic favorite!","review":"I was so disappointed in this version! I have a \\"Joy\\" from the mid-1950s and one from the early 1980s -- I would chose either old one over this one any day. The print is terrible and the tone is smug and elitist.

In our household, all how-to cooking and recipe discussions are settled by saying, \\"Let's ask Joy.\\" Unfortunately, the organization, typeface, hodge podge style of the new Joy makes it truly unworkable. If ever a book suffered by being written by a committee, this is it. I'll be sticking with my old version."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE politically correct cookbook!","review":"This has always been my favorite, basic cookbook of American food.

The new version is suitable for starting fires."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, poor printing quality","review":"I love Joy of Cooking. My older edition has been used time and again. The new edition is well-written and has updated recipes I have enjoyed.My only lament is the new book's quality. I had to send my first one back to the publisher after just one year because it started to fall apart. The replacement copy they sent me (postage there was at my expense) has several pages that aren't printed quite right.Considering that these books will be very much used, the publisher should have insisted on better quality from its printer!

Sure, the new 'Joy' has discovered the food processor and microwave, but has discarded many of those tried and true basics along the way. If you want to replace your worn out, dog earred old copy, get the regular 'Joy', not the new, 'enhanced' one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Workhorse but Just a Good Cookbook","review":"In our household, we use this book everyday. If we want to do a cheesecake, a roast, a bruschetta, this Joy gets opened. It's got solid recipes that are useful for the beginner.That said, if you prefer a reference with more charm, more insightful writing, and better recipes, this Joy doesn't add up. It doesn't inform the reader about the current lifestyle that previous editions did. This one is more antiseptic. I'm not sure if that reflects the time we live in or the various writers' vision of the late 90s. In any case, this edition is great for a novice and has a place in all kitchens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless Garbage","review":"The original version of Joy is a strong contender for the best cookbook ever written. In this modern re-write, the new editors have completely demolished a venerable and valuable classic.I am not sure what sort of stuff the new editors were smoking when they came up with the idea for this re-write of Joy, but they must gotten a hold of some really good stuff, judging by the peculiar results. As it stands, it is mostly a cut-and-paste affair, cribbing from many cookbooks you probably already have. Note carefully that the \\"new\\" material is of substantially lower quality and value than the original material. It is now a typical trade hardback that you would expect to find in the cut-out bin at the book store. I am not sure why the authors thought it necessary to do this re-write. Any intelligent editor would have torpedoed the manuscript.This revision of a venerable classic is a waste of perfectly good trees."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Classic Runined","review":"The previous edition of The Joy of Cooking is a necessity for every kitchen--and also great fun to read. This book is neither. The previous edition assumed that cooking was part of that joyful pastime called entertaining. This one makes is part of that dreary business called hygiene. To give one example, instead of recipes for drinks with funny stories, the new version tells you not to start drinking if you don't already. Thank heavens that the older version is still in print."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUCH Better than the old one...","review":"I happen to disagree with many reviewers who prefer the older Joy. If you want to learn how to skin opossum and cook rabbit, pick up the old one. Use the new Joy if you want a wealth of information on how to choose ingredients, cooking utensils, and techniques. Everytime I want to cook a new dish, I look for how they make it in the new Joy.My only complaint is that the new Joy is so huge, the binding on my book is broken. I bought the spiral-bound edition of the old Joy because I thought it would be sturdier, but I never use it because I don't like the recipes."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I hate this book. It won't stay open. The recipes don't stand out as separate entities so you can glance at the page and see the next step or ingredient--you have to stop and put your finger on the page and read it and for the next step you have to stop and read again. Over and over. Worse, my results made the kids stare dolefully at their plates.I got an earlier version as a wedding present, and learned a lot from it. What I finally did with this one was show my son how to fold the pages, tape the front cover to the back cover, and spray paint the thing gold to make a Christmas tree."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book will not be around for my daughters 30 anniversary","review":"In 1970 my first wedding gift was a copy of \\"Joy of cooking\\" from a loving aunt. I still use this book today while living and cooking in France. Over the years I have given this book to many young brides including my daughter. But I have to say that only after a few years of light use, the binding has come off and the pages are falling out. Because of this, it is difficult to use and to rate it's context. I wonder if others have had this problem? I am going to write to the publisher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joy of Cooking","review":"Recently I had a friend for dinner and prepared one of the recipes from this wonderful cookbook, Joy of Cooking. We all loved it and she asked for the recipe since she knew her children, too, would enjoy it. Instead of writing out the recipe, I decided to purchase the book as a gift for her. I purchased my copy many years ago, and it is the one cookbook I go to whenever I have a question about food. I love the \\"About...\\" sections throughout the book. I have learned so much. I also go to this cookbook when I'm having company, as I know I can rely on the recipes to be a success."},{"rating":"2","title":"Step by step cookbook","review":"I love this cookbook!

The 50's & 75 eds are improvements on the original; they retain most of the best recipes, while updating certain sections and techniques. Not so with the \\"new\\" edition! Fewer than half of the original recipes are retained, and whole sections (Canning, Game) have been eliminated. While some of the new recipes are good, and the expanded vegetarian offerings are nice, this is no longer the Joy of Cooking that I've known and loved since I first learned to cook. All in all, disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Live up to the Original","review":"Growing up the only cookbook we every used was the original Joy of Cooking which was a fabulous reference. I recently looked at the new edition and didn't like it at all!

I was so anxious to receive my new (1997) edition as my 1975 edition was falling apart. To my dismay none of the recipes I depend upon were there, or if they were, were completely altered. Where is the Persimmon pudding? The basic cornbread? The bran muffins(the old version)? Gone. And I detect a trendiness at the cost of taste in the guise of low-fat, etc. (this should be a separate section only). I am now faced with a dilemma of what to do. I only use my 1975 edition but it is falling apart. Will the Joy of Cooking people please reconsider reissuing it? How about renaming this edition as Joy II for those who actually like it?

The ladies Rombauer never let us down. If I want most of the food Becker writes about, I do live near a metro area large enough that I find a ethnic restaurant that cooks it, and better.

I use the OLD, reliable, Joy of Cooking as a springboard for recipe inspiration and modification. I received this \\"hunk of junk\\" as a holiday present, and it has MAYBE been opened twice. They got rid of all of the sections that I used on a regular basis, and replaced them with poorly-written sections, that have very little bearing on what I would actually cook at home on any sort of regular basis. Perhaps in the future, the publisher will actually come out with a revised version worth acquiring; until then, AVOID this one, buy the older version, it's more redeeming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, But I've Used Better","review":"I received this cookbook as a gift on my 22nd birthday--half my lifetime ago. It was okay for what it was--a place to start to learn everyday food preparation. However, as the years went by, I noticed that many of the recipes were rather bland; some of them were downright awful. I tried making brownies--they fell. I made some salad dressing--it was inedible glop. Many other dishes came away looking and/or tasting rather strange. At first I thought it was me, but many years and recipes and cookbooks later, I had to give \\"Joy\\" away. If you're new to cooking, this book is extremely useful. There's lots of background on cuts of meat and basic ingredients. An experienced cook might wish to purchase a less well-known and more creative volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"A timeless masterpiece","review":"This cookbook belongs in every kitchen! Whenever I'm planning a dinner party or I'd like to try something new, I can always count on the new Joy of Cooking to carry the day.

There are no adjustments and the unit dosen't fit exactly like the orgininal washer, the shape of the \\"flats\\" on the Avenger are not the same (it is universal for many saws).You have to start the saw to activate the laser (turns on at 500 rpm). The problem is it will cut about a 1/32\\" off the laser line. It should cut right on the edge of the line or the center of the line. So you have to estimate where the cut will be.Your better off with the saw off, bringing the blade down to your piece of work to see where the cut is. Or with the blade running sight down the blade.The saftey feature of the laser should be to line up the cut with the blade not spinning, thats not the case with the Avenger. The blade must spin to activate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Add a laser for $30","review":"I use the Avenger on a Makita LS1013. Very easy to install. I had a small interference problem with my blade guard. I went to the website they had a fix which took 1 washer and 10 seconds to put in and I was in business. The reviews I read on this item are correct. It is off 1/32\\" and the laser comes on only when the blade is running. To me it's not a big deal. I adjusted to the 1/32\\" in 2 practice cuts. For $30 it helps me immensely when doing crown molding or any molding for that matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"New life for an old tool","review":"I installed the Laser guide on my old power miter box saw. By old I mean when I bought the saw they did not have laser guides for power saws. Before the laser guide I was never able to make an accurate 45 degree cut. Laying the blade down on the wood was a hit or miss at best. And yes the guide is off 1/32 but that turned out to be a plus because I like to sneak up on the final cut for that perfect fit.

I was apalled at a lot of the story line -- I didn't remember the show being like that!Of course, the music is wonderful (with the exception of \\"I'm and Indian Too\\"), and the color and costumes are brilliant.

As a collector I was delighted when I received Annie Get Your Gun a couple of days ago. I was not disappointed! Besides the delightful score, Annie Get Your Gun, being Irving Berlin's last musical, has historic significance. The theme of this almost 50 year old musical weaves nicely into the modern feminist agenda, and for that reason is very timely. Betty Hutton did a great job. I remember her movies from a time when she and I were much younger. I did not appreciate then the quality of her dance movements, but they are a thing to behold. Betty's singing voice is not the best, but this does not detract. What the viewer is seeking is not operatic quality but personality projection and delight and there is plenty of that. Howard Keel demonstrates that he was one of the great non-operatic singers of the movies. I will keep this one in my collection and recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Annie Get Your Gun - Betty Hutton","review":"Annie Get Your Gun starring Betty Hutton is one of the best motion pictures ever made.

Berlin's lyrics are very funny. you have to listen very closely. hutton brings a vulnerability to the part that i don't think anyone else could bring to it and it turns the movie from an old-fashioned, loud musical, to a 4 or 5 star movie. watching her face as she interprets each word of each lyric, was just amazing. we had no idea that all these familiar songs came from this musical. the other great song was 'anything you can do, i can do better'. very difficult to do and very funny and clever. we thought we had heard the song before, but we had only heard snatches. it was great getting to hear the whole thing and trying to catch all the funny lyrics. i hope this movie really gains the audience it deserves and another generation will get to know it and pass it along."},{"rating":"2","title":"finally making its debut on video!","review":"Never before available on video and unseen on television since 1973, ANNIE GET YOUR GUN is the musical masterpiece we have all been waiting for, and it now comes home in a deluxe collector's package.Betty Hutton is dynamite as sharp-shootin' and quick-witted Annie Oakley, and Howard Keel is equally at home in his role of Frank Butler.The tuneful score includes \\"I Got The Sun In The Morning\\", \\"Doin' What Comes Naturally\\", \\"There's No Business Like Show Business\\" and \\"Anything You Can Do I Can Do Better\\".Also including the original theatrical trailer, an introduction by Susan Lucci, who briefly replaced Bernadette Peters in the current Broadway revival, and a cut number called \\"Let's Go West Again\\", this is one video musical classic you can't pass up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Annie Get Your Gun","review":"It may be old, but it sure is good.

I just don't think this should have been advertised as such because, having seen some of the Garland outtakes on other occasions, I expected at least a scene with Frank that included some dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad purchase","review":"movie came in quick time, was actually delivered before the est. delivery date. on the bad side, it wouldnt play in any of my dvd players (computer included) for regional problems. i was not very happy about that, purchasing from providers inside the US should mean that the dvd's reflect OUR region, not a different countries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it is supposed to be..","review":"I purchased this item, it was supposed to be a DVD.

When I first took it out of the box, there were brown stains on the fabric, and even on the white metal parts from the packaging. It looked used. While it is very easy to assemble, it is also very flimsy. The metal support beams on the carrier do not stay in place. Also, the \\"adjustable\\" seat on the stroller is no more than a piece of plastic w/ shallow grooves in it....It seems probable that after just minimal use the grooves will become stripped, leaving the seat to just flop back and forth. Also, it is difficult to open and collapse the stroller, and a child would need a parent's help in doing so.

The earlier (first) version contains stories of children who want to please God and who love to learn.

The street mode is unrealistic; all you do is ollie onto 3 or 4 different obstacles and grind them. Wow.

A nonsensical plot and general poorly done screenplay evident throughout this film. Sean Penn & Travolta delivers a good performance but wife Robin was horribly mis-cast. This film is just bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's So Rotten.........","review":"Absolutely one of the all time worst movies I have ever seen (second only to Independence Day). If you are just absolutely forced to watch this movie, then I highly suggest not eating 1-2 hours before show time. After watching it, I actually felt embarrased for all those involved in its creation (honestly). I started thinking, \\"This can't be for real.......the film editor must have had a 'beef' with the director and he deliberately pieced the film together in the wrong order so to get back at him......Yeah, that's gotta be it.\\" You never know at anytime during the movie just what the heck is going on (it's all over the place). I literally had to read the reviews to figure out what it was that I had just painfully sat through. Belive me when I say, \\"Save your money and save your time. 'She's So Lovely' is 'So Rotten'.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst","review":"As much as I respect the Penns, Travolta, and the other actors involved, I must go along with the minority voices on this one. I just saw it on a bus ride to NYC and thought it was worse than the nasal surgery I just had three weeks ago. I missed the opening credits, so only found out at the end that it was Robin Wright Penn--much to my dismay, as I've enjoyed her work elsewhere. The worst parts of John (and apparently Nick) Cassavetes--meandering script, unlikeable characters, tedium, tedium, tedium. Root canal might be more meaningful."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's So Lovely","review":"I didn't like this movie. I watch it and the very next day I found myself thinking about how that movie ended and how it bothered me. I will never watch this movie again and I will let my friends and family know. For someone to actually leave their life behind, a wonderful family, and children for a crazy person who can't even stable himself out is pathetic. I just don't like the fact that she pick a messed up person to replace probably the best 4 people in her life. They should have ended it differently and maybe then I would like it, but for a moive to bother me after a night of viewing, I wished that I would have never stayed up to watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robin Wright rocks!","review":"Watch this movie if just to admmire Robin Wright's excellent performance in the first half. The second half didn't require that much acting from her. In fact, in my opinion, the whole movie falls apart after the point where Eddie is released from the institution. The first part of the movie really draws you in and it feels real. You may not admire the characters but it's an accurate depiction of how life is for some people. I consider this a very good, entertaining movie, compared to all the usual [stuff] that's out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sean Penn's best work","review":"I wasn't terribly impressed with Sean Penn's work with titles like Dead Man walking, but he is excellent in this film and proves he is a serious and talented actor.

It was not in the least bit entertaining, and was quite possibly one of the 5 worst movies I have ever seen.The acting was not bad, but the script was terrible. The characters are uniformly unsympathetic, which left me totally ambivalent towards their unfalteringly stupid choices. This film follows the basic theme of \\"you can take a girl out of the slum, but you cannot take the slum out of the girl.\\" Unlike other similarly themed films, however, this one is not funny, not romanic, not pretty, and not worth renting for a dollar.The sets are unattractive. The dialog is disjointed and boring. There is, in all seriousness, not one single good thing I can think of to say about this film.Please, if you are seriously considering purchasing this title, RENT IT FIRST. Better to waste a little money than a lot. I hope I have helped some of you avoid repeating my mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good rave collection","review":"This sounds nothing like Prodigy's most well-known album, The Fat of the Land.

The CD gets a little wierd in the end, but it will definitely get you movin'. Just try and sit still when you listen to this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Bon Jovi, But Not Really","review":"It's always refreshing to hear a relatively unknown foreign band hit it commercially in the US.

Buy this CD now!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dry Kill Logic - Almost just another new rock band...but not","review":"I purchased this CD and I have a few comments on it. I downloaded Rot and Feel the Break before buying this, and the songs were more than enough to convince me to buy the album. I would almost put Dry Kill Logic in the genre of \\"Nu-Metal,\\" but they go above and beyond most of them. The lyrics have lots of feeling in them, while being pretty basic in form. Most of the songs are \\"sung\\" in Cliff's heavy, screaming vocals. That makes it a little harder to hear what he's saying, but the emotion layered thick makes up for that. What impressed me were the amazing guitar riffs these guys pulled off. Every song has such a rhythmic flow to it, you can't help but rave to it. Because they encompassed all aspects of a unique sound into this album, I give them the highest rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unrelenting Heaviness all the way","review":"If you like heavy stuff then this is the CD for you. Every single track (except the last one) just keep pummeling away. Best songs are Nightmare and Weight.

I sold it 2 days after buying it. Why? Well, they sound like about 800 other bands out there today and I found that their song 'assfault' sounds DISTURBINGLY SIMILAR to 'breathe' by Skinlab. Definately not on. This is just another cliche filled, generic, angsty nu metal fad, and is nowhere even remotely similar to Slipknot. It's a slow, chugging, pointless album that did nothing for me whatsoever. Except maybe the start of 'Rot'. It starts out as a good fast paced song, then what happens? It just stops. And becomes another slow boring song sounding like any korn-inspired garage band in the world. It sounds like an album full of fillers. Definately avoid this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I wanted to comment on the people that said his lyrics are unimaginitive. He has nothing but pain felt for his ex-girlfriend and if you listen to it in that repect his lyrics are great.

Ive never been able to open a book that has every scale possible. Ive seen reviews on this book here on amazon, and alot of people say theirs a con cause the book does specify a Root note in the scales, If you just pay attenention to waht mode your in, and notice the roman numeral, your good. This book does requir some theory to understand what this book has to offer. This book makes it very easy to understand the concept on chords, and how and why their named the way they are. The formulas they teach you (which are very easy to understand) will prepare you for a college class, thats how great this book is, and the biggest plus is, its never been more easy to learn and understand, THis book breaks scale/chord theory down as easy as it can be broken down. This book is a music for all musicians, so what are you waiting for? BUY IT!!! I did, and im was a better musician within a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"A wouldn't recommend it","review":"I purchased this book along with the companion dvd, \\"Scales and Modes\\". The book is rather confusing and droll. I would rather shoot myself then watch that video again. Not only was it basically a rote reading of the book, but the format was terrible. Throughout the entire thing the author wears a monks robe that hides his face, he continually makes these idiotic gestures like he's a magician, the whole audio is done with some annoying special effect on his voice and the content was just not that eye-opening. I have \\"A Modern Method for Guitar\\", volumes 1,2 and 3 by William Leavitt of Berklee music. I have found them to be far more valuable. Not only do you learn to sight read, but you also gain better theory and much of the same information offered by Cad-man in a much more mature presentation style. Sorry, Adam. You're obviously a knowledgeable and talented player, but teaching (or video production) does not seem to be your forte."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps can be used like the old Sears catalog!","review":"When a student brings one of these books to a lesson it is almost a guarantee that they know nothing about the fingerboard.This series has captivated a certain segment of the guitar owning population. I have found any amazingly small amount of actual useful musical information in them.If the student doesn't have a basic music theory book that would be a start..the Walter Piston Harmony book maybe. For more specific guitar information Guitar Lore, pub, Theo Presser, by master teacher (taught both John Coltrane and Pat Martino) Dennis Sandole. Even the Mel Bay Modern Guitar book would teach you more about actual music.

However, by getting a computer to generate every possible fingering pattern for every key/mode that you can easily derive yourself is a waste of paper. I guess it tries to justify its price by being 10x longer than it needs to be. Computer-generated texts might have been fun and exciting in the 90s, but people have brains too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book!!!","review":"Good shipping turnaround. Item was as described.

So, you want a music theory book, go buy a harmony book, and stop whining.As for the review that said \\"when I see a student with one of these books, I know they know nothing about the fretboard...\\". Well, duh, this is a book that will help the student, uhh, learn about the fretboard. Music theory books are another topic.Its a catalog of of scales. That's it. And, the author writes the fretboard diagram AND the scale on the same page, which is just what the heck I wanted. So, for someone like me, that has not played in many years, its a great way to review the scale notes with positions on the fretboard.Whiners: get a life.

His manic acting range: from quiet reserve to over-the-top desperation as the film develops really draws you in to the story, rooting for his arrival but at the same time wanting to see how he'd react to yet another interference.This movie is a truly amusing piece of work - it never drags and is perfectly paced.

He plays a headmaster who is always firmly punctual but when he is due at a conference in Norwich and he boards the wrong train he is plunged to a cross-country adventure with a school girl and a former girlfriend hot on their pursuit. A simple plot unravels a series of sketches that are fine blends of comedy, complimented by fine performances from the cast. John Cleese is manic from the word go but he never fails to amuse. The razor sharp scripts are witty and perfectly timed. Other familiar faces in the cast include alison Steadman, Penelope Wilton and Joan Hickson.

Hard to beleive that this is the same band (well, sort of) that produced a cover of Ray Davies' \\"I'm Not Like Everybody Else\\" that far outshone the original. If I somehow found myself needing to explain rock and roll to someone, that might well be the first song I would choose to play for him. And though I think it is their best song, it is representative of their sound at the time.If they re-release a compilaton of their original material (And I do mean, theirs. Their original albums included significant numbers of instrumental pieces recorded not by the Chocolate Watchband, but by studio musicians.), I will gladly buy it. But this is not worth purchasing..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chocolate Watchband revisited...","review":"Every time a classic artist from a bygone era reprises their act from bygone days, fans and listeners typically approach their return with expectations. Most of them unreasonable. \\"Doesn't sound like their old stuff....\\" they say. After some 30 years? Really? Seriously? So an artist shall not grow, change, and should keep making the same record over and over for the rest of their life?Well CWB has not recreated any of their old albums with this 1999 release, but they have the \\"Watch\\" wound once more, and there is plenty here to like. The spirit of their classic work is intact, but the group has mellowed with age and developed more restraint. That is not to say the music lacks energy, because it doesn't. A fine reunion by a band that has been called an \\"American Rolling Stones\\", if you like Chocolate Watchband, or music from their era, this is a good listen. If you don't, skip it and spare the rest of us from hearing how much you hate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Mp3 Player!","review":"I've had my Lyra for just about two years now and it has been working flawlessly.

The battery life is great for a single AAA, it's saved me from listening to screaming kids on the bus for days at a time on one battery.

It's set on a planet, but has the exact alien from the movies. Sandy Schofield is the pseudonym for a couple of popular sci-fi authors, Kristine Kathryn Rusch and Dean Wesley Smith. They have done their usual good effort in creating a story that's exciting and familiar, keeping you on the edge of your seat to the end. All through the book, I could close my eyes and envision the actors from the movie. It was great. I haven't read the others in the series so can't compare them.

The content of the book is ok-- the doctor isn't finished with his own therapy since he has so many boundary issues.

These e-books should be proofread more carefully before they are available for sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"liked it despite myself","review":"I started out not liking this book, in large part because I didn't like the protagonist (who is, I think, an alter ego of the author). He thinks the world of himself, and makes sure we know that all the other characters he meets find him equally brilliant, powerful, sexy etc. Every woman is attractive and is attracted to him. Of course. One of the main suspects in the murder is a (married) woman who he finds attractive and they enter into a relationship -- even though he's a psychologist working on a case where she's a suspect. Not professional to say the least. The other thing that bothered me was the ease with which people told their secrets and gave up information to the protagonist. Very unrealistic. Having said all that, I did end up enjoying the book and even feeling less hostile toward the protagonist. It's a book that hooked me and kept me turning the pages. I will probably go search out earlier books by the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tries too hard","review":"This book could have been shortened by at least 40 pages. It tries too hard to throw out red herrings and pushes suspects too vividly until the reader KNOWS they won't end up being the killer.The main characters are ordinary except for the doctor who doesn't act accordingly and is entirely unprofessional to the point of being overdrawn.You don't end up caring about any of the characters and when the book ends you are ready to go take your laundry out of the dryer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent story, but the main character ruins it","review":"Frank is a creepy, creepy guy. And I got the feeling that he reflects the author's perspective. I'm no shrink, but there's something seriously wrong with ALL the women in this book, but what's stranger is the way their inexcusable behavior is excused by both the author and Frank. I actually found the cuckolded husband (who was supposed to be the \\"bad guy\\") to be the most normal character. The part about Frank supposedly being a alcoholic, but apparently having no trouble drinking in moderation was odd too. The hostility towards financially successful men was distracting as well. I would imagine that Keith Ablow makes plenty of money off his novels. He should get over it already."},{"rating":"1","title":"A predictable plot that serves Ablow's delusional fantasies","review":"This is the 3rd book I've read by this author and it will be the last. Although some of the character development is intriguing, Ablow makes careless errors (the victim begins as a five month old baby and changes to a three month old midway through the book, and the father invests in Acribat (?) Software). Clevenger is a thinly veiled portrayal of the author who apparently fancies himself irrestible to gorgeous women despite his many character flaws.I lost interest in the plot halfway through the book and Clevenger's lack of professionalism is serious distraction to the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whiny Shrink","review":"I think the main character-Frank- needs more therapy.

And it's black and white - so it must be arty.This movie is heavy and dark, and my feeling and experience is that the Coen brothers don't do just plain dark very well.

Give me a old Hitchcock movie any day over this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The darker side of Coen's","review":"I am a huge fan of the Coen brothers and throughly enjoyed this dark side of their nature. Their humor in a very simple glance or expression is priceless. This story, athough darker than most of their stories, moves effortlessly through this barbers dull ordinary life with a 50's style film noir that is most enjoyable for richness of character study. With any story of this nature not everyone is going to enjoy how they get to ending and walk away with a warm fuzzing feeling about these people. I personlly had to watch it a second time to really appreciate the fullness of the story. However, I can't help but enjoy the velvetity look of this black and white film and the hypnotic narration from the barber explaining his story.This is not the best the Coen's have to offer but a must to appreciate their style and deep feeling for film. Their body of work is, to me, one of the best the film industry has to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Coen masterpiece","review":"I loved this film. Billy Bob showed control, almost autistic, but fully aware all the time. Frances McDormand and James Gandolfini added to the outrageous subtle humor, all with a perfect \\"noir\\" attitude.

YUCK!But...they are after all the Coen Brothers and they will bounce back and I am a die hard fan! They'll do better next time...just not this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Coen's Film Noir Falls Flat","review":"I had high hopes during the opening shots of this film. The black and white film-noir feel was intriguing. It visually interested me...but my interest quickly waned. The character of Ed Crane, a barber who blackmails his wife's lover so he can invest the money with a guy with a bad toupee, narrates the film in a very monotone manner which almost lulled me to sleep. The pacing of the movie was painfully slow and the dialogue was uninspired, which is highly disappointing coming from the Coens. Alot of acting talent, such as Billy Bob Thornton, Frances McDormand, Tony Shaloub and James Gandolfini, went to waste in this picture. The tone of the film was flat and subdued. This is the weakest of the Coen brothers films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda Bored, man.","review":"I think Billy Bob Thornton should get himself out of this kind cliche so-called Noir movie ASAP. Because this kind movie would gradually ruin his acting career. All these kind movies, what he could only do in them are: wrinkled his eyebrows, chain smoking, deadbeat trance, empty eyesight, sitting or walking around like having taken too many sleeping pills. This is a very pretentious movie that trying very hard to be looked cool but only fell short to be bored and washup. High praises are totally not necessary unless you want to prove to yourself that the money you wasted on this pathetic boring movie was wisely spent. Have mercy on us, Thornton, get some better and more active scripts before signing up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Previous reviewer is a Jackass.","review":"I am typically too lazy to write, however the previous reviewer stirred me enough to demand a response. If you're interested in fast moving color films with stereotyped performances whose sole purpose is entertainment, then stick with Spielberg. I find it amazing that someone with such a poor understanding of film dares comment on it.If you have an interest in film as an expressive medium and as a reflection of an individual's (or brothers') creative aspirations, you will perhaps at least appreciate the film. Furthermore, the cinematography is absolutely phenomenal, among the best I have ever seen (I dare rank it along side 'Last Year At Marienbad' in this respect).This is the best Coen Bros. and among the best releases in the past several years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tragically Underrated","review":"This may be the best Cohn brothers' movie yet. Stellar performances by all, and a plot that contains no loose ends adds up to a great nouveau film-noir flick that shows what could happen when an unsuspecting man starts to travel down the wrong road. The ending is almost transcendant. This is the kind of movie Albert Camus might have made if her were a film writer and director."},{"rating":"2","title":"Directors' Commentary Track","review":"Yet another disappointing commentary, it sounds more like a laugh track to a TV sit-com. The directors should prepare; I suggest they listen to John Sayles' commentary on the \\"Limbo\\" DVD or Steve Buscemi on \\"Tres Lounge\\" for models on what a commentary track should be instead of just winging it. I wanted to hear a serious discussion (inside gossip is also okay), not a lot of goofy laughter. I cut out after about thirty minutes; it was a frustrating and irritating thirty minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Masterpiece","review":"This is a perfect film. I was amazed when I met a couple who said it was \\"pretentious\\". Pretentious? How, pretentious? It is utterly absorbing and fascinating. Fantastic script, superb acting, realistic and surrealistic at the same time. An always surprising yet totally logical plot. The fantasies underpinning drab commercial lives; the underbelly of convention. Something like Blue Velvet, but more subtle, more ingenious, ultimately more shocking. Riveting characters: people you meet in the barbers, the mid-market department store, the small-town lawyer, the local school; and what they're really like. A masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make Mine The Executive Contour!","review":"Well...I am not a gigantic Coen Brothers fan,nor do I think of Billy Bob Thornton as a brilliant actor....but this film changes things a bit.After seeing the excellant \\"O Brother Where Art Thou?\\",I've been a little less critical of the Coen Brothers works.( I've found their previous films mostly hit and miss. ).This film is a great homage to all those great film noirs that came out way back when. Mystery! Murder! Intrigue! A Lovers Triangle! Dry Cleaning! Flying Saucers! It's all here! Billy Bob Thornton as Ed Crane,the guy who doesn't say much,speaks volumes with his presence and mannerisms,as the mild mannered barber. Tony Shalhoub is great as the obnoxiously smug lawyer.( How did he not get an Oscar for this performance? ).Frances McDormand,James Gandolfini,and Jon Polito all give great performances. The writing is smart,witty,and clever,and it's never obvious. I really enjoyed this film for it's originality,and wonderful use of black and white. A must see!"},{"rating":"1","title":"it's got one problem.....it's incredibly boring.","review":"this has a \\"Coen Brothers\\" movie written all over it. great acting, cinematography and great dialogue, but with only one problem, it is boring as hell!!

By far, it is better than most movies that Hollywood puts out, but compared to other Coen Brother masterpieces like Raizing Arizona and Miller's Crossing, this is a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Billy Bob is bad","review":"This movie [stunk]. I didn't enjoy any of the performances and except for Billy Bob, the main character, I like all the other actors. This was not an interesting movie. It was not a funny movie. It didn't go by fast, which movies should, because they are for entertainment purposes. It's in black and white, which, although super progressive, just doesn't cut it and I understand why it was purposely done that way. At least I believe they purposely made the movie that way for a reason, but you'll have to waste an hour and fifty minutes to understand. Anyways, their is nothing good about the movie except Billy Bob Thorton may have developed emphysema."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Movie that shouldn't have been there","review":"It's not often, that my husband and I just look at each other and ask, \\"Are you enjoying this???\\" But this was one of those times. We didn't get past him saying he wanted to get into the dry cleaning business. Just a little too Noir for me. But, if you're the type that because the movie is slow, dark and seems like it must be art, then watch away and gush on like the rest of these folks that obviously saw something in this movie that we did not."},{"rating":"1","title":"An art \\"fillum\\"","review":"Yes, this film contains some fine acting and some clever reproductions of the \\"film noir\\" genre from the late 1940s. But the script leaves a lot to be desired, and the directing is at times extraordinarily inadequate. How many times do we need the same shot of a man smoking, staring into the distance, and mumbling a few words of no consequence? The plot has a few twists that are unpredictable, but it's hard to follow, given the poor script. I can imagine that film studies types will find much to cluck about here. I was reminded of the many Ingmar Bergman movies I used to sit through in the 1950s, thinking them quite profound. Having grown up, I realize that they are a bore. This Coen brothers production is more boring than most. Two stars. One of the least of their works."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Movie That Wasn't There","review":"While this film is sort of interesting, and has an art house cinematic visual appeal, it lacks the usual compelling plot progression that makes most Coen brothers' films so much fun. Thronton lives up (down?) to the title of his role, and James Gandolfini, Tony Shalhoub, and Jon Polito all briefly shine in their respective parts, but the apathy of Billy Bob's character seems to infect the whole process. Can't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"fairy Average","review":"saw this movie recently&despite the Folks involved in the film it didn't really hit all the way for me.somehow this film reminded me of Steve Martin's \\"Dead Men Don't Wear Plad\\".the one line that stood out for me was when the Music Instructor told Billy Bob that Girl who Played Piano just didn't have feeling in Her Playing.He said it's cool to know the Notes but you gotta have feeling.and that speaks on about this film&other parts on the Entertainment Game.this Story was already figured out with the first half hour.not as deep as it should have been.interesting to a certain point though."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Man I didn't Care About","review":"I'm a BIG Cohen brothers fan and was looking forward to this movie.So many of the actors I really like and am familiar with soI anticipated a very enjoyable movie.

That is a good Cohen Bros. \\"Film Noir\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good cast and cinematography but:","review":"In the Special Presentations, the Coen Brothers refer to The Big Sleep and Double Indemnity. I haven't seen all of their films, but this doesn't measure up to Raymond Chandler. Chandler's stories are more fantasy and fun. This one should be on the Chill Horror channel.It's also a remake of Raising Arizona without the fun part. Not repeating yourself in art is difficult; but with the Coen's status, I guess they can do it if they want.Based on the reviews, apparently there are a lot of viewers who feel good when they feel bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Movie That Wasn't.","review":"The movie that wasn't.

This film \\"The Man Who Wasn't There\\" was pointless. Many times I lost interest and switched back to television.

I'm going to have to assume the people that gave this movie such high reviews were basing their scores on the fact that the movie has some original sequences, and doesn't follow the mold of most of today's mass-market [stuff]. But somewhere along the line, these critics have forgotten that being new and original doesn't necessarily equate with being good.This movie is too long, the plot is boring, etc., etc..

This book affords a concise, in-depth examination of the horror film genre and aims to identify its relevance in a historical context, psychological context, and social context. Horror films were long denied by critics as a substantial and intellectual genre worthy of scholarly research, but Kendall R. Phillips proves that they couldn't be more wrong. The films discussed in the text follow a chronological sequence, dating back to the 1920s with The Phantom of the Opera, and goes all the way up to the 90s with Scream.Excellent book for anyone interested in horror films, film history, or with an appreciation for the much broader history of American culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected better from Delta","review":"The \\"quick snap\\" connector for the side sprayer is ridiculously cheesy.

Some of the fight scenes were poorly done, and the acting was bad too. If you watch it to many times it gets boring, and barely whatchable. The fight scenes were good, but minor things in the fight scenes were bad, like when Jackie hit the bad guy in the head with a bottle, it looked as if it didn\`t even hit him, and then it made this loud \\"BONG\\" noise when it hit the bad guy. Stuff like that made the fight scenes in \\"Rumble In The Bronx\\" bad.

Although he clearly stated it, this movie is not even filmed anywhere near The Bronx. It is filmed in Vancouver (believe me, The Bronx does not have mountains. It may have a waterfall, but not mountains.) Evidently, he's trying to film it as though The Bronx was still in the 1970s. Meanwhile, it was filmed in the 1990s. This borough has changed since that time. It is still changing today for the better. The image portrayed is that if you step into The Bronx, a criminal act will be immediately done upon you. The story is shallow, unfunny, and pointless. It is obviously a two hour commercial to see what Jackie Chan can do. If I could have placed in no stars, I would have. Thank you for helping sabatoge New York City's name yet again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chan's best in recent years","review":"An American box office smash for Jackie, and well deserved too.

I strongly recommend that you seek a Hong Kong version of this film. The Hong Kong version includes some scenes that were cut out of the American film. Those scenes make the story much more coherent. Moreover, the English subtitles in the HK version are less distracting than the bad dubbing of the American version."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of Jackie Chan's worst films.","review":"My god, was this film ever awful. Jackie Chan really frustrates me. He has all the qualities of a big-time movie star and more, but he insists on making these terrible movies with minimal plot and third-rate suppoting actors. I just hope to god that Jackie will try doing a project with a big-name director(why dosn't he work with John Woo again?) and competent actors. Don't bother with this film.

Her work with the Doris Day Animal League,and the many animals she has helped - is awesome!The author does a good job of letting the reader know about Doris Day, and meaningful eventsin her life. While I was disappointed in her tv show that she kept changing the stars (she started out awidowed mom - and somehow the kids disappeared after a few seasons - as well as the charming farm, whichI felt was a terrible move on the show) - you come to realize how much her life was in a turmoil during theperiod of the shows creation - her real-life husband had just died, and her financial empire had beenswindled from her - but just like Doris - she takes it head on - and gets justice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"In her own words","review":"I enjoyed this book in part because it was in her own words.

Also many shots are repeated in the three discs. Content seems to be from the the early 2000's and does not reflect conditions in Ireland today at all.

The disabled often don't have the autonomy, the caretakers don't have the time or energy. Kittay's book opens up a whole field of discussion: how to reorient our concepts of jutice and community in light of the obvious facts of the different ways in which we are dependent on each other, and on what such dependence can cost those who take it on.

It does give me a weird nostalgia trip listening to this and I don't know why. It still sounds fresh today which is amazing given techno's everchanging culture. It's worth the money if you are interested.The Narcotic Suite seems pretty much self explanatory. 3 Kilos is probably about getting stoned, Skylined is another term for being wired and Claustrophobic String is about the paranoia of the comedown I think.

Imagine watching a short film that starts over again and again, each time from the life of a different character. Each version builds on the other. The pieces fall into place, but not completely til the very end. The story lines are well developed and run in parallel until you find yourself surprised when you see how they meet.The cast is very balanced; no one stands out as the main character. The big names: Patrick Swayze, Hilary Swank, Rachel Leigh Cook, all fit in just like the lesser-knowns and their acting makes them very believable. I didn't see Patrick Swayze, I saw his character.And listen to the music. It's purposely dorky and B-rated. O and the karma.

The movie focuses on the events leading up to a bizarre road accident, and intertwines them beautifully, keeping the audience wondering just what the heck is going on. The cast is superb, with every character getting their own moments of glory, and the ending is truly surprising, but the kind that makes you smile and say, wow, this guy did a great script. While the entire cast is flawless, standouts include Shawn Hatosy and Oscar winner Hilary Swank as hapless bank robbers; Rachael Leigh Cook's smarmy bad girl who is the true impetus of all the goings on; Patrick Swayze and Barbara Hershey as her parents; and Henry Thomas as our opening protagonist who plays a bigger part than we initially realize. With a missing bowling ball and a severed male organ figuring into the plot, 11:14 is a refreshing and original movie that deserves more acknowlegement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie, Bad Marketing Support from Studio","review":"Starring Hilary Swank, Colin Hanks, Rachael Lee Cook, Henry Thomas, Ben Foster, Shawn Hatosy, Barbara Hershey and Patrick Swayze.At 11:14 p.m., an intoxicated driver runs into a human body while speeding down a freeway. It is not immediately clear if the driver killed the person, or if the body was already dead.The rest of the movie traces the events immediately preceding the accident, through five different sets of characters, all of whose lives intertwine with the driver and/or the victim.This is a very smart, suspenseful film, which was actually made 3 years ago, then sat on the shelf while the studio tried to figure out how to market it. I saw it in its only theatrical release, at the Roxie Theatre in San Francisco. This is a truly rare and largely undiscovered gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Can I borrow your movie\\"","review":"I loan it to one friend & it has snowballed! I'll be brief, I don't compare this to the movie 'Crash' at all which I found to be sobering, I compare it to 'Pulp Fiction'. It's one of the best dark comedy's I've seen since 'Pulp Fiction', somewhat gruesome at times but hysterical (warning you may feel guilty for laughing), though the story line is completely different. It's all about the title & events that occur. You will laugh, be aghast, intrigued, on the edge of your seat & then in the end you will be blown away by the genius of it all. The cast is top notch no need to add verbiage to what's already been previously stated. I'm not going to give anything away about content, so many already have. This movie truly is a cult classic!!! I just hope my friends see this review so I can say, \\"At this price, please buy your own!\\" Hmm, maybe I'll just buy several & give them as gifts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, you never heard of","review":"This was suggested to me by a friend a while back. I eventually rented it and was very surprised how good it was. Highly recommended. Another surprise...a chubby Patrick Swayse."},{"rating":"2","title":"11:14... awesome","review":"11:14 is a pretty original movie and some may say fairly dark. It is based around the events of one night, and weaves the stories of several different characters who at first seem unrelated. There are a few cast members that were relatively unknown at the time and are now A-listers. The film also features a non-linear plot and timeline. This may be a very vague review because I don't like spoilers myself.

First of all, the music is awful. Tinny, fiddly, loud, and just unpleasant, plus there's no way to stop a song once you've started it - you just have to let it play through to the end. Second, as others have noted, the book is poorly designed. All the pages had bent, one had ripped, and the edge of the cover had come off after only two weeks. Third, the writing is terrible!

Most Jackie Chan movies try WAY too hard to be funny, and this one is no exception. It just isn't funny and the attempts are silly and unintelligent. They should just stick to fighting and stunts and they'll be fine. Jackie Chan is terrible at comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mayhem in a Mitsubishi factory","review":"Saw this one in the theater (twice). I loved the shopping mall fight where Jackie almost parodies the big mall-mayhem scene in Police Story 1, this time by letting somebody ELSE trash the mall. The twin thing is funny, though we've seen it before, but I was disappointd that Jackie UNDERPLAYED what should have been the big moment when he met his twin for the first time--when have we ever seen him underplay anything? However, the big show stopper is the final fight in the Mitsubishi testing factory--it truly contains some of the best stunts of Jackie's whole career. The man's speed and agility (and total lack of sanity) are absolutely unbelievable. You could buy this video just for the Mitsubishi fight and totally get your money's worth. One bad note, though--no outtakes!! :{"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Chan masterpiece that all fans shouldn't be without!","review":"When this movie first opened, it was spectacular with Chan as two of himself. The action and comedy is widely seen, which makes it a great movie that Chan made. Aside that this is one of the Chan movies that didn't have bloopers (along with Crime Story), this movie is one that every Chan fan must see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even TWO Jackie Chan's can't save this movie","review":"Probably the worst Jackie Chan movie ever, it has very few fighting scenes, and only one or two even remotely Chan-like stunts. The technology to put them both on screen at the same time is awful as Chan passes through himself several times. Plus, the supporting cast is terrible, especially blue-collar Chan's sidekick. Trust me, by the time the movie is ending you'll wish he died a hundred different times. Terrible movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"Jackie Chan's Twin Dragons is mildly entertaining but has mediocre fight scenes and humor that quickly becomes tiresome. The choreography is choppy and disorienting, rather like the overall flow of the movie. Much of the movie's humor hinges on people confusing the twin Jackie Chans for each other. It's not quite bad enough to be good, although there are some unexpectedly funny parts, such as when a man gets hit by a truck and bounces back and forth many times very quickly. But such moments are few and far between, and this is a movie best seen at most once.2/5"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT an ORIGINAL VERSION !!!","review":"1 star is not to the movie - movie itself is one of my favorites - but for the US edition.Some idiots are cutting all the time LARGE parts of Jackie Chan movies for the US.

He's charming, sharp and amazingly fast. But any movie that Jackie directs really sucks big time. The story is usually childish, silly and the supporting Chinese actors always \\"overact\\". I'm very disapointed that in this day and age, Jackie still releases something like \\"Twin Dragons\\". When the other twin plays piano, this twin's hand shakes is the most stupid idea/joke I've ever seen. I had to shut it off and watched regular TV instead. It pissed me off for having to rush to the video store to get this movie. My message to Jackie Chan: \\"Please avoid stupid stories like this one! Better yet, let someone else direct your movies for the International audience\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad re-edit of a fun film","review":"For some reason when it was released in the US this year they decided to edit out most of the comedic scenes and most anything not directly involving Jackie Chan from the earlier release. They also almost totally replaced the soundtrack with music that for the most part didn't match the scene. I like Jackie Chan films but this release was very disapointing. The only up side was that the voices were re-dubbed by I think by the original actors.

I mean, for 15 bucks, how could you NOT buy 'em? \\"Twin Dragons\\" is terminally silly, but still delivers its quota of creative stunts and brilliant fight scenes. Fans of Jackie fights in unusual settings will love the sequences in the body shop, including one jump -- while fighting -- INTO the window and OUT the door of a car. It's also unusual to see babes in a Jackie flick but this one features two of Hong Kong's sexiest. You get to see Jackie clown around a lot since the two characters he plays are from such different ends of the social spectrum: a highly cultured world-famous pianist/conductor and a two-bit crook from the gutters of Hong Kong who \\"rolls\\" with a midget that can't act."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than useless.","review":"This software failed to block most of the banner ads that show up in my.yahoo and interfered with other websites that I access on a regular basis, notably the Wall Street Journal, Forbes.com., and even amazon.

Production by Timbaland (perhaps the most under-rated producer in the hip-hop genre) is spectacular. Missy Elliot brings her unorthodox vocal talent, and on the songs which she is featured, serves great rebuke to Ginwine's cashmire lyricism. Both are in rare form over Timbaland's beats.

Another reviewer commented that a lot of recipes need something done throughout the cooking process or are partially cooked on the stove before being put into the Crockpot. This was a big turn off for me too. I suggest trying a different book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for people who work all day","review":"I was not happy with this cookbook because many of the recipes required that I do something during the day with the recipe, like stir it at 4 hours into cooking, or cook something on a stove then put it in the slow cooker.

Even if not a sequel to RISKING ELIZABETH, I look forward to Dr. McCloskey's next novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writer's first efforts","review":"Although \\"Risking Elizabeth\\" had a good enough storyline, it was at times a tedious read. The writing style was stilted, as the author sought simplistic ways to reveal historical information about the characters. For example, a character would say something like, \\"Grandmother, tell me about the time that so and so did thus and such.....\\" Also, the story's characters weren't realistically drawn, as they would, in the middle of a tense and dramatic episode, sit down and have a delicious meal, fully described by the author. It was an okay read for the beach, but it shouldn't be taken as a serious literary effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"good heavy construction....","review":"sure it's not Monster cables, but for the money, they are absolutely perfect.

It will challenge you but also reward you with brilliant performances and one of the best-ever soundtracks (by the late George Harrison). Psychedelic? You bet.

In order to fully appreciate and understand the film, it helps if you have seen at least a few episodes of the show and understand the characters.

I thought this would be the climax of my collection, but sadly not. It is a sad attempt to bring the TV show to the big screen. It's basically a very lackluster re-hashing of the TV show's various skits sewn together with a poor sub-plot. Even the cast looks like they didn't want to be there.Stick to the TV series, it's the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"AYBS? The MOVIE","review":"I bought this movie on VHS awhile back.

Mr. Humphries in various costumes & the lovely ladies on vacation.No audience participation, but the show is still lots of laughs. If you love the original show & the humor of Captain Peacock, Mrs. Slocum and the rest, the movie is fun. Even the shop serviceman Mr. Harmon is around to irk the players!

A spin off movie of the famous 1970s British sitcom series of the same name is little more than an extension of a standard episode of the seires only it looks slightly more realsitic being made in film. Humphries causes some amusement as his overly camp and flamboyant character, whilst Mollie sugeden gets a few of the laughs too. The film really lacks any sort of direction and never once are you treated to outdoor, exotic locations. so basically all of the action takes place in the hotel. Rather like a substandard Carry On film. Fans will undoubtedly be delighted whilst people unfamiliar with the series will remain unamused. On the whole, mediocre at the most with a few laughs along the way but in all honest the whole thing seems terribly dated now. Recommended to fans of the series regardless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This DVD","review":"If you love the series you will hate this movie. How it could be this awful but still have John Inman and Mollie Sugden in it is a mystery. It is painfully, PAINFULLY, bad. Not at all funny and a complete waste of a very talented group of actors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only watch it if you are a fan of the show.","review":"The TV show Are You Being Served? has to be one of my all time favorites, and I believe it truly is the funniest British comedy ever on TV. However, the movie was lacking.As I first started watching this movie, while they were still in the shop, I noticed that something was lacking, that something about it felt empty. It was the lack of a laugh track. Now, in all honesty, most of the time I prefer there not be a laugh track, but in Are You Being Served, a laugh track is essential. Without the laugh track, the comedic timing of the show was thrown off from the start.Then, as they get into the movie, the jokes aren't new, and the conflict is predictable and leaves you yearning for it to be over.If you are a huge fan of AYBS and want to have the complete collection, that is the only reason I would suggest buying this. It is the only reason I bought it, and the only value I see in it. There is definitely little (if any) entertainment value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I have the entire series and watch them very often. I was quite excited about getting the movie. It STINKS! The characters are not up to their normal excellence and the jokes and gags just do not work.

Again, the AYBSMovie,(I'm sorry to say)left much to be desired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as great as the shows but still funny.","review":"This movie was made during the height of the run of the show on television. It is pretty predictable and uses the standard humour of the show, but still manages to deliver several laughs.

I like British humor so this comedy sketch turned movie was cheeky and whimsical- just like I wanted. A great array of characters and and a plot line that is predictive but throws a twist in to keep you laughing. I say go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good funny movie with the crew you know well.....","review":"For Are You Being Served fans and followers of the series, this is almost like a highlight of best lines from the series. That said, it's a good movie....the crew is in a different location, but the jokes swirl around Mrs. Slocumb's pussy, Mr. Humphries walking style, Mr. Harmon's blue collar background, Mr. Lucas's ever hopeful actions to get into Miss. Brahm's pants, and you get the picture.......Good fun over all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie, not great","review":"Being a huge AYBS fan for many years, I ordered this movie to add to my collection. Overall it is a good movie, but not great. It lacks the \\"warmth\\" of the series. I suppose this is because there is no laugh track and the film or filming style is different. The actors and actresses are just as good and just as hilarious even while reusing some of the same gags as the series.If you are already a fan of AYBS, this movie is well worth it. If you are a newcomer to the show, I would suggest watching the series in its entirety first, then watch this movie, else you might miss some of the finer points and subtlty of it.Again, this is a good movie with a good story line and great acting. I would suggest buying it if you are a fan of the show, it would make a fine addition. And I am unanimous in that..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Even Think About It.","review":"Are You Being Served? The Movie is definitely only for the most die-hard of fans.Don't buy it. The jokes are identical from the series, including the whole \\"Sexy Knickers\\" episode. There is nothing new that you haven't already seen in the series. Yes, they may have been removed from the store and sent on a vacation. But, the story doesn't add anything to the pre-existing dynamic between the characters.Definitely missing is the Laugh Track or Live Studio Audience feel. Somehow, the jokes don't seem to be as funny.This will work for you if you are a die-hard fan who wants to complete his/her collection of Are You Being Served? footage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best deal for the $","review":"After having a Porter Cable 5\\" obital, this is a dream.

Though most people look at it and thinks its nothing more than a kids video, I think people of all ages will enjoy it. The movie shows you some of the adventures of Donkey Kong and his friends. It's fun and full of surprise as he battles to keep the crystal coconut in his possession. The video is full of fun songs that you'll be singing long after you see it. It's very hard for me to find a movie that I can watch all the way through without wanting to wander around during it, or watch something else, but this is one of the few that I don't want to turn off. I suggest this video to all. I loved it and I know you will too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yaaaay DK!","review":"A lot of people seem to dislike the Donkey Kong Country TV show, but I love it, personally. The voice acting is pretty good (especially King K. Rool's), the dialogue is really well-written, and I even liked the songs. There are some things that weren't in the Donkey Kong video games, such as a new Kong named Bluster, and Candy Kong has a completely different design (which makes her look a tad unpleasant, but then again, she's supposed to be rather mean at times). I wish they'd released more of these episodes on tape! Overall, I liked this tape, and I'd say it's definitely worth the cost, but that's a matter of opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Bad It's Good","review":"From the terrible voices to the awful music this is a masterpiece of trash cinema.

The acting by Jack Nicholson and David Morse is superb as always, but their best efforts can't save this disjointed, pretentious film full of existentialist garbage. This is one of those films that never seems to want to get to the point! I thought it appropriate at the end when Nicholson and Morse were crying together: I think they might have been glad this movie was finally over so they could then use their talents for a director who actually knows what to do with talent when he sees it.

Each chapter is by a different person giving testimony because the main character is caught in a custody battle over the children with her ex-husband. It makes the story very disjointed.

Very quickly following the death of the saint a great body of stories and traditions arose around him. Some of these stories were plainly fabricated; others contained more than a grain of truth. As a scholar of the late Roman world Bury knew the territory very well and tells a compelling and plausible story of the earliest days of the Irish church. While scholarly, the book is readable and interesting, full of wonderful stories and wry humor.

Good product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Hubby loves it! There is a place for Goo, and his tiny cell phone.Also In So Cal, it is hot and dusty.

Great product, quality, and got it at a great price. Even better, the product qualified for free shipping...and not those 5-7 days for free shipping but I actually got it in three days! I will definitely be on the Amazon site first for any purchases before looking for it anywhere else."},{"rating":"2","title":"great belt","review":"I was a little worried about some reviews, but for the price decided to go with this belt. I agree with the review that you have to push the belt down, almost to the point that you feel it's going to fall off your butt and then fasten it tight there. Then it stayed in place easily, never have had to adjust it through several runs now. Pocket is limited...I like to carry my phone and ipod, but there is a stretch band on the side, that I can wiggle my phone in and it stays put through the run, so the ipod has room in the pocket. I am totally pleased with this purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke in the middle of a long run!","review":"This was a horrible product! Not only were the bottles difficult to get out of their holders while I was running, but the entire belt broke in half (came unsewn) in the middle of a 14 mile run! It was frustrating and left me very thirsty! I am returning this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't stay in place","review":"I bought one of these Fuelbelts from a local running store last spring because my long runs were hitting the 10+ mile point and it was warming up so I needed to be able to take fluid with me. Fuelbelts run very small - I have a 26 inch waist and 32 inch hips and the Small was too tight so I ended up going with a Medium. The Medium fit just fine as long as I wasn't actually moving. Once I started to run, it would shift until it was around my waist and completely loose. So the first 3 or 4 miles I'd have to slow or stop to readjust the Fuelbelt. Very irritating. It would stay in place once I got sweaty enough. I have heard that many women have had the same problem with the Fuelbelt so I am wondering if it is made more for men. This spring and summer the Fuelbelt will be retired and I am going to try one of the hand held flasks. Hopefully I will have better luck that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this.","review":"My family has purchased two of these dishes and both of them have cracked during normal use (baking and washing.)

It is taken a little slower than most but there is such depth of feeling and intensity that she surpasses all the competition. Other versions I have heard (including the recent Chang) tend to not get beneath the surface. I beleive Josefowicz really understands the tragedy of this music. She has a very interesting interview about herself and this recording in the July issue of Grampohone. It makes for interesting reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Understanding Shostakovich","review":"I have purchased two identical copies of this recording, so that I will always have it in my computer to hear and still be free to circulate a loaner copy to fans of Shostakovich. At last we have someone who understands the emotional depth of Dmitri Shostakovich and has the skill to deftly handle his empty harmonies and unusual approach to meter. Leila Josefowicz possesses the artistic passion to do justice to this troubled master and shows a daring style that reminds me of the famed cellist Jacqueline Dupre. Yes, you will want this recording and the next Josefowicz recording as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Howard","review":"Very handy tool. I had a home-made deflater/gauge but it was old and I didn't trust the PSI indicated. This one matches my other gauges, and is easy to use.

Perfect companion to my on board air system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Proof viair and Masterflow are similarly produced","review":"This Viair's air hose and the MV-50/MF-1050 's air hose are exactly the same.

Ben-Ari, as did many Habima actors, ended up in the U.S.Ben-Ari went on to open an actor's workshop in L.A. teaching many of Hollywood's luminaries (Lucille Ball periodically taught comedy, etc).

It is set in Carthage, c. 219 BC as a young Hannibal is making his march on Rome. The title and copy made me think it would be more of a thriller, rather than the weak soap-opera it turned out to be. There is a bit to be learned about the customs and manners of Carthage, but the plot is so silly I don't advise spending your time on this book. It relies on one unbelievable coincidence after another--much like Melrose Place, only without the verve. Steer clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible... Again.","review":"I randomly caught a performance by Kurt Elling a couple of years ago at the Green Mill, thinking he was another underappreciated and unknown yet incredible artist. My friend and I were sketching the band, and he came down and sat with us for a bit between sets to check out our work. Little did I know he was a three-time Grammy nominee! Needless to say, he was a down to earth guy, and this is conveyed in his superb music.Kurt's songs are something you can do anything to... relax, drive, romance, party. I've listened to this CD countless times, and each time I find something new. I get into it every time. On my first few listens, I was amazed by his vocal gymnastics. As I continue to listen, I am also blown away by his band, which outright JAMS on some songs.If you'd like to try some jazz for the first time, buy this album.If you're a jazz fanatic, buy this album.I just ordered the out takes..."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can anyone like this singer?","review":"I made the big mistake of purchasing this album. Briefly, Kurt Elling seriously disappoints in his singing style, his poor voice and inability to even sing on key. If he went amatuer hour, he would be dismissed in the first call.If this is where music is going, we are all in trouble. I will stick to the far better jazz singers. Guess anyone can market an album these days, regardless of talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best","review":"Not only is Kurt Elling one of the best, if not the best, male jazz singers working today--he is one of the most interesting and exciting singers alive today--period. No recording can capture the thrill of hearing him live in concert, but this recording is probably as close as you can get. The man has style, wit, intelligence and incredible voice control. I dig him the most!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bringing out the true idea of unplugged albums","review":"Along with Eric Clapton's and Nirvana's unplugged albums- i think this is one of the best Unplugged albums ever recorded. Most of the other unplugged albums i've heard lacks the originality and the true acoustic sound that the unplugged albums started out to be. We know AIC to be good heavy rockers and saw their flexibilty and maturity in Jar of Flies' mellow, soothing compositions! The vocals of Layne Staley is powerful and reaches the soul, the guitar-work of Jerry Cantrell makes you feel that you can play it too. I would suggest you get hold of the video of this album because it shows something more about the band."},{"rating":"2","title":"a materpiece of acoustic grunge","review":"I have to admit that I didn't think that Alice In Chains would make a very good Unplugged album because of its electric guitar powered hits like Them Bones,Angry Chair, and Man In the Box (that song's inspired by veal, honest). Of course the cd's highpoints are the tracks that lended themselves to acoustic guitar anyway; Got Me Wrong, Heaven Beside You, Down In a Hole, No Excuses, and Over Now. The surprises are Killer Is Me which features Jerry Cantrell grumbling out lyrics as only he can, finishing the cd on the perfect note. Rooster is also very good unplugged and a little slowed down from the sound of it. It makes the song more haunting, which is good for a song about Vietnam. Unfortunately, Angry Chair and my favorite Alice In Chains song of all time, Would?, sound better amplified, but they're still good. Overall this cd is pretty much a best of album in disguise and it's perfect as that. I'd advise getting this over the real best of album, Best of the Box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Acoustic versions of their best songs.","review":"I own both the cd and the dvd of this live set. This was the first live performance in years for the band, and it was a smash hit.They perform most of their hits, as well as a few choice favorites, and a new song that they wrote shortly before the concert, \\"Killer Is Me\\".For fans of their acoustic albums, I would recommend this. It really brings them down to earth a bit and is a more intimate recording. It is recorded very well. I am normally not a fan of any live albums, but I make an exception for AIC, because they were one band that sounded simply incredible live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding CD if looking for diff version, laidback version of AIC songs","review":"One of my more-played CDs... Nice if you want a variation of AIC classics or a slightly laid-back version of them.Used this to get others that thought AIC too much for them to reconsider AIC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"As Alice in Chains is already amazing this tops the cake.

This shows the true talent of the band, especially the cords of vocalist Layne Staley and guitarist Jerry Cantrell. Their interplay makes this album as incendiary as it is. Check out the acoustic version of \\"Would?\\", just as rocking as their electric version."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is REAL music","review":"I am a big Alice in Chains fan and would recommend this CD to anyone who can appreciate REAL music. I have to say that this Unplugged has been in my CD player for a while now and I don't see it leaving any time soon! I guess it is because there are so many bands today that sound the same. I cannot tell you how sick I am of hearing the SAME type of music on the radio. Alice in Chains is one of those rare bands that break through the mold of mediocrity and make absolutely amazing music. There is not one song on here that I do not like and NEVER get tired of listening to it. IT's a must have for any true AIC fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Unplugged review","review":"Well before I herd this album I really didn't know who Alice in Chains was. I have herd of them but didn't care to research them any futher. About 2 years ago a friend let me borrow this album to listen to. I was amazed. I thought how the acoustics and everything flowed together were absoultly amazing. Later durning the summer I bought this album and listened to it everyday. This was the album that go me really interested in Alice in Chains. It has a blend of Alice in Chains, Sap, Jar of Flies, and Dirt on it. I have everyone of those albums expect for Dirt and think they are all amazing albums. If you are into Unpluggeds and like Alice in Chains I suggest you buy this album. All the Alice in Chains albums are great but this is the ablum that will make you sit back and listen and really respect Alice in Chains for who they are and what they are saying in their music"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprise, surprise!","review":"I've never really cared for most Live-And-Unplugged albums by alternative/ heavy metal groups. I'm not too hip to hearing wussified, toned-down renditions of hard-hitting tunes that should be played full-bore hard & loud (the way they're meant to be played). So needless to say, I wasn't planning on enjoying Alice In Chains' Live-And-Unplugged CD all that much. Strangely enough, however, I found it to be not half bad! I was surprised by how well the acoustical renditions of Alice In Chains' most famous tunes managed to retain most of their original plugged-in bite and edge. Never in a million years would I have imagined that \\"Would?\\", \\"Down In A Hole\\", or \\"Rooster\\" could be re-done without the 110V outlet and sound as good as they did here. But somehow Jerry Cantrell & friends managed to pull it off quite well!..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alice in Chains Unplugged","review":"As I write this review I happen to be listening to the CD. I'm not a hardcore Alice in Chains' fan, however I happen to be one of Mtv Unplugged. This Unplugged session is great, although somehow too slow at the beggining (but not boring at all). All of the songs were perfectly arranged & Cantrell's guitar solos are simply amazing. For me the highlight of the CD is without any doubt \\"Would?\\". About the \\"Nirvana vs. Alice in Chains\\" issue that people tend to talk about whenever reviewing this CD I have to say that it's impossible to compare this two CDs in which both bands printed their own unique style. AiC's was darker while Nirvana's was played in a more \\"tunned down\\" style, however they were both great.I give this CD 4 stars instead of 5 only because I think they lacked some creativity in the songs. Don't get me wrong, they sound real good, however I think they may have used extra instruments (violins, celli, etc.) to make it sound a little more different."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome!","review":"I bought this for a friend, but im into AIC.

MTV saturated the airwaves in the '90s with the term 'Unplugged.' Bands like Nirvana, Bon Jovi, Oasis and more have sat on MTV's stage with acoustic guitars in hand - ready to delight all eager listeners. This album is an accoustic storybook beginning with the first song \\"Nutshell\\" and softly ending with the song, \\"Killer Is Me.\\" With new renditions of hits like \\"No excuses\\", \\"Rooster\\", \\"Heaven Beside You\\" and \\"Over Now,\\" the band redefines itself as not only a great grunge band but also rock icons of the '90s. Between the hit songs lie those that could have been hits - every single song on this album is that good. Alice In Chains \\"Unplugged\\" is easily one of the best albums of the decade.

With 'Frontiers' 'Back Talk' and 'Rubicon' three awesome songs that I've never heard played on the radio that should have, have a great sound! And also 'Troubled Child' has a haunting keyboard sound, but is a musically powerful song.The whole album is a Journey Jem, I think that Japanese Animation fans may enjoy the album as well, while not J-pop, it has the sounds that inspired the music of 80's anime.Just take a listen to 'Frontiers' and judge the album for yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!","review":"This is the album that got me into Journey, 18 years ago.

When I boot from the CD, I want to make the new drive my boot drive, but can't get the files to copy - error message at about the 8% point. Tech support is very friendly, but after several calls they finally admitted to the WinXP file copy problem and suggested I buy Partition Magic or something similar. When that arrives perhaps my luck will change - but I've just discovered that PM specs say it handles only up to 80GB partitions.

It even comes with its own little storage case. When folded together it is no more that 1.5 inches in diameter and not even an inch thick so you could easily tuck it in a pocket and carry it around with you.For those of you who are confused about what this is: if you've ever seen a movie where a thief brings his loot to his fence and the fence looks at the diamonds with his little scope...that's a loupe. The focal point of the lens is practically right in front of it but it allows for decent magnification with a relatively small lens diameter.

For the price I paid for it there are others much better. It's got MAYBE a 1/2 inch view area and the magnification is about 1/3 of what they claim. I like the 3 lens Carson I got today much better. However if you're looking for a very small decent power magnifier with a strong protector this isn't bad. the casing you see in the picture to hide the lens in is metal and pretty strong but, it's open on both sides so it's still not spectacular."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wacky collection of myths","review":"It's hard to report that these myths are \\"good\\". However, if you enjoy barely cohesive legends from a dead religion, then these stories are pure entertainment. They grab pieces from all over: Norse, Arabic, Iranian, Jewish, Arthurian, etc. In the very first story one of the \\"Nart\\" heroes thrusts his sword into the ocean and cuts it in half... and that's just an aside to the story.I'd say the Narts are similar to Klingons. They go around and battle each other and often beat up a god that pisses them off. The authors do a good job of trying to make sense out of these stories with detailed explanations and footnotes. Sometimes even they are at a loss. I recommend it... but don't look for logic in the stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and Boring!","review":"Another dissapointment from what used to be my favorite author.

Didn't like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"An example of the law of diminishing returns","review":"Ludlum has written an improbable number of books most of which range from excellent to good. This is not the case in The Hades Factor which is too predictable and bland. In addition, it does not have the minimum of plausibility needed to make a book interesting: spreading a deadly virus in order to profit by selling its cure is too horrific, impractical, ridiculous and downright stupid. You will not miss much by not reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great summer read...","review":"If you like the biological thrillers and spy novels, then this book is for you...

I was moving into the disappointed area. Because eventhough you want the formula, it was getting tired. I think the addition Gayle Lynds is like adding a \\"supporting note\\". This is similar to when a singer's voice is worn out or thready. A backup singer fills in the note and makes for a richer sound. I am glad he found someone. I am hoping that this collaboration turns out to be more successful over time than the \\"Op Center\\" and \\"Net Force\\" stuff from Clancy.I enjoy the new characters..........especially Marty. This picture of evil reminds me of the thirties/forties in Germany. The definition of evil supplied in TNT's version of \\"Nuremberg\\" was \\"...the inability to experience sympathy with the human condition....\\" (sort of quote)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Be Fooled By A Cheap Imitation","review":"Robert Ludlum fans will be greatly disappointed. I know this wasn't written by him, I'm guessing someone found an outline of his or something like that.

Even though there was a lot of medical/research jargon in there that I didn't completely understand, that was fine. But I loved how up-to-date it was. The technology Marty used, the medical/research stuff, everything was current. The way the characters interacted was great--I never really knew who to trust and who not to trust--which only added to my pleasure of the book.As for Marty--I hope he shows up again. I love how the author was willing to just let fancy take his course when Marty was off his meds. I knew that his condition was serious, but to see Marty interact with society was hilarious. He always managed to be friends with the most unlikely people.Anyway, a good book. I hope you enjoy it---take it to the beach and let your imagination go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ludlum Lite","review":"Lite as in co-billing and lesser quality, not fewer pages.

Read it if you're bored, I guess, but this is really the pop fiction equivalent of an insipid t.v. sit-com."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly predictable","review":"If you've read a lot of action-thriller novels, you'll easily be able to spot the plot developments in this one: villain creats virus in order to sell cure. Hero's girl gets virus and dies. Hero stops villain and saves world. YAWN!!!This is so by-the-numbers, I was able to skip from the end of chapter 11 to the start of chapter 45 and not miss anything of real significance. There are much better killer-virus novels out there, so don't waste your time or money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Master is back!","review":"Had to drive across Texas this week and I needed a good book to keep me going. I bought the unabridged version of THE HADES FACTOR by Robert Ludlum. Althought I own every book he has written, I have to admit I was disappointed with his most recent effort and approached this one with trepidation. I also thought the Bio-terrorist book had been overdone. Let me tell you -- THE OLD BOY IS BACK!!!! The was pure Robert Ludlum at his best. Action, suspense, and great characters. I'm really glad I got the unabridged version as I didn't want to miss a word. Can't wait for the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Asperger syndrome ? I think not.","review":"I think that someone should have checked out the basic characteristics of Asperger's in DSM IV. The only characteristics they got right were the high intelligence factor and the social anxiety. Marty's \\"unmedicated\\" manic behavior more strongly suggests a Bi-Polar \\"diagnosis\\". Hos ability to perceive the feelings and viewpoints of others is quite admirable, especially since one of the things that folks with Asperger's often need is lots of help with is the ability to take another person's perspective. (Check out \\" Theory of Mind\\").Generally , I was very disappointed by this book. Having been an avid Ludlom reader in the 70's, I found this book to lack the seemingly authentic research and the intricately woven and believable plot twists and turns of his earlier solo work. This book \\"felt\\" way too contrived. Its sad that his name is on this \\"Ludlom\\" work."},{"rating":"1","title":"A shame!","review":"Disappointing. The story is prefab and strongly reminicent of MI-2 the movie, in fact, it's about the same evil corporate scheme threatening the world with a deadly new virus.

Still, you'll find it highly predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull & offensive","review":"Very surprised at how dull and poorly written I found this book to be. Disappointed --- Ludlum's been entertaining in the past.Also, the constant racist stereotyping of the antagonist \\"Arab\\" was appalling and very offensive. For shame...Can't recommend at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hades Factor","review":"I am a Ludlum fan (read them all) who loves a good story...not one of those fans who thinks they are a book critic and nitpicks every phrase or fact. If you like a good suspense/espionage story with solid characters that is hard to put down then you will enjoy this book. Lt. Col Robert Smith, MD. is a strong lead character and Marty Zellerbach is an extremely interesting supporting character. Watching Marty battle his Asperger's Syndrome (type of autism) really adds an interesting wrinkle to the story. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wishes to read a good story that is hard to put down..I read it in three days! I look forward to the second book in the series and to reading co-author Gayle Lynds other works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hades","review":"The paperback is abridged so it has alot less of the usual Ludlum detail. Character devlopment is superficial and they are predicatable. As usual, the heroes are nearly superhuman in reacting to crisis situations, as compared to the crooks who always seem to bungle. The scene in Iraq is a good example - a crew of Republic Guards with automatic weapons confront our hero in an alley and cannot take him out! Save your time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Ludlum!","review":"I'm a hardcore Ludlum fan having read all his books usually more than once (it's hard waiting two years for something new to read). I though when I saw by Ludlum and Lynds that this would be another Tom Clancy scam (I can't stand anything he wrote with someone else), but was I pleasantly surprised. This is a good book. Worthy of Ludlum's name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with poor writing.","review":"I should have read the review (see other reviews here in web site) by David S. Rose. I agree with him that this is a poor performance relative to what we'd expect from a pure Ludlum. After the first 24 pages, I had had enough and stopped reading! The sophomoric writing made it too painful to go on. Why would such a good author (Ludlum) allow this to be published?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat 2.5 stars","review":"This is my first Ludlum book, and I'm very disappointed in it. I expected more from him, yet this was dry and unemotional. There was no real emotion over the death of a loved one and many of the characters were unnecessary for plot purposes. In fact, some plots were left dangling, and some characters, who seemed to important in the beginning, disappeared until the very end. I'm hesitant to read the next book in the Covert-One series. Maybe I should go back and try his older ones, instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overshadowed by the others but its still good","review":"Good story, this being one of Robert Ludlum's last book I felt I had to read it. The plot is excellent and it will keep you guessing until the very end.There is only one part I didn't like, in some books and movies whenever there is a flat part the dialog something happens that is unique to that book or movie. This means that in such an instance Arnold Swartenager kills someone or a Christian in the Left Behind series would pray.In this book when there is a flat line the dialogue Jonathan Smith pines and moans over his wife to be. I am not saying this isn't nessacary but after the 5th time you just want to yell \\"SHUT UP AND GET ON WITH THE STORY MAN\\"!Overall-Very good I particularly like the character of Marty Zelerback and hope to read the next book in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh for the good old days!!","review":"Having read this boringly predictable book co-written by a formerly great author..one longs for the rebuilding of the Berlin Wall and and the lowering once again of the Iron Curtain so that Ludlum would once again write a thriller of the calibre we always expected of him..very very sad indeed!! A waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly read","review":"This is not so much a review of the book as a review of the audio. I could not even get through the 1st CD. Mr. Campanella reads too fast and runs his words together. I could not understand much of what he was saying, so I couldn't listen to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Above-average thriller from the late Mr. Ludlum.","review":"This book is an above-average thriller; which almost seemed prophetic, given the SARS outbreak, and Ebola, and provides a fairly fast paced story. Mr. Campanella does a fine job (though his \\"British\\" accent is a bit weak) at reading this first \\"CovertOne\\" novel. Would be a good way to check the book out (before buying the print version-i.e., the abridged audio version I'm reviewing here). Also recommended, The Cassandra Compact and The Paris Option (Books two and three, respectively, in the \\"Covert One\\" series)."},{"rating":"1","title":"how does something this bad get published?","review":"Of course the answer is having Robert Ludlum's name associated with it. I am a long time Ludlum fan but this book is poorly written.

Don't waste your time with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent diversion.","review":"In Robert Ludlum's \\"The Hades Factor,\\" the improbably handsome, intelligent, and talented Lt. Col. Jon Smith, M.D. returns from a conference to find his similarly spectacular fiancée dying of a new, lethal virus she had been working to identify at their laboratory at USAMRIID. A warning from a friend and former FBI agent tells him to run for his life. He doesn't; he is determined to find out what killed her, and why.The story is gripping and suspenseful. Of course the bad guys are diabolical and powerful beyond reason, and the good guys resourceful beyond credulity. That's part of the deal with this kind of book. It's good entertainment, straining the limits of belief just enough to be a fun read while not crossing the line into complete silliness.The audiotape version is well-read, and I highly recommend it for listening to in the car during a trip or commute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"It works, but it really hurts my bichon when I try using it on her.

When I used it on our Bichon, it really didn't cut through mats. The dull, serrated edges pulled on his fur and after trying different things, we gave up. It was just too painful for him.

I've owned two \\"crotch rockets\\" myself since I've had this game and the pure thrill for speed is about the same, although riding in real life and in a game are of course drastically different.Moto Racer offers more fun and speed for the buck than any other game I've owned or played. When you get into that First Person view and launch your front wheel into the air for the first time you truly get a sense of what you're in for. The bikes are hella fast and handle extremely well and the course's are equally well laid out. If you want an EXTREME arcade motorcycle racer look no further....YOU'VE FOUND IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet from Act 3 on","review":"The first act was a drag. The beginning of Act 2 was wonderful (Zancanaro's opening aria which was warm and beautiful got great applause), then the score wilted. But from Act 3 right up to the shocker of an ending, the whole thing was absolutely beautiful. Everyone sang wonderfully. The plot had enough devices to keep it interesting. I don't like ballet, but I enjoyed this one, the dancing was clever (but what did it mean?) and the music was beautiful and fun by turns. One note. Merritt's character in particular, but all the rebels in general seemed obsessed with a death wish! I want to die, would that I could die, it is better to die than to... Good grief! If they'd all had their way, the opera wouldn't have lasted 10 minutes, just a stage littered with contented corpses. And (sigh) why must everyone suffer so in a Verdi opera? I quibble. It's just old fashioned melodrama. I highly recommend this, first and second acts notwithstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"One major flaw...","review":"This is okay, though as another reviewer said, too big to be very portable. The pegs work fine for us, no trouble so far.The big negative, for me, is the fact that it's all one piece. If the two players' boards snapped apart, you could use it in a car. As it is, you have to sit facing each other, and it's just small enough that you need to do it on the floor, or on a very small table.Oh well - I got it because it was on sale, and we didn't have a regular battleship set. If my kids like it enough, I'll get them a better version - one with separate boards for each player (good in general, not only in the car).Fun - battleship is a fun game; the awkwardness of this set takes away little.Educational - there is some learning of how to...\\"spread your fire\\".

Full-page color displays provide a wealth of mostly-distant bridge images set against changing skylines and backgrounds. Weather plays a large part in these captivating images - but so does history, and art historian T.J. Clark adds an essay which provides background information on Misrach's interests and approaches, with geographer Richard Walker adding commentary on geography and viewpoint. The result is an artistic catalog with appeal not only to any California resident but to any interested in Bridges or architectural art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did very little for me","review":"This book did very little for me. More than being a study of the Golden Gate, it's a study of weather formations. If you enjoy looking at clouds, the sun and sky you may enjoy this book. I on the other hand found it sterile, repetive and somewhat pointless. Further, it's all too easy to simply set up a camera, never move it and just press the shutter release periodically. Where's the artistry in that? There's no question that Misrach had a nice view from his front porch, but does it really merit a book?The jacket text is corny and pretentious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great design","review":"Very happy with the design and work-ability of product, as the device is completely adjustable, in all directions!

I also noted that the frame of the unit was dented and the grey paint was cracked and peeling due to impact. Then I noticed that the motor housing was smashed in and the blower fan would not turn. I was able to remove the motor housing, hammer out the dents and get the dust collector to work. It is a heavy item, but it should have been packaged and shipped more carefully. If returning it was easy (and if I didn't need this item immediately), I would return the item for an exchange.

I've used it primarily at my woodturning lathe. Dust in the air has been eliminated. Heavier chips still land on the floor, but not as many, so cleanup is much easier. The machine was packaged exceptionally well. It went together easily. One minor problem with the instruction book: The book says that all you need is a 12mm wrench and a Phillips head screwdriver. Right off the bat, a 14mm wrench was needed to attach the casters, and a thin one at that. It took a few minutes to improvise a thin wrench, and that took up most of the hour it took to complete the assembly. Those casters can't be tightened down with a regular wrench. A special wrench should be supplied in the box.

Overall I was able to still use the product and decided for the price the damage it did have was minor compared to the savings. I almost sent the item back and probably should have since the damage was apparent to the person that packaged it up.

I purchased the 50 hose as well so that we could clean the air in smaller rooms without working around the machine and having to keep moving it.

It's a very small problem that is easy to fix, but it's been going on for so long ( atleast 3 years that I know of ) that there really isn't any excuse that it is still happening, especially when it is probably one of Delta's top selling DC's. Get your act together Delta.

It had a small but noticeable dent in the housing around the impeller. Has no noticeable functional effect, but it is annoying. Especially as, like a number of others, there was NO damage to the styrofoam packing around the impeller. Instead, the damage must have occurred before it was packed. Very lame, Delta!2. It is TOO mobile. It comes with 4 casters, but all four swivel and have no brakes. So the collector can wander around. Since the dust hose is stiff and heavy, this is not good. I'll replace them with some Steelex polyurethane casters of the same size - two fixed direction and two swivel with brakes (like a shopping cart).Other than these complaints I would have given it a 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant surprize","review":"Had been looking at several DC's for my garage shop and decided on the Delta 50-760. This unit has plenty of power for hooking up to one machine at a time. I wanted to use a seperator and was able to fit a 30 gallon metal trash can onto the cart base. A 20-25 gallon can would have would have been easier to emty but the 30 was all I could find. The price was right at $374 from Amazon versus the same unit for $466 locally. Free shipping made it a no brainer. All in all I'm very pleased and would highly recommend"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another with a damaged one!","review":"Price was right and actually arrived before due date.

Unit would not start and blew the circuit breaker. Delta has advised I take unit to service center - fortunately there is one nearby - hassle I should not have to have. New Product? Forced to give 1 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value and performance","review":"I read all of the reviews before ordering so I was somewhat skeptical. I can say I am satisfied with the performance of this unit. It is quieter and has more suction than the one I had in my old shop. I liked the compresssion bands for mounting the bags. It is much easier than the old clamps system.I would have given it 5 stars but it did arrive with a small dent in the housing incurred during shipment. It does not affect performance in any way"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Customer Service","review":"I just purchased a Delta 50-760 Dust Collector. The box looked fine but when I opened it I discovered the fan housing was bent in, preventing the fan from operating. I banged it out with a hammer so it would work. There was more damage to the machine but it doesn't interfere with the operation. When I called Delta I was advised it wasn't their problem and that I should take it up with the shipping company. I won't be buying any more Delta equipment and I hope losing a customer was worth the $5 part they could have sent me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delta 50-760","review":"This is the second Delta 50-760 I ordered. The first one would not run ! I returned it and ordered the second one which was damaged in shipment ! The box wasn't damaged much at all but the motor cover end cap was dented in against the cooling fan and I had to remove the cover from the motor and hammer it out so it would not rub the cooling fan. The main impeller housing was also bent but did not cause any problems other than the paint peeling off next to the bent area on both the top and bottom of the housing. I would have thought Delta would have beef up the packaging by now to keep these damage problems from happening. Not very happy with Delta and their poor quality control and packaging problems. Other than that the unit seems to work as it should now. I am happy to say Amazon took care of returning the first unit so purchasing from Amazon is a good thing in case you do have problems. Their customer service was really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Great dust collector, has good suction, installed a seperator in front of it combined with the 1 micron bag there is a noticeable reduction in the amount of dust in my workshop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works ... but quality is in question","review":"I ordered this having first read others' reviews. A few had mentioned dents/etc right out of the box, with no damage to box or styrofoam. I fall into this category. The motor fan cover was dented to the point where the motor would not spin freely. The metal dust shroud also had a dent... but the box was perfect. It had to have happened at the factory. I took off the fan shroud and repaired it. I must say that it was shipped incredibly fast, reasonable to assemble, and really moves some air. It is a bit louder than I expected.

There was a tiny crack near the top that must have happened during the fall, the pressure dropped and all of the water had leaked out into her cage. I applied electrical tape all around the top of the bottle to cover the hole and to help the bottle fit more tightly into the hole.

Unfortunately it is a real let-down when compared to MacDonald's great suspense novels of the same period, like \\"The Brass Cupcake\\" and \\"Judge Me Not\\". With those two novels MacDonald burst forth on the paperback original market in 1950, after his apprenticeship in the pulp magazines, as a fully developed talent, fully as great a writer from the get-go as he ever would be. Unfortunately, \\"Wine of the Dreamers\\", while it succeeds for its ideas, is a dud with respect to execution. It is telegraphed, some of the key scenes happen off stage, it reads like an outline for a novel that never actually got written. Read \\"Judge Me Not\\" if you want great early MacDonald, and read \\"Bright Orange for the Shroud\\" if you want MacDonald the greatest he ever got."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absence of photos","review":"makes this book not worth the price...

Pictures print out great, scanner REALLY fast, does great quality. I have not used the copier a lot but I'm sure it will be high quality like the other two functions. I highly recommend it. P.S.

On fitting the new printhead the computer has completely died and won't even give me a green 'on' light. I have tried different power supplies/changing the fuse etc. but on googling 'MP 600 dead' I realise this is a fairly standard feature of this printer. I can't even get someone to look at it because the nearest repair centre is in Surrey, hundreds of miles from where I live.

It also has issues recognizing paper in the same peculiar fashion.If you have the patience of a Zen master, you will find the MP600 quite rewarding.

It's a very fast print (prints a 30 page document in about a minute and a half), the ink lasts forever, and it prints pretty high-quality stuff. Granted, the ink cartridges are a little on the pricy side, but since they only have to be replaced once every few months, it's really not that bad.

It seems the toner goes very quickly, and like all toner, costs plenty. Look for promotions to get some savings at least on the paper.

The amount of features on a machine in this price range is really incredible.

This unit does have the rear paper feeder as well, but is used for loading specialty paper like envelops and photo paper which is a really nice feature. You can close the rear feeder when not in use to keep the dust out.

Photos are exceptionally sharp. It is so much faster than my old HP and the overall quality of photos and printed material is much improved. I like having two paper sources; the cassette and the sheet feeder so you can keep two kinds of paper loaded all of the time. The control panel is simple; not a lot of buttons making it easy to use. Scanning is very easy and produces excellent, if not better, results than the original documents. For the money, there is a lot of value in this machine.

When our Epson gave up (too soon), and their help people advised me to just buy a new one, I started shopping. This Canon seemed worth a try, but it has turned out to be much better than that. It is great! Everything is simple, from the set up to printing to copying. We didn't even read the manual, just tried punching buttons, and it worked! It is far quieter than the Epson, prints faster and with sharper text. We don't have any interest in printing photos, so don't know how that does. We can honestly say that every time we do a print job, as I just did with multiple pages for the IRS, we are thrilled that we bought this printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective","review":"I was impressed by the features and many positivie reviews for this printer. I ordered it and eagerly set it up. Unfortunately, I didn't even get to load any paper, because I got an error during running set up. The error message was not in the direction book, so I called customer service. Long story short, the technician could not help. He suggested I send it back to Canon at my cost and then Canon would send a refurbished one. I returned it to Amazon and, thinking I had just got unlucky, ordered the same printer again. Well, I couldn't believe it, but the second one wouldn't work either. I didn't get the same error message, but the paper would not feed through the machine. this time when I returned it, I ordered the epson r380 instead. It installed easily and works great so far.Perhaps I was just unlucky twice, but there seem to be quality control problems. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"defective product ...","review":"As many other reviewers pointed out the printer will stop working after a while. I bought it about 2 years ago and used it very lightly (only changed the black cartridge once in 2 years) and it stopped working. The display screen shows an error (paper jam of some sort) even though there are no jams. This is a known defect by Canon but they will not fix it. I had to dump the piece of crap in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good if it works","review":"A good all around unit, but it stopped working after 6 months. There's a problem many others have reported with recognizing the ink cartridges. Canon won't stand by it, so off to the dump with this 6 month old printer. Very frustrating. Don't fall into the same trap that I did.paul"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Power issue solved","review":"Put one star originally because of the following problem, however, now that it's fixed I wanted to change it to 4 stars but it won't let me. When I originally bought this printer, I thought it did an amazing job with both pictures and documents. Unfortunately, after only 6 months of sporatic use, it just stopped working. It wouldn't turn on. I tried plugging and unplugging it from both the wall and from the printer itself. I tried different outlets too. It just wouldn't power on any more. I was very disappointed because I loved this printer when it was working.I called tech support and they told me to completely unplug it for 20 minutes. I thought this was stupid since I had plugged and unplugged this multiple times since it had broken. However, I did as he said and unplugged it for 20 minutes. Sure enough. When I plugged it back in, it started working just like it had before."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Impressed With Each Use","review":"Initially I was underwhelmed with the black text printing on plain paper (the words did not seem crisp--they bled a bit--but this problem seems to have mostly resolved itself with further use), but was more satisfied with the color printing, and am impressed with it as a whole. It is a well-designed and very attractive all-in-one with some slick design features (at least to non-technophile me), such as the scroll wheel and the way the various doors collapse and unfurl, as well as the way it seamlessly performs all its many functions. I have not printed any photos on photo paper yet, so I can not rave as others have about that particular function. I can echo others in saying that it was incredibly easy to set up. There was not a hitch and I found the instructions clear and logical. For my money and needs, this is a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"U150 Ink Tank Cannot be Recognized - Me Too!","review":"Like so many other \\"victims\\" I have also been getting the U150 Ink Tank cannot be recognized.

My former printers were lexmarks, and they \\"ate\\" away at ink, and it cost about $50 to replace the black and color cartridges at least 3-4 times a year. The print quality was not great, just o.k. for the upkeep of the printer. I switched to Canons, this one is awesome. Print quality is great, ink cost is low, the ink lasts for quite a while. In fact, I've had this printer for about a year and replacing the ink for the first time, and I'm a heavy printer. I love that there is a screen where you can select which feature you're using. You can scan items automatically as a pdf, the scanner quality is great, and it gives you multiple options to choose to modify scanned items. There's just so many options available on this great machine, that instead of faxing items, I just use this to scan and email.

Check dimensions if you have a small computer desk. It was very easy to set up with clear concise directions that contained idiot proof pictures. The only thing I would have liked to see was an USB cord included or else the printer can not be hooked up to your computer. I was fortunate enough to have a spare, though I don't see why it wasn't included with the printer. Everything was straight forward and taking my time (about 45 minutes to set up) the first page printed perfectly. I like the screen display, the choice of having it a top loader or front loader for the paper, and the speed and quality of print are both very good. I would recommend this printer to anyone who plans on using a printer at home for some medium work duty or school reports."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work out of the box !!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Bought this printer after reading glowing reviews and I liked how it looked. I got the printer home and followed the setup instructions carefully. When I got to the \\"add paper to automatically align the print heads\\" part of the setup, the paper would not even feed. It would crinkle up and jam. Seemed like one side of paper feed worked and other side did not, as it crinkled only on one side. After checking over and over for obstruction and following the trouble shooting and owners manual, I gave up and returned it for a refund. I'll never know how it printed cause it was a lemon from the start. Now I'm shopping for another printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't print on stock heavier than 28 #","review":"Just finished setting up my new MP600CANON PIXMA MP600 Multifunction Inkjet Printer/Copier/Scannerand after printing about 10 reasonably high quality sheets for which I was quite satisfied, I finished reading the manual to tackle other projects and found that paper heavier than 28# cannot be used.

So far it is easy to use and works great! I like its compact size for a multi-function machine. It is very attractive and looks a lot better than the Epson multi-function unit I did have.

You need a ink catridge to SCAN!","review":"The ink catridge will not be recoginzed in 3 months even though the catridge has ink (almost full capacity!) Aparently, Canon put in code in the catridge so that it would stop functioning after a while even if it has ink. This is not a myth. (Call up customer service, you'll find out).They are so greedy, the printer will not even scan to your PC if the ink catridge is not to full capacity! Seriously, what reason can there be for this crippling functionality? Canon, wake up! Don't go the way of Sony!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon Pixma MP600","review":"I have had several multifunction printers that have failed after a couple of years. I did a lot of research before purchasing the MP600. It is bigger and heavier than I had anticipated, but if you have the space, it is a wonderful printer, copier and scanner, especially for the price. I like the paper cassette, which keeps dust out of the printer. It prints incredible photos, especially on the \\"high\\" setting. I would suggest staying with Canon ink cartridges instead of the cheaper \\"compatible\\" cartridges. Good ink really makes a difference when printing photos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality","review":"Printer quality is very good. Ease of use is good. Print speed is good.

None of the Chinese characters used throughout the book can be enlarged for easier or more comfortable reading, and much of the English text happens to be embedded with the hanzi, so you cannot enlarge it either. Especially in the Answer key, the fonts are so small you really need a magnyfying glass to read it at all!!!I think this is unfair. It should be clearly stated on the website so that people know what not to expect (all you excpect from a normal kindle edition: search functions that actually work, font resize functions, etc.) I would certainly have abstained from buying it or would have gone for the paperback edition instead. A ripoff."},{"rating":"2","title":"As long as you like Pinyin, you'll like this Grammar Book","review":"This is one of the few Chinese Grammar books written in English for the English speaker studying Chinese. AND, it contains both the simplified characters used on the Mainland as well as the traditional characters used in Taiwan and a few other places. The book is comprehensive and has an excellent index. The only thing keeping it from a five-star rating is the errors of fact it contains in various statements about how Mandarin is being used in Taiwan. For example, page 9, section 2.4 states that some characters lose their original tone and are changed to neutral but only on the Mainland and never in Taiwan. I cannot speak for the Mainland but the tone change is most certainly current in Taiwan. (Ref: Taiwan National Normal University, Mandarin Training Center where I am studying.) There are a number of other errors of this kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculously simple","review":"I really felt that this workbook was a waste of money.

We needed a spray head replacement kit within the first 18 months, and after another 2 years (of light use, mind you), it needed more replacement parts for the stem controls which govern the workings of the internal water flow column. This latest fault caused constant leaking down the stem all over the granite countertop behind the sink (and of course, it also leaked all over below the sink, too). I will never buy another Kohler product. For the nearly $400 we paid for this unit, I would have expected 20 years of flawless function aside from an occasional change of a spray head gasket or filter screen.

Just when you think the killer has been identified (and the killer admits he's the killer), a coda at the end suggests otherwise, WITHOUT any resolution. Like leaving it open for a sequel? Hardly, in this 2001 New Zealand film.Overall, even though it holds your interest until the end, it's a cheap thrills movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing advanced ADT book","review":"Advanced only. ADT Goldberg ($50 w/o CD & no email support like Paul Aubin) opens the movie with you already overboard in 6 foot swells and no life jacket. It is advanced, highly cryptic for advanced ADT architects ONLY. If you need ANY SUPPORT AT ALL buy Paul Aubin who gives great free email. Goldberg was obviously highly edited to save paper. IT SHOULD COME WITH AN EXPANDED VERSION ON DISK with more complete tutorial instructions. Agree with all comments below, obviously the beginner below did not understand the advanced nature of this book. This book is GEARED FOR PRODUCTION not learning. We all work in a ridiculous \\"get a project out the door\\" environment, HOWEVER the book did get pubed to help us poor chaps that had to produce FANTASTIC accurate work in very short times for a real client(usually rich and wanting great value from the pro). Best buy VIZ by Paul Aubin also, which is an amazing book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for a Beginner","review":"If you are just starting to learn how to use ADT, this is not the book for you. The author assumes you already know how to use many of the commands during the first exercise. The directions for each exercise are very vague and difficult to follow. His directions are so bad, that I have been stuck on the first exercise for hours. I will definitely be returning this book. It was a big waste of money.If you want to get a good beginner book, try David Frey's \\"AutoCAD 2005 No Experience Required\\". This book is more geared towards AutoCAD than ADT, but you will get a solid understanding of 2D and 3D commands. There are also excellent chapters on setting up layouts and printing. This book may be difficult to follow in ADT, since the menus in AutoCAD are a little different. I recommend that you load the AutoCAD menus into ADT to complete the assignments in this book. This may be a difficult task, but it can be done by using the \\"Menuload\\" command."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nikki Yanofsky","review":"Nikki displays incredible talent in her singing, especially for such a young person.

I was absolutely amazed by what I saw. For all those people who gave it one star, or complained of it being about vampires, or not being about vampires are all totally wrong. This novella is written exactly like Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\" with extracts and letters telling the story. There is the obvious \\"undead\\" link and some extremely unpleasant thoughts planted in our minds by the writer later on, but ultimately Aycliffe has provided us with a fascinating little story that in turn interests, enthralls and finally exhilirates the reader.

Jonathan Aycliffe's The Lost is terrible. There is nothing interesting about the book. The plot is boring, the style is ridiculous, and the content is... well, nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title should be \\"The Loss\\"","review":"The other day I borrowed this book from the library and spent a day reading it. I agree with the review of the reader from Texas: the ending is too disapointing. I kind of enjoyed the book at first, but when it almost reached the end of it, I realized that there would never be a good ending. I was right. The evil ones won and the good ones lost. The title should be changed to \\"The Loss\\" to really emphasize this terrible fact... Thank God I just borrowed the book and not actually bought it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extraordinarily Disappointing!","review":"The beginning and the middle are not that bad, actually. But the ending of the story is very bad. No conclusion, no happy ending, just cruel and meaningless intentions. If you want to read good horror books with happy ending, also with the same format (using letters and journals to tell the story), Jeanne Kalogridis' trilogy of The Diaries of the Family Dracul is a good choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete waste of time","review":"The only thing I enjoyed about the entire book was the tragic ,flashback, story of the lovers told in the last quarter of the book. There's absolutely no action. The 'monsters' don't show up until the very end and then they do absolutely nothing. The style is just a gimmick and totally ripped off. I don't understand the links to the happenings back in his hometown.

It is definitely not, although it uses the term \\"strigoi.\\" I am a great fan of a vampire novel, and so this novel is certainly not among those I would recommend to vampire novel lovers. I also read some of the reviews here, and I wonder why some of them want a \\"happy ending.\\" This is a horror novel; one cannot expect a \\"happy ending\\" here. Nevertheless, that does not mean I like this novel, for this is surely one of the worst novel I have ever read, regardless of its having no connection with the vampire topic I mentioned above."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stoker would be embarrassed","review":"The most disappointing book I ever read.

If you claim you love Bram Stoker, then you should see that this book is completely the opposite of Stoker's novel. This book is pathetic, low in ideas, has no good plot at all.

This book is a painfull and vain attempt to imitate Stoker's style."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Light, Unimpressive Novel","review":"There is not much I can say about this novel, because that is the fact: there is not much to say.

It has awesome features including unlockables, challenge map levels, and great gameplay.This is what I liked about it: First off, I loved how you could use cool ninja moves such as running across the walls and jumping from wall to wall to get to a higher area. I also liked how you could use the collaborative moves with the other turtles.What I didn't like about it was: sometimes, the controller would be a bit unresponsive. I also didn't like the challenge map levels. They look like something that would come out of \\"TRON\\".To conclude, I do like this game, but it is a little bit tricky to play. Even though I beat it quickly, it was a little frustrating at times. Other than that, it was GREAT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great game","review":"i bought this game for my 9 year old, he loves it. i thought it sucked. but i starded to play it and its very fun i couldn't stop playing it. i got 20% of it passed in about 2 hours. some missions are very easy others kinda hard. the special moves are pretty cool. great game for 20 dollars. the only thing that it lacks is multiplayer i wish i could play with my son."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best TMNT games ever","review":"Really Great Graphics , straight foward gameplay , cute characters , fun setup and story , and a almost cartoon like look too it.

What a huge disappointment. Why would a band 'Raised On Radio' make elevator music? This is lite pop except for a few good songs (\\"Girl Can't Help It\\" and one or two others). It seems that the rest of the band was as disgusted with Steve Perry's new direction as were fans. The band dissolved through the making of this record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ahh... the album sent Journey into hibernation...","review":"Well, here it is. Gone are the cosmic lyrics, the musical interplay, the magic. After releasing 'Street Talk', in 1984, Steve Perry returned to Journey, desiring more control over the recording process. He then proceeded to turn a great rock 'n' roll band into 'his' band, and it SOUNDS like a Steve Perry solo album with Neal and Jonathan guesting. There's no Steve Smith and no Ross Valory here (largely because of the producer's desire to use computer bass and drum machines, guess who the producer was?), and the three remaining members that were Journey would break up after this album. Although they would reform later, it would never be the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like this CD","review":"It's the worst of journey.I like only \\"Why can't this night go on forever\\" and \\"Girl can't help\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ROCK","review":"Love the cd..

Therefore, it has to rank as one of JOURNEY's most successful commercial works. Only the lead-off single BE GOOD TO YOURSELF has any sort of resemblance to the traditional JOURNEY sound. It had the highest chart rating and managed to nick the Top 10 at #9. The remainder of ROR was an attempt at a dance-type album. Certainly an honest effort but lacking in the strong JOURNEY tradition. Coincidentally, check out the continuing aspiration to maintain an Egyptian theme on the album cover - the ROR logo is an inconspicuously disguised winged disk! ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"ROR Needs More Respect!","review":"This and Trial By Fire are by far my favorite Journey albums. There isn't a single song on this one I can't listen to every day, and I do! You feel something with every song. The title song is one of the most fun pieces I've ever heard, the use of old song titles is just pure joy. You cannot sit and have to sing along. And the last song, Why Can't This Night Go On Forever is one of Journeys most beautiful. The combination of Neals killer guitar and Perry's soul touching voice is in force from start to finish. This effort is as fine as any Journey has ever produced, it's sad that we will never hear such magic again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Journey no longer knows how to rock on this atrocious album","review":"I've never had this album, never thought about getting this album, and never would touch this album with a ten foot pole. Journey by this time in their career, decided that they didn't want to rock out anymore. This is just saccharin sweet pop music for teenage girls. Like a previous reviewer said, this sounds like a Steve Perry album with the Journey name on it. I thought they were starting a decline with the release of ESCAPE, but even back then they could actually rock on occasion. These mostly are just syrupy ballads or just weak songs in general. Steve Perry was the shot in the arm that Journey needed back in 1978, but with this release he's kind of in charge of the downfall, also. If you like to rock out, this ain't the album to get, so basically take my advice and stay far away from RAISED ON RADIO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here I go again bashing Journey","review":"Be good to yourself is probobly the gayest song these sell outs have ever done.

Pure genious. I have not one word bad to say about this CD. Perhaps, maybe, that it was a tad short. Bit the length of the CD is definitely made up by the superb blend of ambience with the electronica world.Cretu, even though you left the Gregorian chants out (which was a mistake), you have evolved Enigma into a new age of enlightenment. Push the limits and Vive le roi, were great tracks. Cretu's voice enhances, and doesn't hurt the flow of the music.Listen to Enigma: The Screen Behind the Mirror, alone or with a loved one. Well worth getting. A happy Enigma Fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Michael Cretu has proved himself a master of the \\"weird music\\" as my office mates call it. I call it pure genius. With Enigma 4, he does not disappoint. Though not as brilliant as the original (they never are), Enigma 4 delivers up some interesting creations of musical landscapes starting off great, fading a bit in the middle tracks and ending good though a little short ended...the only negative criticism I have about the CD is the harshness of Cretu's voice which tends to distract from the songs...Overall a B-....A great new artist I found with similar music is \\"Digital Moodz\\" at mp3.com, check it out...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Bits of Enigma's past...","review":"I found this CD to almost be a re-hash of Enigma's past. If you listen carefully, Enigma fans will find all sorts of references to all 3 of the group's former albums. Listening to this album after listening to the prior three (all four in a row) the references are even more obvious. I would have given this album 5 stars had the song \\"Camera Obscura\\" been left off- it's about 1.5 minutes of a song with potential and then it's cut off suddenly. It just doesn't fit. Still, the album is good overall and worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop recycling the same old stuff","review":"I first encountered Enigma in the early 1990s in France. That initial CD was amazing, and really interesting. I still listen to it. The following releases have all been more of the same, and not nearly as well-done or creative. Colour them boring. New stuff, Puhleeze...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Wonderful Job!","review":"I've been a fan of Enigma since college, and I just love their music. The combination of so many areas/forms etc are ecstacy. Every CD is also different, so there is no way to compare it with the past ones. This one is quieter, which leads to a great relaxation time. I recommend this to any Enigma fan and I think more people should give them a shot for a new sound to music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enigma's Worst","review":"This CD lacks the warm, spiritual quality of the first 3 Enigma releases. Definitely not music to relax to. It's the same Enigma style, but without the rich, creamy filling, so to speak. I didn't feel that any of the tracks were anywhere near the quality of my favorites from previous Enigma albums: \\"Rivers of Belief\\", \\"Return to Innocence\\", and \\"TNT for the Brain\\". I really don't see how anyone could consider this to be their best CD ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good test for audiophile equipment","review":"I believe this to be 1 of Enigma's 2 best albums. It compares very well to MCMXC A.D. but in a different light. MXMXC was more electronic classical. This CD is more European Classical meets Japanese Taiko Drumming. Booming bass and great sound effect. It really cries out to be played on great audio equipment and really good speakers. It just won't be as good on your car CD player and only degrades more though headphones. So listening to your IPod or a portable CD players will greatly reduce the experience.

And not even this fuming heap of an album will change my mind.I like the recurring O Fortuna theme. It's cathedralic in classic fashion: good. Lovely. But where the *heck* did the cheesy affirmations in the second track come from? \\"Don't accept average habits\\"? Couldn't they have said it in French, at least? It's positively embarassing to listen to, even with no-one else in the room. And that embarassment lingers with one throughout the rest of the obviously lackluster album, making it difficult to relax into the trademark Enigma meditative state.Yes, I'll buy the next album. I've got them all, why break the chain? Why let this unfortunate rotten dumpling in the rich multicultural stew that is Enigma spoil my entire opinion? I won't hold it against them, and neither should you. Nail the pretty CD picture--in the case, with CD included--to your wall.

There is nothing new in this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty disappointing","review":"MCMMLVIIICIXVIX was 5 stars, cross of changes was 3 at best, le roi was 4-maybe 4.5 stars, but this one sucks. The sampling of Verdi or whoever it was is popularizing and stinkifying to high hell some incredibly gorgeous operatic music. It's shameful, and Cretu maybe should be castrated--oh, wait, He must be to hit those feminine notes he does. The female vocalist (not Cretu) is the only good singing on this record. The voice of Cretu is as usual saturated in reverb and delay, which really crapifies the sound, and makes it seem like he was desperate to somehow make this feeble attempt at music sound good. There are some good melodies here and there, but they are too broken up by garbage that the album as a whole is unlistenable and annoying. Enigma's strength is melody and weaving it into an album length song-experience, and this one entirely fails. The artwork seems to reflect the music too--choose an album based on the picture--it's about right."},{"rating":"2","title":"So close to perfect.","review":"To put it simply, this is the second best album ever made, second only to Le Roi Est Mort, Vive le Roi. Michael Cretu is an absolute genious. His mysterious (enigmatic) lyrics, his beautiful, unique music... Words just cannot do it justice.\\"Gravity of Love\\" is the most beautiful song ever created. \\"Push the Limits,\\" \\"Traces (Light and Weight),\\" \\"Smell of Desire,\\" and \\"Between Mind and Heart\\" are the other major standouts. The reason this album doesn't quite stand up to Le Roi Est Mort is that there are a couple songs that I could take or leave, whereas Le Roi does not have one track I don't love.Cretu, I love you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great album from a great artist...","review":"I have been an Enigma fan for about four years and being that as it is, I have all of their albums, including one import CD that Mr. Cretu put out in 1990(Cretu and Thiers:Bell Epoche). With The Screen Behind the Mirror, Micheal Cretu continues with the Enigma tradition and standard, while raising it a couple notches higher. Although it took me a few spins to get into this CD, after it grew on me, it quickly became one of my alltime favorites in my collection. I strongly recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of Enigma and their beautiful music."},{"rating":"1","title":"i hate this album but.......","review":"if your a fan of this genre of music, i highly suggest prodigy \\"the fat of the land\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definately not Enya","review":"Anyone who would say Enigma is comparable to Enya probably wants to sell CD's more than listen to the music. But that was the pitch. You got me this time, and it looks like it was a successful promotion.

EVEN MORE SO THAN ENYA AND ALL OF HER MUSIC SOUNDS THE SAME!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Weak","review":"Enigma have done some great stuff but there's not much greatness to be had on this CD. It is all pretty much self-indulgent and repetitive. Some tracks hint at some cool melodic ideas but they are never developed or taken advantage of. The only true stand-out track on this CD is Modern Crusaders, which just happens to be BRILLIANT and is worth buying the CD alone. It's a shame, and unusual, that nothing else on this CD is recommendable. Enigma can usually be relied upon to come up with unique atmospheres and moods, but not this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Not Meet My Expectations...","review":"After all the hype and reviews of this CD, I finally broke down and bought a copy. I'm afraid I can't agree with most of the reviews here. I found myself thinking about how awful this music was; I found very little innovation or SOUL in this album, perhaps it lapsed into some kind of formula, but, nothing sounded as fresh and exciting as the earlier albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cretu gone lazy","review":"I have enjoyed all the previous enigma albums thus far, except this one. It is both 'unoriginal' and recycled music, which has lead me to believe that maybe enigma has gotten lazy in their old age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it !","review":"This is a great CD! The intro is the best of the four albums, very dramatic. Modern Crusader is the best song on the album. The only reason I gave it 4 stars, instead of 5, is because I was looking foward to more Gregorian Chant. This is definatly going to be one of the more listened to CDs in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"enigma does it again!","review":"What did you expect but the best?

This album is great. The use of \\"O Fortuna\\" is something that only enigma could have ever think of! This is a CD to listen to on a peaceful night with candles and no other type of light! It just transfers me to strange, intersting and mystical places, just like the one's in Tolkien's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent addition to any true fan's collection!","review":"If you are like me and already own all 3 previous albums, and most of the singles, do not hesitate to add this one to your collection. Tracks 3,4, and 11 alone are worth the price of the CD. Definitely worth the wait, not at all disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enigma-Junk for the sedated set","review":"I found this so lacking and void of any real sentiment, that I thought for sure this in no way would make its rounds of the \\"cultured set\\" Then I went to a book signing and this music was playing and people were chin wagging about the intellectual world......and I realized that this is music for the IKEA set who go to starbucks and wax philosophical about third world debt and how we should get more involved of course after I save enough money for the bannana republic outfit! Boring music....that will lull you into cultural desensitization. Pass it up and buy a good book instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds too much like Enigma 3","review":"ENIGMA 3 + O FORTUNA + CRETU SHOUTING + NASTY GUITARS = SCREEN BEHIND THE MIRROR. As simple as that.I can't deny that from a more technical point-of-view we could say this is the best Michael Cretu production to date, but it sounds just like Enigma 3! While listening to it I thought: \\"Hey! This song is a faster, remixed 'Why!'\\", or \\"Isn't that from the last track of the first album?\\", or \\"Somebody tell him to stop shouting!\\". Most elements and instruments used in the songs sound as if they were RECYCLED from his earlier work. Also, there are too many \\"O Fortuna\\" adaptations and remixes out there to listen to random samples across an entire album. There is no strong \\"hit\\" song either, or at least as engaging as \\"Return to Innocence\\", \\"Carly's Song\\", \\"Why!\\", \\"Mea Culpa\\" or \\"Sadeness\\". If you want more Enigma 3, buy this album. If you'd like evolution in Cretu's work, look elsewhere because in this album there is none."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly anthemic, much?","review":"I find this album, with its cliche and anthemic melodies, to be an insult to anyone with intelligence.

To begin with, the first track takes way too long to get off the ground, and the talking accompanying this track is very annyoing. I think Enigma is trying to be too enigmatic. Most of the rest of the c.d. was rather unappealing. There are a couple of okay tunes, but nothing special."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame at best...","review":"Where are the catchy tunes from \\"The Cross of Changes\\"? Where is the semi-ethno flavor of \\"Le Roi est Mort, Vive le Roi\\"? What has happened to Enigma? The \\"Cross of Changes\\" album still remains one of my favorite all time recordings, but none of that spirit is found in Enigma's last effort. It is just a repetition of the same beat and tune over and over again. Nothing makes you want to come back for more, nothing moves you inside the way the good old Enigma tunes used to... I was so disappointed. I feel they have run out of inspiration, and are just trying too hard, and unsuccesfully, to keep afloat. Too much electric guitar, too many poor vocals, too much repetition... too little to make me want to play the CD ever again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chill Sensual Groove","review":"I love Enigma. I really love Enigma. \\"The Screen Behind The Mirror\\" is another great offering from this tight, creative ensemble. Whenever I want to kick it and calm down (which I need to do because I do get easily worked up my friends say) I put on an Enigma disc and fly. I don't know why it took me so long to get around to this one but I was not let down. I especially connect with \\"Silence Must Be Heard\\" and \\"Gravity Of Love\\". And I have to say, I really love the artwork on their covers. The visuals put me in in the mood for the aural experience.One big complaint: This CD is way to short!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stuck on repeat!","review":"I love Engima.

But who can say it has been done with such style and musical feel to it than on \\"The Screen Behind The Mirror\\". Absolutely great! And the rest of the album (combining all the previous ones) really works around the theme (Carmina Burana) - result: it's very powerful. I like the idea of a theme throughout the album, like in Enigma's debut release, because it gives the tracks on the album continuity."},{"rating":"2","title":"The music of Enigma","review":"I have been a fan of Enigma for a couple of years. I have the first 2 cds, which are amazing. I just got \\"The Screen behind the mirror today and I just can't stop listening to it. The music is just so enchanting. Some of my favorites are \\"Push the Limits\\",and \\"Gravity of Love\\". The whole cd is incredible though. I love how each of Enigma's cds have a theme and are different. It never leaves the listener bored. Enigma's music sends you off to a mystic dreamworld where total relaxation is the main concern. I love to dim the lights, lay back and just drift with the music. I give this cd 5+ stars. Once again, I have not been disappointed with Enigma. Buy this cd and take a Journey of the Mind...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Enigma since MCMXC AD","review":"This is definitely Enigma's best CD since their debut MCMXC AD (\\"1990 AD\\") album. While not nearly as meditative as that album, \\"Screen\\"'s songs all fit together better than the wildly-fluctuating \\"Cross of Changes\\" and \\"Le Roi Est Mort, Vive le Roi\\" (\\"The King is Dead, Long Live the King\\"), making an excellent cohesive package (though still far below the standards set by \\"MCMXC\\"). This is a great album on its own, but we're still waiting for a true sequel to \\"MCMXC\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bouncing Ambiance, Moody tends","review":"I just bought this CD...and although it reminds me of all the other ones enigma has put out, this one has a ring of something different.

But I can say that, without doubt, this album is designed to make you feel...pure and simple. And it delivers...yes, it's like their previous albums. And yes, it has a few elements that remain untouched from the original 1990 release of MCMXC a.D. But it IS a genre, folks...and it is a beautiful example of the genre. Think of it as 'mind-message'...especially The Gravity Of Love. Full of feeling, purpose and destination. And there you have it--it's the vibes, folks...the honest-to-goodness way it makes you feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wizard of Oz","review":"I've been a fan of Enigma for quite a while now. Michael is like the man behind the curtain in Wizard of Oz. You rarely get to see him, he doesn't play live, he doesn't show himself all over his videos but he takes you to a place that you've only dreamed about. Michael is a genious and this is my favorite album of his. I recommend all of his albums but this is the best in my opinion. DJ Slyside and jamie smith band wouldn't be the same without Michael setting the standard."},{"rating":"2","title":"LA MUSICA DE EL CORAZON","review":"This is Enigma's best recording. The stand-out recordings are: \\"PUSH THE LIMITS\\"(great pulse pounding workout music),\\"GRAVITY OF LOVE\\"(great love song),\\"MODERN CRUSADERS\\"(fast/upbeat,should have been used in the end credits of X-MEN),\\"CAMERA OBSCURA\\"(FAST), \\"SILENCE MUST BE HEARD\\"(great song with a supernatural sound)."},{"rating":"1","title":"RUTH-ANN FROM \\"OLIVE\\" ONLY GOOD THING HERE....","review":"Damn you, Curly, don't you know that Orff has been sampled now FAR TOO MANY times for you to come along and do it and expect to be considered original? I find it VERY difficult to get by Enigma's over use of the Carl Orff samples... they distract from a very good piece of work, and from an otherwise SPECTACULAR song, \\"Gravity of Love\\". I have been a fan of Enigma AND Olive since both of their respective debuts, and Ruth-Ann's vocals are as strong and passionate as ever, here. If any DJ or music producer reads this, give \\"gravity...\\" a remix WITHOUT the \\"Carmina Burana\\" samples... ;) After a bit of a disappointment after E3, I am underwhelmed over all with this outing. Buy Olive, \\"Extra Virgin\\" if you havent already... IT'S WORTH IT. It should be the litmus test for all other music in this genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"New to Los Angeles","review":"I\`ve heard a quite alot of Enigma stuff.

The Screen Behind The Mirror is indeed an incredible return to form. From the moment the cd begins with that familiar \\"Voice of Enigma\\" music, it is enchanting. Ruth Ann from Olive is an exciting addition and provides the cd with two of its best songs, \\"Gravity of Love\\" and \\"Silence Must Be Heard.\\" If you've never heard her from Olive's \\"Extra Virgin\\" album, get that one too. You'll be wanting to hear more of her. My other fave tracks (at the moment) are \\"Push the Limits\\" and the title track. Unlike some of the other reviews, I enjoy the fact that Cretu returns to some of his themes from the past albums. And although this cd is a bit shorter than the other three, it still packs an emotional wallop. Good job all around, Mr. Cretu."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enigma hits the right spot again!","review":"To all those fellow Enigma fans, this is a great album. They still preserve all those qualities that we love, all the beautiful rhythms and melodic sounds. Although this album was beautiful, I felt that I should expect a little more. Maybe a few more 'complete' songs, perhaps a few more rememberable songs.... I recommend this cd for all Enigma fans and all ambiance lovers, but I would first listen to \\"Love Sensuality Devotion\\" and if you're torn as to which cd to get first, I suggest the latter. Don't get me wrong, \\"Screen\\" is very well put together and is very beautiful, but \\"Love Sensuality Devotion\\" is much more rememberable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting CD","review":"This album is a change from what I normally listen to. The tracks are deep and relaxing. You could describe it as world music. Hightlights include the single \\"Gravity Of Love\\" as well as \\"Silence Must Be Heard\\" which is more upbeat and has more impact than the other songs. Both tracks feature vocals by Ruth-Ann from the group Olive. \\"Push The Limits\\" is the other single, and like many of the tracks features spoken female vocals. This CD is definitely interesting and I'm sure if you like this kind of think, you'll like The Screen Behind The Mirror, but apart from a few stand out tracks, it is a little too deep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very creative and very intriguing!","review":"This CD is awesome! If you like good music for thinking and contemplation, this is it! Enigma has done it before, and they set the standards even higher with this CD! \\"Gravity of Love\\" is the best track on the CD, and all the others are close behind. It is best to listen to this one at night, while you are alone, because this is the only time you will really feel the music - it has many hidden messages. Whether you listen to this one for pure enjoyment (like I do), or for meditation (many people do), it's a great CD that everyone should give a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid introduction to Shi'ism","review":"Yann Richard covers Shiism from Ali through the death of the Ayatollah Khomeyni. He covers its spirituality as well, although his emphasis is on the revolution. He looks at Shiism in Iraq, Lebanon, India and Afghanistan (although his book pre-dates the rise of the Taliban). He also briefly reviews Bahai's Shiite origins--perhaps the most fascinating and far reaching development in Iranian spirituality. Although he gets a little wrapped up in French intellectual dramatics, his book is a solid introduction to Shiism. He assumes a general knowledge of Islamic history and spirituality, but otherwise this is a very accessible book (despite the series' title)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent book","review":"This book was ok, but it was fairly basic in ideas.

The plot, as you can imagine, won't \\"surprise\\" you much, but the characters are well developed, acting is more than adequate and the story line is... almost credible! Romeo and Julieta (played by the stunningly beautiful Luana Piovani) are particularly well done and you will likely care a lot for them and root for a happy ending of their love story. If you don't like soccer you will likely find that there is a bit too much screen time devoted to games and team cheering, but no big deal. If you think soccer is THE most important thing in the world (as many characters in this movie seem to do) you will likely enjoy this movie immensely.

Terribly boring and uninspired. Obvious and tired chord progressions and musicianship.

I think Francine Pascal should have stopped while she was ahead. The series was good, and she could have ended it after Loki died. Without him, there really isn't a story plot. I don't want to hear about all these stupid high school problems. If I did, I would have bought a Sweet Valley High book (also written by her). I guess if you read the series, you might want to read this, just to see how it goes. I'll read until the end for curiousity. And the fact that it can't get worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to find exactly what you need","review":"I started reading this book right after \\"Sams Teach Yourself Macromedia Flash 5 in 24 Hours,\\" and what a disappointment it was. I expected tutorials and step-by-step illustrations. Instead, I got vague hints as to what Director can do (minus examples and pictures). Looking for how to do those things was a daunting task. This book is badly organized. In fact, the author says that information on how to publish your Director file can be found in Chapter 2, Chapter 9...etc. Things are not exactly in one place. I'll go back to using this book when I'm more experienced with Director, but until then, it makes a great flower press."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Guide","review":"This book is the best for learning how to use Director. I started out not knowing anything, went through a couple of chapters and can do almost anything I want now in Director. I takes you slowly through each section of Director. Including lingo, this book covers everything. I work for Gary and looking in the book is just as good as talking to him. Gary is seriously the best and this book encapsulates what he knows about director. Pick it up if you want to learn how to use director or if you want to become a more advanced programmer. Also if you want to know more about programming in Lingo look for Lingo for Games it has all sorts of code in it and is an extremely useful tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for quick reference.","review":"Found this book unhelpful for quick reference to specific problems that needed to be solved.

It's quite long, yet I take joy in re-reading it and look forward to the next time I enjoy it. A rare, candid, unpretentious insight into a life. After reading it recently, I re-read some of her mysteries and understood which parts she took from her own life. For example, the character of Ariadne Oliver is a version of herself. Ariadne relates stories that really happened to Agatha. If you love biographies, I recommend it, even if you are not a mystery fan. An interesting aside: since much of her life was spent in Iraq and other parts of the middle East, and also in dealing with war (WWI and WWII), this is an interesting read from our modern perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Thumps Up","review":"I have read most of Agatha Chritie's book.

The remianing did not and I received no email to let me know if they were out if stock or back ordered. I attempted to find contact info to check on the order which became a major chore. The product was ordered directly from Amazon not another vendor. Once I finally found the contact info I called customer service and was informed that the product was backordered and it would not be instock for another week. But the service rep said it could take up to an addtional 2 weeks to ship, mind you I had 2 day shipping, and if I did not receive it at the end of the addtional 2 weeks call back and the would ship it overnight.

When my professor said no magazines or internet addresses allowed, I about died. I had some trouble finding a lot of information other than magazine articles on Alanis, but after I found this book I had all I needed. It was not only informative, but extremely interesting and something I actually enjoyed reading. I found that I knew very little of Alanis and her past, and after reading it I had gained a great sense of respect and admiration for her. She is truly an amazing, talented person both musically and in her personality. She really enjoys her music, and lives through it, which is clearly evident after reading this book. I would definately reccommend it to anyone wishing to learn more about her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Number 1 Fan","review":"I have to say that this book was very informative and told me loads of things about Alanis that i though i already knew.

Well, it is definately among the best. If you need Up To Date information on Alanis this is the book to read. It is the most recent written Alanis book, and has info on both the Tibetan Freedom Concert and Bridge School Benefit. It has eight pages of color pictures. If you would like to view the cover, it has the same picture as \\"Death Of Cinderella\\" except smaller, and the backround is of Alanis facing up like praying or something. The pictures are all black and white, however they are beautiful RARE ones (like Alanis and Madonna and Alanis running in the triathalon in mid summer 1997.) The review I wrote before is fiction.

This is has the same idea as Inu-yasha except twisted a bit. A girl is accidentally taken to the distant past. She is a priestess to all the people and there is the powerful male protector who has a little demon inside. It is actually a totally different story from Inu-yasha. The only similarity is that it has a girl sent to the past and finds that she is needed by a group a superstitious (and gossiping) villagers.

This manga (Priestess) is the first in the series, and it introduces Miaka and her friends, so this is definitely the one to get if you are interested.

It's difficult for me to give DMB anyting less than a perfect review. Although this is an excellent album, I would recommend Live at the Redrocks. You might not get some of the band's newer songs, but the energy and precision is much better on Redrocks. And coming from the perspective of a Carter Beauford fanatic, the drumming is better on Redrocks. CAUTION: Unless you are a huge DMB fan or are intersted in musical improvisation, don't get both live albums.

They did however play some songs I was excited to hear but on these songs (granny, #36, and true reflections) they had the \\"stay girls\\" sing with them. Now I don't really have anything against these girls but they just don't sound good with band on any song with maybe \\"stay\\" being the exception. I love hearing the band live and perfer live albums over studio albums.

Dave needs to wait a few years before putting out another live album. Get in the studio and get some NEW SONGS first. I'm sure it was a good show, but save your money and go see the concert yourself. If you want a good live album, buy PHISH: HAMPTON COMES ALIVE. No 2 Phish shows are alike and you get much more bang for your buck.

Crash was awesome. Before These Crowded Streets had its moments, but it had its serious flaws. Listener Supported was the first live DMB album I got. Ouch. \\"Long Black Veil\\" that everyone seems to be ranting about is an insult to Johnny Cash, who wrote the song and did it much better. The \\"All Along the Watchtower\\" that everybody seems to love is travesty to Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, it is the worst cover of that song I have ever heard. The rest of the album takes songs that were good or at least passable and corrupts them. Some bands have great live albums. DMB, at least with this album, sounds worse than I have ever heard them. Honestly, this band would benefit greatly from the removal of Dave. He is whiny, nasal, and can't play guitar. The rest of his band is much more talented, but you just can't see that on this album. Don't waste your money on this double dose of nauseatingly bland junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC!","review":"This new album of Dave Matthews shows again (as if we really need another prove) the great music that the band is able to deliver during live performances. Perfect sound recording... a MUST HAVE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"live albums=worse quality","review":"why bother? its the same songs on the album with no change whatsoever except that now you get to hear it with an annoying crowd in the background and bad quality...YAY! (id pay extra for that!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break","review":"For the past 5 years my nephew has said this band is awesome. I broke down and listened to it, zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. I can't give this cd a better review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice but for Kenny G audience","review":"Very big disappointment. DMB can do that much better. Strictly commercial"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD, but DMB has done better live performances","review":"I'm a BIG fan of Dave Matthews, but I've also been to concerts in person. This CD is a great CD, and does capture the essence of DMB live. The thing is, I've heard so much better from them in person! There are some great tracks here. (On a side note, Long Black Veil is a great track. It's just so much more wonderfully depressing when Mick Jagger sings it on \\"The Chieftains-Long Black Veil\\" album... I reccomend it).To be warned, a lot of these tracks are taken at a particularlly slow tempo. For the most part it works, but sometimes you wish they'd stop slowing everything down. Just a small gripe...If you're a DMB fan, and even if you're not, you'll love this CD. I rate it 4 stars only because they are capable of so much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's time for something new Dave","review":"I have every CD Dave Matthews has put out. I was eager to listen to this when it came out. I played it once and put it away, I may give it away. He does do justice to The Long Black Veil, but that is about it. Watchtower is much better on Redrocks that it is here. Warehouse, Jimi Thing, and Rhyme and Reason AGAIN! I surprised Ants isn't on this CD. Go back to the studio and work your magic a couple more times before you \\"bless\\" us with yet another live CD. And when you do, don't record in New Jersey for crying out loud. He has put out more live CD's than studio CD's. It is also very clear why he does covers of Veil and Watchtower, it's because he doesn't have enough of his own material. If you have Red Rocks that is all you need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great live album","review":"I'm not much on live albums, especially those of the \\"greatest hits\\" nature, but this one is really worth the money. An excellent performance that has exceptional sound quality and a dash of audience presence. \\"Listener Supported\\" really shows why Dave Matthews Band is one of the most note-worthy groups in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Totally Origional Artist","review":"The Dave Matthews band is the most origional sound out there right now. This collection of songs, from a concert of three month's ago captures the essance of Dave and the band, the breathtaking music, haunting lyric's, and Dave's amazing voice. Enjoy this guy, he is a rare one indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome. Much better than the Red Rocks set.","review":"DMB's new live effort kicks. There are very few modern acts out there who can equal these guys in musicianship, and the recording is remarkably clean. Particularly good is the song selection. \\"Don't Drink the Water\\" is their best song, and along with hits like \\"Crash Into Me\\", \\"Too Much\\", and \\"Stay (Wasting Time)\\", there are some rarer cuts like \\"#36\\" and \\"Granny\\" that really rock in concert. Dave's voice is great as always and the band smokes, especially hit-man Carter Beauford, who is the John Bonham of his time. Violinist Boyd Tinsley contributes to the set with his song \\"True Reflections\\", a real showstopper that I hope they play on the next tour as well. Be sure to pick up \\"Listener Supported\\", it a great piece of work. P.S. The four star rating is for the occasional improvision, which at times can drag along a bit on some songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captures the true essence of a live concert","review":"i've always been a dave fan, and i absolutely love this CD. On this double disk set, there are favs such as two step, warehouse and jimi thing, as well as newer songs like #41, and stay. This is music to pop i the car and drive around aimlessly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential, beautious","review":"cover of johnny cash's long black veil is amazing, but would anyone ever expect anything less form the one of the most talented group of musical geniouses out there...ther whole thing has a huge place in my heart...bit better than Live at Red Rocks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Minor Flaws Hold This Album Back","review":"I'm a big fan of Dave Matthews Band, and I like every album of theirs that I have heard, but compared to Live At Red Rocks this is a disapointing live album. Disc one of this set is near perfect, excellant versions of their excellant songs are played. Disc 2 is where the disapointing side sets in, the songs on this side are (except for 3 or 4) either live versions of songs that I didn't like from Before These Crowded Streets or not so great cover songs.(A hard core fan will be happy to hear so previously unavailable covers though) All in all this album is way better that average, but when compared to other DMB efforts its kinda flawed. Live at Red Rocks is way better, so if you're a casual fan you might want to avoid this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Of course it's awesome it's DAVE!","review":"You need some change from CD to CD, this album has a little bit more of a jazzy sound. Doesn't matter that there was no Tim Reynolds, Dave pulled off another great live CD. True Reflections is great, I suggest getting the DVD of the concert it adds to the music. Although Say Goodbye would have been a nice addition to the album. Oh well, can't wait for the new CD! Strongly suggest you add this to your DMB collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"good cd, but could have been better","review":"first, i'm a huge dmb fan. i like the album, but i feel that the setlist was terrible. there were plenty other great shows on this years tour that could have been used. i don't listen to the first disc that much, but the closing and enchore were descent. the show lacked some of the great old tunes such as ants, tripping billies, wwys, ... it did include a great wharehouse, granny, true reflections (not played as well as usual, but still one of my favorite songs), #40, the great cover of long black veil, and crash. although i suggest this cd to anyone who doesn't have it, i would still rather listen to one of my tapes from trax. another thing, the gospel singers are great on stay, but i wouldn't want to listen to them for a whole show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same ol' Same ol'","review":"I'm a huge dmb fan, but I dont think this cd was worth it. He's already put out two live cd's that contained mostly previoiusly released songs. Red Rocks was fine because it was the first one, and Luther College was ok because it was accoustic, and with tim, but another live one--- its getting a little redundant. The music itself isnt bad, but i dont see the point to paying for the same stuff. I'm looking forward to the next cd though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just what the world needed...","review":"OK, first off let me say that I have always been a fan of the DMB and have seen them numerous times in concert, but I just have to ask, was this album really necessary? I have to wonder why musicians this creative and talented want to keep reprocessing old material in lieu of--gasp!--an actual new album that includes no previously recorded songs. Of course, DMB fans will run out and purchase this and they will all love it, so if you are a DMB disciple then go for it. But if you want to get excited about the DMB again, this is not the album that'll do it for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"STICK TO THE STUDIO ALBUMS!","review":"I think it is time that someone dismiss the theory that the DMBAND is better live than in the studio. This is simply ludicrous. Too often in concert, Dave's voice cracks or does something totally annoying that is easily covered up in the studio. Plus, at times, the band tends to add to parts of songs attempting to make it sound fuller, when in essence it makes it sound cluttered and noisy. Compare the versions of \\"Don't Drink The Water,\\" \\"Two Step\\" & \\"Jimi Thing\\" to their originals. It is no comparison. My suggestion would be to stick to their 3 studio albums, all of which are incredible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough Live Albums of the Same Stuff Already","review":"I think Dave Mathews has been hanging out with Yanni or something. Both of these artists seem to put out an abundance of the same songs on different albums. This is Dave Mathews 3rd Live album and it is about time he came up with something new already."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major let down from a band with lots of talent","review":"As a long time fan of DMB I must say that this release was not their most successful endeavor. The music lacks the passion and energy that the band normally projects during their shows. The show was so pitiful that after hearing the first few songs I was literally brought to tears wanting to reach into my speakers and give Dave a good slapping. The band sounds tired and the songs drag. I would not recommend this CD to people that are not familiar with the band's work. This release will turn you away from the band for good. The show's few highlights would be the dixie chicken version of crash and #40 though it isn't really Captain of My Ship. I would only recommend this CD to avid fans of the band that just can't live with themselves if they don't own every one of DMB's albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jazzy","review":"This is my favorite Live Dave cd because of how jazzy it is. I have never heard Leroi so good in any other live cd. Every song is so instrumental and huge solos from many instruments. The jazzy solos from the flute, saxaphone, clarinet, piano, and violin are out of this world. Not to mention Carter and Dave busting out in a couple songs. Sure Red Rocks was the first which to some people automatically makes it the best live cd but instrumentally which is why I love DMB this is the best live album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Softer Side of Matthews","review":"If one were to match the live albums of DMB to their studio albums, this is definitely the live answer to Under the Table and Dreaming. Accordingly, just like UtTaD, some people like the different, more mysterious and less driving feel of Matthews, some don't. This album have no really week spots in my opinion although the backup vocals did not impress me. This Album does have some cool rundowns: Two Step is very nice, and Long Black Veil also adds some flavor to the recording. I just didn't like the different flavor as much, and if I had a choice on live albums, although they are both good, sadly I would take Live at Red Rocks over this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Definate Recommend","review":"I recently bought this cd and video and the setlist is amazing. The video was really cool since this is only the second time i have seen them in concert live. If you are or even if you arent a huge fan than this is a cd for you"},{"rating":"2","title":"Listener Supported is Gugs Favorite DMB CD.","review":"I feel that dave matthews band is like no other band in the world, and he shows it in listener supported. In sweeden DMB has perfromed great live performance, and live performance is captured in their new Compact Disc. Guest Keyboardist Butch Taylor accompanies the band throughout the entire show adding a sensual flavor on songs like two step, #41, and Watchtower. This is a great CD and you will love it,many songs on it! It will keep you warm during the cold holiday season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave Matthews just keeps satisfying","review":"Although i have over 50 Concerts on CD of Dave Mathews with Tim, and with the Band, I still had no problem paying the $17.99 for this new disc. I watched the concert the night it aired on PBS, and i couldnt wait to get ahold of it. Even though i have every song on it in 4 or 5 different forms, its still a new concert. And for those of you who dont trade concerts, you should def. purchase this concert. I thought LBV was a nice change of pace, as well as it was nice to see Ants didnt make the cut. I'm Looking forward to Dave's new music which is supposed to be recorded in January."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal!","review":"This album felt like it put me right there. the crowd is really into it and Dave funks it up as usual. This is yet more proof that DMB is one of the greatest live bands around!With fan favs live #40, #41 and a fantastic version of Two Step, this is a CD that will live in my CD player for a while!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good.. only good","review":"This CD is good, but not as good as previously released DMB cd's. I really enjoyed DMB's version of \\" All Along The Watchtower\\" but I feel several of the songs were made longer through jam sessions, several of these jam sessions were good but others were just a long waist of space. DMB is an excellant live band but i feel it is time they release a new studio cd rather than just live material."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Just........Blah","review":"If you're a true Dave Matthews fan, than you DO NOT NEED THIS CD. Having been at the PBS concert in NJ that this CD is taken from (it was mostly teeny boppers there, not true fans) , I was skeptical when I heard that yet another live CD was being made from it, and upon listening to it, I was dissappointed, as expected. If you're looking for quintessential live DMB , you're much better sticking with Live at Red Rocks, or better yet, a taped show. Don't get me wrong, Dave is still one of my favorite artists, but the live CD thing is getting old, although I respect the difficulties and strain of touring for more than a year straight. Bottom line, I was so dissappointed with this CD after listening through it once that I gave it away. Maybe its okay for the occasional listener, but long time Dave fans won't find anything new here."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have Other Live DMB, this one's a rerun","review":"I am a huge DMB fan from way, way back and typically love their live stuff. If you have red rocks and luther, you will not find much new here and in fact, may be disappointed with some of the arrangements.Let's do something new guys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Questioning Dave","review":"While I am a huge fan of Dave, I am so dissatisfied with this CD. Its the same songs that I have on SEVEN other CDs. Enough already. I originally liked Dave becuase of his unique style and creativity- how many more live albums are you going to put out Dave? Granted, there are a few good songs. In my opinion- even if you are a HUGE Dave fan, dont waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Awesome Live by DMB","review":"This is a great album for true DMB fans who can appreciate a different spin on an old tune as well as the new stuff. If you are someone who just wants to hear DMB play Ants Marching or Jimi Thing the same old way, one more time, this album is not for you. However, if you are a true DMB fan who revels in the talent of the ensemble and loves to hear them improvise and spin new interpretations, BUY THIS!DMB puts on a great show, and this captures the live atmosphere beautifully.I personally am not fond of the versions of some songs (specifically, Don't Drink, Stay - the back up singers kind of overshadow Dave in an annoying way - or Watchtower - lacks intensity). But #41, Granny (just flat out amazing), True Reflections, PNP/Rapunzel, Crash (including the Dixie Chicken tag) and Long Black Veil are must haves for any DMB fan who truly appreciates the evolving sound of the band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the original Anne of GG and Anne of Avonlea (the sequel) but skip the rest - horrible","review":"The classics written by L. Montgomery are wonderful and at that time the director, Kevin Sullivan seemed to understand the characters and it translated in the films BUT I GIVE HIM A HUGE 'F' FOR THE FOLLOW ON MOVIES/SCRIPTS THAT HE WROTE. The choices he has Anne and Gilbert make are COMPLETELY out of character for them...I mean come on, they wanted to both be in Avonlea and he had them sell the house, let it go to a pigsty with trashy tenants, and they moved to NY where they did nothing even remotely similar to their character's foundation and beliefs. Just horrible. Don't buy this full set, but the first two by L. Montgomery only. So disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chess Wizardry: The New ABC of Chess Problems","review":"Highly recommended to anyone interested in Chess problems and puzzles, this latest edition of a classic (1996) book presents themes and terms in quasi-alphabetical order with examples. Written in clear and understandable language and using figurine-algebraic notation, the text reflects the author's vast experience in almost every area of problem composition. I am prevented from awarding a 5th star due an annoying publishing flaw - the over-inking of diagrams in the vicinity of page 300 (Problems for Solving) often prevents one from distinguishing a White piece from a Black one (especially difficult with the Queens). I returned my first copy, but reluctantly kept the second when it became apparent that either; 1)every print run suffered the same problem or 2)I got the exact same book back again (this time, used) and it was just meant to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtakingly cool stylings, Never dull or predictable","review":"I had this on vinyl when it first came out. You cannot not like this album. Morgana's covers of the then newer songs are wonderful interpretations. The original \\"Jennifer Had\\" is lovingly sad. This is a great intro to anyone who is just now getting to know Morgana. For us old fans, that soft voice is caressing our ears over and over again. Here she moved away from the classic songs and it worked in grand fashion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Again the cancer of contempary has crept in.","review":"I am disgusted with this new album. I wanted to unleash some righteous anger on my cd player when I heard the \\"Christian music\\" coming from it. The Bible, GOD'S WORD, says, \\"be not CONFORMED to this world\\". Why take the world's music and add WATERED downed \\"Christian\\" lyrics. One review is quoted as saying the album is \\"easy listening\\"; well that is about all it is.

I bought it yesterday and have already listened to it 4 times, it just doesnt get boring. Pino Palladino's bass playing is pristine as usual, as is Roy Hargrove on the trumpet, and some of Charlie Hunter's guitar licks are verging on sexual. Ahmir ?uestlove really shines aswell - his and pino's grooves get extremely tasty at numerous points. Production from the great Russell Elvado is well worth his grammy aswell.Definatly worth your money, and if your a musician or producer this is vital education. One for the grooveheads certainly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely Worth the Wait!","review":"D'Angelo new release, Voodoo, is definitely an album that will stand the test of time. From beginning to end, whether the beat is smooth and jazzy or tickled with a little bit of funk, each song will move you right down to the center of your soul.You can definitely hear the time and dedication that D'Angelo has put into the production of this album. All the songs are heartfelt, a genuine demonstration of true love and appreciation for the art of music.The album is a breath of fresh air and a welcome change from what some have come to accept as \\"music\\" today.If you haven't gotten it yet...go get it!

D'Angleo has truly come through with a very powerful and spiritually conscious album.There is jazz,hip-hop,soul,love,hate, God, and upliftment throughout this album.Aspiring artists and entertainers, please learn from this album. It is what music it to be about. D'Angelo has filled a soulful void with Voodoo. I think no one can argue that this album will be one that will be loved and admired by the world for years to come. Thank you D'Angleo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Some Clothes Buddy!","review":"D'Angelo would be so awesome if he would wear clothes in his video.

He definitely shows growth in this LP, and he brings something fresh to the table. I listened to this album all day at work, and I'm having a hard time trying to pick favorites! Judging from this album, and his progression from the last joint, he'll always be at the forefront."},{"rating":"2","title":"D'Angelo is the ghetto Prince for the 2000","review":"D'Angelo album is off the hook listen to this album when you kick back chillin with yo woman or man or when getting high. D'Angelo new album put's you in that mood. Worth buying peeps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh?","review":"The songs don't really begin or end, they sort of drift into the room and drift out. The vocals are extremely undermixed. Too much bass and drums. Too many slow songs, no energy, all pothead music, people just too stoned to do anything and laying around staring at the TV type music. Unmotivated, unmotivating, dull, sleepy. Listless. The rap bit in the second song is annoying but fortunately it's undermixed, like all the rest of the vocals, so you can barely hear it. And this goes on for almost AN HOUR AND A HALF.Some advice for D'Angelo: (1) CD's usually have songs on them, try to write some next time. (2) Stop smoking so much pot, it's affecting your music in a bad way. (3) Mix down the bass and drums, or if not, try to get them to play on the beat. (4) BUY A SHIRT ALREADY, OK!?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love, Peace, and Chicken Grease","review":"The beats are smooth yet funky, and his voice is... I really can't describe it. This is a great CD to sing along with in your car even though I had no idea what he was saying half the time. My favorite song? Track 4 with Redman and Method Man, very very nice. Also Track 10 is hot. This is a must have for any music lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"smooth","review":"Although I'm tired of seeing his naked body on BET all the time, D'Angelo's music is definitely something to consider. The first few tracks of the CD have a sampled hip-hop flavor and are nice to listen to, but the best part of the album starts with songs after Left & Right (which really didn't need to be on the CD after D'Angelo dissed rap in the liner notes). Many songs really have something to say and his Prince-like hard-to-understand voice blends in well with the live instrumentation. But why does a male need to use his body to sell albums when he could sell them anyway?"},{"rating":"2","title":"so sexy it hurts","review":"not since Charlie Mingus' \\"The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady\\" has an album just screamed SEX from the first track to the last. Untitled (how does it feel) is unbelievable and restrained. It kills me everytime. It's gonna be a good summer with this around..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvin Gaye for the new millenium","review":"Voodoo is the only word to explain this album. Few artists have the looks, voice, instrumental skills, and overall pimpness to make such sexually explicit themes so sensual and love based. Not since marvin gaye has someone made what is lust in rap, pure loving bliss here.Yes, brown sugar was GREAT, but fails in comparrison to this gem. Not only does it touch on jazz, r&B, hip-hop, soul, and funk, but it blends perfectly. I recently have strayed away from this type of music, listening to IDM stars like aphex twin, autechre, and squarepusher. BUT, this album soon brought me back to my love of truly passionate music, which is what this is. R&B is a pile of dumpx10, as is all rap and hip hop, as it dies in 1998, but this album shows the future of black music in the year 2000. Not so base and money greedy, but passionate, moving, and most of all jazzzzzzzzy. Devil's Pie, Left and Right, and How does it feel themselves make this a great buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really worth the money","review":"To start off, this CD does not display any of his real talent. If you want to actually listen to D'Angelo, purchase his first CD. This CD sounds [voodoo] sounds as though he didn't take enough time and energy to it. It sounds like it was rushed. Yeah, it did take him five years to come out with something new, but out of that five years, how long was he writing on this one, about 3 weeks? Anyways, what I am trying to say is, is that D'Angelo could have done much better than what he did on this CD. And to make matters even more worse, all the damn music sounds the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hunk Alert!","review":"This dude is hot!

Can't wait to see this guy in concert."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elevator Music","review":"It's not a bad cd, but i wish he would project his voice more. It just sounded like gibberish all the way through the cd. I like R&B artists that when you hear them, you have to stop and go \\"Whoa, who was that?\\" whereas I could hear him on a closed elevator in the dead of night and wouldn't pay much attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music for the dead and dying","review":"What a disappointment. After listening for about seven times to the whole of this sorry mess, waiting for it to \\"grow\\" on me, I can only conclude: A complete waste of time. Even though D'Angelo undoubtedly is a great singer, this album also features him as songwriter, producer and overall genius. The attempt completely backfires. This music isn't just un-catchy - it is completely uninspired, no melodies to speak of, no words to linger. The bone-dry production makes it only worse, leaving me disgusted. The sound is probably meant to take black soulful music to another level - yet it plunges straight into some cold and dark abyss. I tend to get the feeling that you either have to be dead to really enjoy this album or it will kill you through boredom. If you still think you like this stuff, just compare it to a number of closely associated recent releases by female black artists like Kelis or Angie Stone - a world of difference in quality, style and - yes - soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't say i didn't warn you...","review":"This album is kind of like driving the wrong way down a one-way street. It may take a lot of courage, but, that doesn't mean you should do it. The entire album was a jumbled mess. Where as the creativity is partially there, there is no cohesion. That's probably why he was naked in the video for the SECOND single \\"Untitled, How Does It Feel\\", because even having Redman and Method Man couldn't create any heat for \\"Left, Right\\". And on the subject of creativity, any hack can imitate Jimi Hendrix and every tenor with even the smallest aspiration of a singing career has a falsetto reminiscent of Prince or Al Green. This album sounds like one of the many Tupac \\"unreleased\\" albums that were indeed released posthumously, they were never meant to heard by the listening public and with good reason, because they weren't any good. Disappointment is an understatement when describing this album, disgrace is much more appropriate."},{"rating":"2","title":"sexy soul","review":"Dangelo's sound on this album is like no other. It reminds me of that old prince sound I just love to hear. You will enjoy his deep soul stirring sound and his meanful lyrcs this albums a classic in the making."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superior Second CD!","review":"Who would have thought that D'Angelo could muster up a superior CD as \\"Voodoo\\"! That title alone should be getting everyones attention. \\"VooDoo\\" is one of those albums that should be taken seriously. Not only is it spiritual, but also \\"Voodoo\\" has proven to be one of his best efforts to date. Most noteable standouts (in my opinion) are: \\"The Line\\" (slamming bass line), \\"The Root\\" (very deep message), \\"One MoGin\\", \\"Africa\\" (taking it back to the motherland), \\"Playa Playa\\" (song says it all), and \\"Send It On\\" (impressive slow song). Actually the whole CD is impressive. This is definately a add-on to your personal collection. If you like real soul music, \\"Voodoo\\" is the Cd for you...Sdeez"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Sound","review":"D'Angelo brings to the music business something we do not see often in modern records: music. From his smooth voice to his funky, talented band of musicians, the musicality of this record is tremendous. The slow, easy melodies of Untitled (How Does It Feel) and Send It On, and the up-tempo, beat-heavy Devil's Pie form a brilliant, panoramic landscape of sound. D'Angelo's Voodoo is a welcome diversion from the monotony of modern music."},{"rating":"2","title":"D'Angelo continues his steady climb to greatness with Voodoo","review":"I really looked forward to this LP, and for the most part, I was not disappointed. This is a very, very good LP. D'Angelo accomplishes the goal for any rising artist: to develop range and maturity while at the same time maintaining a signature \\"sound.\\" However, some great jams like \\"Playa Playa\\" and \\"One Mo'Gin,\\" fall prey to the same problems with Brown Sugar: they go . . . on . . . too . . . long. And in my opinion, the album is a tad too-bass driven, and the intricacies of the production are lost in the deep grooves.That being said, there are several outstanding tracks on Voodoo, including the aforementioned \\"Playa Playa,\\" \\"Spanish Joint,\\" \\"Chicken Grease\\" and \\"Untitled.\\" D'Angelo makes another tight joint, and I look forward to stronger efforts in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"needle in a haystack","review":"the best soul album in a decade. a dream project for d'angelo using ol'school combo of live/studio production finally realizing his own \\"fulfillingness' first finale\\". warm soul perfection. thanks d'angelo for inspiring a new generation of soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic, smooth retro soul and motown","review":"It's as if Marvin Gaye and Al Green were still pumping out new music in their prime. D'Angelo has the best male voice in popular music today. His voice has that rich horn-like quality that Marvin and Al had and he can hit the high notes at will. There's one great track after another and surprisely there's more of a breezy jazzy feel to the album than a modern hip hop groove, even with guest appearances by Redman and Method Man. D'Angelo lets the songs take their time to develop so nothing seems rushed which, you will see, is a nice change from most music which is designed for 3 minute play so as not to upset the radio commercial schedule. Given all the above, it's the rare album that gets better and better with each listen.Only criticism I have is that the first few tracks are the only weak ones on the album and lead to a slower start than I would like. Oh well, just hit \\"random play\\" on your CD to take care of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"VOODOO(EDITED)","review":"I ACTUALLY BOUGHT THE CD BECAUSE OF (2) SONGS ON THE CD.HOW DOES IT FEEL AND SEND IT ON.AFTER LISTENING TO THE ENTIRE CD I REALIZED I GOT MORE FOR MY MONEY.THE MUSIC IS SOFT AND SENSOUS.I WOULD ADVISE ANYONE TO BUY IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hypnotic Rythmms reminding you of all the greats","review":"This CD was one truly worth waiting for. I have a habit ofbuying at least one cd a week, and I would have bought this onetwice! You know how it is a rarity that you can listen to a cd completely through and like every song. Well THIS IS IT! you can listen to every song and feel as if it is the first time you've heard it. We all can hear that it's got a prince, marvin,kinda d'angelo feel to it. THis is truly a master piece of our time. But if u don't respect and love true music this cd is not 4 U.END"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the wait","review":"I think that the best new edition to my cd collection would have to be D'angelo's \\"Voodoo\\". I loved \\"Brown Sugar\\" so much. I still play it. It's a very laid back cd with silky beats and meaningful lyrics. \\"Voodoo\\" is much the same. It's the kind of cd that you can just sit back, press play, and listen to the entire thing. My only complaint is that there aren't enough pics of D'angelo on the cd! Definetely worth the wait for this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"REALLY grows on you","review":"I didn't think much of this CD the first few times I listened to it.

It's nice to hear something soulful; an ablum that has substance and meaning. I listen to a lot of hip-hop and what i hate most is when i get an album full of pointless yelling and chatter. Plus there's too much bling-ing right now. D'angelo took his time to create this piece of art and it paid off!!

Anoverlong,boring,and quawky sounding album.D'Angelo's falsettois beginning to sound like a cat yawning,in other words' he needs a new singing style.Now I have to say that \\"Chicken Grease\\"and \\"The Root\\" may be good,but other than that \\"Voodoo\\" isbasically just one,long,redundant 78-minute track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow...","review":"This was definitely worth the wait. Voodoo is the perfect album for all occasions...lovin', thinkin' and chillin'. D'Angelo just sweats sexiness while at the same time providing insightful lyrics. Voodoo is a swirling mash of styles from soul to blues. The album is beautiful, relaxing and stimulating all at the same time. So what about the flaws? Honestly, I can't say there are any. However, if someone were to put an unnecessarily large gun to my head (thank you, Charlton Heston...) I'd say that the songs are a bit too long and that Method Man and Redman seem out of place. (It's best when they have the space to Let Da Monkey Out...get their album,though. Someone like Common or Q-Tip would have been more appropriate.) For those itchin for some good \\"neo-soul\\" (or whatever you wish to label it)should buy this album. It's a little bit of everything, but it's that indescribable nothing that makes it so great."},{"rating":"1","title":"FIVE YEARS FOR THIS?","review":"I HAD VERY HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR THIS CD.

IT HAS TOO MANY BEATS AND VOICES.WHAT IS HE TRYING TO SAY.BROWN SUGAR WAS A MUCH BETTER CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetition","review":"D'Angelo lost some of his music since his last recording, and this album is more about style and mood than it is about music.Many of the songs are produced the same way - with easy flowing beats backing two or three tracks of D'Angelo's vocals. That's okay for a couple songs, but it gets old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music lover","review":"The CD was in great condition when I received it.

DON'T let his rough, macho, street look that best fits the G-rap category turn you off.Or you' ll miss a thang, very essential thang for any R&B music fan.Voodoo obviously showcases D' Angelo' s promising career and amazing talents through his crooning vocals and ably instrumental skills, and proudly put him into the bright light mainstream once again.If you like the way he temptingly croons in \\" I Found My Smile Again, \\" then you will love this album.D' is here to stay for quite long, and we all know that. Let' s just hope 05 years from now he' s not gonna change his show name to somethang like TAFKAD ( The Artist Formerly Known As D' Angelo ) !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy Voodoo","review":"Voodoo is a great sophomore effort by D'Angelo. I thought he took more risks, took his time with developing each song, and - what I like the most - he employs a lot of acoustic instruments (especially the bass and drums)which add texture and life to his songs. There's a lot of soul missing in R&B right now, and D'Angelo is just the artist to bring a soul revival to the industry. I loved \\"Worked a Root,\\" \\"Spanish Joint,\\" \\"How Does it Feel\\" (of course the video might have had a tiny influence there *smile*) and especially \\"Africa.\\"I could have done without some of the tacky profanity (especially in track 3), but other than that, I thought this CD was a great investment. I'd recommend it whole-heartedly to those who are tired of the unimaginative, formulaic \\"songs\\" they're hearing on the radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classy CD with boomin' bass","review":"It's rare to find a CD where all of the songs are great, but this CD is one of them, and it has some of the hardest bass in all of my CD collection, which is about 150. The best tracks are \\"Devil's Pie\\", \\"Left & Right\\",\\"Chicken Grease\\", \\"The Root\\",\\"Untitled(How Does it Feel)\\". Also, \\"Afrika\\" is a beautiful song. \\"Devil's Pie\\" has the best lyrics. Don't hesitate to buy this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"VOODOO IS TRUE","review":"One of the truest and authentic singers of this century, D'Angelo's sophmore album out does his freshman effort.This is one of the greatest album's of the year.

PEACE! SEAN"},{"rating":"2","title":"Voodoo is right...after a few listens u will be hooked!","review":"This new cd from D'angelo is tight. It's one of thsoe cds you can just let it play without skiping from track to track because every song flows into the next. The title is a good title because he works voodoo on you with the smooth beats and lyrics on this cd. The songs have a deep message but you won't get it at first listen. If you read the lyrics in the booklet, you will probably be wondering if your listening to the same cd. Once you listen a few times, you really see how good it is. I have his first cd and I thought it was good. This one I thought was aiight at first,..but now I think it's better than the first. Best songs: 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9, 12 and 13. I know thats about the whole cd but it's that good. This is TRUE SOUL for the 'oo like no other and if you don't know about this already? , then you need to start by checking this out.Don't take my word for it alone. Listen and see that it's not just voodoo thats making people buy it.Tight!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally! True Soul Music!","review":"I applaud D'angelo for making music from his heart and soul.That's what true artist do.While we are inundated with pop-corn music this is what will stand the test of time. I am not saying this c.d. is perfect, but it beats the hell out of what they are calling soul music today! I love the spirit and rawness of this c.d. listening to track 8 and 9 gives me chills up my spine.Keep pushing the envelope D'angelo, and bringing back true artistry in music.You along with Mary J and Lauryn Hill give me hope.I would love to hear Joshua Redman on the next joint. Keep up the great work! and keep bringing the heart and soul back to R&B."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best R&B CD I own...","review":"Which is saying a lot, because my r&b (and music, in general) collection is expansive. There are times when I look to listen to Mariah, or Alanis, maybe Bjork, sometimes Portishead, but I find that I keep coming back to this album and appreciating it more with each listen. I believe in my heart that this will become one of my all-time favorite albums, as it seems unwilling to leave my CD player. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"An R&B Masterpiece!","review":"On Brown Sugar D'Angelo created a great record that was right for the time that it came out in. On Voodoo, D'Angelo does away with today's musical implications by expanding his artistry to a much higher level. D'Angelo draws from his musical influences and creates a groove all his own. With the help of musicians such as Amir Thompson, Charlie Hunter, and Roy Hargrove, D'Angelo transcends the musical standards that are set for today's R&B musicians. While this record may not be as well recieved because it doesn't stick to these standards, it must be applauded for the effort it shows in raising the expectations of all of the music we buy today. Each track rides on a continuous groove that demands several listenings. While the commercial success of the album may not be as great as that of Brown Sugar, it will be remembered long after its predecessor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb,sensational and soothing","review":"D'Angelo music, style and sophistication to express his talent is extraordianary.

And lets not talk about when he sings \\"Untitled (How does it feel)\\"......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have felt you","review":"I am critized for this statment, bout' D's flow in his last creation. It's like he knows he is the bomb and nobody can touch him so he just kinda did what ever. He tries to sound like Prince on a few tracks. Now maybe I'm not in tune with my sixth sense like I think I am. After one week strait of trying to feel Voodoo...I thought it was doo doo and sold it to a neighbor. Now try to get his first one out of me, you'll have better luck trying to get me to believe Tupac is alive. You can play his first piece at any given moment, you can even catch an elder head bopping to the funky tune. I understand an artist must grow to challenge the audience as well as self. If it wasn't for Devil's Pie he'd woulda gotz no luv from the devine1.

The sound is a little more stripped down more to the bone soul.. of the 13 tracks on this cd he blends.. jazz,bebop, soul, funk, hip hop, a little of Prince's eroticism in to one big pot.. that makes this effort a gem to listening to for hours.. Among the strong cuts which are plenty to choose from they are:The Line, Chicken Grease, The Root, Spanish Joint.. the incredible funked up remake of Roberta Flack's Feel like makin love, GREATDAYNMORNIN, UNTILED( How does it feel)..Dont miss out on this one it's hot !"},{"rating":"2","title":"D'Angelo's done it again...","review":"That's number two for D'Angelo... yet again he has produced another masterpiece, living up to the hype it attained prior to release. For five years, the music community waited to hear more from D'Angelo... \\"Voodoo\\" was well worth the wait.However, be forewarned - if you think \\"Voodoo\\" will be just like \\"Brown Sugar\\", you will be sorely disappointed. Although, it is not surprising that D'Angelo mixed it up for his sophomore album.Be sure to check out \\"One Mo 'Gin\\"... a beautiful track that showcases D'Angelo's gorgeous voice. Also, the famous \\"Untitled (How Does It Feel)\\" - this is truly beautiful, you can almost feel the emotion poring out of his vocals on this track. Another track not to be missed is \\"Devil's Pie\\" - not only does the beat have a definite groove, the lyrics are awesome too.

Not a single \\"song\\" on the whole mess. Cluttered, confused-maybe. Soul? I don't think so.

It was full of unmatched songs and dribble. His first album showed promise that he'd become the Al Green of the generation but with the lack of publicity he's received since his debut album, it's apparent that D'Angelo's time has passed. He is very talented and his voice is still soothing on his second LP but the songs were boring and mindless. I bought this album the year it came out and I still haven't finished it and I've made up my mind not to.

There are slow, contemplative songs such as \\"Devil's Pie\\" and there are songs with up tempo beats such as \\"Spanish Joint\\".

Foolishly, I bought 4 boxes thinking they would be fine. First of all, they are wrapped in plastic, which is very, very difficult to get off. You actually have to use a scissors to try to remove the plastic, then it cuts into the tampon. Once you accomplish getting them out of the brutal wrapper, inserting them is worse. They are so uncomfortably dry, I tried dipping them in oil, just to try to get it inserted. It is very uncomfortable. Also, they tend to not go in well and leak. To make a long story short, they suck. I wish I had only purchased one box. I rarely write reviews, but I wanted to help someone else not make the same mistake.

No way!","review":"I was unable to get the reflector panels to snap into place no matter how many times I tried. Infuriating! Ended up cracking one corner which really upset me. Tried taping them, tying them together; nothing worked. My daughter was so disappointed. If anyone can tell me how to make this thing work, please post it! I also emailed the company asking for help and have gotten no response. Really think I wasted my money this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"I bought \\"2\\" of these, as we had a very long flight to Japan ahead of us and I needed something to occupy my 5 and 6 year olds. What a huge mistake! We got very frustrated trying to assemble them and even more frustrated trying to trace the images. If I could of opened the plane door, I would of thrown them out at 30,000 feet! What's really annoying is that I can't even return them as I bought them in L.A. and we live in Japan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in Maryland","review":"My daughter saw this advertised on television quite sometime ago, and asked for it several times. We finally decided to buy it online, received it today (after much anticipation!), and she is completely disappointed. To begin with, the reflection plates don't actually snap in, as the directions say they do. Next, the reflection, while visible, is very difficult to trace. In fact, I had trouble, too! Last, after trying many different images (and thinking that the next one would be easier!), my daughter tried tracing an animated cartoon. I decided to line it up for her, thinking that would help get her started, and it was impossible to do! She is ten, and is quite artistic. This toy, however, has been nothing but a letdown! She feels taken advantage by the television advertisement, and doesn't want to try it again!

I should have read some kind of reviews on this before letting someone pick it up for her. I couldn't get the plates to stay in right. My daughter had a very hard time tracing the images. When I tried to show her how to use it I couldn't do it either!!! We're taking it back tonight and getting her something else that she can play with without the frustration. My daughter is very angry that they \\"tricked\\" her into thinking it was easy. I wouldn't give this toy any stars if it was an option. The only thing good about it is it won't take up much space in the trash when you break the plates trying to assemble the thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product is awful","review":"I bought this product for my 11 year old daughter who has great artistic talent. I thought this would be a way to encourage her growth. After about a month of constantly asking her about the product, she finally showed me how difficult it was to use and how the floating image ended up being a hinderance. This was a complete waste of money and I advice anyone who wants to trace an image to just do it the old fashioned way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Duped by t.v. magic.....","review":"Impossible....the people who wrote good reviews for this product must be trying to sell it.

Trash...trash...trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!","review":"My 9 year old son has been wanting this for a long time now. I finally get it for him. Its really hard to get the panels in. After putting the panels in we can't see the image on the blank piece of paper. We tried by light and nothing. He was very dissapointed and said he hated it. I think they should take it off the market until they can make it useable!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"I agree with the previous reviews! It is very hard to do even though the commercial makes it seem easy. I got this for my 8 year old son, who loves to draw, and he was very disappointed.

The look of excitement and happiness on his face as he unwrapped this toy was short-lived.It was nearly impossible to assemble.

The only useable item from this entire toy were the colored pencils."},{"rating":"1","title":"small bottles with poor packaging","review":"The item arrived seemingly intact, but one of the fragrance bottles was completely dry (not a hint of any perfume being there), which means that either there are quality control problems with their manufacturing and the fragrance was not even put in the bottle, or the packaging is faulty (and it does look flimsy at best).

Jamling Norgay weaves a fabric of threads entwining a people's relationship with Nature, with their gods, and with outsiders who can only see the victory of conquering a mountain to satisfy their own egos. This book is not just for the mountain climbing set. Norgay's thoughts here are for anyone willing to look deeper into our relationship with the Earth, political regimes, and our fathers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Touching My Father's Soul","review":"I found this book hard to read because I am a Christian and the continual reference to Buddhist pratices was sometimes hard to read. Not only because it goes against everything I believe in but because some of their beliefs are a little silly to me. I do respect that they have a great deal of faith and spirituality but it was still very difficult to read. I almost felt like I was reading a book on witchcraft. Also, he was very judgemental towards America and our \\"lack\\" of spirituality."},{"rating":"1","title":"More offensive than informative","review":"While the information and comparisons to his father's climb were insightful and interesting, I was put off by the author's comments on Americans and the spirituality of America. This book was more about Buddism and its practice than a climbing adventure. The descriptions of Buddhist customs are informative, but this reader did not appreciate the tone which came across in these sections. As both a Jew and an American, I felt like I was being disrespected when I read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recipes a bit too long for me but was good","review":"I love this guy and used to watch his show.

It fits the player really tight...TOO TIGHT. It presses in all the buttons on the side together and it makes the player either constantly turn on and off or makes the player unresponsive to all button presses because all the buttons are pressed at once! You also cant cut out the part of the case that fits over the buttons because it holds the case together! What a piece of s*** this is.

Been using this for 5 months now. What I like about this is how you have two choices of how you want wear this. You can wear it as an armband or you can take the case off the armband and wear it on your belt. I liked armband a lot until I realized the one shortcoming of it. Belkin put two plastic loops on it for those who have small arms and those who have big arms, so you can choose how you need to adjust it. But if you have medium sized arms the fit leaves a lot to be desired. My arm around my bicep is 15\\" flexed, 13\\" not flexed. I couldn't really find a fit I liked, which is why I just started using the belt clip part. The only other issue is pressing the buttons on the side. You can't do it blind like you can when your YP-T9 is out of the case. Oh, and the case is pretty darn good in terms of protection and it has a screen protector."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed...","review":"I bought this product hoping it would be an excellent addition to my purchase of the Samsung T-9. Boy was I wrong. Let me begin by saying the neoprene armband uses way too much material. I use my T-9 while I am working out, so I need to be able to work out while I am wearing my player. The armband is so bulky I find it very difficult to do this. I have tried positioning it up high or down low on my arm to no avail. I purchased a similar product from Sansa. Their armband uses a cheaper and less bulky set-up but it is less obtrusive and allows you to workout w/the player in any position on your arm. So no, I would not recommmend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unadjustable POS","review":"Looked to be a decent case with good reviews so I bought it.

It worked alright (still SOME static) for 6 months. Then, everything started getting really quiet, so I had to turn the volume to the max both on my iPhone and stereo to hear anything. I'm guessing the internal amp went out. I'm not gonna buy another one of these, so now I gotta figure out how to get audio again!!If it hadn't failed, I'd probably give it 3-4 stars. It's a decent way to get external audio into your OEM stereo, but since I could still hear static, I wasn't very impressed. Nice stereos are fairly cheap, so I think that's a better route to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Couldn't make it work at all. I even set up a test on the bench to no avail.

The instructions say you need an attenuator if you want to plug it into the headphone jack however it sounds fine with a 3.5mm to RCA adapter (not included). Otherwise it includes all the wires you need to attach it to several different setups. This one does include an isolation transformer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as described","review":"There were a number of questions asked about which make/model of car this would be used in so that the \\"proper\\" style would be delivered.

I love so much music, but if I was asked what CD do I find most pleasing from beginning to end in my collection, this would be it. Resigned is really a near-perfect pop CD, a little something for every mood. Favorites include two of the slower tunes, \\"Out of my hands\\" and \\"I can tell\\", which closes the disk in such dramatic style. Also special is \\"Selfish\\", in which Penn comes up with one of my favorite musical lines, the self-depricating: \\"You might find a prince of men/ but 'til that time my name is Penn/ and I am selfish...\\" If you are a lover of pop music, especially pop music that is guitar driven with intelligent lyrics, this is a can't miss. Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my top ten favorites","review":"a must have. this is, in my humble opinion, michael's best album to date. the songwriting, lyrically and musically, is top notch (amazing background harmony vocals, too), not to mention a superb mixing job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff, but...","review":"All the songs on _Resigned_ are beautiful, especially \\"Figment\\", which i always have a hard time getting out of my mind.

Heres hoping Michael Penn continues to produce for years to come!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An exquisite collection","review":"This collection of David Bowie's instrumental pieces makes a lot more sense than most such compilations. It's good to have them all on one CD, and the tracks go so well together that you could almost imagine it is a 'proper' album in its own right.While the opening tracks \\"A New Career in a New Town\\" and \\"V-2 Schneider\\" are relatively up-tempo, some could be called 'ambient', while others are beyond classification. However you describe them, thay are by turns beautiful, exhilarating, meditative, or even, occasionally, slightly disturbing.\\"All Saints\\" is a great chance to own, in one handy package, a body of work by Bowie (not forgetting his collaborations here with Brian Eno) that has been immensly influential and also helped to expand the boundaries of popular music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good compilation","review":"Until Buddha of Suburbia (am I mispelling that?) is re-released, this is the one place to find some of the tracks from said album. Other highlights include the Scary Monsters outtake, Crystal Japan, and the early Bowie-Eno composition, Abdulmajid (mixed much later).Those tracks alone justify purchasing a comp. that otherwise includes songs available on albums you probably already have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of the endless repackaging of David Bowie material","review":"I like these pieces in context of the original releases, but end on end they become a bit annoying. Since Bowie sold the future royalties to all his music, you can expect endless repackaging as those bonds have to produce returns. I would stick to the classic masterpieces that these instrumentals are culled from, Low, Heroes and Lodger. Those albums are pure genius.

I listen to it just whenever I'm not in the mood for rock or classical music. All the songs are excellent first rate techno, irresistable beats and addicting rythms. The best cut off the album would have to be the first song, I love how it slowly builds up at the beginning and then its all a mix of beats, synthesizer and some nice feminine cooing. All in all, if you want some good beats but despise rap and its retarded bullcrap then this is a great cd for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"So, these guys scored a hot hit with this album.....","review":"Now, this was the first real \\"techno\\" experience I had, having to listen to \\"Smack My Bitch Up\\" a number of times. Whatever it was about this album, their most recent, that became an instant hit in America as well as in Britain, Prodigy fans love them. It probably didn't get any Grammy award nominations in 1998.

I -kind- of liked it... at least some of the songs (Girls, Get Up Get Off, Medusa's Path). I thought reviewers were a bit too harsh with AONO when comparing with Fat of The Land... until I bought it. I can't say that FOTL is a masterpiece--I doubt that it is. But the compositions in FOTL are way better imho. With AONO, I found myself trying to like it. I didn't need that with FOTL (though some songs can be mediocre, esp. Diesel Power). Maybe AONO tries too hard to be electronic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathe.","review":"Just listen to the sound samples. This should be enough to tell you that this is a great album. All those genre bashers saying their music is this or that, well it doesn't matter when the music speaks for itself. This is a classic recording that people will be listening to for years to come. In the future when our kids ask us what we used to listen to, The Prodigy will come up and Fat of The Land is what they'll find in our cd collections. This is a must have for any rock collector."},{"rating":"1","title":"they can do better","review":"Compared to the Prodigy's first 2 albums, especially \\"Music for the Gilted Genration,\\" this album is mediocre. Tracks 5 and 10 are not good at all. The rest is alright but it is not something you will want to listen to again and again. Even tracks like Firestarter and Smack... are nothing compared to songs like Voodoo people, Hyperspeed, Poison, etc. from their previous albums. on the plus side, even this mediocre album does show that they have a lot of potential, so I am eagerly awaiting their next CD. Instead of buying this Cd, get Risotto by Fluke or Journey to the Infinite by Juno Reactor. Those albums represent what all techno should be like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the wait","review":"Well, with this release, it's become apparent that Liam and co certainly aren't geniuses, instead they've just been fortunate to tap into something at the correct time - ie big-beat-techno-rock. There are so many better electonica albums than this effort, it's kind of sad The Prodge get so much attention. From an excellent start, the album falls away into a rapid succession of ho-hum tracks. Firestarter is brilliant primarily because of the Cockney-vocal - the music itself is quite lame - check out the Empirion remix on the single for a 300% overhaul!! And what the hell was that last track? Ah well, The Prodge certainly deserve acclaim for pushing boundaries, and this album certainly has a distinctive sound quite like nothing before it - it's a worry though that the band at the forefront of crossover-techno-pop-rock have turned out to be Metallica-wannabes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy follow up to Music for the Jilted Generation.","review":"A solid selection of above mediocre songs worth buying if only to (like me) peak your interest enough to try Music for the Jilted Generation, certainly their height artistically.

All you old Prodigy-fans, who think that Liam should still make rave music, don't bother buying this one. Rave is dead and it's never coming back the way it was. All the songs on FOTL are absolutely fabulous. It's a mix of rock, punk, hip-hop, dance and techno. FOTL definetly kicks some serious butt. If you like Prodigy's new stuff buy this now!

Whenever I put it in my CD changer with any other artist, once it gets around to this alblum, you can tell its something very different. The Prodigy totally takes you to another world, smashes your brains out and you have a great time, and then you slowly awaken with \\"Climbatize\\" and get sort of a push back to the real world with \\"Fuel my Fire\\".

We saw Prodigy. That was the loudest, heaviest, head banging music I have ever heard. My ears were ringing for daze! I loved it! I just recently bought the cd because I have not been getting enough techno in my diet. I bought several cd's and Fat of the Land is by far the deepest bass that will rock your neighborhood.

Well, it hasn't even been two years, and the prediction is coming true. This isn't music, it's product, and everyone involved, from the artist to the fans, should be well ashamed of themselves.

Before I heard the songs on here, I thought you couldn't appreciate electronica without glowsticks and ecstasy.

In the \\"Music for the Jilted Generation\\" album, you can listen to more details, the music is more *music* than in this album. And that last music... *shakes his head* So I don't like the album.

I bought it again.It is my favorite Prodigy album, maybe because i'm into rock music.The fat of the land ...is an album that can't be placed in one genre.

Then thumbing to the back I noticed a couple pages at the end of the book selling devil worship. These books are authored by the person that gives the forward to The Mastery of Life.At that point I realized that this book was not for me and I gave it away. I can't base my life and decisions on where the moon is or what day of the week it is. It might work for some, especially since Satan has been given certian powers, but I refuse to go to him for security in my life. I know that he will always let you down in the end, and there is only One that can defeat all enemies for you in the long run.This is my personal decision and feel that others that make a different decision in their life have the right to do so, and I don't degrade them in any way.

There is a program (for free) RF-popHR made in 1998 that calculate these claimed kabalistic hours and you do not need the book for anything (I remark, for anything). The only thing you have to do is to adjust the hour playing with Time Zones in using a good ephemeris as Suncycle program (also shareware)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Applying the Tree of Life","review":"I always was interested in the Qabalah and the Tree of Life and studied it off and on for a long time. But I never was able to use it for anything practical much less for my own life matters. This book showed me just how really practical the Tree is and how it can be used with profit. I enjoyed it and use it in many matters each week although I sure don't live by it as gospel. Still, I now have something useful and I understand the Tree a lot better and appreciate it more. One thing. I just found out from a web search the author has a website (8th matrix press) that has a calculator that will do all the hum drum math for you in seconds.

I synchronised my watch to the exact time so that there could be no mistake. I chose an hour and a day that were supposedly extremely favourable to the outcome I wanted. Guess what!? It didn't work. For all the hyperbole and example after useless padded out example that this book provides, the system is little better than basically relying on chance. The author has no website and has no contact details so one cannot even question him about the things he states in the book. So, in a nutshell, the 'system' DOES NOT WORK and the book is extremely incorrent with lots of verbiage and repetition.

That's my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Life Tool","review":"The book \\"Kabbalistic Cycles and the Mastery of Life\\" is one of the most useful works you will ever read. In its pages Dr. Lisiewski lays out a system of cycles that allow the hard-working, sincere aspirant to take complete control over their own life. While the cycles were discovered by Dr. Lisiewski, the underlying principles are based on traditional kabbalah, and combined with the tarot attributions easily lend themselves to any situation one could possibly encounter. While the information in the book is laid out in a way that allows the reader to begin using the cycles immediately, the reader will be able to use the cycles much more effectively if they thoroughly test the system and study the recommended resources. Overall this work is highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Throwing all my Lisiewski books in the trash","review":"I own 2 other books by this author, both of which I feel had some value, if the bombastic, hypocritical attitude he takes towards his New Age bogeyman does wear thin fast.Nonetheless, after the utterly shameless promotional attempts made here by all of the fake \\"reviewers\\", not only will I be getting rid of the 2 of his books I already own, but I'll be looking over again with a critical eye my entire NF collection.Sure, some of the positive reviews seem legit, but when so many are posted by people who have reviewed no other books, and when any critical comment gets \\"dugg\\" down, something just smells fishy.Ironically it's exactly the kind of trick you would expect from the New Age shucksters Lisiewski so clearly wants to distinguish himself from.Caveat emptor."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Magician of the Middle Path","review":"It would seem there are more possibilities for using this book in one's own magickal work besides using it in daily life. An example is will I achieve more desirable results for a certain ritual if I start it during a moon day mercury hour or a Saturn day Saturn hour? The author is writing for all types of individuals and is trying to appeal to a broad audience: lay people as well as magickal individuals. I have incorporated his ideas to my own stylized ritualistic work, and found an enormous difference in the results received. The positive change in the achieved results occurred rather quickly. And all good! There is much here for everyone to benefit from.

While the new guidebook does include the Meadow river climbing areas (incredible climbing there), it's hardly an improvement over the contents of the old version. Very brief descriptions, inexact topos, but worst of all mistakes from the last version are still present in this book. On a trip to Fern Buttress my friend and I found inaccurate bolt counts as well as incorrect grades for more than one route.

I wish amazon could ship these \\"flammable\\" products a bit faster but whatever... That does not affect my rating of this.I find this cologne to be good but definitely not a 5 star. I have many other sweet colognes like 1 million, euphoria intense, and play intense to just name a few, so I am a big fan of sweet fragrances. To me, I honestly get reminded of the smell of play-doh but a bit sweeter. Imagine a very light play-doh smell and add a smooth sweetness. Now this cologne doesn't smell cheap like play-doh though. It seems very smooth and light. It definitely won't cloy your nose. Compared to the fragrances I mentioned above, this is much lighter. This may be good because those previous fragrances are pretty strong. Try it on and see what you think. It's pretty inexpensive for th 1.7 ounce. I will definitely keep it and use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite","review":"Rochas Man is my favorite men's fragrance. If you like gourmands, which I guess is what they call the \\"food fragrances,\\" you'll love this. It's sweet without being cloying, with enough coffee to darken the effect and make it clearly masculine. Hands down, this fragrance wins for eliciting compliments. At some point each evening when I wear this, someone frequently winds up with their nose in my neck - a sign of an effective fragrance if ever there was one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Cologne, Poor Shipping","review":"Rochas Man is amazing cologne: Sweet, sexy + unique. I've bought it many times + received tons of compliments from random strangers. But, my big issues with this seller is that I ordered my cologne 19 days ago + I've STILL not received it yet + according to Amazon's delivery estimate, it should have arrived almost 10 days ago.

It reminds me of the Britney Spears \\"Fantasy\\" perfume. Rochas man would be comparable to cotton candy. It's a bit OVERWHELMING at first, and the scent does change a bit, according to your pH balance. It smells different on different people after a while. I don't think this belongs in the men's section, and that's because I like sweet colognes, but not THIS sweet.

This book show the interest in amusement parks and rides that has been growing ever since the 90's. There is a nice balance between the history of the parks and current conditions. In one book the reader learns a wealth of material about past and now defunct parks (where is the mention of the park that used to be in Mt. Gretna - carousel and all??) as well as information on parks that are up and running. Good summary of each park as well as current information on admission, directions, etc. I was disappointed that there was little emphasis on memorabilia or good trivia. The old photos/postcards really help. That would really help this work out. What about all those great tokens. Even Leap the Dips put our a coaster token to push the coaster. The book is a good read and recommended for the enthusiast."},{"rating":"1","title":"First Kiss","review":"Being photographed in what appears to be but is not a compromising position with a married man makes Kiki Sonntag a pariah. Within a day's time, she's dropped from her publicist's list of clients and so harrassed that she is forced to check into a hotel called the Affair under an assumed name, Jennifer Anniston. Immediately, she runs into the hotel's owner, Fab Tomba, a playboy who pushes all her buttons. Sparring sessions turn into something more, but things like cell phones, kid sisters, and life in general continually get between them and passion. When not trying to figure out how to get together with Fab, Kiki worries about how to get her life back on track and rescue her friends from themselves.* The book as well as its heroine are shallow and, at times, a bit crass. While it may get points for clever product placement and a potentially good idea for the plot, it comes off as completely tawdry. *Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"If you started \\"The Bridesmaid Chronicles\\" with the Karen Kendall books and expect this one to stay true to the quality and spirit--not to mention the PLOT--of them, you're in for a disappointment. This book has almost nothing to do with the actual series. It's barely even a romance; more \\"chick-lit\\" than anything. As most of the other reviewers have noted, Kiki, the main character, is unbelievably shallow and she doesn't ever improve. It's like spending a few hours in Paris Hilton's head. As for the hero, you never get any real sense of him at all. Basically, he comes across as a guy with a stupid name--Fab Tomba--who's only appeal, other than being \\"hot\\" is he listens to Kiki blather on about incredibly inane stuff and somehow manages to be charmed by her.This is the first book I've read by this author and I won't be seeking her out for a follow up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't belong with the series","review":"I really did not like this book, although I enjoyed the others in the series.

But this book just doesn't fit, and Kiki is anything but a heroine. I couldn't identify with her at all, and in fact was constantly waiting for the moment when somebody would teach her a real lesson about her interferring ways. But no one ever does, even \\"Fab\\" (whose name bothered me immensly) ends up chuckling and going \\"Oh, Kiki...\\" instead of telling her to stick her nose elsewhere.The other books in this series are fantastic, and you don't need to read this one completly to understand those, so I suggest reading a plot summary and skipping it. Unless you want to laugh at an unsympathetic character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a lot of substance","review":"I loved \\"First Date,\\" the first book in this Bridesmaid series, but \\"First Kiss\\" wasn't what I thought it should be. Kiki, the main character, is an annoying, shallow snot, who may be involved in some funny situations, but I can't stand her. I'm on page 214 right now. I don't even know why I'm still reading it.

I enjoyed it then and I enjoyed it now.This is the story of life in Malta during WW2, as seen by a somewhat disinterested spectator. You see the highs and lows of the siege. The central character of the story is himself a story-teller - who tells the stories of Malta's previous great battles to cheer up the locals. From an historical perspective - both sets of stories are accurate and make engrossing reading.I'm finding real pleasure in re-reading books I read so many years ago - and I enjoyed this one more on the second time round.

From what has been written over the years about this man, Frank Sinatra was a very private person and I'm sure that he wouldn't be very happy with this book.

VERY impressed. A big fan of biographies in general, however I've certainly plowed through my share of mind-numbing tributes with clear issues of partiality. Was a bit wary with Tina (daughter) doing the narrative, however was favorably impressed. She's clearly a \\"daddy's girl\\", yet at the same time gave a brutally honest depiction of her father and his relationships.

Knowing my dad is a big Sinatra fan, I thought he would enjoy a copy for Father's Day. He really enjoyed it. Here is a touching but warts and all memoir of a father who wasn't always around, at least in person, by a loving daughter. Quite a bit of 'insider' information on Frank Sinatra and some great pictures that I hadn't seen before. Very interesting to note that in Tina's opinion, the love of Frank's life was not Ava, but Tina's mother. I also wasn't aware of how controlling Barbara Sinatra was in the last years of Frank's life - what a shame.

By not visiting their dad and by not trying to get a legal hold on his condition and the pills he was being fed by the wicked step-mother. At times it seems to me that instead of being angry with your dad and not going to see him when clearly he was not thinking right was the wrong thing to do. Frank Sinatra needed his kids more and more to keep a eye on him. Not to get angry and leave him in the claws of this greedy B!! The more I read this book the more I become totally disgusted with Tina Sinatras attitude toward her father. If this were my dad I would have been in his life whether the witch liked it or not.. Sinatra was obviously getting Illmentally, you can't hold an elderly person responsible for their actions when they are mentally deteriorating."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Father's Daughter","review":"An interesting book.

The account covers his early years, family, education, military service, and his notable scientific career. The account of his education was interesting, especially his time at Oxford, England. Hubble's brief military career was covered, and his use of the image of \\"Major Hubble\\" afterwards tells much of his character. His scientific career, his work and professional controversies were covered in detail. If I were to be critical, I feel Hubble's early life received too much attention, I would prefer to have seen his scientic career covered in more detail.

The first thing I noticed when I opened it was, \\"Made under license in the USA\\" on the label. The second was a distinct lack of heady, fresh aroma from either bottle. It smelled more like scented rubbing alcohol. Royall Lyme was, without doubt, the finest men's fragrance in the world. Not anymore. Who's at the helm of the company now? An accountant? Whoever it is, they should be sacked, the foreign license agreements cancelled and the original formula, MADE IN BERMUDA, reinstated."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"Royall Lyme was one of the very 1st cologne/aftershave products I ever used. The deep and rounded lime scent started strong and lingered gently but distinctively. My dad introduced me to this product; so it has many important associations. What a disappointment to find that today's version is a poor imitation of the original. Initially the scent is only vaguely citrus and quickly fades into an unidentifiable chemical trace.

These two bottles looked the same as usual in the packaging, but once removed, the bottles were not a deep green, the pungent lime smell was nonexistent, and the product seems like slightly colored alcohol, nothing more.

Of course they dont and one friend ends up as a midnite snack. From thereon in it starts to degenerate into the poor kid who mutates into an animal that one can only describe as being part gray squirrel part wolf with a bobblehead that keeps, ehh, bobbing up and down and sideways as he walks and snaps.Ladies and Gentleman, behold the WEIRDWOLF.Not funny, not scary, not a werewolf movie by any means."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hello... are you EVER going to ship this item to me???","review":"I never received this DVD from the seller, despite emailing and requesting the courtesy of a response...I have not received either a response or the movie.

This is a disapointing transfer and showed up very grainy on my 1080p tv- especially the moors sections which looked worse than my DVD version!??

The acting is great and the screen shots are very well done to give the movie more thrill. The blood and scary music really keep you focused throughout the whole film.

From the missed dart in the Slaughtered Lamb to the mauling on the moors; from the spooky double dream sequence to the atmospheric London scenes, there is never a dull moment. The soundtrack is just right (Van Morrison, Creedance Clearwater Revival et al) while the special effects - particularly the amazing metamorphosis - are genre-defining.

I especially enjoyed the pair of cops from Scottland Yard: the seasoned veteran with no patience for things he doesn't understand, and hios bumbling side-kick.There's also a variety of \\"real\\" characters. Most are total unknowns, and all the Brits are definitly natives. I didn't hear a single immitation accent, or imposter posing as a local.Released at the same time as \\"Cat People\\", \\"Prophesy\\", and \\"Wolfen\\", this movie has outlived all of them.

American Werewolf in London is the worst werewolf movie i have seen if you want to see a proper good werewolf movie you should see the Howling not this. Also they say the movie is funny its not i only got a laugh out of it because of the thought the main female character had had sex with a werewolf besides that its boring. Seriously i love werewolf movies don't get me wrong but the werewolf in this film more looks like an over inflated hairy balloon with legs and a dog mask, it's nearly as bad as the bald, over sized annerixic hampster of a werewolf from Harry Potter 3.

The only other werewolf pic I really liked was Silver Bullet, and American Werewolf just kicked that one aside. I love this movie. I loved the bitter sweetness of it. I loved the characters.

Mazzini has some dead-on insights about modern urban life and how it distorts our capacity to understand each other.

So first you install Steam, then you let it update itself. THEN you can type in your serial number and download the game, for which you have to be online of course -- my connection is poor, so this took about 4 hours. THEN you can finally play the game. Except that Steam crashed, then wouldn't start, then wouldn't run without an active Internet connection (as it's supposed to).

For some reason, the record companies currently (in the 2000's) seem to think Death Metal is rock and the more unintelligible the singer, the more pressings and advertising they get. I love a beautiful singing voice and Free Dominguez has one. They could use a better \\"voice\\" on a lead guitar, but the \\"grunge\\" sound is fine with me. Whatever sub-genre you want to put this in, it is still the original Hard Rock that started in the 1960's and is very well executed. I have shared this album and it is liked by all who like Rock. The sound of the CD is clear. The last track needs editing, though; it is 11 minutes of silence followed by Free a cappella.

Although, I must say, I was sorta disappointed. I only liked the songs that I had already heard, such as: Zerospace, Before I'm Dead, Glittergirl, Serene Dream, Crazy, and maybe one or two others.

Waste of time and money.","review":"This \\"novel\\" is so ill researched and so full of cliches that I dumped it after the fift chapter. Expensive even at the $2.99 price. Sometimes you can find a gold nugget or even a diamond among the pebbles. Rest assured this is not one. If you have nothing to read go download an old classic from the many freebies available. This one is not...a) A Thriller. Boring on the contrary.b) Well written. It's repetitive, full of clichés, feeble plotted and utterly predictable.c) Researched. The depth of the author's knowledge about the subject reeks of being limited to watching some bollywood films.It doesn't deserve even one star but there's no option for zero. Fair warning!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"I truly enjoyed this book. It does exactly what it is supposed to; it discusses important writings of Mahatma Ghandhi.

Truly an inspiration that should be a required reading for every human being on this earth.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"I","review":"I would also have to say that the book is \\"lacking\\" because though the quotes are interesting and give you some insight about his thought process and a bit about his feelings, if you are unfamiliar with his teachings, or know little of him in general you will find it difficult to identify with and understand why he thinks and says the things he does. Thus, for the uninitiated it may seem a bit too dry."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very useful intro to Gandhi's thought","review":"This collection of brief selections of Gandhi's thought has proved to be an exceptionally useful and concise intro to his amazing insight.

Bugs and his pals audition for Granny with clips of their classic shows; the easter plot is just an excuse to revisit the same old cartoons. And as in most retrospectives, the older material is much better than the filler: in this case it's funnier, more vibrant, and has vastly superior voice acting and animation. Shamefully, the glorious classics are cut into the newer junk with such butchery their genius is nearly ruined, and my friend and I decided we'd prefer them in their original state."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Advertising!","review":"Why did I give this product one star?

This is a collection of snippets of a few Looney Tunes Cartoons....Easter Yeggs is not even one of them! This is a blatant example of false advertising, which should be illegal.

A crime, I know. I was bored one day when I noticed it lying on my bedside table. Upon picking it up I found I couldn't put it down. This is a Snow white type story since I was little and the babysitter made us watch Snow White until we screamed. I still can't watch the movie, 10 years later. But this book brought my interests back to life. With it's own twist to the story, and no dwarves in sight this story is wonderful. That isn't to say that something doesn't take the place of the beloved dwarves. This book has in-depth characters that you can really have fun getting to no, and the villain is one of the best in any book I've read.

A movie tie-in book is created when someone throws the script at an author and says \\"Turn that into a book so we can make some more cash.\\" Absolutely nothing new is added, no background, nothing...and it is true here. If you want background on how the story came about, go read the original book on which this movie and the original movie is based: Planet of the Apes by Pierre Boulle which can be found right here on Amazon. It was written in the 50s (or 60s), and is COMPLETELY different than Tim Burton's movie or this tie-in novel.

However, I was disappointed that this book is basically just Sutherland's Cranial Osteopathy and Upledger's CranioSacral Therapy repackaged. It's very disappointing that as Cranial work is getting more and more accepted, so many authors are simply reinventing the wheel and calling it their own. The initial work of Sutherland and the subsequent developments of Upledger have yet to be substantially changed or enhanced by any other authors in the cranial field that I have found. Until then, my recomendation is to stick with works by Sutherland and Upledger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Careless quality","review":"The book arrived water damaged.Craniosacral Biodynamics: The Breath of Life, Biodynamics, and Fundamental Skills"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"A beautifully written and revelatory exploration of Charles Warren Eaton's poetic world and those of his contemporaries.

It can easily mislead unwary buyers into thinking Kevin J.

It's not the comic, but I don't think that's a bad thing. The novel is well written and characters, like Quatermain, are closer to their literary selves than Moore's reworked versions. Fans of the original characters and the LXG movie will enjoy this the most. I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the movie's screenplay","review":"If you want to read Alan Moore's work, do not get this! The screenplay has a storyline that is very different than Moore's original graphic novel. Reasons to get this version1) You want to relive the movie2) You are a big fan of Dorian Gray (who is not in Moore's original)3) You like Siberia depicted in comic books.4) You are not interested in edgy mature graphic novels like Moore's.Personally, I found the storyline of Moore's original much more interesting and have no plans to want to relive the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pocket for Corduroy by Don Freeman","review":"At the laundromat, Corduroy gets out of the chair that Lisa had told him to stay in while she was helping her mom put her clothes in the washer. He looks around the laundromat for a pocket. He found towels and washcloths. Then he found a laundromat bag that had just come out of the washer. He got into the bag and as the artist was putting the clothes into the dryer, Corduroy tumbled out. He was all damp. The artist dried Corduroy's overalls and left him on top of a washer because he didn't know who he belonged to. That night, Corduroy stayed in the laundromat alone. He looked for a pocket again. He pours out a box of detergent chips that he thinks is snow and he thinks he is skiing but he is really sliding into a basket. He thinks that he's in a cage which he doesn't want to be in. He falls asleep...I would recommend this book to anyone who has read other books done by this author. If you liked his other books, you will love this one. I loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dread when my daughter asks me to read aloud","review":"I hate this book. I LOVE the original Courduroy but this sequel irritates the living daylights out of me. As far as I can tell the world which Courduroy inhabits is supposed to be *somewhat* realistic - and in the original book, it is. But in this one, the caricature of the artist (in a beret? REALLY?!) is just painfully clunky, as is the name of the Hispanic-owned laundromat (\\"Pandro's\\"). *sigh* Since I have read it approximately a billion times, little things become impossible to ignore, like the fact that Lisa's mom tells her the laundromat is \\"about to close\\" but the artist has time to run an entire dryer cycle before the manager says the place is closing. And if Courduroy is too precious to get lost, shouldn't it be LISA'S name on the little card in his pocket? It's all very sloppy and undermines any residual charm left over from the first book. I am SO disappointed and this book might \\"accidentally\\" fall into the fireplcace aaaaaany day now."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 3 year old loves this book","review":"I can't begin to count the number of times we have read this book since finally purchasing it for Christmas.

As he overhears Lisa's mom telling her to clean out the pockets in the clothes, Corduroy realizes his overalls don't have pockets and he thinks he'd better go remedy that situation right now. The rest of the book is a \\"bear's eye\\" view of the sights, smells, and sounds of an inner-city laundromat. What I love most about the Corduroy books and characters are that they show everyday life as I wish it could be--where strangers take a moment to do kindnesses for one another, and even a little innocent fellow who needs help can find it without having to ask. The original Corduroy book was a gift to my daughter. I bought this sequel for myself as much as I did for her. Parents and kids, curl up and enjoy this together!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved by My 2 Year Old","review":"My 2 1/2 year old adores this book. In fact, I have had to make a rule of no more than twice a day. He calls it the \\"laundry book\\". I must disagree about the caged bear scene being frightening. My son specifically requests the caged bear scene and is obviously not scared in the least. It is a sweet tale of a little girl and her little bear.

My son's vocabulary has grown exponentially!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what you'd think","review":"Yes, it's subtitled \\"a romance of the Dark Ages,\\" but everyone neglected to mention that its main theme is homosexual romance. From the reviews, I expected the history and historical figures of the time, not an unrelieved series of sexual invitations, genital explorations, and young boys offering themselves for such service. The first few chapters were enough to make me want a refund. Mr. Massie's style is well-suited to story-telling, and that's why I gave the book two stars, but if you want more story than sexual adventures, read Gillian Bradshaw.

The first few of these we bought I had plug in lan cards with large buffers, but this proved to be a waste of $, the built in is quite fast. The USB on this board is generic as far as I can tell, do not see any reason for this specific model to give problems.

In Mastering this game you will improve your overall Math and Strategy skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good family or game night game","review":"If you can get past the truly awful box graphics, this is a really fun game. I actually bought it for someone else for Christmas, but we played it as a group and it left me wanting to buy one for myself.Without going into too much depth about gameplay, which is covered quite nicely in other reviews, the basic premise of the game is that the players are competitive energy companies trying to create the largest power grid they can. To do this, they have to buy resources (priced competitively), constuct a grid, and bid on more efficient power plants to power their grid.I think kids as young as 10 or so could understand this game (and learn something from it). My daughter (13) played with us and developed her own strategy that evolved as she played again. It's competitive, which makes it both fun and a little aggravating. It can take awhile to play the first time, but after that, it goes quickly. Highly recommend if you enjoy board games."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster strategy","review":"I love board games and am a huge fan of the Eurogames that have made the rounds on the circuit. I don't know why this game has gotten the buzz that it has. Each round is designed to equalize the playing field so that regardless of strategy, each player is always on roughly the same level. Personally, I like a game where your strategy can pull you ahead of the others, or where you can mass a power play and trump the other players, but that is impossible in this game. Those who fall behind one round are brought up the next round so that even players who haven't been paying attention have a shot to win at the end. What's the point to a strategy game if you don't actually need a strategy to win?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Many better options","review":"We bought Powergrid on the recommendation of friends, but disliked it. It basically seems like you head in one direction as fast as you can, and if you get ahead, it helps you get even further ahead. No real trade-offs. Eventually gave it away.

It is a combination of Catan, Acquire, Risk and Monopoly. We Really enjoy this game. Takes a little time t get used to, but worth the investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent game, but very long","review":"This is a great game. It is fairly long and has a steep learning curve so it will likely take you at least three hours the first time. Don't be discouraged, it'll go faster once you get the hang of it. I recommend assigning jobs for players based on where they sit; one to restock the resources, one to reset the turn order and so on. This will go faster than trying to remember and do everything as a group. And the time to play will fly by, I highly recommended it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Ready For a Long Haul","review":"Powergrid is a game about optimization and in someways a spreadsheet could play the game for you. That being said it is fun, but you have to have the right group of players who are willing to devote 2+hrs of intense focus. The biggest hingepoint of this game is that each round turnorder changes and during each phase(sub steps in a turn) turn order could be normal or reversed, this can be way to daunting to new boardgame players . It takes a large amount of focus for this game to be fun. I would give each player a task that way the game doesn't get bogged down too much, have one person do turn order, another money management, another resupply resources. If you have gotten bored with Agricola and Settlers of Catan then this would be a great next step."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supply and demand","review":"This game is a great game. I played it with my students and they learned the basics of supply and demand."},{"rating":"2","title":"intimidating to new players","review":"This is a fun game. I knocked off a star because you have to play it all the way through once to completely get it (and by the time you make it through that first game, you don't have time to play it again right away, and then you have to remind yourself of the rules when you give it a second try a week later) and the rules change at various stages in the game, the rule booklet and the Game Phases Reference card seem to contradict on one point, and I am always afraid to teach it to people when it is their first time playing a board game with us (ease them into the nerdy board game world).I know that sounds like a lot of negative, but it really is a fantastic game...

I dropped it off with some friends who have played it many times, though I have been mostly unable to make it.Playing (and watching) gives a new appreciation for all of the times you have thought about buying something to keep for later. In this game, you learn to not only prepare for your current needs, but to keep prepared for future changes in the game. It is difficult, though a lot of fun. (And the game progresses towards a definitive end, which is very nice.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps the lights on!","review":"I have a pretty extensive game library.

I strongly suspect that Ludlum did not even write the outline for this book and the sorriest one, \\"The Paris Option\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Face-paced Shoot-em up","review":"The Cassandra Compact, by Robert Ludlum and Philip ShelbyJon Smith is sent to rescue Yuri Danko, who has called the secure line and asked to be extracted. Danko has a piece of terrifying news, but before he can tell Jon, he is cut down in a spray of gunfire by assassins. Smith deduces that someone is out to steal a sample of smallpox from the Russian cache of bioweapons and perhaps manipulate it to make it more virulent. This is a face-paced, exciting and scary book. Lots of action and shoot-em-up. Not exactly my thing, but I did enjoy it quite a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second part of the covert one series","review":"Almost as good as the firt one, the hades factor.Jon Smith is at his best again!great read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Implausible","review":"The author(s) present a predictable yet highly implausible work. They obviously failed to do their research, at least with respect to the space shuttle program, and I can only imagine what other nonsense this story is based upon. Since when does NASA have antigravity chambers?If you want to read Ludlum, read something from the Bourne series. This is a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun ride","review":"Covert-one operative Jon Smith is sent to Venice to help bring out Yuri Danko, who has sent a desperate message for help. Tragedy strikes. Yuri is killed and Smith barely escapes (thanks to a piano). Thus begins Jon Smiths desperate attempt to find out what Yuri knew that cost him his life.This is what I consider good escapist fiction. International locales with some space shuttle action thrown in, drives this somewhat complex thriller. The idea behind this biological thriller, is using an altered smallpox virus with no possible vaccine, in warfare. Sure it stretches reality but that's what escapist fiction is all about. The motivation behind some of the powerful figures in this plan are??? I'm not sure.Non-stop action and suspense.Recommended for thriller fans who want to escape."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree....","review":"with Francis McInerney....this book is not vintage Ludlum, but there hasn't been anything of quality come from his desk in quite some time.Ludlum was the best. I cannot understand why he wouldn't quit at the top of his game. Surely all the bestsellers he had afforded him a comfortable life. I would have much rather wished for more than to have read the drivel that came in the later years.If you're looking for good espionage and cracker jack writing, read any of the BOURNE series. For a bit of fun, read THE ROAD TO GONDOLFO. Don't read anything in the last 10 years. And, don't read this new one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story for a long drive.","review":"I have read many Ludlum books and will always beleive that nothing will come close to The Bourne Identity. However, I really enjoyed this book. The story was good, the characters were interesting enough so that I actually cared and the reading kept me interested throughout my long drive. However, one thing kept bugging me. The reader kept pronouncing NASA as Nasau. A minor annoyance, but I still recommend this for a road trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Robert Ludlum has spent years writing great thrillers, and now it seems he's decided to let others write a book, he'll say he co-authored it and cash in. Good for you, Robert, but maybe you should read the book BEFORE you agree to put your name on it.This was my first experience with the co-authored book. I've seen the Tom Clancy and Nelson DeMille co-authored series too, and I've always been a little wary. My suspicions have now been confirmed. This book was a quick read, predictable as anything, and could be grasped by your average 3rd grader. Philip Shelby kept the audience in complete suspense by waiting until the 4th chapter to identify the conspirators to us. About halfway through the book you knew what the evil plan was and you knew how it was going to end.My expectations for a Robert Ludlum book have been set way too high to try and pass this garbage off as his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read","review":"A page turner, suspenseful.Excellent plot.

Soup produced and marketed it themselves and I knew little about them except that they were from Appleton, WI and were a blues trio. Back then, I was 17 and they sounded great. Bluesy, rich with lived experience. Oh, how I wish I could say that this stood the test of time. Did I change so much or were they always this pathetic--and by that, I mean \\"filled with pathos,\\" emotions without connection. Oh, they are competent enough for a bar-based blues band, but despite the guitarist's life-challenges so richly detailed in these release notes, this CD more than most bears out Thomas Wolfe's warning that you can't go home again. Things are not what you thought they were."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carrie really slays'em","review":"There's nothing very sinister or scary about this movie but it's searing portrayals of human animals and what they're capable of doing is brilliant. this is really a character study with a scattering doses of fantasy. piper laurie, as the lunatic mother of carrie white, should definitely have won the Oscar for best supporting actress just as Sissy Spacek should have been the best actress winner. i shudder to think that now that carrie II has been released and received only fair criticism, the floodgates will open and we'll soon have to suffer through increasingly inferior rip-offs like carrie III, carrie IV and so on until its drained dry. the beautiful musical score by pino dognacio is worth buying and listening to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carrie is by far the best horror movie I have ever seen","review":"I read the other reviews and have to say a few things: 1. Sissy Spacek could NOT have been prettier, Carrie was supposed to be ugly -- she looked good in the end anyway. 2. The people at the prom didn't actually laugh at her.

I rarely buy movies and was greatly disappointed with this one. The bottom 10% of the screen was chopped off as if they were trying to fit it into some other format. It almost looks like they took the standard VHS format and chopped from the bottom and top to put it back into the widescreen. Extra clarity does not justify censoring parts of the original movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this movie!","review":"I really like this movie.

This is the first time viewing the film and do not know if it's like that in the original version or this is a screw up. I think it is because the gym teacher got really mad hahahaha.When the three guys are picking out tuxedo's, it quickly goes into Alvin and The Chipmunk mode for a brief few seconds.

Nancy Allen plays the mean, make that almost evil bulliette, Piper Laurie plays Carrie's religous fanatic mother and Amy Irving plays the girl that is trying to help Carrie out..secretly.The acting is lovely, the filming/cinematography is excellent and, well, let's just say the entire film is lovely and delicate. The prom scene is pretty violent and this has a lot of nudity at the introduction."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic !!","review":"Well, I just read that MGM is issuing a special editon of this DVD. I hope they improve the sound as the sound of the first DVD is lame. Its 1999 sequel (The Rage Carrie 2) has a super Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack. Anyway this DVD's picture quality is good. Bright and sharp. You won't notice this is a 1976 movie. You should know the story by now. About a nerdy high school student played by Sissy Spacek who has telekinetic power. And things turn deadly as the other students make fun on her during prom night. John Travolta, Nancy allen and Amy Irving Co star.

The book was perfect but the movie was REALLY bad..for a more accurate movie, watch the NBC TV remake of the movie..it's not accurate either (being in the 1990s/2000s and all) but it's closer than the original movie..In other words: READ THE BOOK!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"in was gross and dumb","review":"it was ok it was a little sickning and gross the book was better cause you couldn't see what was happening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I recently saw this movie, and boy was I bored.

For such a classic as Carrie which has been released in 1976 this movie is still timeless for watching. Carrie (Sissy Spacek) is a telekinetic girl and she moves things with her mind. She's an ugly girl as the movie wants to tell you. Everyone is making fun at her....UNTIL THE BLOOD'S FALLIN'.... \\"They are all going to laugh at you\\"..

The concluding prom scene is one of the great sequences in all horror films. An inspired choice for Halloween."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this the same story?","review":"I read the book, and I couldn't believe how great it was. When I saw the movie, cheesy horror scenes were added, the story was told differently, and it was hardly as moving as the book was. Obviously some cheesy horror scenes were added just to make the audience react. I guess the people who made this film didn't think the original story was as grabbing. If they stuck to the story, this movie would have rocked. I did think that Sissy Spacek did an excellent job and the cast chosen for the characters were matched perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRILLIANT!","review":"Sissy Spacek was absolutely BRILLIANT in this role.

Well, personally, I didn't find it all that scary and I'm only twelve. From the beginning scene in the shower room (they're so mean!)until the crowning of the prom King and Queen, you keep wondering (or at least i did) what is going to set Carrie off, because all of these people are really mean to her, including her mother, and she still doesn't do anything really bad with her power of telekinesis. The dumping of the pig's blood kind of creeped me out. I mean, that's just wrong. The only parts that I found creepy were Carrie's eyes during the evil part of the gym scene, and the part where all the knives fly into her mother. The very end would have made me jump a foot if I hadn't seen that part once before on T.V. The acting was amazing, particularly by Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie. This is a very good, suspenseful movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING","review":"I've recently seen the later TV film incarnation of Carrie.It doesn't compare to this 1976 theatrical adaptation.All actors in this film are outstanding.Including Betty Buckley as the girls Phys Ed coach Miss Collins.A perfect horror flick for it's time."},{"rating":"2","title":"STEPHEN KING PROVES AGAIN THAT HE IS KING OF HORROR!","review":"Based upon the novel, Carrie is about a young girl just now going into her period.

What a way to start a horror movie! I was never so confused and scared in my life! Watch for John Travolta at the end of his Vinnie Bobarino days. The girls are cute for the most part, but doesn't that girl ever take that cap off?? She even wears it to the prom? Of course the last scene is what everybody loves. At first I didn't like the 'split-screen' effect, because back in the day, you missed someting, but now with DVD and VHS, you can watch one side, rewind and watch the other. That mother's a nut. Watch for those 'dirty pillows'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly thrilling and moving horror film","review":"Other than Delores Claiborne, I still think Carrie is the best adaptation of a Steven King novel. The diary format of the book is shelved for straight narrative and it is beautifully told and brilliantly cast. Spacek and Laurie deservedly received Oscar nominations, Allen, Travolta. Irving and Soles are perfect for their parts. Very gorey and frightening at times, it's still heartbreaking and moving at others. This is one of DePalma's best achievements and even at its age, it's timeless. One of the best horror flix ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"carrie on bluray","review":"very disappointed with this blu ray dvd i have a dvd copy and it surpasses this bluray transfer i wasted 15.00 on this i was really looking forward to seeing the hd picture of this favorite film of mine seller wouldnt give me my money back either so im trying to get in touch with mgm to let them know this is a bad transfer of a great film. : ("},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything About John the Evangelist You Ever Wanted to Know","review":"Ashton has left no stone unturned.

Sure, you absorb a little horse knowledge out of it, but the learning isn't really important to the strategy - more important is landing on the right squares and the horse you start out with.

You can choose from four horse bust pawns, there is a Arabian, Thoroughbred, Freisan, and a Paint. Beautiful little things! They look so lifelike. The board is beautiful and well put toghether, a nice theng to look at. The only downside of this game was that it is just a little confusing, but if you have younger kids, they have simpler rules than the originals, and once you play a full game the rules make sense.

The recipes provided are easy to follow and the buttercream & cake come out fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"More room on the pedestal please!!!","review":"That pedestal is getting pretty crowded but I think that it'll have room for Ms. Garrett!! Having been thoroughly enchanted with the creative gems of her first book, \\"Creative Cookies\\", I waited (and waited and waited a verrrrry long time) with bated breath for this new book, and it was well worth it. She can be placed with the likes of Colette Peters, Dede Wilson, good ol' Martha, and Anna Von Marburg, just to name a few, as incredible women of creativity in cakes!! Lovely and sharp photography accompany her easygoing and clear teaching method of helping even the most novice of bakers to attempt these wonderful creations. The hints and tips that she gives are both insightful, yet simple, and you can truly feel that you are attempting something within your realm of ability, regardless of experience. Thank you Ms. Garrett!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Good price on this book and I'll keep it for the buttercream recipes. Ms. Garrett's work is technically amazing--she is an artist--but the designs are are too precious and fussy looking for my tastes. More 18th century than 21st."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very 1980s decorating designs :(","review":"I was very excited when I ordered this book due to the high reviews. I was very disappointed when it arrived. The cake decorting designs are very old fashioned...like maybe from the 1980s. Nothing that I would use to decorate my cakes. It does come with alot of recipes, which I used the lemon curd one. It tasted really good. All in all if I had to do it again I would not have ordered this cake decorating book."},{"rating":"1","title":"POS - didn't last a month","review":"This thing is extremely fragile.

Most often when I plug it into my phone, the phone lights up as though it knows it's plugged in, but it doesn't charge. I think the charger is not delivering the right amount of current to the phone, but must be for the headset.I bought two of these, so I know it wasn't just one that's a fluke. And I know it's not the phone, because every other USB-plug charger I use works like a champ. I guess for a penny I can't really complain. It's just frustrating because even the one from the AT&T; store was junk too, and that one cost $30!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good thing it wasn't too expensive.","review":"My husband lost his car charger so I ordered him this one. It takes FOREVER to charge his phone. I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it, I wish I had","review":"I found this book to be VERY frustrating for a beginner to the program.

Here is how to do ___."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is all over the place without bad focus","review":"Don't waste the money this book is all over the place. One would have to thumb constantly back and forth to find information, every example starts you from the beginning, material is extremely redundant. And to add insult to injury where it is redundant different verb-age is used making you question what you have read in previous chapters, thus making you go back and double check what you have already read. Book also wastes a lot of space in pictures instead of straight forward instruction, many pages are wasted only showing one step of example, space waster. Case in-point, go to index and look up Transition, creating, not there, author runs on about editors and doesn't focus on getting to work immediately. I can't believe someone has taken an Apple product, something that's meant to be easy and simple to use, and created such a confusing guide to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this book.","review":"Usually Peach Pit Press is good for the money, however, thisseries on FCP is NOT useful.

Persephone has always been sheltered from boys, the only exception being her girl crazy cousin Hermes. Her mother Demeter has a fierce hatred and a strong opinion concerning men and what they can do to a girl. Persephone leads a happy life, lazing aroung with her friends all day. On one such afternoon, Persephone is awoken from a nap by a horde of strange creatures who drag her down to the caves by the sea...the dwelling of Death himself! It is there that she is informed that Hades, (the supposed Lord of the Dead), has fallen in love with her and kidnapped her in hopes that she will consent to be his bride. Trapped underground and held against her will, Persephone has some hard decisions to make. Will she seize the first opportunity to get back home...or is she falling for the most unlikely person alive?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good starting point","review":"Good, if somewhat disjointed book that concentrates more on the thought processes behind going back to the land than on the mechanics of it. At times the use of third person narrative grates, but on the whole it is well worth overlooking these minor quibbles.This is a good starting point for beginning your own journey back to the land, in that you must get your head in the right place to be able to walk the walk, so to speak. The authors give plenty of resources for further investigation of particular topics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware Political Rantings","review":"I enjoyed parts of this book; however, there were several sections which I felt had nothing to do with the \\"back-to-the-land\\" premise. Do I really have to wade through the diatribes against George W Bush? I thought the book would have been more effective if it stuck to the initial ideas of self-sufficiency. Then it would have reached a larger audience. I could not read the whole thing due to these rabbit trails.I found the book _On Good Land_ by Michael Ableman to be much more helpful, or even _It's a Long Road to a Tomato_ by Keith Stewart. Back-to-the-land views are held by many across the political spectrum, as we are all called to be good stewards of this good earth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mysticism-lite","review":"This book takes one far afield from the brilliant potentiality in mysticism and off onto some twilight.

They were so easy, that we all just rolled our eyes, said the answer, and took the next turn. Because of this, you would think it would be a great game for children, but there were enough quotes that children wouldn't get that they wouldn't like it either. So the game is meant for no one in particular. It was so disappointing, we stopped after about 10 minutes and returned the game the next day. Also, the pack of cards is pretty small, so even if we had thoroughly enjoyed the game, we would have gone through all of the cards pretty quickly. After giving up on this game, we ended up playing Buzzwords instead, and it was exciting, fun, and challenging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Game!

There's five categories, including music, movies & tv, folklore and literature, if I remember correctly. A correct answer gives you a tile to put on your line. It takes 11 tiles to complete your line and win the game. On the game board there are spaces to make you lose a tile or give a tile to one of your opponents. You could also gain tiles if an opponent lands on that space.I've gone through the original edition and the expansion set of cards with my group, so this game is not played as often. I still have it though. It doesn't have any bells or whistles, but it's a nice game for family game night."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very fun & entertaining game for all ages!!","review":"My friends & I had a blast playing this game!

When the package arrived, the instructions inside the box stated that baking the mugs makes them \\"hand-washable,\\" but you better wash it quickly since they also state \\"Do not soak your mug.\\" The directions go on to state \\"Do not place your mug in the dishwasher or microwave as doing so may remove paint over time,\\" which is a complete contradiction of what was advertised online.The images of the product are also misleading, since each mug shown online has painting near the rim, and the instructions state \\"Do not paint 1/2\\" from rim of mug.\\"These were a big disappointment and I will be sending them back."},{"rating":"1","title":"George Foreman Suit Separate Pant Grey Stripe","review":"These pants are an excellent fit and look very nice.

This \\"Barbie\\" doll version of the our favourite detective is more focused on her appearance, boys, and partying than solving the case or helping others. Personally, I DO NOT want my children reading this novel and would prefer them to become familiar with the old Nancy...an inspirational and intelligent woman not the materialistic, immature, self-conscious clothes horse featured in this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"I picked up this book because I really really like the original Nancy Drew series and I was hoping for another good series. I was very disappointed in this book because the case was kind of lame and it seemed like they hired a romance writer to write it.

There are many negatives that I personally have: IT IS HEAVY, if you like or need large size and heft then this is for you. I chose this watch for the ease of reading, for it's water resistance (screw-down crown and all)and the expandable watch band. The biggest problem with the watch is the band: is is, to me, a really poor design that not only looks funny when extended but I question it's integrity. The size, both diameter and thickness attracts a lot of attention with some people saying the word \\"gaudy\\" and \\"huge\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Item!","review":"This Suunto Compass has exceeded my expectations! Whereas the Silva Ranger has been the mainstay of our (non-electronic) search and rescue navigation aids in the past, this compass has all of the same features, lower price, better glow in the dark face and easier to read dial, straight forward declination adjustment, ergonomic curvature below the sighting mirror to better visualize your destination and the magnifying lens on the base-plate is located where is becomes useful when looking at a map... Drawbacks? Cheesy lanyard clasp, UTM Markings do not take the place of a stand alone map interpolator (in other words, equally as useless as the ones on the more expensive ranger).Look ... its cheaper, just as functional and better looking than the next compass in its class!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate bearings in the field","review":"This compass replaced a baseplate-only compass. The Suunto MC-2DLIN's sighting mirror made accurate bearings much easier.I first used it in a wilderness navigation class, where it gave multiple bearings that got me very close to flagged objectives.Some may say they can navigate much better with a GPS. So what do you do when your GPS batteries die in the middle of the Bisti Wilderness? Either you better remember the landmarks you passed on the way in, or you pull out your compass to orient yourself with your paper map (you did bring a map, didn't you?).The only compass that's more accurate (to 1 degree) is a true optical-siting compass, like Brunton's 54LU that's no longer made. You can still get them from John Carnes' maptools.com website.For most of us, the Suunto MC-2DLIN's 2-degree accuracy is good enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tool","review":"What a great compass- it's been very tough and endured a beating in the field, with no breaks of the plastic or fading of the numbers.

Phil is well Phil and his heavy voice and style of delivery only adds to what already is just a great piece of music. Seriously, both the Down releases are simply amazing sounding efforts with boatloads of feel and passion.These cd's have a very heavy groove to them and are truly righteous listens.Do yourself a favor and get these A.S.A.P."},{"rating":"2","title":"See them live!","review":"I will start by saying that this album is much more toned down than \\"Nola\\" and I was a little disappointed at first. I could instantly hear classic rock coming out of my speakers, but then I saw them live. I don't know why they produced this the way they did, but hearing this album live it sounds just as hard as \\"Nola\\". I can only guess they were buzzed while they were producing it. It is still a damn good album, there is a lot of feeling and meaning to the tracks. While you won't probably be bang'n your head, you definitly will feel this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chill Metal","review":"Down is breathtaking. Phil's vocals are so smooth yet gruff at the same time. He is amazing. The guitars are downtuned and distorted. This is a good stoner album. Many of the songs are trippy (Check out Track 15) Just a solid album, unlike anything else. Picture Sabbath and Pantera and Zeppelin together. Can't Miss!! Killer recording"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Hell of an album","review":"Buy it! Simple as that. This album is very dynamic... melodic, rockin and punishing."},{"rating":"2","title":"HM where it should be today!","review":"This has to be the BEST heavy metal CD I have heard in years. I was wondering where HM was going, with all the rap-metal going on, along with the general attitude that metal will no longer sound like it did in the 80's (forgive me!), I was a bit lost.I 'tried' all the nu and rap metal bands, but they still kind of left me cold as far as the general 'feeling' I used to get from all that great mindless, party-oriented stuff from the 80's. OK, time to get with the program - so I have, and have found that DOWN is where it is at. The sum of their parts shine like the sun, as any of their individual parts have not been that hot over the past 5 years...(Pantera, COC, etc). As some reviews say, guys you got to quit the day jobs and do more DOWN!This is one awesome CD. I have not heard DOWN's first CD, but if this is a disappointment, well the first must be a classic. Either way, check this CD out - it will grow on you quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Down II -- Very Average","review":"*NOLA was one of the most amzing CD's I ever bought so I eagerly awaited the release of DOWN II. . .If I had to pick a personal Top 10 CD's of all time NOLA would be in it . . .It is with great sadness that I inform you that (at least to my tastes) DOWN II is a very average CD.About 1/3 of it is slow/accousticy stuff or experimental (like a song with only drums).One of these songs (My Mistake - I think its called) is pretty good. . .The other 2/3's of the CD is heavier, but I found it uninspiring with about 3 (from 10) of the heavier songs appealing to me.I must say we all have our own taste for music and you might really like this CD,but for me (after how good the first was) this is a real let DOWN==="},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I expected more as the singer is from one of the heaviest bands ever known.

You can tell these guys were just doing what they loved in it just happened to become an album. It just has that feel. Like everything just feel into place without having to work at it. Its a pure rock album.Down II is not like that. It seems like they tried hard to get that same groove, that southern rock feel. I really tried to like this album...and it has some decent guitar, lyrics, and beats. But in this case the whole is not the sum of its parts, it just doesn't come together. It feels about as real as a brittany spears album, and it pains me to say that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never buy a Rehab album","review":"The first warning about the quality of this CD was the disclaimer that they wrote and recorded this album in 60 days. A first glance this sounds impressive. However, after listening to it you say to yourself, yeah no kidding you did this in 60 days.It sounds like it.This album is nothing like NOLA, which would be fine, but Phil needs to either get off the H or back on it because the lyrics are hurting and the music is marginal at best.If you have loved NOLA and do not want to ruin your image of Down, Crowbar, COC, and Pantera DONT BUY THIS PIECE or if you do get it used because it isn't worth $18.00."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whay DOWN wit it bro!","review":"Bro, this is da bawmb album bro!

There is some filler and I think because the album has such a long running time that some extra material could have been left off. Don't expect \\"Nola\\", this is it's own album. I was however highly pleased with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Depressed? This Is Beautifully Brutal!","review":"Down is back again with a new ultra-heavy album. Being the ULTIMATE fan of Pantera and Corrosion of Conformity, I bought this album the day it came out. My first chance to listen to it, however, was today.If you like either COC or Pantera, you should give Down a shot. \\"Beautifully Depressed\\" is almost like Led Zeppelin with an accidental overdose of distortion. \\"Dog Tired\\" is a brutal piece, very predictable. \\"Learn From This Mistake\\" and \\"Lies, I Don't Know What They Are But...\\" are somewhat softer songs, but still heavy in a way, if you read the lyrics.Yet, one draw back I had is the lack of songs. I would have much rather preffered a double-album... It would have been a lot more worth my money. I'd be willing to pay 30 bucks for a double-CD set anytime."},{"rating":"1","title":"First one was way better","review":"I think Nola is one of the greatest heavy metal albums ever and I too was anticipating the next album. I wish they waited 7 years more because this one was really disappointing. First off, the production really [stinks] compared to the first one. Someone said in one of the reviews that the drums were too loud. I disagree, I think they weren't loud enough! The other person probably had that opinion because the guitars sounded bad as well. Vocals weren't as great either. The production wouldn't have been much of an issue if the songs were better as well.Who knows I remember that I didn't like the first one when I first heard it either. Maybe in time it will grow on me. I've only listened to it twice since I got it (like two months ago). I hope the next one is better and doesn't take so long to put out.Side note: I saw them live just last week and they did rock although Phil Anselimo was zonked out of his mind. I wish he could have been sober but they were still great."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALL HAIL DOWN","review":"THIS IS A GREAT CD THAT FEATURES STYLES FROM PANTERA, EYEHATEGOD, CROWBAR, AND COC.

GREAT AMERICAN ROCK!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good one!","review":"Down II is another great album from this band. If you liked the first one, you'll like this one. It has that black sabbath influence like the original. Phil's singing is more versatile in this album than the original. It's overall a good all the way through album. I can't say which down album I like better, although they stick to their original style, this album has a distinct sound. You won't be disappointed if you are a down fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expansion on a theme","review":"I used to play a bit with Jimmy (drums) in New Orleans, and am very familiar with Pepper and Kirk as well. This album does a great job of expaning on some of the themes laid out on their excellent debut album, \\"NOLA\\". These are some fabulous musicians that distinguish themselves from the pack in their ability to find a swampy, thick groove and really lay it down. This album has more dynamic shifts and a wider array of instrumentation that the first release, but in my opinion equals or betters the finest work of each of their primary bands (Pantera, COC, Crowbar, & Eyehategod). They seem to feel a greater sense of creative freedom here than in their own bands, and I for one would not mind seeing this become these guys' primary musical vehicle. Excellent album."},{"rating":"2","title":"An album for any mood","review":"I have never really wanted to write a review, but I just wanted to say how much I really liked this album. One song in paticular has me obsessed. \\"Lies, I Don't Know What They Say But...\\" is utterly entrancing. I feel as though this is Phil best song on the CD. Pepper and Rex play perfectly together. I just can't say enough good things about this CD. You can't peg it as a Pantera or COC or any of the other members other bands. It's just Down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lot Different, But Still Smoking'","review":"Zeppelin and Sabbath influences. This is how Metal should be! These dudes are reliving the good days.

He, along with his precocious daughter, go to Scotland to investigate his new holdings. There the Sherbrookes meet the beautiful Mary Rose Fordyce and learn of her travail, i.e., her birth circumstance, her predator, and her inheritance. From this point on, there is much romance and adventure.THE SCOTTISH BRIDE delves into the foolishness of prejudice and the immense pain it causes. It also looks at the healing forces of family and love."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love the Sherbrookes!","review":"It was great to finally read Tysen's story and to read more about the great Sherbrooke family.Tysen, despite his sexy Sherbrooke looks, is a vicar. His wife has passed away and he is raising three children. He is content with his life when he learns that he has inherited a Scottish castle and the title of Baron Barthwick. Being the responsible man that he is, he departs for Scotland not knowing that he's about to completely change his life.I thought this book was great to read. I loved seeing Tysen finally getting in touch with his Sherbrooke blood and learning to enjoy life. His daughter Meggie is magnificant. What a great addition to the story. I'd love to read a story about Meggie and the rest of the Sherbrooke children.I really enjoyed reading more about the other Sherbrooke's, Douglas and Alex, Ryder and Sophie, and Sinjun and Colin. I love the way this family gets together to solve a problem.I'd recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disapointing Finale to the Bride Series","review":"I want to start by confessing that I really wanted to like this book. I loved the Bride series, and I was thrilled to discover that Coulter had writtn a book about Tyson. At the same time, I had apprehensions about what type of character the sanctimonius and pious younger brother would turn out to be. My worries were not allayed by further reading, Tyson has changed since the earlier books but his character was too loosely drawn in this book. I did not find any of the other characters in this book interesting, nor was the mystery very intriguing. In summary, Coulter should have quit while she was ahead."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE OF COULTER'S WORST","review":"This was the second Catherine Coulter I read and I nearly gave up on her. The book was poorly written compared to her usual standard and after reading a number of her other books, I began to wonder if the same person wrote Scottish Bride! I'd only recommend this book if you are stuck in a waiting room somewhere with no other reading available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Learn to say \\"when\\"!","review":"As another reviewer mentioned, this book is TOO LONG. It should have finished once Mary Rose & Tysen got married. And the \\"plot\\" involving Erickson MacPhail--a very low-rent affair. There was no real danger, and no real evil, just a bungled kidnapping by a very misguided idiot.It almost seemed as if Coulter didn't devote 100% attention to this novel-- the characters were pretty much cardboard cut-outs. I didn't get much sense of them being \\"real.\\" And after a while Meggie wasn't \\"cute and amusing\\" anymore, she was just plain annoying.I haven't read any other of the Sherbrooke books, but I'm glad to hear they're better than this one.

Where are the fiery heroines, the ones with true pluck and spirit? Why do all of Coulter's females become bedridden at some point? What happened to the mystery? There was nothing fresh about this novel. The relationship is missing the brilliant spark that is so enchanting in many of her previous works--it seems lately Coulter is marrying off her couples earlier and earlier. This story has been done to death by Coulter. Try the \\"Song\\" series or the early Sherbrooke brides."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloody he** , Why did I waste my money on this?!","review":"Don't mistake me. I love Coutler books. I have a huge collection of them, my favorite of course being The Sherbrooke Bride. I loved the Bride series, and the following Mad Jack and Courtship, but this book left me high and dry. I have never felt the need to skim a Coulter book, but unfortunately this book did not hold my interest. Tyson is a nice character. Mary Rose is a nice character. But they are both so boring at times I wanted to scream! It seemed to be that Coulter once she gave these characters their traits, she wasn't sure what she wanted to do with them. The only reason why I even finished this book was to read about the other Sherbrookes, especially my honey Douglas. My suggestion to all of those interested, wait until you can check it out from your local library."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only Coulter book I will keep.","review":"This was the first Coulter book I read. I looked at her others, and this is the ONLY one I will keep.I looked at the other reviews, and could not understand why so many gave it a bad review. Then I realized why. Tysen.He is a (gasp) MORAL person. He is not a rapist, nor can he empathize with the man who is trying to force Mary into a wedding by means of raping her. He does not abuse the heroine, physically or mentally. He has not bedded half the female population of the county. He was faithful to his late wife. He loves his children.He is, if anything a little straightlaced, and learns passion and humor from Mary, instead of being the one to \\"loosen her up\\".In other words, boring to Coulter fans. Understandable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put this Bride Back on the shelf","review":"I loved the original book \\"The Sherbrooke Bride\\". I have read all of the bride books and this is by far the worse. The only reason I have given this book two stars is because it lets us know what has become of our favorite characters. Otherwise, this book is a complete waste of time. If you want to be thoroughly entertained I suggest reading the first book which happens to be about Alex and Douglass. Skip the second for Ryder's story is so-so. I would then read Sinjun's search for love. It is very funny and captivating. Ms. Coulter generally writes really good books. She should have quit while she was ahead."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST SHOP VACUUM EVER!","review":"We are extremely happy with this shop vacuum.

His music is uplifting and inspiring, with the title track as my favorite. I am forever a truly-devoted, PW fan! He captivates the heart and soul with his reflective and imaginative guitar masterpieces: \\"Caravan of Dreams\\", \\"Together Again\\", and \\"Venice Beach\\".

Nevertheless, undeterred if you havent discovered his sound yet you must start with this one. You dont get them this good very often and its hard to determine which are my favourite tracks. I think if pushed I would have to say track 6, Just Another Day, with of course, Basia.

I've seen Peter about three times and actually met him when he was in Al's band while they were playing in Pittsburgh. The guy is as nice as he is an excellent musician!!! His guitar licks and melodies are so original, sensual, smooth, and sometimes haunting. I've turned so many people on to him.

The solution is to turn the \\"weather radio\\" volume \\"off\\" (until it clicks like an old transistor radio). I think this affects so many people because the instructions tell you to first turn the radio on.Also, the instructions don't point out that almost 1/3 of the hazards only apply to Canadian users (Iceberg warning anyone). Also, it isn't clear from the instructions that is isn't possible to turn warnings (but not watches) off for life threatening events such as tornadoes. This make sense, but isn't explained by the instructions.I'm completely satisfied with the product after I did some research and worked with the device, but I would have warmer feelings for the manufacturer if the instructions and/or web site offerings were better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Weather Radio","review":"I've had this weather radio since spring 2006.

Bottom line: I wouldn't be without this weather radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"This thing worked like a charm... until it died.","review":"It has warned me of several major thunderstorms since I bought it, giving me plenty of time to \\"batten down the hatches,\\" so to speak. Very configurable, too. If it had a hand-crank to power it during a lengthy power outage, it would be perfect, but a spare set of batteries will probably be sufficient for most people's needs.EDIT: I can't change the rating, but not too long after the radio was out of warranty, it died. The blue display was on and blank. I can't seem to revive it. :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in blocking feature","review":"Our first weather radio is the Midland S.A.M.E. Weather/All Hazards A, which will wake you up in the middle of the night even for a severe thunderstorm watch, and keep waking you up. We bought the Midland WR300 because it appeared we could block certain types of alerts. You can, but you cannot block Tornado watch nor several other types. Personally, we want to be routed out of bed in the middle of the night for a tornado WARNING only. We returned the radio and purchased a Reecom 1630 directly from mfr. which I *can* program to block severe thunderstorm warnings and tornado watch alerts, and we can now sleep through the night unless danger is imminent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weather Radio","review":"Excellent product.

Place it where you can hear it, but I would not recommend placing it in your bedroom unless you are very hard of hearing.Pros: Large feature set. SAME prevents alarms for all but your area.Cons: Takes some time to program settings for all the different warning types. Truth-be-told, most people could probably use the unit right out of the box and change nothing but the channel and maybe the SAME setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy in Florida","review":"I am very pleased with the Midland WR-300 product.

Totally useless feature.Many of the so-called selectable alerts shown in the manual are not available on the radio's menu, including Tornado Warning, Bio Hazard Warning, Civil Danger Warning, Civil Emergency Statement, Earthquake Warning, Immediate Evacuation, and many many others. They simply do not appear on the list of choices, so they are not selectable.A total waste of money. The radio will be going back ASAP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning This Radio is not reliable","review":"MIDLAND WR300 Weather RadioI purchased this radio and believe the radio is either defective or impossible to program. I am skilled in electronics and cannot program this radio. The instructions are totally counter-intuitive.If you follow them to the letter you still can't get the radio to work. I asked help from a ham operator, skilled in radio repair, and he gave up on the entire thing, saying he could not program the radio, and suggested I return it, and buy something else. I am frustrated with the entire thing, disappointed and out nearly $50. Look at the other reviews and see how many speak of the difficulty of programing the radio and the exceptionally poor instructions. I highly recommend you NOT purchase this radio unless you want much difficulty and possibly a radio that will not work properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Experience","review":"My husband and I were thrilled with this thing for a few days----when it actually worked. Then, it completely stopped. We called Midland and their customer service staff was very rude and not helpful. They were aware that this unit has a faulty power plug, and we should return the plug for a new one. Nope. We are returning the entire thing. It is worthless and the service is pathetic. WE WANT A FULL REFUND. We have since purchased a new weather alert radio system from a reliable store. It works beautifully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad clock","review":"If having a good bedside clock is among your priorities, this is NOT the radio for you.

I wanted only coverage for my county, and with the instructions it was ready to go in under 5 min. If you are considering the WR100 get the WR300, its worth the small extra you pay. The WR300 will give you as many or as few alets as you desire.Keith M"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Weather Radio","review":"I've had a few different weather radios in the past and this one is the best by far. It's very easy to use and I love how you can program it to alert you for only certain counties. The alert itself isn't as annoying as some from older radios, but it's still loud enough to get your attention. The watch/warning/advisory lights are also great because they stay on until the alerts expire. It's also very compact and sleek and doesn't take up much room at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait Till You've had It A While...","review":"Mine worked great for about a year or so. Then it just quit. I keep getting the \\"Check Reception\\" error. I have tried everything the Midland Radio website suggests to fix it. Nothing. Don't waste your money. All the good reviews are from people who have only had it a short time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy a Midland weather radio","review":"I normally like Midland products, but I purchased a Midland WR-300 weather radio. It's extremely difficult to program (counter-intuitive), doesn't respond per the instructions, the display is faint and difficult to read, the AM/PM indicators are small even under magnification, and the clock keeps going totally haywire. Yes, it delivers alerts, but it's quite unsatisfactory otherwise. I've since purchased both a Radio Shack weather radio (and I usually avoid Radio Shack procucts) and a Reecom 1630, and both work very well, are easy to program, and have excellent displays. Don't think large companies are monolithic. Good products of one kind from a company don't necessarily guarantee good products of another kind. The particular engineers assigned to the WR-300 product failed to deliver a good product this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"display does not work properly","review":"I ordered the radio in response to the recent severe tornadoes in my area. The alarm works fine, however the display goes out. It scrolls characters that you can not read. Had to push buttons unplug etc. to get display showing again. At times when I have just looked to check the time the display will have zero's with x's in them. The weather radio works great. Just not the display. Will purchase another NOAA radio with SAME Tech. Just a high price for this radio and for it to not be fully functional. Overall poor quality for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Midland wr300 weather radio","review":"With weather getting more unpredictable every year this radio is must have item in every home.

Still works fine on AM and FM but it is silent on the weather channels. No weather channel reception means no weather alerts either. A quick Google search revealed that this is a VERY common problem with Midland weather radios. I do not recommend this radio. I'll be buying a different brand when I replace it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"I ordered the Midland WR300 Weather Radio on the recommendation of my daughter, who had read its reviews. She bought one a month or so ago, but had to send it back because it wouldn't work properly. It was replaced and does work now. So, I ordered one and received it two weeks ago. It worked at first, but then couldn't raise our local weather station. I called Midland and they told me to send it back for testing. That was enough for me. I'm sending it back to Amazon for a refund and am ordering a Reecom Model R-1650. It costs a bit more but appears to be a much better radio with a few more features."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful","review":"Ordered three of these radios for the family. A few weeks later we had one of the worst tornado outbrakes in Tennessee history. Many deaths and much destructions nearby. These radios really work.

The radio really needs to recharge the battery and keep it charged."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good.","review":"I just received this radio, and it picked up 3-4 weather stations with no problem. Perhaps this is to be expected, but I also just received a Kaito KA009 radio. The Kaito receives static and FM stations on its analog-tuned weatherband, but no weather stations. I haven't used all of the Midland radio's features yet, but compared to the Kaito KA009 it's golden."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite WX radio ever","review":"I have owned this radio for two years. It has a sensitive WX receiver, and the FM broadcast has decent sensitivity as well. The AM broadcast is usable for medium to strong signals--but in a metropolitan area you might get strong nearby signals overriding more distant stations.The WX part really works well. I like that it notifies you if it hasn't received the weekly test--so you're not inadvertently \\"in the blind\\" if the radio was moved into a bad reception spot. The SAME code selection allows for a lot of options, and the alarm override is a really key feature.As far as the battery backup via four AA batteries, I accidentally unplugged the radio for a week, but the batteries still kept it going, although they were low after a week.Highly recommended, and I have used several models of weather radios over the past decade and this is my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good unit for money but needs better time display","review":"Time display too small, difficult to read in bed. If time display was an LED, and not a LCD, it would be easier to see. Should be able to set wake up alarm in fewer steps. Emergency alert alarm works well and like feature to manage desired warnings.

The LCD display on the 120 was very easy to read even with the back light off. But the display on the 300 is very dim unless you crouch down in front of it and view it at a low angle.I don't know whether mine was flawed or whether there's an actual design issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, but one confusing aspect in instructions","review":"We purchased this product for peace of mind and are very happy with it. The only problem was figuring out how to change which alerts we would get. Really, I read the instructions and could not find where it talked about adding and removing alerts. Well, come to find out that the \\"Defeat Siren\\" function (whatever defeat siren means) can be used to remove alerts. If I had known that one bit of information, the instructions would have been much easier. Others in their reviews talk about the confusing aspect of the instructions, and this is probably what they are referencing. Everything else made perfect sense. Again, we really love this radio and the peace of mind that comes with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"midland wr-300 weater alert radio","review":"excellent weather alert radio. also has wake-up features and am/fm radio. fm radio is good however the am stations are very weak unless you have an outside reception hookup. would recommend. bought three more, one for each of my children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very weak weather band","review":"I am very near a major city and this radio cannot pick up any of the three weather stations that are indicated for my area.

I don't know if this one was defective or not but if I were you I would definately check into the \\"Reecom R1650\\" weather alert radio, it rocks! And yes we did the Midland programmed properly.

While getting it setup was a bit involved, the process was clearly spelled out and went without a significant problem. One feature I really like about this model is the ability to set alarms by type and level of emergency. This makes the few extra dollars for the 300 model well worth it. The alarm is LOUD and will wake you at night, so you probably don't need it to go off for every type of watch and warning. Ours has sounded, correctly, twice for tornado warnings...the main reason we purchased it. The alarm can be heard throughout the house. The unit can be easily hidden behind a picture or set on a bookshelf. Our only use has been as a weather alert/weather radio and it performs these tasks admirably.Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Midland Weather Radio - 300","review":"This item appears to function well.

The problem so far is the weather alert feature seems to not be working at all. We've had 4 different alerts, advisories, warnings since the product was received, and so far the alarm has not sounded once, nor is any message displayed in the screen. Maybe just a DOA example which needs to be replaced, but who likes to have to do that? I've written directly to the Midland Company to see what they have to say, but if they don't respond I'll have to return it for a replacement. Bottom line, it needs to work for weather alerts; that's what it is for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Monitor","review":"The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was based on what I considered the dificulty in setting up the monitor.

It worked great for almost 2 years and now everything on the unit works BUT the weather radio/alert system part. My dad tried reprograming it several times with no luck and also called Midland directly and their only response was that they would sell him a new one for $90!!! In my opinion this item should have worked for well over 2 years and why would he pay $90 for another one from Midland when he could buy a new one for less on Amazon?!? Needless to say since it didn't even make the 2 year mark we won't be buying another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality control?","review":"This is our second midland weather radio, and the second one that died a quick death. The first just outright died shortly after the warranty period expired. This one the screen died, and no longer can be read. The backlight works and the machine itself works, but I just can't use it since I can't read the screen.We only use this in the summer since that is our stormy season, and after the season, it gets unplugged and the batteries removed. So it probably has less than 6 months total usage and is worthless. the manual says I can send it in to get fixed, for $45 +8 shipping? I could buy a new one for less. This will be the last midland product we purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed within 15 minutes","review":"I purchased this product through Amazon and then, unfortunately, I put it on the shelf for over a year before trying it out. When I did plug it in, the display failed completely within 15 minutes, rendering the radio nearly useless. This is why consumers should always test new electronic products immediately after buying them. Still, my foolishness does not excuse Midland for selling a shoddy product.I didn't have the reception problems that other users reported, but I can attest that the programming is more difficult than it needs to be. Also, why does the alarm clock function support only one alarm?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit after 3 years","review":"Same as many others, weather radio quit after about 3 years.AM/Fm still works, but who cares?!Just amazing.

From what I could tell, I could accomplish that.That's where the good news ends.The minute I took it out of the box, I noticed the 5 grey buttons on top stick, to the point where I have to grab them and pull them back up. Next, I turned it on. I was unable to get a signal on ANY of the channels. If I moved it up against the window, I could get one slightly. The Radio Shack radio I had received 2 channels PERFECTLY, without needing to put it up against the window.I am now about to ship this thing back. I am very disappointed in this radio.

It was somewhat complicated to set up, but once done with the initial setup it performed well. About a month ago the first set of batteries I put in there ran out. I put fresh ones in there and tested to make sure it still worked. Well, everything except the weather alerts and radio work, defeating the point of the weather radio.

Within the past few months I moved from one place in IL to \\"tornado alley\\" in IL and my girlfriend is just a mile from me, so I got her one too. She has it set up to receive any local emergencies so she's not bothered by things going on miles away.

Just be sure to enter only the alerts you are interested in, and in the counties you are interested.

That is such an eery feeling to be woken at 1:00 in the morning, and hear about who took whom. We need to know, but not a 1:00 in the morning.

Unfortunately I can't give it a ZERO but instead will go one star. I have owned this weather radio for 2 years and when I needed the NOAA warning features the most with Severe Thunderstorms and Tornado Warnings in my area, the Midland WR-300 sat in silence. No warning tone, no NOAA radio, no alert lights displaying, the only thing that now functions is the AM/FM radio. This was the first major severe weather event of the year and had no reason to think it would fail. With my next radio I will make sure to test it on my own each week but it will NOT be a Midland."},{"rating":"1","title":"WR-300 RADIO","review":"Purchased March 2012.

I thought I would also be able to see what time it was in the dark. After 2 nights of being blinded by the bright blue light when trying to see the time we turned the light off and put our old alarm clock on a different dresser. So now we have what looks like 2 alarm clocks in our bedroom!! I really don't know if it works or if we have it set right because we havn't had any warnings yet. To make a long story short, this radio has a sucky display and is confusing to set!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"midland weather radio","review":"Very slick radio.

All of the same problems . I can't get past setting the time . AM /PM display is so small I could not believe it .I thought it might be a dot instead of letters. No 800 tech support phone number. Its hard for me to believe the 4 and 5 star review are about the same model of radio. On the third day I finally got the radio programmed.I have no idea what I was doing wrong.I find this radio a true pain to set. The instruction pamplet will have to sit under the radio forever for reference (make sure you write in your county codes so you dont have to look them up again ).I would recommend a dedicated weather radio only not a unit that has alarm time and AM/ FM radio all in one unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"A weather radio saved our lives.","review":"I purchased 2 of these to replace the Midlands I lost in a tornado on July 13, 2004. The old radio saved the lives of myself, our 5 yr old and 3 of our grandchildren. If the radio had not been gone off, we would likely be dead. I never would have looked out the back door in time to get us all in the basement before an F4 hit our home. We live in the country and I have always had a weather radio. I tell everyone I know to get weather radio .This is a nice model and I like the AM/FM feature. The problem I continually have had with every radio is that we live in the middle of the coverage areas and don't get the best signal at times. I have solved this by putting a Chore Boy stainless steel scrub pad on the antenna. It definitely improves the reception and seems to do better that foil. Other than that I think this is the best one I have had."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quality unit with thoughtful design","review":"I really like the WR-300. It has a decent user interface, a very clear audio system, and lots of useful features. This is the unit to have by your bedside to wake you up in a crisis. It has a siren, plus blinking lights, plus a very loud and clear speaker for listening to voice announcements. You can't ignore warnings from this unit.As another reviewer notes, the WR-300 is not really designed as a bedside entertainment radio. Buy something else for that function. The loud beep on every keypress is deliberate and important -- it is to help you work the unit in noisy conditions, as you might have to in a storm. That's appropriate design, in my opinion.I bought one of these after Oxnard had a tidal wave warning that I only learned about hours after it had expired. I live on the flood plain, so tsunamis would be destructive. But with just a few minutes warning I could easily get into the high hills surrounding the basin. This box will give me that warning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great weather radio","review":"Easy to set up for just the counties and alerts that you want. Note: it will alert you with sound day and night so make sure you only set the alerts for the most important ones so you won't be woke up at 3am for a storm \\"watch\\", etc. or a flood warning, if you don't live in a flood zone, etc. All in all, great item for the money and with all the tornadoes this country has had this year, I feel safer with it.

Once through that hurdle it's performance was excellent. It was able to pull in two NWR stations very well and even a third but with some noise. We received several flash flood alerts in the past two days and it didn't miss one. On the down side the menu system is difficult to master and even changing AM/FM stations is trickier than I think it could have been. The ability to enable/disable the siren for specific types of alerts is great. I don't need to be awoken at 3:00AM to be told there's a marine weather alert! Get some help with the set-up if you're not very good with these types of devices! Still, it is easy to recommend given the solid radio performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as described","review":"Set up is a bit involved but everything works ...

The very first storm that came through after I got my WR300 running knocked the local NWS radio off the air and I didn't receive the tornado warning they issued. Good thing I had the tv on at the time!Before I bought the WR300, I had tried a cheaper Radio Shack model that would alert you the minute it lost radio reception, but wouldn't let you select counties or alert types. I guess I just assumed more expensive models would have this feature, but that is not always the case.Just remember, it is not a newsworthy item when a NWS station goes off the air-the local news will not warn you nor the local radio or the police...so your weather radio is never 100 prercent reliable, even with battery backup."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tinny sound - 3 FM presets - good weather radio","review":"If you are looking for a weather radio with SAME, this is a good radio.

Return policy at amazon.com is a 5 star rating. Have never had any problem returning defective merchandise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor build quality.","review":"Bad radio. Worked for just over two years then the weather radio quit. Difficult to read display and cumbersome setup. Find something with better build quality. A well built radio should last decades not months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable Display","review":"I bought this radio as a bedside clock radio with weather alerts. The display is a large blue screen with tiny characters which are only visible at certain angles. It is unreadable at any angle at night. The method of controls, for alarm setting, receiving weather broadcasts, etc. is very confusing. It is unsatisfactory in every way. I have procrastinated too long to return it, and have wasted $50 on it. Don't buy a gadget like this on the internet - see it in the store and pay a little more (or considerably less, for a clock radio) to have some idea what you're buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Radio was easy to set up and has performed great. recommended by a friend and I would pass on the recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"I purchased this item because we rarely have the television on and I wanted to be warned of severe weather in the area, especially at night. I chose this model because I was able to narrow the alerts to set off the alarm only when there is a warning in one of two specific counties. I've been using it for about 2 months and it's worked great. I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for a few months, then died","review":"The WR300 radio was working great for a few months, then stopped receiving everything. The AM/FM radio and the weather radio just stopped working on day, with only \\"static\\" (white noise) on all channels. It's still under warranty, but looks like I have to pay to send it back to the manufacturer, and then pay them to send it back to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to set up","review":"This radio works as advertised and was extremely easy to set up. The default weather radio connects to the strongest signal NOAA weather station and saves that setting. But you can change it easily if you want. The AM/FM radio portion has a digital tuner with decent sensitivity and selectivity, and the saved stations feature (3 AM, 3 FM) is very convenient. The reason I took off a star is that there is no sleep feature . This could have been added at relatively little cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"These are dependable and work great this product is a must for a 72 hour kit, a lot of people do not think about it but these are a must for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice features but...","review":"While this has nice features like a radio and the ability to switch the siren to a voice, the LCD makes it virtually unusable. The back light combined with black letters and numbering makes reading it at night very difficult to say the least. From just the right angle, you may be able to read what it says, but when you're in a hurry (like deciding to run to your basement) due to an impending tornado alert, the LCD renders the device useless. I would not recommend this unit to anyone with other than 20/20 vision."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good price","review":"This was a better price than any other site I looked, and it is not found in-store, we have yet to really use it since it is winter and not as many alerts as summer, but I love all the additional options than the standard radio, plus the volume control on the alert."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than first alert!","review":"works great. Worth the extra money for the feature that allows you to turn off the warnings and watches you don't need. I don't care if there is a blizzard warning or a flash flood warning at 2:00 AM.It is much better than the first alert brand. I purchased a similar one from first alert a year or so ago, but it started going off in the middle of the night for no reason at all ( NOT COOL). When I asked first alert about the problem they told me it was a software problem that they knew about but had no fix for! My only choices were to return it to the store I bought it from or return it to them (at my expense of course) in exchange for a cheaper model that wasn't programmable. Lucky for me I saved my receipt and the store had a good return policy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great weather radio!","review":"We bought this weather radio after a recent hailstorm in which none of the neighbors could hear the accompanying city sirens warning of a very close tornado. I like that we can program it to receive only the local warnings if desired, and that it also runs on batteries. In the past 3 weeks the alarm has sounded 3 times for severe thunderstorm warnings; since we don't watch TV the warnings were very reassuring. The alarm is very loud, we moved it from our bedroom to the living room; we can even hear it outside. It has the option of just having the radio come on instead of the alarm, and also shows a red warning light when there is an alert. We live in the suburbs, and for us the reception of both AM/FM and weather radio are excellent. I would recommend this radio to anyone who lives in an area susceptible to severe weather, as well as to anyone who wants to be alerted to other civil emergencies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall...we can't complain!","review":"We have been using the Midland WR300 for about a year now and it works perfectly. We have been alerted of a tornado in the middle of the night, even were told of a rare Winter Storm warning here in the great state of North Carolina. It was such a good radio, we bought our parents one as well.Here are some of the downsides, yes the buttons are LOUD, you definitely can not set this thing with your spouse sleeping next to you. The clock is pretty much worthless in the middle of the night as you need to feel your way around to get it to turn on.Overall great product, it does what it says it does and not a whole lot more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Odor prevents use","review":"I received the radio yesterday and attempted to set it up, however, a strong chemical odor made me put it in the garage.

Great product for weather radio. AM/FM a plus. I also like the capability of tuning into the local county for localized weather alerts."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works for tornados","review":"I bought this unit a couple of years ago and we had a bunch of tornado warnings since then. You need to set it up correctly first of course. The instructions are very clear, but some people may have trouble. I set it up so that only visual indicators light up for things like Flood or Severe thunderstorm. However, when there is a Tornado warning, the clock starts screaming so loud, you can hear it anywhere in the house. Works great! I live near a county border, so I have it set up for 2 counties and it alerts when a warning is issues in either of those counties. My only complaint is the display. If there are several alerts at the same time, you have to wait for them to scroll. The night light is so bright, I disabled it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Dead","review":"I bought this radio in May 2010. It got about five months of use, and since the fall of 2010 has sat unused due to the house being remodeled.Two weeks ago I got the radio out because of impending weather and plugged it in, only to find that the radio was dead. I put in new batteries, and it operated for about 4 days, then died again. I put in another set of batteries, and the same thing happened.It appears that the power supply is defective, so the radio has to run solely on battery power. Unfortunately, at the rate it drains the batteries, it'll cost more in batteries than it's worth.Although I liked many of the features of the Midland Radio, I'll be buying a different brand to replace this one in hopes that it will last longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't last long under normal use","review":"Had this 7 months.

This radio is great, it has SAME technology (for county specific alerts). This feature is great, and within a couple days of receiving it, there was a stretch of severe weather, and even a power failure. With the battery back up we were alerted to tornado warnings for my area. It also gives alerts for smog advisories. Alerts can be turned off if you don't want to hear certain ones.The design is compact and modern. My only complaint is you have to really be picky with it's positioning to get the best reception, although an external antenna is available.This weather radio, despite it says NOAA - works perfectly fine in Canada for Environment Canada weather broadcasts and alerts. :)For the price you cannot go wrong with this radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Radio","review":"Have had this radio for a few days now. It was easy to setup, and is quite stylist. Went through the user manual, and performed the setup by the numbers. Worked as advertised.

Clearly value for the money spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair Radio","review":"Be careful on purchasing this clock radio. It has many features and is somwhat difficult to get it totally programmed. However, the worst part of this Clock Radio is that it has NO sleep capabilities. The radio is either on or off. If it is by your bedside and you like to have the radio on for an hour or so-it does not have that ability. So it is not a full functioning clock radio. That is very misleading. I wanted a NOAA alert radio by my bedside but have a clock radio, which I did not get. So beware on this item. The radio is ok but shoud not be advertised as a clock radio but rather a radio with a clock and that is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Receiver problems","review":"Many aspects of the unit seemed good but I returned the one I ordered because in some locations in my apartment the radio received some type of commercial radio or TV signal.

This is a must have for all households, a small investment.Also, no false alarms. It has not went off at all until last night. You can decide which weather alerts to sound the siren, and which to ignore, etc. Very flexible and easy to use. Easy to hear all over the house as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised","review":"This product is great. Lately we have experienced bad storms. This unit responded very well.

But with the SAME technology, I was able to program this to only go off on warnings that affect our area. For watches, it just lights up and puts a text warning - no waking up for things that haven't yet reached the emergency level.As others have noted, it'd be nice if there was more control over the light level, and the time could be larger. But these are minor considerations. I'm buying another radio for my office."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good to have...BUT...","review":"I purchased three of these for gifts and I cautioned everyone about how complicated programing the monitor can be. It took me a good two hours to do this. At the same time, I was worried about the alert siren going off and no one knowing how to turn it off! Since I set mine up, we've had several alert sirens go off in the early early morning. It was good to wake up and listen to what was going on - especially because one of the alerts was a notice of an earthquake that produced a very small tsunami effect that affected our harbored boats and shoreline. I like receiving warnings and alerts as soon as the NOAA issues them and it outweights the complexity of programming the monitor. For the price, peace of mind and features - this is an pretty good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"In 5 years in strom central Texas, never had 1 alert","review":"We've had this model for over 5 years.

In the end, I think he did set it up right, but didn't know it. It works well when there are storms, once we had it set up. There needs to be a quick setup guide, if all you want to do is put in the station number and your county code."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I have been very impressed with this radio.

It recognizes the test alerts but I have had no real time alerts during the month I have had it. The AM/FM sound is a little \\"tinney\\" but not as bad as I have heard on other low priced radios. I am using it now in Florida but plan to take it to upstate New York to our summer home and also on our many summer camping trips. The feeling of security and well being that it gives is priceless.

The user manual is very poor, the on-line help is not any better - be prepared for trial and error to learn how to use it.

In fairess, I can say that her singing is techincally accurate, albeit souless. The ONLY energy in this new cover is from the techno beat track. The snappy attitude from the original is missing. Cher was able to bring soul and energy to techno, and so was Madonna. Perhaps it is just a bad mixing job (but all of the tracks???)

The book lets you know what to expect in M&A and Transitions.2. It lets you gain insights on economic value creation, and teaches you to focus on the bottom-line.3. It provides a clear framework for communications at different levels to different stakeholders (customers, employees, shareholders, regulators, vendors, et al.)4. It also sensitizes you to potential competitive threats during the critical period of transition.5. It virtually hands you a launch plan for transition, but with enough insights via stories and incidents that you can adapt it; and learn multidimensionally. (e.g., What would I do when two of my competitors merge?)The authors' communication is lucid, ideas are pragmatic and insightful, and the focus is on the bottom-line. READ THIS FIRST!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Field Guide \\"Lite\\"","review":"Lots of catchy anecdotes, but light on actually implementing the \\"Accelerated Transition\\" principles, despite the \\"field guide\\" description.

Not worth the money...skim it at the bookstore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long on opinion, short on facts","review":"I found this book entertaining in terms of the anecdotes they use to illustrate their points. However, I was deeply disappointed with the degree of conviction they maintain based primarily on a data sample of a little more than 100 firms. That compares to more than 30,000 transactions globally in a normal year. I find it difficult to have much confidence in their conclusions. I find it annoying that author's often seem to promote either their agenda, their firm, or a particular point of view by using either data that tends to support their conclusions or a sample that is too small to be meaningful. Nonetheless, if you are interested in being entertained, this book is for you...howerver, if you are interested in some modicum of rigor, you need to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as claim","review":"I purcahsed a pontoon with a 1990 Suzuki 150.

I have little respect for his mentality and scholarship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do people really believe this stuff","review":"I highly commend Mr. Woodrow for correcting his previously held false opinions. It takes a lot of courage to admit you made a mistake and even more to publicly admit it and make amends. Amends is exactly what this book is. After having previously believed Hislop's \\"research\\" and conclusions, even going so far as to write his own book based on them, this book serves as Woodrow's complete refutation of Hislop's errors done with the most generous spirit possible. Woodrow may criticize Hislop's methods but he never criticizes Hislop himself. After reading the book I am left with one question, why did Woodrow, or anyone else for that matter, believe the claims Hislop made? If anyone out there still holds to the foolish belief that Catholics are really Babylonian pagans, please direct them to this book so they will stop proving themselves to be fools."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money - skip this book","review":"If you read \\"Babylon Mystery Religion\\", which I did, don't bother reading this book.

The simple fact is that they got to Woodrow. But unfortunately for them the truth is sure hard to rub out. Forget about all the silly arguments made back and forth.

I was so disgusted by Woodrows claims that I couldn't even continue reading. He totally puts down Hislops research. Some people just refuse to see the truth. Others will be misled if they continue reading false doctrine by uneducated authors. Idol worship is an abomination before God/Elyon! The Catholic church and religion is very corrupt. God did not create these man-made holidays. These holidays were created to mislead everyone. Unfortunately, some have fallen into this trap. Do your reesearch before allowing yourselves to be brain washed by mans traditions(pagan) and beliefs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Raph Woodrow: Influenced by the Great Whore of Rev. 17","review":"I read his first book and also read a preview of his latest book...Sadly, his refutes are at times based on pictures. For example, he critizes Hislop's book for displaying one picture of a blonde haired woman with a black baby and dismisses it as just a myth with no real pagan connection....Baal worship or sun worship was intergrated into various cultures at various degrees and at various times throughout history. So it wouldnt be that uncommon to have a mother/child religion (baal worship) displayed in a mixed manner or in a variant manner...Also there is another thing, Woodrow may have been too focused on the first book that Roman Catholicism was the only religion with the pagan connection calling itself \\"Christian\\"...Revelation 17 reveals more than one religion has the pagan connection, but the \\"mother\\" is Rome...So I believe after 35 years or more he began to be influenced by the Great Whore and also by dispensalism."},{"rating":"1","title":"ROMANTIC disappointment","review":"It sure was a disappointment to listen to the C.D. and not have it live up to his other recordings.

Jonathan Taylor Thomas is grossly miscast in this film. Disney should have put effort into developing a decent script rather than trying to showcase one of their popular stars! It lacks the charm and wit of the novel and JTT is not a bit believable as Tom. He is a talented actor, don't get me wrong. But he has no business playing Tom Sawyer. Too much of his attitude from his Home Improvement character comes through. Brad Renfro is acceptable as Huck, but nothing to cheer about.

And I'm fairly glad I did. Tom and Huck is an innocent classic tribute to...well...innocence. A lot of the movies you see today are graphic and violent and sexual. Things that are PG rated today would have been R rated back in the sixties. My friend says that's because we've 'evolved.' I think that's a load of crap.

The peril is real. The danger is heart stopping. As always in the midst of this whirlwind Mr.Golden and Ms. Holder take time to give the reader wonderful moments. For example the gatekeeper granting Angel a magic dream of Buffy so real he can smell her lavender and vanilla fragrance or Joyce proving that she is worthy to be a slayer's mother.

This film in particular comes across as inauthentic and filled with every ridiculous sexist cliché that was already outdated in 1988, let alone in 2013. Two stars only for having a good late-1980s soundtrack (though the film suffers from soundtrack overkill at times. Kate Bush's \\"This Woman's Work\\" during the childbirth scene?

It has a great lesson in it of choosing your own path even if it's not the popular choice. Also it shows what determination, practice, & discipline can get you. It also shows the bonds of friendship. I would definitely watch it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY Good!!","review":"\\"Save the Last Dance\\" is an awesome movie and I would recommend it to everyone. All of the stars shine playing their roles. Julia Stiles gives her best performance yet. This movie explores the kind of emotional strains and difficulties of maintaining an interracial relationship, as well as losing a loved one. This movie will bring you to tears. A must buy, you won't regret it!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie & music","review":"This movie is AWESOME and so is the music. I like the fact that Julia Stiles character enters the 'black world' instead of a black man entering the 'white world'. The movie was writen and produced well accept, it did get a little slow in the middle. Thats the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Save the last dance is a great date movie. My husband and I BOTH enjoyed it. I will defently add this one to my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love this movie","review":"Anyone who loves dance should see this movie even if you dont like to dance still go see it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey at least it had a message","review":"Well I though this movie was pretty funny as a comedy, and hey it had a decent message. The lives of the primary characters were going downhill when they were \\"getting wasted\\" every night, and once they took control of their lives things turned around. Hey it was funny too. Yah it didn't win any academy awards, but that is just actors giving other actors awards anyway, so I tend to ignore that."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"I absolutely hated this movie. It was extremely slow moving and the story was awful, actually, I shouldn't say that because I don't know the entire story because I fell asleep less than halfway into it (although I'd had a lot of Jolt Cola prior to the start of the movie).

It's my second favorite movie behind Titanic. I just got this movie on VHS today, and I watched it when I got home. Of course, I saw it a few times before at my friends house that's how I fell in love with this movie. It's about a 17 year old girl named Sara, who is a ballet dancer but then her Mom gets in a car reck at the beginning and she stops for awhile on her ballet dancing. Then she has to move to her Dad's town in Chicago. Well anyways, I don't wanna give out the whole movie!

And a girl, the ever boring Julia Stiles, wanting to learn how to do the ethnic bump n' grind. Oh and there is a \\"message\\" in this film, kind of a West Side Story thing. All the cliches are there and if I were black, this movie would offend me. The black women are either street walkers or welfare mommas and the black men are gangsters. Way to go with the stereotypes.

I can only blame myself for renting it but I knew what I was getting into from the start...I just wanted confirmation. Sadly, this is the current trend in Hollywood, teaming up black males with pretty blondes. I wonder if someone out there is trying to cause a trend. This movie is disgusting and I would never let my daughter watch it. Ms. Stiles has type cast herself as whale dung, and that's at the bottom of the ocean...as low as you can get. Don't rent or buy this (bad movie). Why encourage Hollywood in perpetuating this obsceene fetish?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very offensive","review":"I found Save the Last Dance to be very offensive. Its pounded heavily with bad attitude, violence, profanity, sensuality, and freak dancing (the guys and girls body touch very closely and very sexualy) when dancing. Its so disgusting.I don't understand why any teens would want to waste their time watching this dirty movie. Mtv is responsible for bringing this dirty romp to the big screen and I'm sorry that I ever saw it. It may come across as the story of dancing and romance, but its not. Its misrated and an R rating would have been more appropriate for this movie.This is a filthy movie, and shouldn't be seen by anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"PURE TRASH!!","review":"Trash is the softest word for this \\"movie\\".

I thought this was supposed to be a movie about different styles of dancing. If you want teen drama then I guess this could be for you. If you're looking for something about a young dancer trying to make it, this isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"GAG!!! Full of Stereotypes!!! Just Plain Stupid!!! GAG!!!","review":"I hate this movie with a passion. A blond girl moves to the ghetto and her black boyfriend helps her to regain courage to dance. OMG!!! Somebody save me. This movie was full of stereotypes. Stiles' best friend, a black teenage mother. The black females in the movie were either portrayed ghetto ready to fight girls or teenage mothers. It's very offensive. This was seriously a yawner, especially watching stiles trying to do the dances. The guy's acting was boring too. I couldn't believe his acting. yawn yawn yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not a good movie","review":"This movie, in my opinion, was boring. It had a lot of trash talk, no really good dancing, and a predictable ending. Julia Stiles was dull, but Sean Patrick Thomas was good, so if you like him watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Really Liked It!","review":"This was very good! It mixed romance, friendship, comedy, and dancing into an entertaining movie. The dancing was fantastic, and the acting was great, too! Julia Stiles was very good as Sara, a seventeen-year-old girl who dreams of being a ballerina, but ends up learning a lot about hip-hop, as well. This movie doesn't quite make my \\"favorites\\" list, but it comes pretty close! I really liked the fact that more than one story was going on at once, but they worked together to make one big story! I recommend this movie to teen girls, especially those who love to dance. I say \\"teen\\" girls because there is a lot of cussing and some teen content that isn't appropriate for all girls. But to those who are allowed to watch PG-13, and love teen movies, I highly recommend this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie","review":"This is one of my favorite movies. I love the plot, the characters and just about everything about the movie. I didn't care for Derek's friends though, and was glad when he didn't join them in their antics. I loved Julia Stiles and Sean patrick Thomas together. They both came across as real. This is a definite 5 star movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Acting 101","review":"The story was good, but the acting was hideous. Julia Stiles performance was as pathetic as Keanu Reeves in 'A Walk in the Clouds'. She was not very convincing in her role and she sounded at times as if she were reading que cards. Definately not a show to spend your money on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripped Off","review":"Be aware that this DVD ships from Italy and cannot be played on American DVD players. I bought it, not knowing this and sent it back for a refund which I have never received. Amazon should be more forthcoming about these sort of problems. And I rate the seller no stars at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie","review":"This movie is a really great movie. I loved it so much I saw it twice. With Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Thomas being a couple it really made the movie. I would definitely recommend this movie and this movie shows how far you can go in life. Even though the couple were not accepted in their surroundings, they didn't care. A happy ending also makes the movie a great one. Not seeing this movie is a bad choice.

A really worth while movie to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular","review":"This movie is great.It shows what it's like for someone trying to get back into the regular move of things and it shows how nice it is to be able to have friends and to fit in.It's kind of like my situation with being the only white boy in my school.The music, scripts, actors, and just everything make it the best movie of the year! A must-see."},{"rating":"2","title":"titanic","review":"For some reason, this movie reminds me of the titanic. the titanic was a clasic movie which fills your heart with joy and sadness at the same time, that's what i find in common between these two movies.Save the last dance, although it has a predictable story line, the characters, story and the music will stay with you after you see it. the story starts sad, but things begin to improve slowly and the lead characters strugles and finds a new hope for her self and her life, watching this movie teaches a lot about life itself.. you should never give-up kind of story...i saw this one on the movies, and the only reason i'm not gonna buy the DVD, is because it is going to make me sad to watch it again ( it's just me! i'm very emotional )."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST MOVIE SEEN!","review":"ive seen a lot of movies, and i mean ALOT, but none have stuck with me or impacted me as much as Save the Last Dance. i HIGHLY recomend this movie, i know that the moment this movie comes out on video, i have EVERY intention on buying it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I recently viewed \\"Save The Last Dance\\" twice. I found the movie incredibly enjoyable, and every performance was right on. There were some cliches, however, I enjoyed how the characters held together as well as the quick dialouge. The only problem I had with this movie is in the scene where Sara has a nervous breakdown after the ballet, Sara tearfully tells Derek that her dream was to be a prima ballerina and Derek asks if her dream is stil to go to Julliard. Sara had never actually said she wanted to go to Julliard she just said she and her mom dreamed of ballet success which easily could have included institutes other than Julliard, so Derek must be telepathic, which was never again mentioned in the movie. Otherwise the movie was magnificent."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Film Ever!!!","review":"When I saw this movie, I had to watch it again just to make sure that it was that good! The storyline is fantastic and is a movie for everyone. Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Thomas are the best actors, so together you can only imagine how good they have to be. I would give the movie +5 stars but I can't do that. This movie was so good, I went out and bought it right away and both of the Cd's! It even made me want to learn hip hop dancing. If you miss this movie, you'll be sorry when everyone's talking about it. This is a must see! I just loved it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best I have ever seen!","review":"I loved this movie, it was perfect Julia and Sean Thomas Patrick had great chemistry.

I loved it and I think it was one of the best movies this year!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Save the Last Dance","review":"I am a 78 year old grandmom. One of my favorite movies is \\"Dirty Dancing\\". This movie reminds me of that with a more modern theme. This is the way kids act, talk and dance today. I thought it was very very good. I watched it with my grandsons and we all enjoyed it a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"coyote ugly with a dramatic twist","review":"Save the last dance has a variety of different themes for all types of people. Julia Stiles moves to New York after her mother dies in a car crash. She has to live with her dad and go to an all black school. She gave up her dream of ballet for a walk on the wild side but when the opportunity comes around, she may have to pull together to get back into the life she once lived. Save the Last dance is something I would reccomend for anyone persuing a dream."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Teen Flick, a Decent Movie","review":"Save the Last Dance greatly transcends other run-of-the-mill teen movies that are so prevalent today. Unlike the others, Save the Last Dance has EXCELLENT acting as well as a very well-developed plot. So many teen movies are nothing but sappy romances. Save the Last Dance is a romance too, but far from sappy. Numerous subplots abound: moving to a new city, sadness, friendship, racism, dancing, and most important of all: achieving dreams. Julia Stiles plays her part beautifully, and every aspect of the plot falls wonderfully into place. Save the Last Dance is not a classic film by any means, but so much better than its complacent counterparts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movies","review":"They sent me a DVD that doesn't work in my DVD player. When I emailed them about it they sent me one website that was supposed to decode my DVD player so it would play it. There instructions didn't work.

So poor, who puts up the money to make these things?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dang why you gotta play her like that Chenille!","review":"Sean Patrick Thomas is actually a good actor with some real potential, but even he can't save this movie (or the last dance). This movie is trying too hard to connect with the kids while at the same time attempting to display some emotional depth, while at the same time trying to highlight some real problems in African American culture. Instead of leaving a meaningful impact, it ends up creating mockups of a unique but troubled society. Don't try so hard Hollywood. Make a real genuine movie about the problems of inter-racial relationships OR make a movie about the struggles of under-privileged youth OR make a movie about the struggles of broken families. I like the idea, but the execution is laughable. And Julia, you should loosen up a little and get some soul.

If you love RnB and to a lesser extent rap then watch this. The soundtrack is awesome. It features songs such as 'Get It On Tonite' by Montell Jordan which is a fab song, and 'All or Nothing'- a kinda RnB based orchestra track. (This is the song Sara dances to in her audition at the end). I love this film and have watched it loads of times just for the music. The storyline seems real, although it it a bit stereotypical with a single, teenage mother and a group of (teenage)thugs into drugs and crime. However, a great film.

Her lyrics sometimes run along the gutsy channels of a Camille Paglia rant, but with the tender heart of everywoman. She sings to her man that she's not interested in being his friend (hubba-hubba), but it's a song that never goes purely raunchy.From the sultry \\"Rainy Night in Chinatown\\" to the wonderfully amusing C&W ballad \\"Big O,\\" this is a super CD. Grab it and hold onto it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The surprisingly well-rounded man behind the barbed writer","review":"Doug Moe had full access to Mike Royko's family, friends, and colleagues, present and past. He used it to put together a warm account of the many-sided man behind the sometimes acerbic, Pulitzer-Prize-winning columns. And, as a six-a-week newspaper columnist himself, he has a clarifying intuition for his subject. Royko fans will be telling these stories to each other for years. I took the new photos for this book, but the real photograhic gems are the never-before-seen shots of the younger Royko, his people and his world. The perfect Christmas gift for Royko's readers who miss him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun to read","review":"It's a wonderful book about a fascinating writer.

I have read the Tribune for many years but never did read Royko's columns. I read this book to get an idea of why he was such a revered journalist.I found that the book had some great stories in it and overall it was an enjoyable read, but I did not emerge as impressed with Mike Royko as I thought I would be. A good book for a nice overview for someone trying to figure who Mike Royko was.

Hogan here presents a somewhat unevenly written story. However, that being said, there is a class of reader (such as I) that really appreciates clever sf and surprising plot twists.Multiplex Man does have its moments of annoying polemics so frequent in Hogan's work. However, the incredible entertainment of this book easily makes reading it well worth while. Towards the end I couldn't put it down; the adventure was so exciting, the explanations so satisfying.If you have difficulty finding this out-of-print book, a little Web searching can reward you with this gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sci-fi book","review":"This book is a good sci-fi read. It has a bleak vision of the future in where America has adopted an almost 1984 Orwell feel to it and freedoms are routinely violated all in the name of protecting resources and believe it or not, Asia and Russia are the the lands of opportunity. Throw in a dab of mystery and government intrigue and a man with amnesia and five months missing from his life and you have a great story.This is the first book I have read from this author and I am looking forward to reading more. I recommend this novel to anyone who likes mystery and sci-fi."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"This seemed very amateurist and ignorant.

It is a real joy to read hard SF written with skill, there are not many who can combine cutting edge science with the ability to write sensible sounding dialouge and fashion believable personalities. Having said that, this one does not make it. The old 'waking up with amnesia and killers after you' plot has been around for a long, long time. Sure, there are a couple of twists, but nothing really new. The real disappointment, however, is the political layering. Anyone who likes an L. Neil Smith novel would like \\"The Multiplex Man\\". Exactly the same depiction of Libertarians as good, smart, helpfull, successfull people; and everyone of any other viewpoint as eithier naive, criminal, mentally ill, or a combo of all three."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're no Philip K.

The whole misplaced identity and 'tyranical' government thing is just handled so poorly here.The attempts at philosphing are such poor straw-man scenarios (Do you want your government telling you where you can go! Don't give out any personal information!). And the whole multiple identity thing is just chunky.At least Dick kept you in suspense as to which identity was valid, and made you care/humanize with the poor guy. This book is nothing more than a cheap execuse for Mr. Hogan to expouse on how much he hates government intrusion (yet I bet he'll complain if the roads aren't plowed).I really regret picking this up, I don't regret putting it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABRIEF EDUCATION","review":"THIS BOOK WAS GREAT FROM BEGINNING TO END.

The editing, narrative style, atmosphere and screenlay are all handled wronly. The only good thing are the commanding performances by Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman. Formulaic, tedious and overlong.

However, the movie is more than heavy with a misogynist view that taints the film. Freeman is super in the role that he is totally wrong for, the friend absorbing, but just slowly turns you off. Rent it if you are a fan of these fine actors, read the books, but I doubt you will wish to invest in a DVD copy for your library. Just a poor Silence of the Lambs or Manhunter (the original with William Peterson!!) both done much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"An edge of your seat, nail-biting, guessing game!","review":"I can't understand how anyone could not like this film. It is a great thriller that keeps your attention through the entire film! Ashley Judd gives in my opinion, the greatest performance of her entire career!

I recommend 'The Collector' made in 1965 directed by William Wyler as an absolute standout classic film in this genre.

I can only pray the new one is better. Kiss the Girls was incredibly predictable.

Kiss the Girls tried and failed to live up to the atmospheric thrillers of its type it was trying to immitate. It was indeed a very dark film, but at no time did I remotely feel tense or particulary interested in its outcome. Even the otherwise excellent Morgan Freeman failed to gave this film that extra edge it was so badly needing. Having said that there was little any cast could have done with a script straight from the textbook of Hollywood film writing combined with one of the most cliched endings I have ever seen, which went even further to undermine the rest of the film. Flawed on so many fronts it is hard to find a single redeeming feature and is definiteley one to avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly premise","review":"Sure, it's a fun movie, but it's best not to look too closely at the absurdity of it. We have here a serial killer who despite his 40 hour week still finds time to keep a dozen or so women inside his underground slave-brothel. Think about it. This chap doesn't even have a concierge on his staff let alone a maid or a chef. Thik of all the groceries he'd have to buy, the meals he'd have to prepare, the clothes he'd have to wash and the toilets he'd have to keep running. He may be a ruthless sex-villain but it's hard not to feel just a little sory for him. And speaking of toilets, there weren't any in the girls' cells. Nor was there any sign of baths or showers. The killer was supposed to be an admirer of Casanova but there was never any suggestion that Casanova liked his women filthy. No, this is a typical hollywood film that may stir the blood for a short while, but which is so poorly thought out that the viewer never really suspends disbelief and never forgets that it's only a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Thriller","review":"Based on the Novel by James Patterson the film is a great psychotic Thriller starring Morgan Freeman, Ashley Judd. Morgan Freeman is a cop who gets involved in the case because his niece is one of a number who have been abducted some of which have turned up dead some ofwhich are still missing.

I found it totally inappropriate for children and was shocked to see that it was rated G. It has many very dark scenes and a considerable amount of violence as well as several sexually suggestive scenes. I'm sure many of the kids had nightmares after watching it.

Good Supporting Cast including:Genevieve Bujold, Udo Kier, Bebe Neuwirth and Rob Schnieder. This was a Box Office Disappointment in Theaters but it did better on Video.

It just didn't look right. This is minor considering the overall quality of the story.I did enjoy this movie. It doesn't have content that you have to worry about little ones seeing.

The tray is helpful at catching some but it is very small and a custom fit to the dispenser, it does not help. I still end up with coffee on the counter. I thought this was going to be a wonderful (especially since it is non-electric)appliance. It turns out I waste way to much coffee. I have just written an email to the company to see if there is a fix for this extra leakage. So I'm not sure if this is common to all. Just know mine is worthless.

I would have perferred she stick to the Seaman's story rather than so much of her own.But if you like Ann Rule, you'll like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful and Fair","review":"The quality of Internal Combustion far exceeds that of 95% of true crime books out there. Ms. Maynard really did an outstanding job telling the story of Bob and Nancy Seaman. She definitely did her research, rather than filling the pages of her book with suppositions, and what came across most to me, was her effort to be fair in her analysis and presentation of this sad case. Ms. Maynard artfully intertwines the tragedy of the Seaman marriage with her own personal history, which makes for a thought provoking and insightful read. I really felt for Bob Seaman, it was so sad how he found this surrogate family who really seemed to love him for who he was, and that was something he never truly had with his own family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Women, cars, and the men who love them (the cars, that is)","review":"The car theme got me.

She loves the lamb in the movie and all the songs and dancing. She asks to watch it over and over again. I think it is a fabulous movie for both young and old! Sure Fern has changed, but throughout the years doesn't everyone change?

However, the drawings are a total departure from the simplicity of the original. That rough and innocent look in some ways demonstrates the delicate power of the original's script that made it so appealing and heartwarming. But there's enough warmth of the heart to go around in this one that most viewers shouldn't be disappointed.

Now it's theirs."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Stinks!!","review":"They take each character from the first movie and change them all together. Fern is not the sweet little girl that you knew. Wilbur is more like a wild animal than a sweet hearted, kind, loving pig. Charlotte's children, I think, could have a much, much better attitude. The illustrations were a big flop. The movie itself was a big flop. The new characters are very badly done. In each scene there is a new main character. Wilbur himself, the amazing star from the last movie is only the main character about twice. Charlotte's children and a new character really show up more times in the movie than Wilbur.

It could be that the adapter is not working, but I get a \\"memory stick error\\" message on my camera. If I had bought this from a local business I could take it in and show them how it doesn't work, but doing this long distance is a pain.

I know that Tom Hanks is very talented and Robert Zemeckis is an accomplished directer, but what were these two thinking. The only person I can half stand in this movie is Sally Field, who I like and respect as an actress, but even her character wears thin. As for this film winning the Academy Award, it is sad because both Little Women and Pulp Fiction were much better films. The Storyline of Forrest Gump is either one you accept or you loathe.

He has taken a serious and debilitating human condition and turned it into a cheap and tawdry satire. He has created the impression that people with this disability can achieve a level of functioning that is, through no fault of their own, impossible, and further eroded tolerance for these people by creating the impression that they do not achieve these impossible goals simply because they have no ambition or willingness to do so. If my children were still young you can bet they would not see this. Only Gary Sinise as Lt. Dan Taylor the Vietnam amputee turned alcoholic indicated any empathy with the human condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Represents all that is wrong with Hollywood","review":"Possibly the worst in a long list of terrible oscar winners where people voted for what made them feel good - regardless of content.

But, with a good shooting script and Tom Hanks (bless'im), I think I've watch this movie in it's entirety at least a dozen times, and will watch snatches of it on TV anytime it's on.Since then, I have read several of Winston Groom's Civil War books, and especially enjoy \\"Shrouds of Glory\\" about the Battle of Franklin (TN) and \\"Shiloh, 1862\\".

Not only do I wish I had never seen Forrest Gump, I wish there were some way I could not see it twice.This movie belongs in the section of Video World with Plan 9 from Outer Space, Robot Monster, and Sgt.

Maybe somewhere in the product description it should tell that it is not an actual box of chocolates, but rather a scratch and sniff card. How dumb is that? I thought I was sending a thoughtful gift and instead just looked stupid for thinking they were real. No where in the description does it say anything about the chocolates, and the title definitely leads a person to believe that they are actual chocolates. I paid twice as much thinking chocolates would be a nice addition for a gift. No such luck. Extremely disappointed with this order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Voice in the Wilderness","review":"I guess I'm the only person in the World who didn't like this movie. I am a huge movie fan and generally like Tom Hanks as an actor, but this film just didn't resonate with me. The idea that an individual who is apparently borderline mentally retarded can go on to become a war hero, great athlete, and all around success story seems quite far-fetched to me. Our world is becoming more competitive, not less. A person of his intelligence level would be unlikely to be successful in any one area, much less several. I'm sure this will sound insensitive to some, but it's true! I know this was meant to be a \\"feel-good\\" movie, but the storyline seemed trite and unbelievable, and the superimposition of the main character into scenes with famous people such as JFK seemed gimmicky."},{"rating":"1","title":"sucked so bad ...","review":"... come on baby this sucked so bad (sung to the tune of John Cougar's \\"hurt so good\\"). hollywood dragged out every corny stereotype and cliche for this most overrated film. and i've had enough of tom hanks getting paid $15 million per film to tell us how greedy and shallow we all are. give me a break.the only reason i gave it 2 stars was the splicing of actual footage from JFK, Nixon etc. and integrating them as part of the film which was funny at times. otherwise, \\"suck so bad ...\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets tiring.","review":"This film could have been good if parts of it were'nt so ridiculous.

If I could I'd give it 2 1/2 stars. It is hard to really like a movie when you can actually feel it trying to yank out your hearstrings like a Hollywood surgeon, though.

I am so glad it won an oscar. If you look really close before the movie's over the boy who played Little Forrest is Haley Joel Osment, the same actor who played in the Sixth Sense.

Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cinematic mess of a movie","review":"Forrest Gump can't decide whether it wants to be a comedy or drama, but it doesn't really matter, since it fails at both. A mentally challenged man (Gump) gets caught up in increasingly improbable situations throughout the 20th century. There's no real overall story arc.... just a bunch of random situations strung together. I didn't care about any of the characters at all; Gump doesn't evolve as a person, and goes through the movie spouting terrible one-liners. Most of the other characters are just jerks.I went into this movie with an open mind when it first came out, and boy was I disappointed. I honestly never saw what the appeal of this movie was, as I thought it was literally one of the worst movies of the '90's. The only bits I enjoyed were the scenes in Vietnam, and the special effects are pretty good. That's why I gave this two stars instead of one."},{"rating":"2","title":"CONSERVATIVE THEME","review":"\\"Forrest Gump\\" (1994), directed by USC alum Robert Zemeckis, was considered a fairly conservative film, featuring a breakout role by Tom Hanks.STEVEN TRAVERSAUTHOR OF \\"BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN\\"STWRITES@AOL.COM"},{"rating":"1","title":"A babyboomer's wet dream","review":"Forrest Gump was nothing more than an adult baby crib movie produced by a bunch of over-the-hill boomers who still have delerious todler memories of JFK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Tom......","review":"I'm giving this movie two stars because of the supporting actors, and, the book from which the movie is taken.

Sounds like you NEVER tried actually talking to someone from Alabama. If you really did...well, honeychil', accents just aren't your thing - don't do no more of 'em!They should have asked an English actor - they do spot on southern accents. Maybe, it's time for a re-make with Jude Law. Forrest was not a handsome man in the book, but, apparently, that doesn't transfer to the screen, so, get a hottie who can do an accent.

Not only is it offensive to cripples and the handicapped but it just isn't enterntaining! This movie distorts the history of our nation by placing a half witted dunce in some of our countries finest moments. Tom Hanks plays the role of a not so smart man pretty convincingly which makes you wonder. The one bright side to this boring film is the acting of Steven Griffith who plays the role of \\"Tex.\\" I think this film would have been more serious and convincing had Jim Carey played the role of Gump using his Dumb and Dumber character Lloyd Christmas. I do recommend the adult remake of this film \\"Forrest Hump.\\" 1 word \\"blahhhh!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"This movies like a box of feces","review":"The moral of the movie is, being a retard and not understanding life deeply is the key to success.

Not only is this \\"film\\" completely odious, you can't imagine how long and drawn out it is unless you've actually had to sit through it, which I don't recommend.

This is a true classic. In my opinion, it's Tom Hanks best movie ever! He even won the oscar for best actor. This is a very moving, heartwarming comedy-drama that takes you on an incredible adventure. Forrest Gump (Hanks) is often way too smart to be handicapped, and way too fast to be slow. How anybody could not like this movie is beyond me. This movie is an easy five stars. The acting, plot, script, characters, and everything is perfect and just plain enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great View of History","review":"Moving through history as it happened.

These are important parts of our history and many movies have been made about them just not depicted right.Forest Gump stars Tom Hanks who won an Academy Award for best Actor for his awsome acting skills as Forest. The historic events in this film made it interesting and a film that not only was for interainment but educational.

Forest Gump is the movie for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!!!","review":"Why does everyone love this movie? It must have been one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. The reason why I did not care for the movie at all was because it had no plot. There was no point to the movie at all. The film was just about this nerdy guy running around and getting beat up on by bullies, while being felt sorry for by everyone else.

The film's normal soundtrack is there, but when the rock music is supposed to kick in (Vietnam for instance), you hear about half a second then silence. I have to say that it totally ruined the film for me and my wife, as this was such an integral part of the emotions that this film can evoke. I do have this film on normal DVD and I compared the two, just to be sure. I will be returning this copy to Amazon, and will let you know what the outcome is.

Forrest over comes challenge after challenge and shows such grace to others it is hard not to completely love him. Hanks showed that he is one of the greatest actors ever to hit the screen in this movie by portraying Gump in such a way that the viewer loves him and knows him but never feels pity for him even though his circumstances may seem to warrant it.Gump gives us a vision of true loyalty in friendship, he is patient, kind, doesn't hold grudges (doesn't keep accounting of wrongs suffered), he believes all things and hopes in all things. This movie is very enlightening and a true pleasure to watch.It is fun to watch, it is entertaining, it is a good family movie (older kids) and it is definitely a \\"thinking movie\\" and a challenge to how we all live.

In this role, he disappears as Tom Hanks and becomes Forrest Gump. And when a great actor does that--watch out!! In some of Hanks' movies, he overshadows the movie and you are aware of Tom Hanks playing a role. (I think this happened with some of Meryl Streeps movies.)But not in this one. He is pure Forrest.The supporting roles are very engaging also and are well-acted: I loved Sally Fields' mother--Sally never misses the right ambience, tone of voice, etc. She nails the mother. And Bubba, I will never forget the scenes during which he is listing every shrimp recipe in the world--especially the one where they are cleaning the floor with toothbrushes. Jenny is also spot on. She got each decade just right. And Gary Sinise screaming his lungs out at God during the hurricane--great scene.I rank this as one of the top ten movies ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Beautifully Done","review":"A beautiful movie about the story of Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks), a simpleminded yet strangely wise gentle man, and his journey through growing up in a small town in Alabama in the 1950's, as a football hero at college and soldier in Vietnam in the 1960's , a table tennis champion, shrimp boat captain, company director , and cross country runner in the 1970's , the movie takes us through these wonderful times , and Gump's wonderful relations with all who he comes into contact with , especially his mother (Sally Fields) , his childhood sweetheart Jenny Curren (Robin Wright) , his army buddy Bubba (Mykelti Williamson) and his other army buddy Lt Dan Taylor (Gary Sinise).Filled with tragedy and triumph, Gump also meets Elvis Presley, John F Kennedy, George Wallace, John Lennon and Richard Nixon.It is a movie about the triumph of the human spirit-most beautifully done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forrest, Forrest Gump","review":"How could anyone not like this movie?

I felt as though I should have been reimbursed for the time I wasted watching it. I was very offended by the mere premise of this \\"film.\\" Don't question authority and try not to think too much. Just go through life in a haze and you'll achieve more than the guy who spent his life learning and working hard. Forrest Gump was such a half-wit he barely knew he was alive. Everything was made light of in this movie. Everyone who ever worked hard to accomplish anything was viewed as a joke and worst of all I couldn't figure out if this was a comedy, drama, or parody. It failed on all fronts. It was basically a big nothing. As a lover of movies, I must issue this warning: Stay away from Forrest Gump. Life is just too short to waste watching [a movie] like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't buy it for a minute","review":"I was about to begin this review with the statement that I don't understand why this film inspires such intense adulation - but unfortunately, I understand all too well. Mediocrity and cheap sentimentality has always sold well in America; a \\"feel-good\\" movie wins the audience every time.But what are you \\"feeling good\\" ABOUT...?This movie sells the premise, \\"It's DESIRABLE to be mentally deficient.\\"There is NOTHING desirable about being mentally challenged.I think this film could be called subversive, perhaps even dangerous, in its glorification of simple-minded \\"innocence\\" over rational, thoughtful consideration of what's going on in the society around you. This film makes light of many serious events in America's history for the sake of some \\"gee-whiz\\" special effects.Come to think of it, it's probably the PERFECT movie for the G. W. Bush era.Definitely NOT entertainment for any thinking, rational person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure vomit.","review":"The first time I saw this movie, I was privilaged to have seen it for free. Thank God. It was the most insipid tripe ever put on screen. Despite having paid nothing to see it, I was non-the-less sorry to have wasted my eyesight on this piece of retard-O dung. It was little more than a trivial carnival ride through the 60's, 70', and 80's, that served only to assure a bunch of jerk-off baby boomers that they were the only generation who ever existed. What a waste. Steer clear of this box of chocolates... you might wind up with a rude surprise."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANOTHER OVERRATED FILM!!!","review":"The moviegoing public must have turned off their brains when they watched this mindless and stupid piece of contamination. Surprisingly, all the characters act meaningless and they were awfully acting. Plus, the special effects blending famous scenes from the past is just a distraction to keep away the viewer from realizing the filth of this overrated film that will remain, in my opinion, one of the worst films trying to be sympathetic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It Stinks!","review":"The movie is fast paced and pretty entertaining. However, as a form of art, I thought the movie really [wasn't]. Tom Hanks does a superb job of acting stupid and the movie doesn't seem to have any real message. The real problem is that the Forest Gump character is very annoying and once you notice this, the movie really starts to have a grating sensation (fingernails on a chalkboard type stuff)."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best!","review":"Forrest Gump is indeed one of the best movie I've seen. It had taught me so much about life, how to treasure it and not take it for granted. The cast, script, and special effects were all wonderful. This had to be Tom Hank's best performance, I just could not c anyone better than him in this role. I love this movie, I saw it over six times, and I still and will always love the movie. Please take a chance to see this movie if u haven't yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie, but gets old","review":"Maybe I've just seen this movie too many times, but it seems very long. I love it, don't get me wrong, but it can only be bearable for so long. You end up wanting to strangle Jenny, until she gets AIDS, that is. Forrest is the only really likable character, because of his innocence. The director did a really great job of touching base on a lot of really impacting events of the 20th century. A good movie to watch if you're feeling patriotic. I really liked how they weaved Forrest into the history of the shaping of modern America. Vietnam, the \\"*beep* happens\\" bumper sticker, the smiley face logo, John Lennon, John F. Kennedy, Elvis, the hippy generation, etc. As I said, this is a really well done movie with great acting, but it seems very long."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love it","review":"but one thing i find wrong with this film....it does seem to linger, or feel too long. no matter how many times i watch it, after he goes on the run across america, i tend to tune out from there to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forrest Goofball","review":"I don't want to slam this movie, but I just don't understand why so many people like goofy, cute stories like Forrest Gump. It was so far-fetched for me that I never watched it again. It was not quite as bad as The Terminal.Like the reviewer below me said, this movie beat out The Shawshank Redemption at the Oscars. Unbelievable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Film I have seen in a very long time!","review":"When I want to show my students a film about the 1950's to the 1980's in America, here is where I go. That and I want to show them that strange as it may seem to them, doing the right thing does pay off in the end. I would be not surprised if this film is shown as the quintessential film about America in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mobster Reference Book","review":"So far many of the names I've been reading in the newspapers are coming to life in this fun read! Just enough mayhem to wet your appetite for more! The format makes it easy to read and pick back up and I find myself using it as a reference book at this point as I'm going through various newspaper articles. I'm still in the process but am learning quite a bit about mobsters outside of the Chicago area. Must have for those getting started like myself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No depth at all.","review":"This is just facts tossed between covers, that's all it is.

No depth at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Gangster Guide","review":"Anybody with the slightest interest in the gangsters from the 1920's -1930's will dig this book. The authors run the criminal gamut; if he or she was a bank robber, kidnapper, bootlegger, Mafiosi whatever, they are in here. Anyone new to this genre can benefit greatly from the Almanac.

I highly recommend this CD for anyone who desires to go to \\"Another Level\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"I just had to write a review and say that this CD did take me to another level in praising and worshipping the Lord. This is one of those CD's where you can tell that Israel has an intimacy with Christ and he has not held back how he honors the Lord with his gift of music. Also, I was privileged to be at a Worship & the Word Conference with my former church where Israel did not only minister in concert but he spent time teaching us how to worship the Lord. Israel I would like to thank you for that. I love how Israel & New Breed allowed the Holy Spirit to breathe on this project but most of all on their hearts. For those of you that buy this CD your level of worship and desire for greater intimacy with Christ will deepen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A total worship experience anywhere you go","review":"I love this cd. I purchased this along with 5 others and I must say I listen to this more than any other one. Especially disc 2 Friend of God, Friend, Here I am to Worship...these songs are just awesome.

You can really feel the presence of the Lord listening to their voices.This CD literally takes me to Another Level."},{"rating":"2","title":"GET YOURSELF TOGETHA","review":"If you are a member of the Impact Movement I know that you are making some noise over this CD. I heard Isreal in concert last month at our annual conference and I was SO BLESSED. I literally had to step away from the crowd and get on my knees and then on my face just talk to God (okay it was more like loud sobs, but God understood).

Great plot and great European setting. Also look into Siberia and Siberia II."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little outdated, but still worth getting","review":"For the price, this is definitely a game set worth considering. Both games are quite good, although definitely the second is the one that makes this buy worthwhile. The first game is definitely a bit ancient in terms of graphics and gameplay.But Gabriel Knight 2...wow, what a game. I played it twice, something I never do with adventure games. But this one was SO well written and conceived, and it was recognized by many folks as a Game of the Year. It truly does immerse you in the story, and some of the final movie sequences are superbly done. Great locations, great plot, definitely a game you HAVE to play if you haven't already."},{"rating":"1","title":"ARE YOU KIDDING","review":"Is this a misprint ??? 88 bucks for a little 1/2gallon bowl?? This cant be right... must be wrong in ad"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay quality for price, but not as pictured.","review":"While the bowl I received served the purpose it was intended for (serving gummy fish at my daughter's party), it looks completely different than the pictures in the listing. It is flat on the bottom and on the side so it can sit upright and at an angle. Which was fine, luckily, but it would have been a problem had it been intended for actual fish or something that I wanted the bowl to look symmetrical. The bowl itself is decent quality for the price, and had a plastic lid, which came in handy keeping our candy fresh. But again - was expecting something different. So just be aware, the product I received does not look anything like the bowl pictured and you may get the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"super cheap, a bucket is a better investment","review":"These fish bowls are so flimsy, you're better off just getting a large mason jar.

I read the Painted Bird a long time ago, and I loved it. Being There was pretty good also, although, I found the movie better. But Blind Date - it feels like I read a different book than all other reviewers.\\"Erotically charged?\\" - only if you find incest (with own mother, no less) and rape erotic. \\"Idea man, [...] international playboy?\\" - I found Levanter rather dull.I have to admit that I find Kosinski's language mesmerizing in its simplicity, but, combined with this unemotional narration, it did not work for me in Blind Date. This novel, just like the Steps, is told in vignettes. This concept never really appealed to me. This time it felt like an easy excuse to... perhaps not having much to say?I don't see much redeeming value here. Blind Date alternates between being gratuitously shocking, and boring. At this point, I'm not sure I want to read more by Kosinski..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eastside Shiz","review":"This album reps for real.

The other tracks are very good or near classics. I don't rate intros but I loved the intro. My only gripe was the female hook in Nas is coming, sounded very out of place, as did Dre at the beggining although it brought a grin to my face. It's too bad Dre didn't have even a tighter beat.This is a slept on classic by most. Probably Nas's second or third best album depending on your view."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is when Nas started to leave the streetrz","review":"This album is still the real nas, but he sampled a guitar for the message, and Pac's \\"All eyez on me\\" for \\"Street Dreams\\", but don't get me wrong, he's still a great lyricis in this album, but so-so, and sampled beats are not what I had in mind. If I ruled the world, is the best Nas song to date. But then when I brought this, I was thinking, I didn't pay 18 bux jes 2 hear 1 good song. Then I started to listen to this for the lyrics, then it grew on me, just like that. If u wanna hear Nas at his best, I recomend Illmatic, this, Stillmatic, and God's son."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nas is Stillmatic","review":"This is the best of the 5 nas cd's.

Buy this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nas's Best","review":"Illmatic is widely considered to be Nas's album, and it is definitely an excellent album. However, as sacreligious as this view may be, I find It was written to be more enjoyable to listen to and therefore better. Illmatic is a very serious album. Nas is anxious to convey his views of the world and he does but he lets very little humor or excitement seep into the album. It was written on the other hands seems to have more pep. The Beats are done by big producers like Dr Dre and the songs feature more guests, such as Jodeci on Black Girl Lost, and Lauryn Hill on If I ruled the World. I also think that this album contains Nas's three best songs. Street Dreams, If I ruled the world, and the mind blowing I Gave you power, perhaps the best extended metaphor in a rap song that I have ever heard as well as the best rap song about guns."},{"rating":"2","title":"nasty nas","review":"now im a fan of NaS and i love him (ask my boyfriend) this is one of my favorite albums by him. his lastest has to be my all time favorite i could listen to that album front to back. he's a true emcee. he has pure talent. i've been a fan for years and i think he fell of with nastradamus but everyone has at least one album that aint their best"},{"rating":"2","title":"His second best album","review":"2 me,It was written is better than illmatic.Stillmactic to me flows to his best,but it was written is nas's second.It was written is a 5.star Masterpiece.It includes tracks like \\"The Message\\"(His lyrical Classic),\\"Street Dreams\\"(a sample from 2pac and the movie CASINO), and the well known hit \\"If i rule the world\\".I just got this yesterdsay and The album I AM....

The best tracks are The Message, Shootouts, If I Ruled the World"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nas shows potential","review":"Nas has some pretty strong music on this album Th first 7 cut ar good, highlighted by the best Nas song of all time:Take it in Blood (#6). Songs like Blood,Watch dem Niggas, street Dreams, the Message, If I Ruled the World are the perfect example of how untouchable Nas is with decent production.

I was shocked that all these great acts came from Dallas, a city I grew up in and always thought was stupendously dull. Anyway, there is a great mix of stuff on here. The Vibrolux song is incredible, and I'm still sad I've never been able to find any of their albums in print. The Old 97's W.I.F.E. is hilarious, especially considering they must have been about 17 when they wrote and sang it. The Fuzz songs are supremely idiotic--who the hell are these guys--they are nuts! The Cowboys and Indian's cover of Hank Williams Roly Poly is great (a song I now sing to my son). The old blues guy singing about his mother is amazing... check out his story. Brave Combo is amazing. The music is very diverse, so the tracks don't really mesh with each other necessarily, but everything on here is excellent. I wish this CD packaging had become an annual tradition."},{"rating":"2","title":"From the era when psychology didn't have ethics","review":"This book is interesting. I bought it at a used book store when I was a child. The binding they use is awful, so it fell apart within a year or two. Talk about risque. The book includes pictures of experiments with monkeys involving cutting off the top of their skull and replacing it with translucent material to see their brains and fear of heights experiments that place babies on glass ceilings (the caption reads the mother of the baby removed him/her from the experiment when she found out precisely what was involved). This was the era of government-sponsored LSD experiments, so pictures and information on that are included as well. It's definitely worth having this book around for the conversations it would invoke, even though the experiments were ethically wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"Not good paint.

I had played this game before, but it had been a few years and sometimes I like things better the second time I play them - but this particular Nancy Drew wasn't worth my time or my money. I feel like the programmers had a great story and the first half of the game was okay, but then it just ended, like they were on a deadline so they just slapped the last part together. The characters were not likeable, the puzzles WAY too easy even on Senior detective.

Is the trouble related to the orphaned orca whale roaming the nearby channel, or is there a deeper threat shrouded in the approaching fog? Meaningful messages or fookish flotsam? Floating bottles lead Nancy Drew on a kayak cruise through a dangerous sea cave maze. Roving sea monsters, hidden valuables, midnight smugglers and shanghaied pioneers: Nancy must glean facts from fish tales. Local tempers boil at the Hot Kettle Cafe. Is a vandalized whale-watching boat a random act or is there deeper trouble to be dredged?:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahem...","review":"I loved this Nancy Drew game, I Have played all of them and I found this to be one of the best. However, the drawback is that it requires a fast, modern computer, so it will not work for many people, also it takes up a lot of memory...As well as being one of the best games, it's also one of the hardest, in my opion. Theres a part of the game when you have to collect a certain amont of clams is a part I often get stuck on. Also, you can go ciaching, and you may get lost. Lastly, you can get food poisoning (allways fun to get her sick)if you make a gross sandwhich, I like the Nancy Drew games where you can eat :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"There is No 'Deception' About This Game!!!","review":"Wow! When we bought \\"The Haunted Carousel,\\" we had very high expectations considering the previous games. We were, however, very dissapointed when we finished in less than one day, were shocked by easy puzzles, and were bored by unchallenging conflicts. We were very leary when \\"Danger on Deception Island\\" came out, but we gave it a chance.We were thrilled by this game!!! The graphics and sound effects were awesome! The puzzles were challenging, but after a lot of thought, you could solve them. This game, #9 in the series, was the best by far. The plot twisted constantly, making it impossible to detect the 'culprit' before the end of the game.

Danger on Deception Island is great and fun with tons of \\"seaworthy\\" suprises.In the game there is an orphan killer whale who swam into the San Juan Islands in Washington. You are staying with a marine biologist named Katie. She wanted the whale to be tested in a lab, but the other suspects on the island want it to return to it's pod.

My daughter likes to pick which color she is going to use each night, and it almost turns something you think will be horrible into a game.

The other earplugs didn't help much and would keep popping out during bath time. Those that stayed in longer were also more painful to put in. These, however, worked incredibly well. The putty is soft, yet firm enough, to stay in place without getting lodged in his ear canal. Due to the softness, the material forms a perfect seal and does not let water in. The best part is that these can be reused over and over again (just be sure to rinse them out after each use) and do not harden or lose their ability to stay in place. They work even in the swimming pool. The only \\"problem\\" I've had is that the bright colors attract his 1 year old sister and she wants to keep pulling them out of his ear. :)Would strongly recommend these for anyone who's looking for effective earplugs for their children.

Crisp production and great vocals from Sir Cliff (yes, he's been knighted...are there any British rock singers left who HAVEN'T been?) are the highlights of this set of amiable pop-rock. Richard does some interesting covers, most notably Wreckless Eric's \\"Broken Doll\\". Most people (outside of England that is) probably associate Cliff Richard mostly with his pompadoured, early 60's teen idol period, so it is good to see this worthy era of Richard's work getting the re-appraisal and remastering treatment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cliff Richard Does It Again !","review":"Wired For Sound is great !

The high point in the film was the actual construction of the robot, everything before and after was a total waste of money and time. What were Kirk Douglas and Farrah Fawcett getting paid to do other than taking showers and rolling around naked with each other? Surely they were there for a reason but what, they never did any work at all and as far as the special effects I've seen better shadow puppets for an eclipse than the one in this film. Harvey Keitel was a very convincing horn ball that's about it; I think his mission was to get laid by Farrah.

The plot, or more-so, the arrangment of Kirk Douglas in a ridiculous role, takes place on Sheba, a moon of Saturn where there is a really old horny guy (Douglas), over the top as ever and his young sex slave (Facett), who does numerous nude scenes. This is so painful to watch because there is absolutely no chemistry between the two. Add a lousy Kietal in the \\"mad scientist\\" role and this goes even further into the stink pit.

The premise is not bad (two scientists working on a remote planet to save the world's food shortage peaceful existance is shattered by the arrival of a killer and his pyschotic robot) but there is no build up or character development at all. Harvey Keitel and Kirk Douglas are capable actors but one wouldnt say so from this drivel (Keitels voice is dubbed to add insult to injury) and Farrah...well...there is no hint here of the excellent character actress she would later become...but to be fair maybe she was only as good as the material she was given."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am guilty once again","review":"AS I HAVE STATED BEFORE:If you like campy Science Fiction as I do than this film is for you.There is not a lot to say about film like this because it is not actually any good at all.

However, if you listen to the CD version be prepared. C.J. Critt gave believable and fun voices to the characters, especially Grandma Mazur. Lorelei King's version is bland and distinctly lacking in character, giving, for example, Grandma Mazur an old-lady, creaky voice. The rest of King's characterizations are not much better.This isn't the only time I've had trouble with King's voice. Several other books were discarded because her voice was too grating.From now on, if the only audio version I can get has Lorelei King, I'll read the book instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the norm but fun none the less.","review":"This is not the usual Evanovich mystery novel but is still fun reading.

Isn't Christmas meant for children anyway?There is still the regular Plum mishaps, another car bites the dust, with Stephanie taking the hit with more grace and patience.If you are looking for some light hearted fun while your significant other is watching football games this is the book for you!

Character development is going nowhere, plot/mystery is thin to non-exisistent - I feel the stories are getting by on humor, and that's it. While funny, the book ultimately doesn't deliver what I read books to experience.

Bodily harm from Elves, the incinaration of yet another vehicle and the general mayhem created by Stephanie's dysfunctional family amuse and entertain the reader. The sexual tension is not as rampant in this story as in some of the others.

When the \\"hero\\" is a guy named Diesel, and there's also a Sandy Claws, I should have listened to my inner voice and skipped this one.

Her other books are great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Visions of Sugar Plums","review":"Sooo disappointed in this book. When I read Hard Eight, and was disappointed, not only in the length--what was it, about 50,000 words?--but the with plot too, I had hoped that maybe Ms. Evanovich had expended her energy on creating a Christmas classic with the zany Plum characters. Not so. I love the Plum series, and buy the hardcovers the day they are released. I strongly recommend this series to anyone who loves humor. Plus, I'd planned on buying this book as Christmas gifts for friends too cheap to shell out for the hardcover. Guess what? I'm saving my money and hope book nine is redeeming. I think Janet needs to quit the publicity tours and get back to writing the characters and the stories we all expect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have waited for the paperback!","review":"I can't believe this book was published in hardcover!

I love the Stephanie Plum \\"number\\" series - One for the Money, Two for the Dough, etc. However, this book was very disappointing. I kept waiting for Stephaie to wake up from \\"the dream\\". Not really believing that the author was really wanting us to buy into this \\"drop dead gorgeous guy appearing out of nowhere with super powers\\" story line. Janet Evanovich you should be ashamed yourself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Sugar Plum.","review":"I felt cheated, a short unbelievable story, not like Janet Evanovich's other Plum books, an Alien who breaks locks, Elves who bad mouth and fight,a man with electric fingers????????? No, No, lets get back to real life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"This book seemed hastily thrown together to make it onto the shelves for the holidays. The plot was thin, the characters undeveloped and the premise was simply stupid. I have loved the other Stephanie Plum books and wish that I hadn't read this one. I hope that \\"Nine will be noteworthy\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I was very disappointed in this novella. It seems the author was just trying to get something out fast to appease us Plum fans. I would rather wait and read something of substance. I only laughed out loud once which is a bad thing when reading a Stephanie Plum book. The fantasy part was hard to swallow, and I sincerely hope that Ms.Evanovich doesn't plan to include it in forthcoming novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"XMEN or a Plum novel ??","review":"I was actually very dissapointed by this book. Evanovich is an amazing fiction/comedy writer...Sci/Fi...lets be honest..she is not. Im sure this was meant to be a break from the mold...a treat to her readers...but it left me sitting there giving one of Stephanie's famed \\"eye rolls\\". It felt rushed, and it just wasnt a good story...yes some laughs were there...but too short of a story, To XMEN like (maybe she had just watched the movie). I have loved all of her other books, and thought they were well written and maybe thats why I felt that this one fell short."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the other Stephanie Plum novels","review":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE the Stephanie Plum novels.I LOVE Ranger and Morelli (don't we all wish we had our own?).I didn't like this one as much.

The main characters in this one were so unreal and it took away from the book.I did enjoy it, though.I can't wait for 10 to come out."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOO... this book sucks","review":"This is a total waste of money, if you are a fan of the series, then save your money. I don't see the point of this book, the plot is totally unreal. I purchased this book because I am a fan, if I would have known it was a fairy-tale, I would have left it at the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shockingly bad.","review":"I love the Plum series and have never given any book of the series less than 5 stars...until now. The plot of this book is too incredible to be even remotely believable. The supernatural twist doesn't fit in with the other books in the series. Where are Ranger and Morelli? How can you have a decent Plum book without them? Read this so you are up to date for the 9th book but expect to be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expect more from Janet E.","review":"Now I know Janet's books are fiction, but at least she made you feel like you knew the characters. However this Diesel guy was not believable at all! Janet was rather vague about who he was and from where he came, so there wasn't any character development.The story was too short and too far-fetched. I hope she won't do this to us again because I really like the Stephanie Plum books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Visions of Sugar Plums","review":"I can't believe Janet wrote this story with a right mind!I love all her other Plum novels, but this was too weird and I regret asking for this book as a Christmas present.

What a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Say it ain't so, Stephanie","review":"I listen to BOTs while walking, and the Plum series has motiviated me to walk more than any other. As you can probably surmise based on what other reviewers have said, I didn't get much walking done this holiday season, because the story line didn't keep my interest. I also REALLY MISS the Jersey accent of the earlier readers...this one's voice was as bland as the plot. However, every other book in the series has been terrific, so I will not give up and am looking forward to \\"nine\\" and hopefully Ranger and LuLu will be back and Joe won't be out on a job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book.","review":"If you like the Plum series . . . don't buy this book.

It effectively means the end of the series for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I was disappointed in Janet's Hard Eight but nothing compared with the disappointment in this book.

I love the other books but this one was done purely for the money without any regard for plot or readers. BORING and not worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"why was this published?","review":"I have given up reading the Stephanie Plum mysteries because they are the same every time. Same jokes, same story line, same dumb blonde. I own this book because a friend thought it would be a good read and so she gave it to me (a year ago). I took it out of my \\"books to get rid of\\" box and read it in about 2 hours. The plot is thin (so thin it is nearly invisible), the writing is sloppy, the jokes are the same (grandma's missing teeth, her \\"studmuffins,\\" Stephanie's car blows up, etc.), and it really is the bottom of the barrel in this genre. If you want to read a good story with genuine humor and a solid plot, read Elizabeth Peters or Barbara Michaels. Stephanie Plum is overdone, overexposed, and has overstayed her welcome.Kris, a reader who prefers well-written books even when reading just for fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Visions of Sugar Plums","review":"Not the usual Evanovich quality. Too much fantasy. No enough of Granny. Too, too, too short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I didn't pay for it.","review":"I checked this one out of the library, because there is no way I'd ever buy a book in the Plum series that didn't have Ranger in it. Thank goodness I lost no money on this one, because it was horrible. I forced myself to finish it in case it redeemed itself at any point, but it did not. I could not get into the new character, the plot was ridiculous, and Ranger's absence took away all the glorious tension that holds the other novels in this series together. I can only hope JE reads these reviews and realizes that she needs to go back to her successful formula for the next novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Janet, Janet, Janet","review":"I was disappointed in this novella having read the entire series of Plum books. No Ranger, Hardly any Morelli and some guy named Diesel who \\"pops in and out\\". The story was not believable and the wedding at the end was ridiculous.Janet, Janet Janet-Please keep Stephanie and the characters that surround her more convincing."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was ok....well... not really!","review":"This book was ok, kind of Christmassy for the holidays, but it's not the best, and doesn't fit in with the series.But the truth is, I just pretend it is not part of the series because it had a slight supernatural edge to it. And common! What is the author thinking? This is Stephanie Plum, the bounty hunter, why in the world would there be magic, in this fictional real world? Also, Ranger, one of the hotties, and main characters of the series was out of town, and wasn't in the book at all. Now, what kind of PLUM book is without Ranger? Definitely not my favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Visions of Sugar Plums","review":"It didn't completely make sense to me, I didn't think the ending was at all satisfying and didn't resolve any of the questions in the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Visions of Sugar Plums","review":"The book was typical Evanovich. It was enjoyable from start to finish. The book was difficult to put down. If you're a Janet Evanovich fan, I would certainly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Imaginative Christmas Tale!","review":"This Evanovich book is a detour through the holidays that one may take to escape the pressures of the season. The usual characters from the series of mysteries show up for this amusing, if highly unlikely, Christmas tale. Reading this book will feel like \\"home\\" for Evanovich fans, but do not expect the thrills and chills and depth of story line that readers usually enjoy in Stephanie Plum books. This is a \\"twinkle\\" of a book, just right for a light weight read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Visions of Sugar Plums","review":"got this as gift i have pick up alot of these books for a family member who loves janet evanovich books and the prices are better then the stores so i pick them up online for this person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the read, you aren't missing anything","review":"To start, I am a huge Stephanie fan. I have all of the books from the numbered series in paperback and read them over and over again. But, after reading \\"Visions\\", I have not and will not read it again. I found the character of Diesel very silly and I'm glad he is not in any of the books in the regular series. The whole fantasy aspect of the book made it hard to read. \\"To The Nines\\" takes up several months after \\"Hard Eight\\" leaves and Janet lets you know some of what happens in between, excluding any reference to Diesel. You learn Valerie becomes pregnant after \\"Hard Eight\\" like she did in \\"Visions\\". Because of how awful \\"Visions\\" was, I didn't bother to read \\"Plum Loving\\" or \\"Plum Lucky\\" and wouldn't read the new \\"Wicked Appetite\\" if you gave it to me for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best Stephanie Plum","review":"This has probably been my least favorite Stephanie Plum book. I think it is because it falls a bit too far out of the realm of possibility for me. I love Stephanie Plum because I can picture myself getting into the same situations and for the same reasons she finds herself. But this was a little too unrealistic for my taste.I know... it's fiction... but still."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, I didn't hate it.","review":"This doesn't pack the punch of her other Stephanie Plum offerings but hey, it's the holidays and I'm feeling generous. It is short, and like other reviewers stated, there is very little Joe and no Ranger. But if you don't have a lot of time and you need a quick Stephanie fix this isn't bad. It reads more like a magazine short story but I love Stephanie so I guess that makes me Plum crazy."},{"rating":"1","title":"An eggnog hangover","review":"I love Stephanie Plum and am quite fond of good fantasy. However the two do not mesh well. Who is Sandy Claws? We never do find out. Who is Ring? What is Diesel? Do we care? This plot does not allow a willing suspension of disbelief. Please borrow this book from the library. You will hate yourself in the morning if you pay full price for what is essentially a short story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Picking the petals from Plum","review":"Visions Of Sugar Plums was a disappointment. With all the supernatural and comic book characters now appearing in books and movies Evanovich tried to join in with her characteristic protagonist, Stephanie Plum. The usual plot lines of an FTA, the ruined car, and Plum herself with her disorganization meets a new man with abnormal abilities. Plum runs through her erotic arousal theme, her boy friend appears briefly, locks click, lightning flares, family meals occur and everything works out at the meal, there is little suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dud in the Plum series","review":"I love the Stephanie Plum series but this was a dud. Normally I can finish one of the series in a day, but I couldn't even make it through half of this novella. I'm going to try again someday, but I'd say, just move on to the next book...You'll be much more satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the read","review":"I love Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series. Unfortunately, this book was a trite attempt to create a holiday novel with little substance, humor or plot. Yes, the Stephanie Plum books follow a certain formula, but in this case, Evanovich took the \\"Hamburger Helper\\" approach to the book, cut a lot of corners and came up with a real bomb. Pass it by...there are so many better Evanovich books to read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"While this book was amusing it was a total price rip off. The story left you wondering what it was about and never really made much sense. I do not recommend it. I was very disappointed as I was very much looking forward to her next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par - don't waste your money!!!","review":"Obviously, I don't mind silly since I usually enjoy the Stephanie Plum books - but this thing is just awful. It's the usual nonsense for a while (cars burning up, etc.), which is fine - but the book suddenly ends! No wrap-up, no explanation (ok, it's a nonsense book, but c'mon!). I was totally shocked when all of a sudden it just stopped dead. Don't waste your time on this, you'll just end up saying \\"huh???\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Your Usual Stephanie","review":"Visions of Sugar Plums finds Stephanie in search of Sandy Claws, an elderly man who runs a toy shop. Sounds simple enough, right? Enter Diesel, a mysterious man who \\"pops\\" into Stephanie's kitchen. With his help Stephanie is on the case to find Sandy. Oh, did I mention Sandy has workers in his toy shop? And they're elves???This book was a major disappointment. A big fan of the Stephanie Plum series I found this book to be boring. It didn't have all the usual characters and the ones that did make an appearance were in the book such a short time. This book seemed to be written in a hurry and not well created. I was in a hurry for it to be over so I could read something else. I kept hoping that it would get better but that just didn't happen.I would recommend skipping this Stephanie novel. It is a waste of time. Not worth buying or spending the time reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Visions of getting back to better writing..........","review":"This was a very sad effort from Janet. A wee bit too much egg nog while writing this one? The whole Diesel fantasy character was a bit over the top.

I started on book 9 the other day and then realized that I had apparently missed some stuff that happened at Christmas. After a quick search I found this as the \\"in-between\\" 8 and 9 book. I wish I hadn't. I downloaded it to my kindle and read through it quickly. It was a very short read and I supposed that is something to be glad about. The story was terrible. It was completely far-fetched and unbelievable. I wouldn't even consider it a part of the same series if the main characters hadn't all been the same. Definitely NOT a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"I have fallen in love with the Stephanie Plum series. I have quickly read through the first 8 books in a period of a month and saw this was sort of in between eight and nine. I bought it (I wish I hadn't) and quickly realized this was a fluff piece for Janet Evanovich. Storyline is unbelievable and new characters are knock-offs of old ones. This has nothing to do with the series and you won't miss anything so I recommend to save your money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy this book","review":"I loved all the number books, this one however was terrible. it is not worth the paper it is printed on. there is no substance. i think she wrote this in one day just to get a book out.you will be horribly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check it out of the library!","review":"I loved every one of the 1-8 of the Stephanie Plum series and eagerly await #9. However, this Christmas novelette needed much more editing! It seemed to me that her editor decided - oh, about July-ish - that a Christmas Plum novel would be great to put out. Heck - it has a catchy title all ready! However, the novel is not fleshed out at all - both the storyline and the characters are weak. Janet Evanovich is capable of so much more.All in all, definitely not worth the price tag, but a quick and brainless read if you can get it at your library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to keep reading","review":"I am a big fan of Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum but this book is nothing like her other books. This cannot even be called another book in the series. It lacks creativity and an attention keeping plot. We never really learn who Sandy Claws is and we really don't care by the end of the book. Stephanie has the usual car fires and explosions but they were just plain boring. The absences of Ranger and the minimal appearance of Joe Morelli were lackluster. The spark just wasn't there in this installment. I do look forward to another one of her \\"real books\\". As I read this one, I kept thinking that someone wanted to try to cash in on the holiday and the success others have had with books like Skipping Christmas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too short","review":"Love Janet Evanovich AND Stephanie Plum, but it's grossly misleading to call this a new book in the series. One reviewer called it an extended short story, but I wouldn't even qualify it as that.It's too short, has no real plot and doesn't advance anything from previous books. And the whole superhero/seperate dimension thing doesn't belong in this series.I'd rather Evanovich spend her time writing the next real Plum book than wasting time on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"This is a short story, with a silly plot that involves a character who is \\"some sort of superman type\\" with non human powers. Pu-lease! It wasn't even funny, it just was dumb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing quicky!","review":"As a huge fan of the Stephanie Plum series, I was really excited to see this new Evanovich book, 'Visions of Sugar Plums'. The title alone had me anxious to read it!Not only is it a \\"quicky\\" read, but a disappointing one. To me, this was easy way to throw a new book out on the market before the holidays to make some money. Evanovich may get the dough, but you do not get what you pay for with this book.Bring back Ranger, add more Morrelli and lose the 'alien' Diesel. I would not recommend this book, but will be on the lookout for new JE books in the future. I just hope there are no more attempts at a sexy sci-fi!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eagerly awaited, but disappointing","review":"It's not often that I run to the bookstore and pay top dollar for a hardback, but I always make an exception for Janet Evanovich, who is one of my absolute favorites. This time, however, she is off the mark with a story that just never takes off and makes little sense. This new character, Diesel, is one dimensional and takes page time away from all of our favorites. Ranger is nowhere to be found and Morelli is too far in the background. I found it hard to care about the plot which was convoluted and, frankly, I didn't get it at all. I will look forward to the next Plum novel, though, #9. Janet, please don't fail me now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, but overpriced","review":"Stephanie's having a hard time working up some holiday spirit, and it doesn't help when a stranger mysteriously appears in her apartment and her unmarried sister discovers she's pregnant. Add in the continuing adventures of Grandma Mazur, a paint thief who's skipped bail, and a few rampaging elves and she's ready to run. It's a great Christmas romp, Plum style.If you're not a fan, you'll want to start with one of the other books, since a lot of characters appear in this book with very little introduction, and you might be a bit confused about who exactly these dysfunctional people are.My only real complaint is that at 14$, it's a bit pricy for what you get."},{"rating":"2","title":"short and sweet!","review":"I enjoyed it.

I like the Stephanie Plum books a lot and eagerly awaited this one. What a disappointment! Evanovich must be taking lessons from John Grisham, whose lame Skipping Christmas was a big stinker last year.

LOVE the books with their inept (just like me!) heroine(?). I was pleased to come across \\"Sugarplums\\" in the library, but I was extremely disappointed in its execution. It reminded me of the equally disappointing Christmas story that Patricia Cornwell wrote for her lead character Kay Scarpetta.It seemed to be an effort to tide us over until the next fully fleshed-out book, but it was really kind of lame in its effort to be wacky.No harm done, I just returned it to the library.Waiting for #12..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Visions of Sugar Plums = Plum Waste of Money","review":"Save your money, people.I love the Plum series, but this book was nothing but a filler to make Evanovich and her publisher some easy Christmas money.The plot was plotless. The \\"new\\" character was never fully explained -- basically he was an alien, and of course, a good-looking one, who had skills the likes of which make McGyver look like an idiot. No Ranger.

Living in the U.K. I quite happily paid U.S. prices and shipping fees to ensure that I got her new book as soon as possible. I started to read it the day it came, but unlike Stephanie Plum books numbers 1-8 (which took a mere day to read) this Evanovich book took over a week to read and even then it was a struggle. It's boring, a huge diappointment, has a tenuous plot and at times insults your intelligence. My advice is don't buy it - if you want to read it, at least wait until it's out in paperback or borrow it from a library/a friend. Come on Evanovich - you can do much better!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What was she thinking?","review":"I love Stephanie Plum books. I love the humor. I love Grandma.

I have read the numbered books 1-8 before getting to this one. I love the numbered books but not this one. I feel like it's a necessary evil. The storyline is B-A-D but some big things happen in Stephanie's family that you need to know before you get to #9. There is no Ranger, Connie or Vinnie. They are all mentioned but not interacting with Stephanie. Connie is alluded to but there is no dialogue. For those who love Stephanie and Lula team. . .they only interact for one afternoon and most of it is shopping. There is introduction of a new character (Diesel) who pops in and out of rooms and unlocks doors and apparently is somewhat magical. CHEESY!!! This reminds me of those cheesy Christmas specials. . .but I read this book in September"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I love the numbered Stephanie Plum books and was eager to read this one (like many others out there). What a huge disappointment! I started to read this book and simply gave up after a couple chapters, which is something I rarely do. It's very boring and the plot is simply terrible.

In addition to the \\"plot\\" being not well thought out, the book ends abruptly after only 164 pages, lacking the usual Stephanie Plum novel endings.

Oh I know, let me rip off my fans and make a quick buck...","review":"I have read the first four books from the Stephanie Plum series and found them rather enjoyable. This book however is awful.

I was quickly becoming a fan of Janet Evanovich but this book has turned me away from her slightly."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought it was a dream...","review":"I kept waiting for Stephanie to wake up and realize that it was all a dream, but she didn't. What shocked me even more was when I went on to read the 10th book and some of the story from Visions fo Sugarplums carried over.

If I could give it 0 stars, I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Visions of Sugar Plum","review":"I have every Plum novel and have loved every one of them, until this one. I only liked Visions of Sugar Plum. First of all, the story wasn't believable and where in the world is Ranger? He makes the books as far as I am concerned. I can only hope that this was a quick write just for Christmas. Please Janet, go back to the working class Stephanie who can't keep house, can rarely catch a felon but can keep us laughing from the first to the last page."},{"rating":"1","title":"No real vision here","review":"Let's face it, Evanovich is not the world's greatest writer. But she has an easy style and decent plotting. In this book, her writing has slipped a notch below her usual standard, and the plot is thin. The first 30 pages or so read like a weak first draft. The book picks up a bit in the middle, but then it coasts for while before ending much too quickly, with too little explained, and with too much left undescribed. Clearly Janet did not care to put her best into this one. Another draft or two, some explanation and complication about 3/4 of the way through (instead of fizzling out), some more inventiveness, and it would have been a winner. Instead, all she's accomplished is to ensure that I'll give her next novel a very careful going over before I buy it (or not)."},{"rating":"1","title":"FAIRYTALES CAN BE BORING","review":"If you collect the Plum hardcovers, well you of course will want this.It is a Plum fairytale with not much substance. Stephanie goes to her parents house for Christmas, Stephanie wants a tree but has no time or motivation to get one, Stephanie see Joes for two seconds here and there, Stephanie has a supernatural friend who is a hunk but pretty boring (personally, I think Ranger is having a bad dream and this book was it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Visions of Lost Money...","review":"I cannot imagine what Evanovich was thinking about when she created this horrific little 149 page Christmas rip-off.

'Why was this book written?'"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I love the Stephanie Plum series enough that I suffered through this book.

This book is excruciatingly predictable and rather flatly written. Her main characters bored me. I have never in my life taken so long to finish such a short book, but I had to force myself to read it.

Let's hope she hasn't \\"fizzled\\" out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It would seem that Janet Evanovich doesn't even try anymore.","review":"The Stephanie Plum series was strong and good up until \\"Four to Score.\\" Quality nosedived in \\"Seven Up\\" with Janet admitting that she'd rushed the book. Those people who are fans of the first books will find the latest installment (too short to be called a book) a half-hearted effort at best. What was worse, the installment was overpriced.Save your money for Starbucks. This one is not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm, what is this book exactly?","review":"I have always been a big fan of this series. Sadly, Janet's previous novel was barely passable. And now with this one...I just don't know. Halfway through this read, I thought, \\"Oh, this must all be a dream that Stephanie's having!\\" But it wasn't. This book doesn't really fit with the rest of the series. The \\"supernatural\\" angle doesn't really work. The plot, isn't really there. And the old favorites -- Morelli and Ranger are almost missing and missing. Something tells me that Janet is written out. She needs to take a year (or two) off. Progress Stephanie. Marry her. Get her away from elves!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"This book was a waste of time and money, the last time I was this disappointed in a book was \\"hannibal\\". The plot was ridiculous, you know from the biginning that there are 4 days till xmas, steph is hunting a bail jumper only to let him go because it's xmas eve! this author could have done much better especially w/a xmas theme."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hysteria","review":"One of the funniest books I have read. Plum, a barely successful (at least financially) bounty hunter is looking for Sandy Claws who jumped bail. It's four days before Christmas and no tree and no gifts and then a sexy man named Diesel literally appears in her kitchen. He's some kind of superhuman--sort of. Her family is hysterically funny, especially her 70+ old grandmother who is constantly meeting stud muffins at funeral visitations, as an example. Crazy things happen at a rapid rate--the whole thing is just plain fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big hit!","review":"All of my hamsters and guinea pigs love these \\"chilly chews.\\" They've always ignored salt licks and flavored woods, but these are a huge hit in my household."},{"rating":"2","title":"J.K. Lasser's New Rules for Retirement and Tax","review":"As a longtime fan of Paul Westbrook's, and having benefited greatly from his advice, I'm admittedly biased in his favor. I can say with all honesty that this book is a thorough, well-written guide, easily accessible to the uninitiated. It should be a boon to anyone who wants to understand how to plan his or her financial future."},{"rating":"2","title":"George Gently: Series 1","review":"I watched these DVD's for the first time and even though my husband wasn't too thrilled about it, I found that it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. There were some shooting scenes, and the shows dealt a lot with corruption in the police force itself but I guess that was to be expected for that period of time (the 1960's). The plot summary basically explains it. The two main characters also made it pretty good. Here, I felt that Gently's partner was a lot like Barnaby's sidekicks -- brash and like to have control and Gently, even though he was still a bit rough, he still brought out his gentler side to make it work. I also have to admit that it was good in the sense of no major car chases and many gory scenes, and also no 'depressing home life scenes', but it still does not stand up to our tastes of what Midsomer Murders offers for the storyline. Still it was something new to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anxiously awaiting this DVD","review":"Obviously I haven't seen these DVD's yet as they haven't been released here. But the books are wonderful and I am hoping that Martin Shaw is a better fit here then he was as Adam Dalgliesh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective disc, not widescreen","review":"I purchased this set for my wife for Christmas. We finally watched them and really enjoyed the series except that one of the discs is defective and simply won't play one chapter. In addition the package clearly says the discs are all \\"widescreen\\". None of the discs is presented in widescreen. Amazon will not accept a return on the disc set (without a 50% restocking fee plus shipping) because it was purchased before Christmas. They simply won't stand behind a defective product. I guess I didn't understand their returns policy in advance, but now that I do, I'll be looking elsewhere for my British mystery theater DVDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"George Gently Series 1","review":"I could not view the DVD's I bought from Amazon because they were not compatible with region 4.

So I have wasted my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, George Gently has subtitles!","review":"I guarantee you that George Gently has subtitles! Please do not believe some of these other reviewers - who have not purchased, don't own it, and don't have any way of knowing one way or another what is true."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gem of a Series!","review":"There's just enough friction between Commander Gently and his sidekick, Sergeant Bacchus, to create a gem of a series.

I hope that series two will come out on DVD soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"SANTA IN THE BOX!!!!!!!","review":"If JACK in the box scared you as a kid, this SANTA in the box will make you laugh..Plays \\"Pop Goes The Weasel \\" or POP GOES THE SANTA as I would say Really cute and very very sturdy.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Deal!","review":"This is the deal of the century... This bird seed is no longer available locally and I was happy to find a larger size bag for sale at such an amazing price. The usual cost of a 4-pound bag is $16. At $48 for 30 pounds, this is the equivalent of nearly (5) 4-pound bags for free. Also, even though the shipping date was estimated at 2-3 weeks from the purchase date, I received the box only 2 days later. Never seen faster shipping... I hope I can locate this seller again when I run out in a year. ;) Thank you"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok for big kids","review":"My oldest son is 5 and loves his \\"army man\\" however it came with lots of little parts that seem to dissapear every time he plays with it.

He does plays with it all the time though and he really enjoys it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lazy Rock","review":"Sanford Arms includes members of Seattle bands that never really became huge (Alcohol Funnycar, Best Kissers in the World, Hammerbox). This is a great lazy album, not in the sense of \\"Man, these guys didn't really put forth a strong effort.\\" The lazy I'm thinking of is the \\"It's 8pm on a Friday night, the work week is over, I'm going to kick back in the recliner, throw on a sweatshirt and watch some network TV dramas until I drift off to sleep\\".Let's face it, we can't be young and punks for the rest of our lives -- there has to come a day when we grow up, start a family, get a corporate job, and start drinking coffee. It looks like the guys in Sanford Arms have already reached that place and decided that it's not that bad.\\"Smolder\\" and \\"Let it Show\\" are my two favorites by the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this record!","review":"I got turned onto this record off of the radio (KEXP) in Seattle.

If you do some math, and include naptimes when she used to take naps, that means she has listened to it over 2000 times. And so have we, both as we tuck her in and then over her monitor. And we still love it.The songs are beautiful and soothing, and certainly a welcome break from traditional English-language lullabies. And they're not too babyish either, which is why she still enjoys this CD. The songs come from a wide variety of cultures, and I think that it's probably good for young children to be exposed to a range of languages and musical styles. But even if it does nothing to widen her horizons, this CD certainly does its primary job, which is to help her get to sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music for everyone to enjoy","review":"You don't have to be a child to enjoy the beautiful songs on this album. This is a wonderful change from the \\"typical\\" lullabye collections. In addition to loving the songs themselves (and their calming effect on both my infant and me), I especially appreciated the detailed booklet that explains the origin of each song and gives some background information about the different cultures represented on the album. This collection truly has something for everyone, no matter what your age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best lullaby album","review":"I have owned this for years; given to me by my daughter. I purchased it for a co-worker with her first baby. They love it as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought it would be better","review":"I thought this CD would be much more relaxing. It was too high pitched and upbeat to be a lullaby CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little weird","review":"My almost 4 year old loves music in bed but seemed to be getting tired of his usual lullabies. So I branched out...he even thought the songs were weird sounding. Needless to say, he doesn't choose this CD at bedtime.re"},{"rating":"1","title":"It sure ain't heroin!","review":"It may sound like harsh judgement but there were only two songs that intrigued me and that I could see someone using on a film score. But as a whole it really is a pretty mediocre and forgetable CD. It actually serves its purpose though as it can put you to sleep as well as any other lullaby but I was hoping for something that would serve me better as background music as I sit at this PowerBook. Bottom line: It's OK but it sure ain't Heroin!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for MY baby...","review":"I cannot imagine that this collection of music would actually help a baby sleep. The music is not \\"bad\\" per se, if you want a collection of foreign folk music. However, only the french song is remotely like a real lullaby. The other songs are just too stressful and weird. It is hard to believe that any of these songs actually help babies sleep, even in each song's country of origin. I suspect that IF my baby ever slept to this CD it would result in nightmares."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not thrilled","review":"I was hoping this would be good as bedtime music, but the music and the lyrics are not what I consider great for a child to fall asleep to. The foreign language, high pitch, and pace of the music are not conducive to a restful journey to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Double Binds","review":"I am sorry to say that as a Non-Mormon reading this book I felt \\"double bound\\" by the constant insertion of references to the Mormon Church, Mormon History and Mormon Literature. I expected a scholarly book that was not a springboard for evangelism. An example, page 22 the author writes,\\"...perhaps we should remember what Joseph Smith went through in Liberty jail. After weeks in the vile prison....\\"And then quotes are delivered from the Doctrines and Covenants from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.Only two of the 9 works cited appeared to be non-Mormon, and most of the remaining were blatantly so.I have through the course of my ministry appreciated the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. And, I have read and appreciated the foundational work of Bateson, Weakland, Jay Haley, Jackson et. al. I would have liked to have seen this work add to their body of knowledge. Sadly, it did not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Release","review":"I remember a buddy of mine bought this cassette tape when it was first released on the single basis that he loved the album cover. We both immediately thought is was brilliant upon first listen. For some reason I never picked up a copy for myself and just recently downloaded this in MP3 format. The first listen reminded me how great it was, and how unfortunately, it was all downhill from here for Sinead. Sure, Nothing Compares 2 U was her biggiest hit and I really liked Emperor's New Clothes, but she never reached the depths she reached on this release.Simply put, any fan of music should own The Lion and the Cobra."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Must Buy This Album! Now!","review":"This album is pure, beautiful fury. Only 18 when she recorded this, Sinead's intelligence and rage are as bold and ferocious as they have ever been. From the classic rocker \\"Mandinka\\" to the devestatingly powerful \\"Troy\\" (musical companion to Sylvia Plath's \\"Lady Lazarus\\" :-) this album is an unforgettable work of uncommon art."},{"rating":"1","title":"UK Edition?","review":"This is the second time I've had an issue with my order. Why am I receiving the US edition of this CD? This is labelled as the UK edition, but I received the US cover. In that case, I could have saved time and a few dollars and gone to my local music store for the CD I received. This is my second time ordering this CD with the same results - receiving a product I didn't need to order from Amazon in the first place. I am extremely disappointed with the accuracy of this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget.... and listen","review":"Forget the whole SNL, tearing up the picture of the Pope thing. Forget the stunning, close-up video for the discarded Prince song. Forget the poorly handled political statements and the whole female in the clergy thing.Put this CD in to your stereo and put on some headphones. The amazing range and raw emotion of this album are unmatched. I was impressed by this album when I purchased it 15 years ago. Now I am stunned. This album is still better than 99.9% of the CDs that have come after it.Many current artists forget the impact that can be made by varying the volume and intensity of a song. The song starts, continues and ends at the same level. Songs on this album can be quiet and introspective in one moment and then be intense and demanding in the next.I have no favorites, as they are all good - from beginning to end. I admit that the Banshee screams can take some getting used to, but take the time to try. You'll be happy you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfection","review":"This album is agueably one of the greatest pieces of work ever done in music. I know tha tthis is a bold statement, but anyone who has listened to this album will probably agree with me. After all these years, this album still gives me chills when i listen to it. it is almost impossible not to get caught up in the emotions of this album. This album is so good that all of her other work, while still great, is just dissapointing in comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has it been over twenty years already?","review":"During the mid to late eighties I was fortunate enough to have one of my dream jobs when I worked in a record store. For that brief moment in my life I was exposed to so much music and a fair amount of it has stayed with me over the decades since that idyllic period. Such is the case with The Lion and the Cobra from Sinead O'Connor. The vocal range of this gifted singer jumps out at you right away on the haunting opening track Jackie. This album is a hypnotic collection of gothic intensity, sultry acoustic strumming, pulsing beats, and angelic whispers of raw emotion.I will admit to not following much of her career after this album beyond the inescapable Prince cover and her highly publicized political statements but I can testify that this album is a timeless and powerful collection of passionate, beautiful, and melodic songs. There aren't that many albums where you love every song and which comes to a close far too quickly. That's what you get here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique vocalist","review":"What a debut album. Her haunting, powerful, and varied vocal performances on Jackie, Jerusalem, Troy, and Drink Before the War are unforgettable. The edge on her voice is something else. I love the raw almost low budget feel of these recordings.I Want Your Hands on Me is another excellent song and vocal; fast and upbeat. I would argue that the single Mandinka, although a decent song, is less impressive than these other tracks. Definitely my favorite Sinead release and worth every penny....."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece AAAA++++","review":"500 years from now people will be listening to this album and be in amazement at how brilliant it is on all levels of musical genius. She will be remembered forever, her songs will be played on into eternity long after our songs have disappeared."},{"rating":"2","title":"Byrd's Greatest Hits","review":"I finally got the correct CD for the Byrds. Be careful--somehow there has been a problem with the UPC code on this CD crossing over to a Sinead O'Connor CD. Verify with the seller that you are definitely getting the Byrd's Greatest Hits and you'll save yourself and the seller a headache. That said, most of the songs were great; only a couple I wasn't all that crazy about. Still a collection of songs reflecting the sometimes serious social issues of the '60's and others just humorous (Hey Mr. Spaceman) that you'll remember if you were a part of that era."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time.","review":"This book was a waste of my time. It is pointless.I was insulted by the frequent usage of french terms and phrases. France is one of most anti-American countries in the world and there is no positive purpose served by including words and terms of this despicable country in an American book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prometheus Debacle","review":"I first read Scarlatti Inheritance in the 70's, and every book since, but this one borders on the ridiculous. The premise of the Directorate was interesting, but for Bryson to make the multitude of unbelievable escapes; buy, assemble, and set up sophisticated computer equipment in a matter of hours is just not plausible, along with most of the escapades. I'm sorry, but this one is just too far-fetched."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still disapointing","review":"I keep hoping that Ludlum will rise to the level of his early works.. I'm not a literary critic, but maybe more plain old people like me ought to review this kind of junk before it's released. Ludlum ought to fire whomever is writing this stuff for him... Example...Page 58. Bryson had \\"stowed his weapon in his glove compartment...\\" Page 59. \\"Bryson's Glock was nestled against the base of his spine, in his rear waist holster.\\" Page 62. Bryson kills his enemy by twisting his Glock around and shooting his enemy in the face.. Tell me how anyone could survive shooting an automatic handgun in that kind of confined space without serious injury to the back caused by the ejection action of the automatic pistol... this junk goes on and on... Your reviewers either aren't reading this book or they have some financial interest in promoting it. It is awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needlessly confusing","review":"Over all I liked this book, but found it needlessly confusing and with way too many far-fetched last-minute escapes. Everybody seemed to be a bad guy. I must have missed something at the end because I didn't catch why the bad guys would send the protagonist to try to catch themselves.I enjoyed many of the action scenes, but some of the escapes from danger seemed too implausible to be enjoyable. They reminded me of James Bond escapes, and I look at those as being purposely over the top.All in all, better than \\"Hammer of Eden\\", which I still haven't been able to get through, but not in the league of some of his earlier work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far from Ludlum's best","review":"Once apon a time, Robert Ludlum wrote the best paranoid thrillers in existance. His \\"Bourne Ultimatum\\" and \\"Gemini Contenders\\" are classics in the field.But this book, as his last several books, is far from his best. It is hurried, sketchy, often incoherent and contradictory. The general plot is a good one, and much could have been done with it, but wasn't.About 2 drafts short of a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ludlum needs better editor as he ages","review":"The Prometheus Deception is easily the worst book Ludlum has written under his own name. The plot moves in fits and starts and soon degenerates to no plot at all, replaced by a succession of incoherent skits loosely connected by cut-and-pasted descriptions of technology along with various forms of mayhem. It soon becomes tiresome rather than exciting. Additionally, Ludlum is showing signs of \\"aging popular author disease--\\" he seems compelled to insert periodic references to \\"magnificent breasts,\\" and his editors seem powerless to persuade him to make those references relevant to the plot. Definitely a bad book-- my copy went into the garbage. I miss the earlier Ludlum."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Ludlum's best yet.","review":"My wife bought me \\"The Prometheus Deception\\" for Christmas and I couldn't put it down. I began reading Ludlum with \\"The Aquitaine Progression\\" and have read every one of his books since then. This one, in my opinion, may be his best yet.I was devouring the book page by page. There are so many twists in this book you will not want to put it down until you finish page 509, the end. Outstanding plots and characters with an in depth look at the possibilities of Signals Intelligence and the realm of the computer age functioning with telecommunications.I thoroughly enjoyed it and can't wait for the sequal!! Order it now, you wont regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who was really deceived?","review":"Absolutely the worst book I've read this year. Tedious, rife with cliches (like that!), stilted characters about whom you care little and a break-neck pace in so many locations around the whole frigging world without, might I mention, any solid clue as to the time-line (until of course, we enter the final \\"deception,\\" and the fuse is burning while Dudley Doright is still thinking it through and Nell will be singed at the very least).Even, dare I say, Tom Clancy can be THIS appealing. Well, not quite.Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great from start to finish","review":"This is a book I enjoyed from start to finish. The action was pretty much non-stop. While some of the escapes from certain death were a little over the top, I don't mind that in escapist espionage thrillers. I heartily recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"A secret agent type is involved in a mostly successful operation against Hezbollah terrorists. He gets hurt, and has to recover back at his base. After this, he is shocked to find that his boss is getting rid of him.It gets even more shocking than that when he realises that the clandestine small agency he works for is most definitely not what he thought it was, but actually a completely foreign operation that has sucked him in.This is not all though, as another level of deception exists. Prometheus is a group of men that want to control all corporate information in the world, giving them immense power. A definite commentary on the consolidation of corporate influence and information can be found in this book.He is reunited with his wife, but the story hasn't ended there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out With a Bang","review":"This was Ludlum's last book that was solely written by him before he died. Every book after this has been written by a ghost writer who still uses Ludlum's name on the cover.This book takes the reader through a deep web of lies and deceit that all comes together in the end. Well, kind of comes together. I had to think about it a little bit but it was a great concept. This book was written before 9/11 and it's amazing how Ludlum was able to forsee the futile war on terror that we deal with every day. It makes you think who's really calling the shots out there and how much are we really told about. Is there really an agency above the NSA and CIA?I really liked this book. It was almost like Ludlum knew it would be his last book because he blends in some aspect from every one of his past novels to make this one a hit."},{"rating":"1","title":"He called it in....","review":"This is undoubtedly the worst Ludlum ever! What starts with a fairly unique story idea, soon disintegrates and drowns in a torrent of completely improbable, not to say impossible, situations. Pure comic book material. He should have hired a good illustrator. The prose is gone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"prometheus Deception","review":"Having read everything Ludlam has written, he appears back to writing in his typical way. Even though somewhat predicatable, he is still entertaining. I am glad he's back after a few yawners. Still worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whoever edited this book should be spanked.","review":"In Austin Powers, Scotty says \\"You've got a time machine, why don't you just go back and shoot him when he's on the crapper!\\" That's how I felt after reading this book.--SPOILER ALERT-- Can someone please explain to me why Manning and Waller allowed Bryson to set up and trigger the disruptor that caused Manning's estate to burn and foil their plans? The scene where Bryson's learns he's been under surveillance for the past 10 years negates the whole plot! The bad guys not only know everything he's done, but everything he's planned to do.And this is just one of many inconsistencies in the book. I give it two stars because finding so many inconsistencies in a best-seller it made me feel so superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aaron Spelling meets Ludlum?","review":"Who wrote this? When I was a kid, I read every available book written by Ludlum and this one is not typical of his work. It is implausible, simple and fill of characters who are like those of some Hollywood cop on prime time tv. Good thing I didn't have to pay for it! Yuck. This book is kindling for Prometheus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never again","review":"Haven't read Robert Ludlum in ages and picked up this one at my son's house for a long plane trip. I can't believe it had an editor. The book has so many impossible situations and contradictory things happening that the reader must either be brain dim or just unquestioningly go with the flow of action to enjoy it. And it goes on and on and on. Is he paid by the word?Clearly since he is such a successful author, I am out of sync with his audience, but then again, I don't have to ever be one of them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"skip it","review":"This book begins much better than it ends. I'm a longtime Ludlum fan (I've read every book he's ever done), and for awhile, I really thought the Ludlum of old was back. I thought MATARESE COUNTDOWN and APOCALYPSE WATCH were just bad dreams I could forget.Nope. This one isn't much better. Ludlum does a great job hooking you with the premise, but then proceeds to go nowhere with it. The much vaunted \\"high tech\\" angle is rarely reflected in the plotline, which I thought got duller and duller as it went. It was a real struggle for me to finish the last 40 pages or so, because I just didn't care anymore.Overall, it reads like a lukewarm rehash of Ludlum's earlier (and much better) book AQUITAINE PROGRESSION. The problem as I see it, is that the Ludlum of today no longer connects the twists and turns to the story. Instead, the characters just stagger around from city to city, country to country, with little rhyme or reason to be found.Sigh. I think I'll go back now and re-read BOURNE IDENTITY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast-paced, but weak plot","review":"Prometheus Deception, like most of Ludlum's books, is very fast paced with little break in the action. It is full of twists and turns, with the unexpected occurring every now and then. However, the book seems like a desperate attempt at coming up with a plot and then trying to make the whole story somewhat sensible (needless to say, Ludlum fails miserably). There are instances when you're left wondering whether the sequence of events or the events themselves even make sense. Yes, we are living in a world of increased government surveillance, but I'm sure Ludlum, being the espoinage maestro that he is, could come up with a better plot than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for those who like Ludlum's work","review":"It is not path breaking in content or approach but a good read.Those who do not like Ludlum can perhaps avoid it.And those who have not read Ludlum please start with \\"The Bourne Identity\\"..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless","review":"While I enjoyed some of his earlier books, this one was a disappointment. Every conspiracy has to have some unrealistic elements in it--after all you read it for the thrill. But Prometheus has too many of them. A shallow plot, an unbelievable character and a totally poitless conspiracy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete loser of a book","review":"This book is a complete waste of your time. Worse than that. I was looking for a new author to discover and enjoy, and a thriller, and the critics' reviews of this tempted me. I enjoyed the first 20 pages or so, and then the book really started to go downhill. Clichés are a given of the genre, but the author takes this ad nauseum. Plots within plots within plots are only tolerable when you care about the characters. You can't in this book because they are so shallow that to call them two-dimensional would be an insult to B-movie plots. I started to think that going blind might be preferable to finishing this......save your money, don't buy it. Save your time, life is too short, don't read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"why bring him back?","review":"Having been a Ludlum fan forever I anticipated a good read with his newest novel. However, I found this book to be his worst effort.Maybe I missed something but why would Dunn recruit bryson back from a peaceful college existence when Dunn himself was a member of the conspiracy?After that it was down hill all the way. Not only were the confrontation scenes predictable but also unbeliveable. Time after time poor Bryson feels overmatch and is still able to prevail. Not just an operative but more closely related to superman.Hopefully, Ludlum will return to his Bourne style and we can all forget about the \\"directorate\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"The F-Bomb","review":"I admit that I am not a Ludlum expert. I read the Bourne series and thoroughly enjoyed them. Granted that was some time ago and my memory may me a little dusty. The Prometheus Deception caught my eye and since I liked the other Ludlum books I went for it. I was pretty disaapointed and read only about 1/4th of the book. The profanity laced dialogs were over the top, to the point of taking away from the story. I can handle some swearing, but the continual use of the F-bomb is a deal-breaker for me. But that's a personal preference. If you're OK with it, then you'll have to deal with the unrealist action that leaves every bad guy with a bullet to the forehead and the good guys never getting hit, even though the enemy are the best assassins from the underworld... It just got to be unreadable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly disappointing","review":"We got this as a book tape for a long trip. It actually started well and was intriguing. But it began to get sillier and sillier as it went on, with totally random plot twists, many of which made earlier events simply make no sense at all. I felt like I was reading a Hardy Boy book, only with graphic violence added. By the time it got goofy, I was totally able to predict that the boss would end up bad. When he showed up on the TV at the end, we burst out laughing! Hard to believe this is the same guy who wrote the Bourne books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Spectacular Thriller","review":"After reading the Bourne Identity series, I felt impelled to read other books by Robert Ludlum. I picked this one up completely by chance, since both the title and the cover appealed to me. I am extremely interested in spy novels, so I checked it out of the library once I skimmed through the introduction. At first, I have to admit, I was contemplating putting it down because it seemed a but lengthy, but since I always have to know the ending, I kept my eyes peeled. Towards the middle of the book, I realized what an action-packed read this was. I literally had to tear myself away from it. I actually enjoyed The Prometheus Deception just as much, if not more than The Bourne Identity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top-notch Ludlum - he's back!","review":"I'd almost given up on Ludlum after the last couple of losers, but now I think he's back at the top of his game with Prometheus Deception. A fantastic opening draws us in, then a premise that's totally intriguing serves as the undertow: what if your whole life has been orchestrated? What if your whole life is a lie? What if you thought you'd been fighting for your country, only to find out you've really been aiding the enemy? Although I wouldn't quite put this up there with Bourne Identity and Matarese Circle, it's really vintage. This novel has the dense texture of the middle period Ludlums, the twists and turns, the feeling that every time you think you've got it all figured out, you're whiplashed back, you realize you were all wrong. The old master hasn't lost his touch. He's back, and now so am I!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"I do not usually feel strongly enough about a book to offer an opinion, but....This book is more a parody than a thriller.

This is not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wrote this?","review":"If it didn't say Ludlum on the cover, and if I hadn't advance ordered my copy, I'd think I had picked up a Gold Eagle paperback off the discount rack. This book has none of the richness and depth of a Ludlum novel. Not only are the characters quite flat, but the plot twists that are the hallmark of Ludlum aren't there. The story is too straightforward, with little in the way of surprise. Ludlum's best is full of \\"I didn't see that coming... but I guess I should have.\\" This book is full of \\"He's going to end up doing this...\\" and ten pages later he does.This saddens me. I've been a long time fan of Ludlum and was quite anxious to get this book. Now having read it, I'm not all that concerned about when the next Ludlum will come out. I know that Ludlum has done some \\"collaboration\\" on a men's adventure novel (series?). This book makes me wonder if a hack writer has rubbed off on Ludlum... or if some hack \\"ghosted\\" this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor effort","review":"I have read every book by Ludlum, and therefore, am a fan. This book was so amaturish, so juvenile, to the extent, that I question that he even wrote it, or maybe just put his name on it. The plot is superficial, and poorly researched. The characters week. In all, a very poor effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Junk","review":"This was my first Ludlum book, and perhaps my last. Couldn't have been more disappointed. 500 painful pages of ... lead you to a sorely disappointing end, an ending that would probably leave you feeling sick. I wonder if this is the style Ludlum uses in all his books. Initially I found myself fascinated by the book but with the passage of time it became clear that the biggest 'deception' was in reading the book itself. I saw neither logic, nor a story line in the entire plot. All that the author had was exotic descriptions of foreign locations. Expect no twists and turns in the story, it is all too predictable and of course, illogical...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fails to suspend my disbelief","review":"I picked this book up because a quick scan of its book jacket suggested it had been the inspiration for the Alias TV series. I'd never read a Ludlum before, although I'm fond of the genre, having enjoyed Clancy imensely. However, I'm abandoning \\"Promethus\\" 1/2 read. The writing is just plain awful. With their informal, choppy, sometimes even gutter-level language it's difficult for me to accept most of these characters as human, let alone highly skilled spies, DD's of the CIA, or members of the Presidential Cabinet. There's nothing too awfully wrong with the plot - one can see why Alias's creators borrowed from it - but the rest of it is just too hard to swallow. This is one of the few books I've read recently that would seriously benefit from abridgement: if 80% of the useless and silly psychoanalytical prose was eliminated, it may actually be readable - or at least I'd waste less of my time finishing it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Prometheus Deception","review":"It is obvious this was written by a ghost writer.

We, as readers, need to be more circumspect about assuming a good author always provides us with a good read.that is why reding reviews is. I presume, a good thing to do before buying a book. This book is predicated upon a ridiculous premise and is filled with events that just don't sell. You want to read Ludlum, but you don't want to read this Ludlum.

His mastery of the past of twisting plots and extremely interwoven details has gone by the wayside with Prometheus. Way too many \\"just happened to have\\" answers and overly simplified answers that lead to plain unbelievable consequences. I have considered Ludlum to be the absolute best at keeping details and plots with \\"no holes\\" and this book does nothing to compare to his previous works.Ludlum has gone from writing his unique style books, to writing cheap James Bond type thriller types meant to please the mass public accustomed to TV paced adventures.The true Ludlum fans can only hope he comes back to his own unique writing form in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Ludlum,","review":"Okay, you had me hooked.

This book is neither believable, nor entertaining to read. There are major plot twists so often, that the reader loses track of the good guys and the bad guys. This book features a 50+ page escape scene with so many 'missed chances' to kill the defenseless hero, in a dark, closed room, that I nearly put the book down at that point. Thankfully, I read on to experience the worst shooting assassins the world has ever seen. This book is far too unbelievable, and there are far too many plot twists to keep the reader interested.

The book is very poorly written with contradictions in statements, logic and common sense occurring within paragraphs and in a never-ending stream throughout at least the first 125 pages of the novel. At that point I could no longer tolerate the lack of writing or editorial quality and quit reading.

I have read quite a few of his books in one or two \\"sittings\\".

I decided to sample his work again. It's a quick read, but quite disappointing.

I'm supposed to say something about the plot, but really, that's all this book has going for it. I wouldn't want to spoil it for you guys who enjoy dumbing down during a flight. Ludlum has had at least two of his works produced as action/thriller movies. I'm sure that is what he had in mind. Just cut out most of the cheezy dialogue and tiresome weapons cataloguing - presto you have a script. I enjoy a good Schwartzenager or Segal movie from time to time. No matter how silly. But, why would you want to READ such a thing?Ps. A writer like Ludlum sure could a capable editor here. Some of the errors are very glaring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ending [stinks]","review":"This is a good book, right up until the end... If you gloss over some minor cliches and errors, the flow and suspense is great. But this sets up for an anti-climatic ending. Where did Abu come from (a villian from the first chapter, but never again mentioned until the last hand to hand combat).I believe Ludlum lost interest in completing the book and the publisher had to hire in some hack to finish the job, so they did it in the last 5 pages. Or...Ludlum lost himself in the maddening plot twists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I haven't read Ludlum in a while and it will be a long while before I read another.

She pulled out a flashing blade, a long thin stiletto. It gleamed wetly, as if coated with a viscous fluid. He knew at once that the blade must be coated with the alkaloid toxiferene, which made it an extremely dangerous weapon. The slightest nick or scrape would lead to immediate paralysis and a suffocating death.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Ludlum's spy like Robocop","review":"Our Superspy in this book keeps jumping from acting very smart to rather retarded. In one minute he pulls together obscure facts to solve a problem and the next he accepts statements of others that any Ludlum reader would seriously question. We all expect our Superspy's to be able to get out of seemingly inexcapable traps, but in this story he comes across more like Robocop rising from a nuclear attack. As a reader of Ludlum since the very beginnings, I expect my heros to use their brains and reasoning to solve the case with clues, facts and information in the story, even though those clues may be well hidden, and not pull solutions out of thin air. Sorry I spent the money for the hardback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Enough stars to rate this book!","review":"The Promethues Deeception starts off with a bang and never slows down in action. The main storyline is Nick Bryson, Aka Jonas Bannet and many other aliases, was working for a secret intelligence agency that turns out to be far from what Bryson was led to belive. Many interesting plot twists occur, and the book keeps you moving from page to page. I was utterly taken at how suspensful Mr.Ludlum wrote this book. The first novel of his I read was not at all anything in compared to this and I will read all Ludlum works I can because of this novel.I anxiously wait for my chance to get a copy of the much touted novel, The bourne Identity so I can begin that storyline.Mr.Ludlum in my opinion easily and clearly surpasses Mr.Clancy in suspense novels.

This book was well written and intersting somthing lacking in The Sigma Protocol and The Cassandra Compact.The book had good action, an interesting premise and twists and turns throughout, what the master Ludlum was famous for. While not his best book, it is the best I have read from him in a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Ludlum's best, but still worth checking out","review":"After reading Robert Ludlum's best books like The Bourne Identity & The Aquitaine Progression, I had huge expectations from The Prometheus Deception, Ludlum's latest Political Thriller. Believe it or not the book managed to satisfy my expectations.( Just about!)The story is full of twists & turns & is exciting throughout, no real boring occassions. The only drawback is the ending where Ludlum seems to loose the plot a little. That is however made up with some excellent characters like Nick Bryson (The Central Character), Layla (The enigmatic woman)& Bryson's wife Elena.All in all The Prometheus Deception is worth checking out once because its got all of vintage Ludlum in it which any diehard Ludlum fan (including myself) should enjoy thouroughly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor intro to Ludlum I suspect.","review":"I saw a trailer for the new \\"Bourne Identity\\" movie andcaught Ludlum's name up there. Never had him recommended tome, but I always knew his books were popular. Went to findBI and picked up \\"Prometheus Deception\\" instead.Pretty stupid book. Very, very tenuous connection to thePrometheus legend, writing was average, too many scene changesof dubious necessity and possbility, and the spycraft waslaughable. I'm supposed to be believe the best spy in theworld didn't know enough to check yesterday's weather beforepatching a video feed? And that a human can learn languages in a month, to a native level, but speaks horrific and incorrectPortuguese? (Maybe that's Ludlum's fault for trying to sneakPortuguese, Spanish, and local variants past a language student).This book rates as a nice diversion but sadly lacking. Itinspires one to sit down and write their own novel, as itproves that if Ludlum can get paid to write this, the moneyis out there for you, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts with a Bang, Ends with a Fizzle","review":"The premise is a good one.

He isn't sure, but he sure knows how to duck trouble as he races from one bad position to another around the globe. The reader expects this pace to continue to the end. Unfortunately, it does not. About two thirds of the way through, the novel just dies. Seemingly important characters are just abandoned, and others which had little mention or priority seem to be reintroduced into major roles. The climax is tired with the big showy blast of a movie-of-the-week's stuntman's special effects.Rather than read this, I recommend one of the earlier works for which Ludlum is famous: The Bourne Identity, The Osterman Weekend, The Rhineman Exchange, to name a few."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mystery Novel That Raised Detective Novels to Literature","review":"In the winter of 1972, the New York Review of Books featured this novel on its cover and proclaimed the it had won the editors over: From then on, detective mysteries would be considered literature - not just pulp fiction for the lowly masses. They had good reason. The way MacDonal writes, the story reeks of southern California in the 60's, capturing the feel of a Sunday drive through Santa Barbara and along its beaches. It also recognizes that all powerful families have dark histories that sadly repeat themselves over and over.

At the end of 60 pages, this bozo of a PI had uncovered a murder and a kidnapping and had not yet called the police in on the case. You have got to be kidding me. I left him on a boat being held at gun point. Good place for him. There was no timeframe in the book I could find. No dates, no current events discussed. I would surmise it was in the 50's or 60's considering the way women were portrayed at wimpie little braindeads. And of course, the male detective was just ever soooo coool all the time.

Perhaps the most disgusting part of the book is Buchanan's claim that Hitler wanted to be America's friend, a theory based on Buchanan's interpretation of \\"Mein Kampf\\". Buchanan, alas, ignores historical tidbits such as Hitler's \\"Z Plan\\", a construction program of aircraft carriers and battleships, coupled with the acqusition of air and naval bases in the Atlantic, was part of a concerted effort to prepare for the war against America that Hitler wanted to fight.Buchanan's reading of history is all wrong and his admiration of Hitler makes any decent person sick.

The result of this policy, had it been followed by Britain and France, would have meant that hundreds of thousands of lives in the democracies could have been saved while the two brutal dictators fought each other to the death.

He's right in saying that Germany in 1940 was not a threat to us (America). We didn't get into WWII to 'make the world safe for democracy'; we did it for the money (the bankers).

Pat sings a song of america and it's duchland, duchland uber allas. The shear refusal to see that the World War One not World War Two bankupted the britsh empire is the basis for this rant and it gets worse. Pat also see to see that was the opinion of the domnions fear full that the chamberlin might sell them out when the japanese moved south that forced a change of policy. Also I am no fan of Mao but Pat again fails to see that it was Mao success in maintaing a fighting force against the japanese from 1937 to 1945 gave him the basis for power not any thing america did.

George Marshall spend month in china in 1946 trying to arange for a cease fire and poltical settlement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost in the translation","review":"I think this book loses something in the translation. It probably makes more sense in the original German."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revisionist History","review":"As one pundit recently said, \\"Pat Buchanan is going after the World War II veterans vote but someone needs to tell him that former SS and Gestapo members can't vote.\\" Buchanan's views are better left to Crossfire and McLaughlin Group venues. He has demonstrated time and time again that he is committed to dividing the country along racial, ethnic, economic and religious lines. If David Duke wrote this book he'd be condemned and shunned by all but Buchanan's colleagues in the media are afraid to denounce him because they like him personally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ramblings of a nutcase!","review":"Mr. Buchanan's nationalistic rhetoric is frightening, to say the least. His comments concerning Hitler are contemptible. His Presidential campaign slogan should be \\"A Dictator, Not a President\\". His words are the musings of a madman."},{"rating":"1","title":"A misleading book as regards history and current affairs.","review":"Buchanan has a warped view of history and current affairs. He is not an \\"Americ Firster\\" so much as a \\"Blame America Firster.\\" His admiration for both the Kaiser's and Hitler's Germany is appalling as his use of anti-Semitic innuendos throughout his writings. Essentially he is a timid nationalist who views the world with fear and has little faith in the American people he claims to admire and want to defend. He is not a Nazi but more of what I would call a Falangist. His intolerance and contempt for democracy is all the more frightening in that on certain limited issues such as \\"affirmative action\\" I think he is correct - however he takes even a good issue to the extreme. He is an affable demagogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank You Father Coughlin","review":"Any reasonable person reading this book with be amazed at its antisemitism.

Buchanan's thesis of the book is that the United States should not get involved in Military interests that do not threaten the American nation. On the contrary, he suggests that America's participation in treaties, protection pacts and other reciprocal actions lure America into military and political intervention that ultimately undermines American Soveirnty and dilutes goodwill among other Nations. Unfortunately Buchanan's critics interpret his work as anti-semetic for criticism of US Isreali policy rather than seeing the patriot Buchanan who supports \\"America First,\\" fighting the encrouchment of a new global order than seeks to gain from America's loss. Packed full of hisotircal references and quotes, this work is a valuable review of American Foreign policies and the mindset of our founding fathers."},{"rating":"2","title":"More historical than critical","review":"Pat Buchanan, an ardent supporter of solid, but cautious foreign policy, has written an excellent account of the policies of the United States overseas. In beginning this work, I had expected to hear a greater degree of persuasion throughout the book, championing Washington's Farewell Address. While this was referenced throughout, I encountered much more history than I was anticipating, but was pleased it was there, as it lent an importance to his argument for the present and the future. Buchanan weaved his way carefully through America's history, complete with discussions of the Monroe Doctrine, Manifest Destiny, the great wars, and up to the very recent past. Anyone concerned about the future of America's military and its future, as I am being 22 years old, should read this masterful discussion, regardless of one's political affiliation."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN INTELLIGENT HISTORICAL REVIEW OF WWII","review":"FIRST OF ALL LET ME SAY THAT REGARDING MR.

Anyone who believes that Hitler, left alone as Pat suggests, to first attack and devour the Soviet Union would have then been satisfied to sit behind the Siegfried Line doesn't understand Adolf Hitler. True, Hitler sought land in the east for lebensraum, but he also believed Germany to be the master of Europe and eventually would have attacked the rest of Europe because the status quo was an impossible state of affairs for him.

Buchanan is selective as to what foreign wars are OK and which were, for example, Vietnam is OK, but WWII is not. Buchanan's statement that Great Britan, France and the US should have stood on the sidelines while Hitler conquered the rest of Europe is perposterus, and an affront to the 6,000,000 Jews slaughtered under Hitler's regime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly confused...","review":"Let me see if I understand. Buchanan says that foreign entanglements are bad. Buchanan also says that WW2 came about because England didn't meet its treaty obligations - in other words, they weren't entangled enough. If he addresses this contradiction anywhere in his book, I must have missed that page...the rambling tone put me to sleep after a while.

Buchanan is nowhere to be found on the American left-center-right political spectrum.

Second, how many times can he write the word breast in one book? I felt like I was reading a Penthouse Letter. Someone should tell Mr. Laymon that he does not need to describe the movements of a character's breasts in every instance. Third, there was no need to discuss how horny a 13-year-old girl was feeling. Fourth, why the need for almost every character to be naked? I am no puritan, but that was excessive.

Not this one. On Collin's album, it's all about the songs.Collin's voice and singing style are perfect for Christmas music. Most of the songs are handled very simply and gently, with a kind of honesty. Collin just might be the only male singer who can pull off the \\"stay by my cradle\\" line in \\"Away in a Manger\\" without sounding ridiculous. (This song, along with \\"Silent Night\\", is performed with his daughter.) \\"Angels We Have Heard On High\\" and \\"O Holy Night\\" start off simple and then soar.

There are points in this book where Palmini has a fondness for Silveria and gets to liking the guy. That is kind of creepy if not unprofessional.A few of the chapters are good.
