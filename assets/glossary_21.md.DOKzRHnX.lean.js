The instructions tells me \\"This bed rail is intended for use for children 2 to 5 years of age.\\" I had asked for a bed rail for senior and this was listed. Also, one piece of the rail broke. I cannot return as I dont have the box, but I will call the company I will throw it away. They cannot send me the replacement rod.BED GUARD RAIL"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and not great","review":"Now that these rails are installed on my son's bed, I LOVE them. However, I thought they were very hard to get on just right, especially with one person. I also found that it is a lot easier to install them attached to the box spring (turning the L shaped holders upside down) and that makes changing the sheets ten times easier too. Overall, a great product, just hard to install. I'll try to never take them off unless it's necessary!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"The package came quickly.

Had to return it to Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy assembly and sturdy","review":"this bed rail was easy to assemble and when finished, I was very pleased with how sturdy it was for a toddler. It slid in between the box spring and mattress just as it said it would, to hide it for daytime bed making. I was very pleased as many yrs ago I had metal rails for my daughters that were really a pain as they had to be removed daily for a good bedroom apparance."},{"rating":"1","title":"would not recommend","review":"I would not recommend this item to others. It was fairly complicated to put together, the pieces looked scratched when I first opened it and the biggest drawback is that the safety bars that hold the rail from under the bed are very short and turn all the time. If you really tighten the straps to hold the rail on they just turn and slide right under. We also noticed that one of the pieces looked bent. We thought we did it by accident while putting it together but after reading numerous reviews it seems others also had the same problem. My daughter has not slept in the bed with it yet so maybe it works fine, but I definitelty feel dissappointed with the quality and construction so far. Also, not as important but still good to know, our bed does not look cute and made with the rail on. You really need to slide the rail under and make the bed that way. Not easy in our daughters small room."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"I am very pleased with the Regalo Bed Rail, specially because during the day it is hidden under the matress and the bed looks as it should.

However, the price increased almost 100% in a year so when I had to buy rails for my son, I decided to try this one. It's inferior. The rails are very bulky under the mattress and lift the mattress up about 1/2 an inch. They also risk ripping the bedskirt and mattress cover if you pull the rails. Although the Dex rails are 2x the price (frustrating) - they are considerably better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Regalo Hide Away Extra Long Bed Rail, Sold by: Amazon.com LLC","review":"I have assembled Desks, Dressers, cabinets, and multiple cribs.

Very sturdy, and we only use it under a twin mattress, no boxspring. Definetly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toddler Rail","review":"We purchased this rail for our almost two year old when we transitioned her to a new room in preparation for our second child. We put her in a twin bed but put the mattress on the floor. This rail works great even with the mattress on the floor. It is quite sturdy and keeps her from rolling out. My husband installed it in less than 20 minutes with no problems. It does take a little while to get the pins back into position after pulling the rail up from under the mattress. And yes, you cannot make the bed nicely while the rail is up--but it is for a toddler and we usually dont make her bed unless we know there is company coming--and at that point just slide the rail under the mattress and make the bed normally!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT product","review":"This is a great product.

It's a good solid fit and the hide away option is wonderful!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"really frustrating","review":"the only reason this item got 2 stars instead of one (or none) is that putting it together was pretty easy...UNTIL the mesh covering on mine is somehow sewn wrong- it is too tight to stretch over the poles, making it impossible to finish assembling it. i called the company and they told me that since each mesh cover is sewn by hand, it could be that the one i received wasnt sewn large enough. i just love how the wording in the instructions is \\"SLIP the poles through...\\" when i'm sitting there trying with all my might to stretch them and its literally impossible. the customer service rep told me they would send me a new peice of mesh cloth.... we'll see if its any better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Difficult to breakdown for Hide Away Feature","review":"I'm not at all impressed with this purchase. The rail is incredibly difficult to breakdown for hideaway storage. We bought it for my 22 month old son who now sleeps in a twin bunk bed with his sister. While it was incredibly easy to assemble and is in fact pretty sturdy, the locking and unlocking mechanism is cumbersome to say the least. Not only do you have to individually unlock each side, you have to rotate and spin, wiggle it a little, and push down the rail all at once. Also we've noticed that using the hide away feature it scrapes the side of the wood framed bunk bed! While I don't have anything to compare this item too, I think I will begin searching for something that works better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Safe","review":"The rail is very secure whether you secure the anchor to the wall or only secure between the box spring and mattress.

I haven't seen the original movie that were made in the fifties. In this remake, there were just far too many people that got killed at the end that had nothing to do with the protagonist or the curse (like in Jun-On and the Ring saga), thus making the plot rather unconvincing!

Like a 'How Not To Write Horror' manual. I'm not entirely sure why I finished the book. I had some hope that it would improve, and it was also so ludicrous that I had to find out how bad it could get.The characters were cheesy and two dimensional, the plot was predictable and often silly.I also got the impression that Mr. Stine was desperate to drive into readers' heads that this is NOT a young adult novel. I think he went overboard with descriptions of sex scenes and foul language. I'm not a prude, but I think his attempt to make this story adult was overkill.I'm disappointed but not terribly surprised because it's so difficult to find really good horror writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"expecting so much more","review":"I got this book and read what the inside the cover said about it. It looked interesting. As I started the first few pages i was beginning to wonder what it was that I was reading. I started to skip pages because I \\"sex scenes\\", just a little too much,.....how to put this, stupidly written. I LOVE reading horror and have read a lot of horror. And this isn't it. There isn't that much talk of sex in the other books. It's more like a book written for male teenagers, talking about looking at women's breasts constantly. Not sure if I'll even finish it at this point. This book stinks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"o.k. read","review":"The book was alright, but I think R.L.Stine is still in that Goosebumps mode. Like most Goosebumps and Fear street books, I have found that Stine has the tendencey to have a pretty good plot to the story but he doesn't seem to know how to form anything out of it. The ending had an interesting twist to it but he's done it so many times that I felt like I had been ripped off and he was too lazy to finish it and just...quit. He's always ready for a sequel so he can make another buck. I hafta admit that there was plenty of gore in it, more than some horror novels (or get a job in horror movie writing which have the tendency to repeat themselves, too). I guess I've read too many horror books to be satisfied"},{"rating":"2","title":"Book review","review":"I happened across this book by chance. I had no idea that Stine had done an adult book. I had been a huge fan of his book since I was 12 and had read most of them. I of course had to read this one. It was pretty good although the plot was predictable. There were some suprises though. I highly reccomend this book to any Stine fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"But I love Fear Street!","review":"Maybe I opened this book with too high of expectations. I love the Fear Street series, have since I was a kid. I may have a BA in English, bu I still love to read these during TV comerials and smoke breaks. Anyways, to make a too long story short, I HATED this book. I didn't connect with any of the characters, and the plot left too many gaping holes. Also, while trying to please \\"adults\\" Stine left all of his charm on the cutting room floor. I only spent .50 on this at a garage sale, yet I still feel I was ripped off. The only reason I gave this terrible book 2 stars is beacause the idea was original, and I still love the Fear St. books."},{"rating":"1","title":"a major disappointment","review":"Not having read Stine's teen books, I was looking forward to this book as a good read for Halloween. It wasn't. The plotting and writing were like a first draft. A lot of it didn't make sense.

Millions of kids reading his stuff couldn't be wrong, could they?\\"They aren't wrong. Just young.I am an avid reader, and have never skipped ahead to read the ending. It's against my moral code. When I read this book, my wife would ask me why I had such an unpleasant look on my face. I responded that the book was terrible. She asked why I didn't put it down. I told her that I needed to know how it ended. She said skip to the back and look. Against my reading ethics, I did. The end was so predictable I (thankfully) had no need to read the rest.If you are one of the unfortunate souls who is currently reading this book, do what I did. Then find a book that won't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adult book? Just Goosebumps after puberty","review":"Stine has written another Goosebumps book, increased the length, added some dirty words, and tries to pass it off as adult fiction.

His style put me off totally from the story."},{"rating":"1","title":":)","review":"I find it insanely funny that Sara thinks to herself (about the rejected manuscripts) 'Don't these people know how bad their writing is?' I could ask the same of Stine regarding this book. It's not completely bad, seeing how I enjoy the character of Liam, but I see him as Naveen Andrews who is definitely not Irish....Why all the cursing and sex? Is there really a reason for it, other than wanting the book to sound adult? Was this thing edited at all?Anyway, I hope R.L. Stine sticks to his yound adult/pre-teen stories, they are a LOT better, IMO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I think that this is the worst book that I have ever read.

Stine to write such a magnificent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best book i've read in a while","review":"R.L.

This is a good book for the audience that likes to read about supernatural phenomina."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was o.k., but lacked something...an original plot maybe??","review":"I read Stine all the time--his books are a quick read and don't use up too many brain cells. This being an adult novel I thought it would be a little more mature than his others. Nope. I read it all the way to the end and thought, \\"He must pick plots out of a hat.\\" Not too impressive, and SO formula!! I'll keep on reading his books when I get bored, I just think he needs to stick with writing the kiddie books..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still waiting for Goosebumps to grow up.","review":"I did not feel any sympathy for these jacked-up characters and when someone finally got their scalp ripped off and their spine crushed, I merely felt relief that this was one less pathetic personality I had to keep track of. The dialog was as vapid as the intelligence of the lead character, Sara Morgan, who has an IQ of about room temperature and performs the expected Dumb-Damsel moves that makes for typical schlock suspense. (Oh gosh, can Liam really, really be so bad? Golly, Gee!) The story concept promises something terrifying along the lines of Saul, King or Koontz, but the terror it delivers is tame enough for Mr. Rodgers Superstitious Neighborhood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but not great....Definately not scary","review":"First of all, I must say that I loved R.L.Stines young adult novels (Fear Street series). So, I was hyped when I discovered he was trying his writing hand at an adult novel. The day it came out, I had it. I was disappointed, to say the least. The plot was far too predictable. His Fear Street books had more plot twists. Plus he used a recycled plot formula. What do I mean by recycled plot formula? Well, if you must, read the novel and you'll discover what I mean. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a horrible book, I've read much worse, but I have read much much better. Example; Stephen King's Bag Of Bones is one of the greatest novels of the supernatural I have ever read. I'd give Bag O' Bones a look at before reading Superstitious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of fun, kind of silly. Generic horror.","review":"It's kind of fun, but very predictable. He points you in a couple of directions but you can see the spin from a mile away. He uses some false thrills to simulate suspense in a couple of places. It only annoys because it's too cute, and reminds you of Goosebumps. Nice touch at the end. He does some cool telegraphic tension stuff with his prose: Little short bursts. The shadows ahead. Etc. The protagonist is too stupid to live, however. Uh, maybe she should have thought things over, or maybe called the cops right away, or maybe something else resembling common sense. Nice trashy read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not horror ... just horrible!","review":"Superstitious was billed as R.L.

In a side note, a friend purchased a copy of Space Camp which was also made by Anchor Bay. To her surprise it was blank. The Beastmaster case also claims to include a \\"16 page booklet of orginal preproduction sketches and liner notes\\" which is no where to be found. All in all this edition was very, very disappointing. I will not buy anything else from Anchor Bay Entertainment. They are misleading their customers.

Put these elements together and you've got the elements of an amazing fantasy.This is the low-budget movie that started the franchise of movies and the TV show and it's whole load of fun. Singer makes the character of Dar come alive as we suspend our disbelief for this sword and sorcery movie. Rip Torn is great as the villain. The animals are great in their scenes.

It stands side-by-side with Flash Gordon (1980) as my favorite 'B' movie, although Flash Gordon is much more overtly campy. Make Moses look like Conan and act like Dr. Dolittle, and you've pretty much got the plot. Marc Singer makes a great protagonist - his physique is only a hair less imposing than Arnold's, and he's a heck of a lot better actor. I'd call this the best fantasy movie ever made, but that's kinda like giving out an award for the least smelly pair of unwashed feet. Turn off your brain and let yourself enjoy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie with Some Bad Scenes","review":"I saw this when I was only a little kid, liked it then too. I know that Tanya motivated me into buying it again but there are some improvements. For starters, it's closed captioned. Now I can understand some of the things that were said. It probably could've done better without the dog getting shot with an arrow or the ferret sinking into the quicksand, even though he got saved. I'm not all too fond of animal cruelty, even if it is fake or scripted.Other than those two things, I give this movie a B+"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Ferret Movie!","review":"As a ferret owner, The Beastmaster has always had a special place in my heart. Sure, there are ferrets in as diverse a lot as Mars Attacks, Kindergarten Cop and Starship Troopers, but The Beastmaster has two of the cleverest and best trained ferrets in movie history.

Could have used a bit more depth in terms of character development and setting the scene (a bit more about the time between the present and the future time when the story takes place) though.

With characteristic thoroughness and objectivity, Dr. Walston presents the merits (and dangers) of the various schools. A helpful addition is the chapter dealing with degree mills--what an eye-opener! Thank you, Dr. Walston, for your continued labors to see that students get a \\"fair shake\\" in their educational pursuits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Text","review":"This is a great text with lots of facts that help clear away the smoke-screens that so many bogus schools use to confuse students and steal their money. Without this book, I would have been a victim. I have three copies of this text so I can loan two out, but I always keep one. No one gets their hands on that one. This has become, for me, the distance learning bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"The required source for distance learning criteria!","review":"Walston's guide is the premier source for distance learning. Anyone who needs to know about \\"diploma mills\\" or other \\"schools\\" who are allowing the student to \\"buy\\" a degree with little or no work must have this book. It answers the questions of what is \\"accredited?\\" When is an accredited degree important? It points out the schools to use and the schools to avoid. All of it is done from factual research and materials submitted by the schools themselves. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best One Out There","review":"WALSTON'S GUIDE is the best book out there on this topic, i.e., Christian distance learning. He not only gives very clear guidelines about how to judge a school--because there are a lot of diploma mills out there--but he also lists more than 200 schools and explains what they offer through distance learning. Not only that but his good humor throughout the book was a pleasant surprise. I found myself laughing at many of his humorous comments. His delightful humor alone could have kept me turning the pages of this book, but the information about distance learning was the real meat of the book, and the combination of the two is a gold mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Resource","review":"I found this book very helpful. The author explains the value of education and the various types of education that is availible. He navigates well through the weeds of schools that are out there.

God Bless"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't leave for school without it!","review":"Walston's Guide is the first and last word on Christian distance learning.

But for everyone else, listen for the voice, ignore the lyrics, and hope for better material in a future release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Debut","review":"After buying \`I Am A Bird Now' and being completely captivated I quickly went out and bought the self titled debut CD by Antony and the Johnsons and if you enjoyed their second album it is a pretty safe bet you will enjoy this as well. It is mostly in the same style and still has Antony's wonderful and unique vocals. I love \`Atrocities' and the piano playing throughout this track is both melancholy and beautiful. I also adore the chorus on \`Divine' which raises a smile every time I play it. This took me a few more listens than IAABN to fully get into it and I found the strings a little more obtrusive on some tracks, but once you do you will be just as enraptured and impressed. The artwork is original and unusual but that sums up Antony and the Johnsons perfectly, original and unusual, but always great. Well worth checking out at some point.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite albums, ever","review":"I should start by saying I'm usually not a fan of music that's this theatrical. But Antony's voice is one of the most gorgeous and powerful instruments I've ever heard, and paired with the lyrics on this album, one imagines him as a mournful angel trapped halfway between heaven and hell. I've had this for several months, and I still listen to it almost daily. It's stunning, and I can't recommend it highly enough.A side note: I saw Antony perform in San Francisco and was surprisingly unimpressed. He played some songs that just weren't my taste at all, and his vocal delivery was a bit weird. In fact, he was outperformed by CocoRosie (whose albums are wonderful as well, by the way). But I remain a huge fan of Antony's, and I can't wait to hear what he and the Johnsons release next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerizing.","review":"Really, no words can describe this CD. It is the most tragic and beautiful collection of songs I have ever heard in my short life. Setting the mood with eerie opener 'Twilight' Antony and his Johnsons could not have got off to a better start. A dark song, with an echoing crescendo. 'Cripple and the Starfish' follows, and this would probably be my favourite. Just listen to it. Song three, 'Hitler in my Heart' has the most beautiful ending a song could ever have. I could go on, but do yourself a favour: Get the CD, turn the lights out, and lay down on the bed. And listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Helpful","review":"This book was very helpful.

Really it's just my opinion but the book was not all that great I really don't understand the 40 some odd people who gave this book 5 stars! First of all it starts out slow and her writing style and dialogue just didn't work for me I couldn't get into it. It was a struggle it did start to grab my attention in the middle though. There was definitely way too much focus on name brand clothing, which took away from much of the story line. Also timing was off, I was confused because the book started off with Kisa's 21st b-day party but later on in the book she was turning 21 again?? I honestly don't know how old the chick was when the book ended or how much time went by during the whole story. It was a mess!

Earth One and Two are here, as are Frank Miller's 'Dark Knight' Universe, Alex Ross and Mark Waid'sKingdom Come, and a plethora of others.To say more would be to give away the plot. Suffice to say that Dorkin's allowed free reign, and uses it to spectacular effect.The only caveat I'd make is that it's best to be well aware of the history of the DC Universe before reading this.

Based in large part on interviews with over 70 pilots and aircrew, Dorr's book covers the whole sweep of Marine aviation from Grumman Wildcats to McDonnell F/A-18 Hornets.In the fifty years of air combat covered by Dorr, the Marines flew a variety of aircraft in harm's way - Wildcats, Corsairs, Skyraiders, helos, Skyknights, A-4s, F-4s, Intruders, you name it. Whatever your interest in Marine aviation, there's something for everyone in this book -dogfights, air-to-mud, rescue missions in early helos, etc. A few familiar names and tales crop up - John Bolt, John Cummings, etc. - but, by and large, the first-hand accounts are new and very interesting. The text is well-illustrated with over 100 black and white photographs.All in all, a good introduction to flying Leathernecks in action."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for Marines stationed at MAG-12","review":"A detailed account about Marine aviation with a strong focus on fixed wing aircraft in WWII, Korea, and Vietnam.

It's got a good variety of colors for light skin tones. The product however doesn't meet up to my expectations. I've got combination skin with areas of large pores. This product, even when combined with a foundation primer, doesn't sit well on my skin. The coverage isn't that bad really. But it looks a bit caked on, and seems to emphasize my problem areas. The Light finishing powder is the only one of this set that I may order in the future. It's got a very delicate texture that covers all areas of the face, including under the eyes, without settling into lines, dry skin, or other trouble areas. The blush didn't have good coverage at all. It has no lasting power. The color it gives is useful for a very subtle glow, but as it doesn't last on the skin it is only good for short periods.

Finley's discussion of the Greek household, or oikos, is especially good, as are his insights on giftgiving. The world that Homer sang of is a stark contrast to the more familiar, Classical Greece, and yet the seeds of that Greece (and hence our world) are already recognizably there. Perhaps they are there in a truer, less alloyed form.The only regrettable part of this book is the second appendix, a speech that Finley later gave on Schliemann. It is full of such professional bitterness that one begins to doubt Finley's decency. The publisher produced a gem of a book, but it should seriously consider removing these few pages in future editions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent insight into Trojan War Era Greece","review":"All of Finley's books, are the best analysis of the ancient world.

Finley is considered a classic about Bronze Age Greece, and it is. And with an introduction by Bernard Knox is always interesting.

I am sure that camp about the Greeks and Homer are divided between those who agree and those who don't.

I agree with another reviewer who said he really needs to get over the Montreal screwjob and realize that Michaels has really changed for the better.

It reads like a movie sequel; the characters are less personally rendered and the plot is more grandiose. As an eleven-year-old, I was excited to meet Tia and Tony now that they have refined their skills at Witch Mountain, but even at that young age I recognized that Return lacked the intimate character and plot that made Escape (and The Forgotten Door) so magical.

I can not believe 3DO could release a game and not test it with a USB port!! This makes the game unplayable. Second, Home Run Derby crashes in the middle and brings you back to your desktop. I could sit and list the problems I had once I FINALLY got a game going but I can summarize by saying-this is the worst game ever put out for the pc.

He is good enough in the role that he earned a Golden Globe nomination. Director James Sadwith won the Emmy for the best directing of a TV movie. The first half is the best, dealing with the earlier years and covering a lot of ground from his childhood up through his comeback in the 1950s. The second half feels a bit rushed, as it deals with his tempestuous relationship with Ava Gardner and his marriage to the much younger Mia Farrow. Had they waited a year or two, they may have been able to dramatize his 1993 chart-climbing comeback with the \\"Duets\\" albums.

A far more poignant ant-war novel - \`Johnny' is a novella at best - would be Ron Kovak's \\"Born on the Fourth of July.\\"The story of Johnny is, nonetheless, one well worth experiencing; the printed word is not, however, the best medium for sharing his experience. The film adaptation is little better, but clips from the film and dialogue from the book are artfully blended in the 1989 music video \\"Two of One\\" by Metallica.While I usually pooh-pooh film adaptations of literature and am not particularly a fan of heavy metal, this recommendation flies in the face of most, if not all, of my previous reviews; I stand by it!Skip the book, skip the film, buy the music video and share Johnny's nightmare with the audio cranked up as high as you can stand it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame, weak ending!","review":"Johnny Got His Gun is not something I would suggest to someone to read. Who wants to hear about a guy's memories from his life who is pretty much dead. He also shows no pride in fighting for his country, he should have taken his medal with honor. In the end the author could've at least made up something a little more exciting. I read through a whole book to find out that the world is going to shun him away, even though he was smart enough to learn how to communicate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much going on to keep me interested.","review":"For our Senior English class, we read the book \\"Johnny Got His Gun\\" as an assignment. In my personal opinion, the book was not very interesting to read. When the book started out, there wasn't a whole lot going on and that turned me away from liking the rest of the book. The author had an interesting idea to write a book from the views of a wounded soldier who lost his whole body except for his chest and half of his head, but there just weren't too many interesting events going on. Joe really irritated me, too, because it seemed like he was not proud at all to have fought for his country in the war and that he was the only soldier who had to suffer after being wounded. This is not a book that I would recommend to many people who like books with action in them."},{"rating":"1","title":"It wasn't the most interesting book I've read","review":"This book was very hard to follow at the beginning. It got much easier to follow at the end. It was one of the most anti-war books that I've ever read. This book had to many things brought back from Joe's life. Maybe if we have known him better we could have enjoyed it a lot more. Joe's explanation of war was who needed it. So Joe's history was that he had regreted going to war."},{"rating":"2","title":"He sure did; didn't he.","review":"This book is often on the banned book list during wartime. Sah shame. Suppose it's hard to be heard without mouth arms and legs."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars but somewhat spoiled by author's own intrduction","review":"In his introduction to his own book the author implies that the book might have been valid for World War I but not for World War II. \\"If the book had been banned {in World War II) I doubt that I should have protested very loudly,\\" he says. He follows this up by saying \\"World War II was not a romantic war.\\" He seems to feel World War I was a \\"romantic\\" war. Is he saying that soldiers are not wounded in this way in non-romantic wars but are wounded like his Johnny only in \\"romantic\\" wars? Is he saying that it's all right to be a pacifist during a \\"romantic\\" war but not in a non-romantic war? In any case, I found his introduction dismaying. The book itself I regard as a protest against all wars. It's hard to understand how someone could write a great book like this and have such a split attitude."},{"rating":"2","title":"A subtle classic you've probably overlooked","review":"The book is an amazing plunge into the human mind. The more you read, the more engrossed you become...Some of it is stomach churning, some heart wrenching...However, it feels too real for you to take comfort in saying: \\"It's only a book\\". Although a complete work of fiction, it is as real as any autobiography I've read. It is thought provoking, inspirational and has a depth that varies depending on the reader. A friend of mine read it and took a completly different meaning from it...He couldn't see what I saw so it's definately a disscusion book, one to share with your friends...My copy has been passes around and around and around and we still talk about it. I definately recommend this book, especially for teenage boys and philosophers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required Reading","review":"This book, which was once banned in the US, should be required reading in high school, and mandatory reading for anyone running for public office. It is particularly relevant today as we deal (or fail to deal) with casualties of our military actions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended","review":"A good book for what it is. Joe Bonham is a kid who through war ends up having no legs, arms, ears, mouth, and nose. He has no way to communicate to anyone or anyway to hear anything or see anything around him, so he is basically alone in darkness with only his thoughts of war and life to accompany him. This book is really good, although not the most climatic, it is good on the level that it brings to light the tragedy of war and is very thought provoking in its attempt to speak of death from the point of view of someone who is basically dead. The extremeness of Joe's case is an exaggeration for a reason and the reason becomes very clear through the reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughts on war","review":"It may seem redundant to add to the other dozens of reviews of Johhny Got His Gun but I just finished reading it and had to add my congratulations for the author's message.I went to Vietnam much like Johnny: I was patriotic, I thought my training as an anesthetist would help to save lives and I was essentially drafted.I had worked in civilian hospitals with trauma patients. But nothing prepared me for what I saw in the evac hospital: the suffering and total waste of human life and potential...conexes full of amputated limbs. Since then I've seen the survivors in V.A. hospitals. We have no idea of the numbers of crippled soldiers just from the latest adventure in Iraq.Where are the Dalton Trumbos for today? Why do we have to learn the same horrible lesson each new generation?"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Book of All-Time","review":"Ive read this book over 15 times in about the 5 years Ive owned it. This anti-war story is a masterpiece with a message. Imagine being def, mute, blind and limbless from a WWI bomb...living is hell, because all you have to know you were alive is a brain and memories. This intense book is a must-read for everybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"johnny got his gun","review":"This is definitely the book that changed my life. My four years of military high school were meant to groom me for a promising military career, but I have now decided that I refuse to sacrifice my life or my freedom (like Joe Bonham did) for a government puppet-master who says that I fought for \\"the sake of democracy.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Johnny Got His Gun\\" is a one-sided story.","review":"This book is probably one of the most controversial books I have ever read. If it was not assigned for a class, I probably would not have ever read it. This book brought about a lot of discussion and a lot of arguments. It is difficult to understand how a man in this condition could be able to still live, let alone think rationally. I feel \\"Johnny Got His Gun\\" brought about a one-sided opinion of war and coming from a man such as Dalton Trumbo, I understand why the book has this view. I thought the stories about his life before the war were interesting but I don't think they were too relevant to the story. It was not written in an organized fashion, therefore a lot of people had trouble following it. I would not have picked this book out for myself to read and I did not really care to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Writing, Bad Message","review":"I thought Dalton Trumbo did a fine job of writing, it took a lot of talent to write that book. I also feel that the message that he was trying to portray was horrible. I don't like the way he is so anti-war. I am in no way for war at all, but I also do feel that there are some things that we have to fight for. WW1 was one of those instances. When you are selected to fight you must do it with honor cause you are fighting for your country. Joe was not put into that horrible state for nothing, he was put that way while he was fighting for his country. Dalton Trumbo needs to realize that even though war is such a horrible thing, it is the reason we live the lives that we do. We live lives of freedom. It is to bad that men had to lose their lives doing it, but that is why I honor them every year. On a final note, this is not a book that I would have my students read, I definently would not promote Trumbo's message."},{"rating":"2","title":"One that begs to be read and thought of indefinitely...","review":"This book of Trumbo along with Remarque, Yeates, Sasson, and Lawrence are essential post world war literature. I read this book at the advice of one of my teachers at the close of my high school years and it is as thoroughly potent now as it was then. No mistake about that. It is indellible.Neither is it I believe a pacifist's book. It is simply too pristine in its integrity to be presented as nothing other that as an indictment of war and its protagonists. No mere slogan or quaint remark will do to bind its experience.This story begs to be told wherever a young man glosses over volumes of Kipling and Tennyson."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!","review":"This book is the most incredible book I have ever read. Literally, I could not put it down from the moment I got it until the last word. Although the lack of commas made the book difficult to understand, I quickly grew used to it, and even had trouble adjusting to normal punctuation. I am very disapointed by some of the other people who reviewed this book however, because the name of the character is not Johnny, it is Joe. I absolutly agree with the novels anti-war theme, and with the current situation in Kosovo, this book should be required reading in every high school English class."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO/SO","review":"I feel that I would have liked this book if the style of writing would have been different. This book showed the real horors of war. I do not agree with the anti-war theme. War will never be shot out of the big picture. If I would have to fight, it would be easier if I was old enough to know the true meaning of \\"war\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather read it than write a paper.","review":"I think that this book was wrote bad. I think that the author was unable to think of things that interested people so instead he decided to bash American patorism. The book tried to tell us that war was so bad and that you never get credit for it. He continually cares nothing of the metals that he recieved for his actions. All I have to say is that he should live in Bosnia where you have no choice and you get no credit."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book about a man who felt cheated by war.","review":"This book gave me the impression that the author thought that war shouldn't be fought. His true feelings come out in his main character Johnny who feels that his life was taken away from him by war. I really didn't care for this book. I don't agree with the authors point of view. I feel that he was bias towards war and tried to push that upon his readers. I don't feel that his book gives a true perspective of how all war vets feel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great.","review":"I was excited for this book when I got it. After reading the first hundred pages or so the first day I put off finishing it. Why you ask? Nothing ever happens. He lays in the bed and thinks about his life. It is an interesting concept, but I would prefer to take out about two hundred pages of the author's ranting about war. A good short story at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agitprop","review":"Brilliant but primitive agitprop, designed to scare the slack-jawed set. Literary value leaves much to be desired - the book is brutish and straightforward, no trace of irony or any ambivalence whatsoever."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE GREATEST NOVEL EVER WRITTEN!","review":"Recently, major cities have started a program in which one book is chosen to be read (voluntarily, of course) by the entire community. For now, and for always, there is no better book for anyone and everyone to read than this one. It's message is timeless, its story is heart-rending and its power is unrelenting. There are no other words except to say it is the greatest book ever written. Don't take mine or anyone else's word for it. Read it for yourself. You'll never forget it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Johnny Got His Gun wasn't worth it","review":"I thought the book \\"Johnny Got His Gun\\" was an okay book but nothing too spectacular. Johnny's attitude toward the war and government in general really disappointed me, though. As a person who's had and has family in the military, I feel that his attitude that we're fighting for things we can't see is biased and one-sided. I am forever in debt to not just my family but many others for fighting for things we can't see. These men and women gave and would give their lives to give others all the things Joe was complaining about. I also feel that his attitude of self-pity was pathetic. Many others have been and will be injured in wars and I hope and have faith that their attitudes won't be like Joe's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting parts, but mainly BORING.","review":"This book held some interesting parts and views, but as a whole it was extremely BORING. I read this book in senior english and I had to force myself through 90% of it. Anit-War? More like anti-freedom. The character of the book was unbelievably prejuiced against waht many hold dear. Trombo has hit a book that I refuse to recommend to anybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Johnny Got His Gun: A Teenager's Review","review":"Before I read Johnny Got His Gun I feel that I really took life for granted. All the little things about life suddenly seemed immensley important. Reading about a man with no physical abilites made me thankful for things I had believed to once hate, such as running the mile in gym or being forced to eat my vegetables at dinner. Occasionally Johnny Got His Gun would become very repeticious. A small noncomplex idea would take the author a entire chapter to describe. However, overall I enjoyed this book very much. Not only did it make me value life but also taught me about the dangers and consequences of war."},{"rating":"1","title":"great book - bad print","review":"I was struggling to read this book until I compared it to another paperback.

As soon as Hitler turned on Stalin, Trumbo pulled the book from print and became a strong advocate for U.S. involvement in the war. When several isolationists and pacifists contacted him for support a year after the book was published, he turned them in to the FBI.He only rediscovered his pacifist beliefs and republished the book in 1971 because the U.S. was again threatening communist expansion (in Vietnam).The moral of the book is that no ideal (mainly freedom) is worth dying for. This is a flawed argument for pacifism as many pacifists have died for their beliefs (Ghandi, Martin Luther King). For a better book about pacifism, read Ghandi's autobiography. While Johnny Got His Gun is interesting for it's 1930's language, the book's version of pacifism is nothing but dishonest, shameful propaganda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Work of a total hypocrite","review":"The second review says it all. Trumbo was a pacifisr as long as Hitler and Stalin were buddies. Hitler would have loved this book aa a means of damaging allied morale. An evil, disgusting pice pf wprk."},{"rating":"1","title":"A story that has no story inside it.","review":"I didn't really care for this book at all. All that happened was his flashbacks. It wasn't even really a story. It's just a guy remembering some stuff that happened a long time ago. The ending was probably the most unclarified part of the book. Al;l of a sudden the book just ends, you don't find out what happens. This book is not worth the time to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"WHAT DO WE GET FROM WAR? ONLY WOUNDS STARVATION AND DEATH?\\"","review":"READING THIS BOOK HAS NOT ONLY CHANGE MY MIND ABOUT MANY THINGS BUT IT HAS ALSO STRENGTHEND MY OUTLOOK AND OPINIONS ABOUT WAR AND HOW IT MAY EFFECT SOMEONE. I RECCOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE WHO MAY NOT LIKE OR DONT UNDERSTAND WAR OR WHAT IT IS LIKE GOING THROUGH A SITUATION LIKE THE YOUNG MAN IN THE BOOK. I ESPECIALLY LIKE HOW THE AUTHOR EXPRESSED WHAT THE CHARACTER WAS THINKING ABOUT."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than just an anti-war novel- a novel exploring the mind","review":"Johnny Got His Gun may be advertised as the greatest anti-war novel ever written, but it's much more than just that. The story of the quadripeligic, blind, deaf, mute, senseless WWI veteran lets the reader look into the thoughts of a virtually dead man; a man who has no knowledge of the outside world at all. A truly incredible book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I'm usually not one to pick up a classic, but my dad recomended it, and it caught my interest. It's about this guy who wakes up in a hospital bed and slowly begins to realize he has no arms, legs, face...he's blind and deaf, and he can't talk, cuz he was in a war. I started reading it the minute I got it. It captures you from the first page! I read it in just under a day, cuz I could never put it down. I'm 15 year old and I say it's one of the greatest books I've ever read. It's amazing. You go through all the emotions while reading it. One minute u may be laughing, the next, near tears.

YOU'LL AGREE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I am force to write a paper on this book!& I love the book!","review":"I think every person that thinks war is glamourous should read this book. I think all the folks who are living \\"for today, not tomorrow\\" should read this book, about a stump. This stump was once a human being and now is a legless, armless, eyeless, mouthless, earless living creature that feels. He once had arms and legs and remembers all the good things that he did with them. We should all just thank god we have our limbs and eyes, nose, mouth and ears. I do and this book made me realise how precious these body parts are. Kids should read this before they leave High School."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was BORING","review":"This book was a waste of my time. I did not like the story about the antiwar.

Just like Salinger did in Catcher in the rye and Huxley in A Brave New World. The book deals very little with war itself and how he was injured or what he saw, but does instead talk non-stop and ad nauseam about the soldier's life before he was injured. He describes his father in sad detail and rethinks all the things he should have done and his lost love. Again, classic major depression and NOT an anti-war book."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst book ever","review":"the only reason i read this book was because it was on the top 100 horror books. But it was the worst book i have ever read. The author goes and tells the reader, a man should never fight for anything. honor, freedom, and liberty are just made up by \\"the man\\" so a teenager can go fight and die. The author goes on to say the if a man dies in the process of saving his wife from being raped he was not noble in his actions. I just recently came back from Iraq and fought for freedom....and i'd do it again in a heart beat. for the people who agree with the author maybe you should leave this great country of ours and live some where else."},{"rating":"1","title":"very graphic","review":"this book is abselutely horrifying.this guy goes to the army and gets blown up............only he lives, well sort of.hes fully dismembered,and is blind,deaf,mute and horribly disfigured.he cant smell either because his face is all blown away.and the entire book is about whats going through this guys head.its f'n sickening.eventualy he begans banging his head in morse code.\\"kill me kill me kill me kill me......................\\".its truly sickening.and whoever that hippie is that wrote it should be locked up because hes demented."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book, but 'farewell' is better","review":"I enjoy this book, although I think 'A Farewell to Arms,' is the surperior anti-war novel.

Whose idea was that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I hate to read.... BUT I COULDN'T PUT THIS BOOK DOWN!","review":"I first had to read this book for my English III class. I thought that it was going to be torture to have to read a book I didn't even choose! But, once I started reading I couldn't put it down! This book is full of inspiration for everyone.

I loved this book and I recommend it to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Realizing the POWER of one's mind.","review":"When all you have left is merely the power to think, you might be suprised just how powerful your brain/mind is. Joe was able to accomplish many difficult tasks by simply taking the time and brain power to do it. I thought this book was an excellent eye-opener to a lot of subjects. By reading this I was able to see exactly how I felt on certain subjects, war especially, considering this book sends a strong anti-war message. I think I speak for a large majority when I say the ending was rather dissappointing, yet it gives you the chance to hope for the best and decide for yourself what happens to poor 'ol Joe!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong message, but annoying character","review":"I thought this book sent a very strong, one-sided anti-war message that leaves an impression on the reader. Personally I do not agree with the message totally because it is to rash. I don't believe that a soldier would feel the way the character in the book did. I can't imagine being able to live the way he did, but I also can't believe his attitude. He thought the whole world was against him, but he didn't help them much by reacting the way he did and I think something could have been done to the ending to keep it from turning out so weak. Over all, I felt the book left a lasting impression on me even if I didn't totally agree with the message and the character."},{"rating":"1","title":"First half of the book was boring.","review":"What can a man do without legs, arms, eyes, a nose and a mouth? In the Book, \\"Johnny Got His Gun,\\" by Dalton Trumbo, Joe was a man who had survived the war. While laying in the hospital, (he didn't know where he was) he noticed that he had no arms, legs, etc. One thing he later noticed that he did have was the sense of touch. The first half of the book was about his memories of family and friends. The second half of the book got more interesting, because he found out he can use his final sense as a way of communicating. I HAD to know if they understand what he was doing, and if they thought he was crazy or not. The ending of the book was totally different from the way I thought it would end. So, I guess, in a way, this book was a good one, if you like books about the outcome of what a war can do."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS BOOK CHANGED MY LIFE.","review":"I read this book when I was 13. It may have seemed a bit mature for me but when I read it, I was moved. From what you see and hear on TV all that enters a young mans mind about war is a patriotic heroic act. After I finished reading this brillient peice of art, I sat in my room for around an hour with teary eyes and thought about how horrible war is and yet we are engaged in one right now. For some it may be patriotic and heroic to die or be injured in war, but this book showed me that war is a horrible act. I suggest buying it or reading it or whatever because this book is to powerful to give up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"I loved this book. You might find it interesting because I am a Conservative and should be warning everyone about this type of book. Trumbo really gets to the core, the root of war and the feelings it brings up.

The only reason I slogged through this mess is that I have read and enjoyed all the other Karp/Ciampi outings.The characters in this book are reduced to charicatures The bad guys are Snidely Whiplashes in that they leer, sneer, sweat like pigs and have no redeeming characteristics to humanize them at all. When they get their comeuppances, which one can forsee the instant they are introduced, there is no satisfaction for the reader because the end is so obvious.Butch is tired, Marlene got boring, Lucy is barely there and what's up with the cowboy and the mystic??? Morlochs and mole people, oy, give me a break!The plots, there are 3 or 4 or - who can keep count? - are totally without subtlety and verge on the preposterous.To sum up: too much, too little, too bad. Are we sure Robert Tanenbaum really wrote this book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mourning the passing of Butch and Marlene","review":"I won't bother with a synposis of the \\"plot\\" in this pale version of the fabulous Butch and Marlene series. As a long time fan of Robert Tanenbaum, the man who was taking credit for these wonderful books, I was flabbergasted to discover he was using a ghostwriter (Michael Gruber). Since they ended their agreement, the last two books have been totally disappointing. I read Fury just to see if the old spark might have returned. . .but no. The writing style is juvenile. . .the prose is flat. . .and the wry humor is gone. The only reason to read this book is to marvel at how truly abominable it is. Rest in peace, Butch and Marlene."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring back the Ghost Writer, (please)","review":"It is truly a bad sign when you're on page 296 and are still hoping that the book will, at some point, start getting good. When an author believes that those fans who have read every book in this series need to be told about every character in every previous novel, that is also a bad sign. When characters suddenly act completely out of character (Lucy's decision, for example), that is another bad sign. The only good sign is the sticker on the front of the book that says \\"Sacramento Public Library,\\" which means I didn't waste any money on this book, only several hours of my life. I am going back to reading Ken Goddard."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disapointment","review":"For the first time, I put down one of Tanenbaum's book without finishing it. I found his characters stereotyped (I wouldn't be surprised if Rev. Sharpton sued) and plot lines absurd. I had a similar but not as strong reaction to Hoax. After reading some of the reviews here, I discovered that he had a co-writer who may have been the heart of his previous books.

But no more Tanenbaum for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck happened???","review":"I know this review is very much after the fact, but I couldn't not write one. Unfortunately, I read an earlier Tanenbaum book about Butch and Marlene immediately before this book. That only served to highlight the differences (and they're not good ones) in the new book. It's like a completely different author wrote the new book (and from previous reviews, I'm gathering that it really WAS a different author!). The tone is completely different. The relationship (especially the humor) between Karp & Marlene, which made the books absolutely delightful for me, is totally absent. I'm sorry, but I loved the renegade part of Marlene. Gone. I realize that some readers don't like all the personal details, but that was what made the books a cut above the usual legal and detective fiction for me. A big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complicated, too many characters, not enough journey","review":"More than half of the book was spent introducing a dizzying array of characters with remote connections. The last part of the book read like a mad dash to pull together all of the sub-plots and characters into a single picture. There were allusions throughout of what I can only guess were previous books, but those references only made it more complicated and caused the book to lose whatever sliver of focus it had. Finally, the book was completely ridiculous in some spots (think James Bond) and didn't leave enough mystery to want to keep you going."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Quite Bad Enough to Be a Trash Classic","review":"The plotting is nonsensical and racist, the writing hackneyed and often laugh-out-loud clumsy, the bad guys stereotypical. Once upon a time, Tanenbaum had a ghost writer who has evidently given up the Ghost. This book is so bad that I hate myself for reading the whole thing. I've read all the Tanenbaum/ghost writer books but this is definitely the last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful.","review":"I'm going to second the motion of the reviewer who wishes he had the time back that he wasted on this novel. There are brief flashes of the old Tannenbaum, but they are brief indeed. The terror plot was laughable. The courtroom drama was non existent, staffed with cartoon characters and deus ex machina device. To say that Tannenbaum has lost 'it' would be an understatement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Racism piled on so thick I couldn't finish","review":"I was going to count out the racist remarks for the purposes of this review, but quite literally the entire first 19 pages is dedicated to explaining how racist everything is, how racist the black man we are going to be following is, how he uses race to get ahead, how scared white people are of those scary black people, how racist the police are. I can't stomach reading this book. People still think this way? This is sick, I will never touch another of his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad for the good parts","review":"This story about Butch Karp and his wife Marlene and their brood, is a complete and total mess. What was a good story about NYC politics and back room dealings, that are based on a brutal rape, was a good premise. Then we have to have all of these subplots, including a Native American characters \\"dream\\" about a terrorist plot with a dirty bomby in Time Square. A visit to \\"underworld\\", as a tribute to HG Wells, and I wonder how drunk the author was when he wrote parts of this. I listened to the audio CD and Lee Sellars performance is very good, despite the subject matter. The fact that he takes this ridiculous story into a tease for the next book, makes me want to puke. Completely improbable situations compounded one upon another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adios Butch and Marlene","review":"This is the second book not written by Michael Gruber, and I was unable to get through it. The wonderful, deep, three-dimentional characters so beautifully developed through the first 15 of the series have been compressed into cardboard cut outs and are as dead as Julius Caesar. I barely got through the previous \\"Hoax\\" (what an appropriate title), but the buck stops here folks. Mr. Tannenbaum, or whoever is doing his writing for him these days, has mistaken depth of character with gory, vivid detail that will give any woman nightmares. Avoid this book. I cannot recomment highly enought the Karp/Ciampi books by the real author Michael Gruber but stop when you get to \\"Resolved.\\" Then start on Michael Grubers new series which are terrific."},{"rating":"1","title":"just a cheap watch w/ a compass","review":"i purchased this watch pretty much to save myself from buying one for about double the cost. when i received the watch i found out why:the band is what you would find on a very cheap watch / the box makes reference to being made in germany, however the watch clearly states, \\"made in china\\" / the directions were poorly translated / and the sealer of the deal for me was that the mode button was very poor - sometimes it would advance two modes ahead on one press, other times it wouldn't advance at all.i'm definitely returning itTAKE CARE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Bought this a year ago today actually.First of all...the band broke after one month...then...the casing started to wear showing that the casing is actually painted on...that is not the true color of the casing...and then...this weekend while on a hunting trip I noticed that no matter what direction I was headed...it always said NE.

It has an alarm that has never failed to wake me up, and a light you can press to see what time it is at night.I bought it, however, for a trip to France, as I thought the compass, the light and the alarm would be really useful. The compass, no matter how many times I \\"calibrate\\" it, by spinning it around clockwise (it recommends 3x) is never accurate, not in Miami, not in Paris and not in the Pyrenees, either.The batteries (it has two) are not the most common, but are readily available, and I had to replace them after one month.

The citrus press (the critical component if you do not wish to juice your fingers)I was able to purchase the complete juicer/press set from Kitchenaid directly. They said it's not normally sold as a separate item, but after I expressed my concern about putting my fingers so close to the spinning parts, they were able to locate one for me. They did suggest that it may be sold as the complete juicer/press in the future. I suggest that anyone thinking of buying this item should contact Kitchenaid as well.I gave this item as it is sold here one star because it is dangerous and messy.

The word powerful defines the most important problem and safety issue with this product: unlike other citrus juicers where the core will spin at a moderate speed upon the user pressing down, this will power into action as you press the \\"pulse\\" button on the machine and then spin so fast that it is very tricky to hold on to the citrus fruit, especially smaller ones like lemons and limes. If you slip, your fingers can get badly scraped by exposure to the spinning core. Did that twice and threw the thing out. It is not worth it! There are many great attachments for the KitchenAid Processor, this is NOT one of them. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful!","review":"I bought this attachment based on customer reviews which described a lid on the unit which holds the citrus in place. Well, KitchenAid must have \\"improved\\" it, because the unit came without any such lid. Consequently, you hold down the citrus with your fingers and can suffer pain and injury because of the speed of the processor spinning the reamer. Definitely not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product-needs instructions on use for lemons & limes","review":"I like to use this juicer every day for fresh citrus juice. I have learned that to juice small limes and lemons it is necessary to cut them in half first. Place one half at a time on rimer and than push the pulse buttom on and off- works every time. Great product but needs much better instructions in it's use. I like to strain the juice through a sieve- this gets out any random seeds."},{"rating":"2","title":"but wait, they're wrong. This works like magic","review":"The negative reviewers, obviously don't know how to use this handy attachment.It comes with a hinged citrus cover, for good reason. You place the fruit over the juicer, and lower the cover; sparing any contact between your hand, and the spinniung extractor. Gentle pressure is all thats required to fully juice any piece of fruit. If you're getting rind, simply stop the machine, re-orient the fruit, and continue. Its also got 2 spindles, for larger, and smaller fruit. As was mentioned, trying to do key limes(which are only about the size of a golf ball), well, there are more appropriate tools, as they are exceedingly small. Try a lemon reamer.

Fascinating lyrics, lovely melodies, a thoroughly pleasing mix of the wry, the melancholic, the absurd, the surreal, and the celebratory. Linda's singing is wonderfully controlled and understated, but Richard's is even better. He may lack her pipes but his delivery was never better.Most amazing of all, though, is Richard's impeccable guitar work. It is delightful throughout, but especially on the first two cuts. The extended fade out of \\"When I get to the border\\", where he trades licks with the concertina, would be enough all by itself to establish him as one of the great originals of the instrument.

After some 200 pages, my attempts to shake off growing annoyance at the author's cynicism and derision faltered. While I was open to the possibility that Mother Theresa might have had the same human frailties that we all share, I was disappointed that the author couldn't just accept that and move on. Instead, he seems to revel in gleefully attributing the most profane and egotistical motives to the reverend Mother's actions and words, but only rarely supplies any evidence to support his speculations. It seems at times that he is truly perplexed at the subject's motives, and thus failing to understand them, he merely constructs what he thinks should have been the rational approach.

Although the book is somewhat entertaining, it's a bit frustrating while reading when Steele failed (pretty bad, I might add) at illustrating the ecology of Coyote. There are a lot of things that do not make sense on Coyote. Granted Coyote is a fictional moon, which has a different ecology than Earth and organisms that we do not see on Earth, but it lacks a diversity of life to support an ecosystem. For example, there aren't enough animals on Coyote to have a food chain. What do the boids feed on? How do they get so big? There aren't intermediate predatory animals? There are other flaws throughout the book and too many to mentioned. Whoever the editor that edited his book didn't do a very good job at catching these flaws."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, Imaginative Sci-Fi Novel","review":"I'm not what you would call a huge fan of science fiction, but I found Coyote to be a compelling, interesting read. Coyote is a moon of a planet in a solar system many light-years from Earth. The action in the novel takes place well in the future, when the world has drastically changed. The U.S. is no longer, and what is in its place is particularly unappealing. The starship Alabama is about to launch when it is hijacked by its own crew filled with, instead of the intended party loyalists, social dissidents. The successfully make it to Coyote (and Steele gets them there with some imaginative sci-fi creations) and form the rudiments of a society.

Of course, since this is a science fiction book, the author can write anything he wants.

The book is not really a novel, but more of a collection of shorts around a central theme.The science in this \\"sci-fi\\" is uninspired and is secondary to the plot.The lack of common sense that would be included in the planning and execution of a space colonization voyage is appalling. The idea that an alien world, only observed by infrared spectrography would be no more hostile than the New England coast is laughable.The best alien creature the author could come up with are terror birds (he calls them Boids).The book is more an attempt to push the authors Progressive/Socialist politics than literature. And even that is amiteurish with him trying to equate libertarianism with one party fascism (its not, look it up)."},{"rating":"1","title":"good idea...bad execution","review":"The concept of the story is not bad....if you ignore the political absurdities...the science is off....but this was obviously meant to be more space opera than Hard SF.....forgivable.The style of writing totally sucked. Moving from present to past tense in various chapters....the style leaves little to be desired. The author needs to find a tense and stay there. It might also help to find one POV and stay there as well instead of jumping from 1st to third person in different sections.I read this book and the next...I probably won't bother to read anymore by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work on an xp platform!","review":"Don't get fooled by the great reviews if you have an xp platform!

I first saw the game at a friends house, on her computer she show me everything about it. Um I thought it was cool..anyways I'm a playstation fan and I would love to buy The Sims Hot Date... I would like to know will it be on the PSX. If not I will still buy it. Can't wait to check it out...."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of The Sims","review":"This expanshion pack is awsome. I'm obsessed with The Sims and I have all of the expansions except for vacation (I'm getting as soon as I can). Hot Date has been the best so far. It has tons of new interactions, new objects, new skins, and best of all you can go downtown! You have GOT to get this game!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enticing Cover","review":"Not only does this game look ten times as interesting as the other expansion packs, but I have to say (reluctantly), it looks incredibly sleazy. I thought the other two EP's were skanky, with the \\"love\\" bed and the cake dancer; but despite the seducingly enticing cover and reviews, this looks like the best EP yet! I gave it 4 stars (I have no doubt that it deserves five) just to leave room for one more. So my advice is to buy it while you can so you don't have to wait for any store to restock this anticipated Sims expansion pack. Besides, has Maxis actually produced any unsuccessful games? I think not, Sim fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you'd expect","review":"When I would read the previews for the game I guess you could say I got...\\"ginny\\". But when I made the stupid decision buying the game I relised everything is slow and even locks up your computer on occasion. Now, I have 124mb of ram and a pentium 4 proccesser. I can't imagine someone with the minimum requirements for this game trying to get it going. Of course any expansion pack for the Sims wouldn't be horrible to own but its not worth the price they put on it. I'm not really sure die-hard Sims fans will really get a huge kick out of this game either. The only decent part of the expansion pack is the extended buying mode. But remmember thats also in house party (not as big a selection but you see where I'm going with this). I know I sound like a fool but people save your money, wait for sims online or something. Your best bet for now would to buy house party."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is Hot alright","review":"I just got it, it's amazing .. best expansion ever ..

In this 3rd expansion pack for the Sims game you get a chance to do something totally different, take your Sim downtown!!! There are new walls, floors, and a bunch of new stuff to put in your downtown area to make a great store, restaraunt, or park. Don't worry, if you don't like to build you don't have to...just like in the other sims expansions there are pre-built buildings that are really fun to visit. I think the funniest things to watch are when you take your Sim on a date downtown you get to plant funny new kisses and moves on your date. There's also a wild animal in hot date that can attack you!!! Everyone must get this game!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"you will not know how the sims reach their heights...","review":"I think it is a very cool game because you can go downtown to meet anyone in the neighbourhood and the townies. Those users say the sims is boring, look again. There are thousands of things you can try...go to the mall, cafe, park, entertainment centre, you name it. What's more, the are 40 social interactions for your sims. What's the con? Simply almost to none. One thing is, the sims hot date is only \\"expand\\" sim adults' ability only. Can't a poor kid buy a candy or teddy bear at downtown or go downtown with an adult???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game!","review":"I like this game.

You will be able to take you speacial sim to a night on the town. You can build your own downtown you can make cafes ngihtclubs resturans etc. Downtown will also feature 2 beach plots in which to build on. There are over a 100 new items which in the build menu have a pink backround. Most of the new objects are for the downtown area but can be used in you home as well with exeptions. Such as the cash register. There are also several characters in the downtown area that are not playble such as an old lady. So overall this new expansion may be the best thing that happend to the sims since the big screen tv."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't work on Windows XP","review":"Wish I had paid more attention and saw that it is only for Win 98/ME When so many are going to XP you would thing they would make this run on XP.

From what I read it may not play on that very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good start to expanding The Sims","review":"I had the Deluxe Edition for about a year before I decided to buy an expansion. I purchased this one a few months ago because it had the downtown part to it. Finally, a way to get your Sims out of the house and to design restuarants and shops.I admit that this pack can get boring. I mean, how many times do you need to see your Sims go out to eat and buy clothes? However, there are other fun interactions that make your characters even more fun than if left without an expansion pack, especially the relationship/lifetime friendship bars for everyone in the neighborhood.Knowing about the other packs out there, this is a great starter. After using it for three months, I'm not tired of it, but I do look forward to buying an additional pack."},{"rating":"2","title":"The sims hot date beats it all!!!","review":"Wow! I love this game it's funny and cute. You can take 1 sim out of your house and go to downtown, where you can shop for Wedding, lingerie, casual, and swimsuits, Magazine's, jewelry, toy's, and candy! You can invite a sim on the phone, at your house, or even downtown. The object of the game is to get married even though I think it's funner not being married because you can't ask your spouce to go on a date. There are more things to do too! Sounds perfect huh well 1 of the only setbacks is children can't go (it's so unfair!) overall it's a great game!! :o)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it for the Downtown Area","review":"If like me you have found yourself devoting a neighborhood to a \\"social spot\\" just to see the sims interact without your control, then you'll find this expansion pack worth it simply for the new downtown area. You control one Sim downtown (of your choice) and your other characters come and interact. This impacts their relationship scores back in the neighborhood. Be the master of your own great social experiment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SOOOOOOOO CCCCCOOOOOLLLL","review":"My friend just told me that there was a new Sims game but I didn\`t believe it.Soo i went to this Sim website,and scrolled down.I couldn\`t believe what I saw.it was the new Sims Hot Date!I checked when it was gonna come out.I was like aaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwww mmmmmmmaaaannnn!It comes out Nov.14 or somethin.So I\`m looking forward to playing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Date Two Thumbs way, way UP!","review":"This game looks and sounds so cool!

A must for sim fans!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This game looks totally asome!!!!","review":"This game looks so cool!!! The other expansion packs looked really bad because they just gave you new items and stuff. This one is cool because you get this downtown area where there are shops and restraunts. You can get a date and go downtown. You can buy them cool things and the more you buy the closer you get to them kissing you goodby! There are over 30 new types of interactions, 125 new items, the downtown area, and tons of other stuff. By the way I give this game 5+ stars. I gave it two so I could find my review. I pre ordered mine off amazon so I Know for sure that I'll get it on time because I don't want to have to wait for stores to get this back in stock. If you are new to the sims and you want this game you have to buy the origanal \\"The Sims\\" or the game won't run on your computer. You don't need to get the liv'n large and house party expansion packs, but it makes it much more fun.

I didn't know what was going to be in it, but I couldn't wait to find out. I was hoping there would be teenagers with romances. After a month and a half of waiting I finally found out. I couldn't believe my eyes, even though there wasn't teenagers there was someplace to go. And that was the other thing I was hoping the new expansion pack would have. I was planning on just a dance club, but with that, restaurants, beaches, bars, parks, and more it was to good to be true. Then I wondered, well the date would be so short because of the time issue, but when I found out time stopped while on the date, that made it perfect. When House Party came out I thought they can't top this, but with this, I guess they did. This will definetely be the best expansion pack. If they make another one in the future, I don't know how they will top it, but hopefully it will have teenagers."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUPER EXPANSION PACK!!!","review":"This is a great super-cool expansion for The Sims. More real, more interactions, you can go downtown, take a taxi, meet other people (not online, they're robots) and take your neighbor's downtown and date and it's really fun, this is a good expansion, you should get it like, today! if you MUST, discuss the price, forget it, this isn't for you..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soooooooooo Disappointing","review":"Boy oh boy. I was really looking forward to playing this game. So far, all it has done is freeze up my computer. Previously, I had the Sims Deluxe Edition with House Party and everything was groovy. Since I have installed Hot Date, I have yet to close the Sims normally...it always crashes my system. My system is well beyond the minimum in all aspects. I have also installed the recommended patch, after the first few crashes."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best expansion yet, but hardly worth it.","review":"This is an amazing expansion pack, but is not worth what it costs. I own all the expansion packs and the original game (obviously) and have spent enough to purchase something of a much higher value, such as a very nice MP3 player, a DVD player or a digital camera. If it's worth it to you, it's an excellent buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coolest","review":"This is the best one ever even better then The Vacation one It takes the game to a whole new level!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"EH 2...maybe 3 Stars","review":"The new objects are pretty good.

I would recommend this game, It is good the items are cools the interactions are cool. But here are some disadvantages.1. You need to have enough memory for this game for it to run at all.2. You need to have a fast enough, and enough disk space for this game to go faster, then a turtle with all of it's legs broken.3. People in the down town area can often times get stuck, and is pretty frusterating since you can't move them.But Maxis did exellent apart from those problems (other then problem 3, arent really their fault)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sims Hot Date, now my new love","review":"I first read about this expansion pack about 3 months ago, I figured that it would be a flop like the other 2 were, but when I got Hot Date for Christmas and began to play it, I was incredibly suprised. Mostly, I enjoy being able to let the Sims go out into the \\"world\\" and enjoy the great outdoors. And another thing that was incredibly funny, was how perfect the new actions seemed to imitate actual human behavior. Cuddling is the most entertaining thing on this game, a cute giggle and a yawn with a strecting arm. Of course though, there still is that great sense of jealousy, which I love, so of course, there are still a couple of slaps going around. I think that this game is wonderful, if you have The Sims, you have got to get Hot Date. It is incredibly entertaining!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed by all the hype","review":"Bought this for my wife, she was disappointed at best because of the limitations that no one ever mentions. Things like you can only control one sim while downtown and it seems to be extremely buggy even with the latest patch, sims and townies both get stuck and sims sometimes seem to \\"ignore\\" anything you tell them to do. It also requires a pretty hefty cpu and graphics card compared to the stock Sims game and other add on packs. It did seem to \\"settle down\\" after she played it for a while, but is much slower when downtown than when at home. If The Sims barely runs on your machine, Hot Date will completely kill your machine!The machine she plays this one is only about 6 months old a Sony VAIO FXA36, a 1 Ghz processor with 128 MB of ram and an ATI Rage Mobility graphics chip. I can upgrade the RAM to 256 and that might help."},{"rating":"1","title":"FRUSTRATION IN SIM CITY ----","review":"The game promises and delivers everything you ever wanted to do with your Sim, IF you can live with \\"Frozen Screen\\",\\"Game Crash\\", \\"Freeze Game\\", \\"Music Skip\\" and a million other bugs that I am sure that Maxis found quiet acceptable before shipping. This game would be their best yet if they would only patch it up. As for any sound problems: after installing this in 7 different computers and having the same problems, I have found that the sound problems are indeed, yet another bug that can and do slow the game down. This is in new machines and old alike. All Direct X intact and drivers upgraded. If you run it with only an installation of The Sims and none of the other Sims extension packs, you will run easier but will remain somewhat buggy. I expected more from Maxis. This game needed debugged before shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rekindling an old flame","review":"There's nothing like a little romance to spice up a boring life, and this expansion pack does just that. The area added is substantially larger than the game itself before this expansion. It is true that the downtown area is slow on my pokey 566 MHz Celeron, but not unplayably so, and the addition of stores, shopping, dining, and more makes up for the sluggishness. I had been bored with The Sims and had hardly played it in months, but Hot Date has rekindled my interest and kept it for hours and hours.As for problems with installation, not only did I have none, but it seems to have fixed a problem I had before when trying to exit Livin' Large after playing it in 1024 x 768 (a problem which was not solved by uninstalling and reinstalling or upgrading video drivers). The game runs better now than it used to, for me at least."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of all","review":"When my sims goes to downtown she just stands there all day. Doesn't move or goes to talk to anybody. I have to tell the sim to do everything. Waste of money and very slow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Again","review":"PLEASE not ANOTHER expansion pack!!! Why doesnt Maxis and EA focus on better things like The Sims 2, Simcity 4000, Simsville, and The Sims Online! The only reason I give this one star is because of the town feature, but then again you can do that in The Sims Online!! Also you can only patch up a game engine so many times!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"I thought this game was really bad.I got this game for my 11 year old daughter at christmas. the rating says 13 years old and older, but I thought they normaly over rate computer games and my daughter had The sims, so I didn't think it would be that much worst. When I saw what was in the game I stopped my daughter playing it. There was a love bed [that was very rude], there was a a love swing and a picnic basket that they kiss on. There was to much Love and kissing. I Think the game should be for teenages 15 years and older, not 13 years and older.I would like to say to parents with children under 15, DON'T GET THIS GAME!"},{"rating":"2","title":"just buy it.. !!","review":"it rox just buy it and u'll no wut i mean.. having pets is the best thing ever 4 the sims this is the greatest expansion pack! hears my order.. unleashed, hot date, superstar, house party, vacation, makin magic, then livin large.. btu they all still rock.."},{"rating":"1","title":"nah","review":"As much as I love the Sims collection, I've noticed it takes about five minutes longer for it to load with each expansion pack.

All under your command. You create a downtown and control one sim.There you can pick up someone to go on a date or use a phone to plan a date! Here there will be rewards, such as cuddling and making out. The objectsive of the game is to keep your date going as long as possible!

Admit it. I personally couldn't live without. But you know... the Sims just isn't enough. I mean you get bored of it, that's why Livin' Large was created. But even Livin' Large is boring. More items to buy and build, yipee. Big woop! I mean, c'mon you're Sims need to party down once in a while. That's why House Party was created. But what if you're sims aren't party people? What if they're more romantic and want to go out with there lovers. On a date perhaps... In Hot Date you have everything from every sims game you own and have installed plus more. Hot Date is going to be such a hit! You should definetely buy it. It's a great game. I can tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought it would be worth it, but its not","review":"This game is entertaining for the first three days, and then the appeal wears off. It takes a plethora of tedious and miniscule tasks to get one major thing accomplished.

So I greatly recamend this game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you thought the Sims was addictive enough...","review":"Ok, I'm completely addicted to the Sims. This expansion pack really added to the fun. I think the best part about it is, for the first time, you get to take your Sims out to \\"date places,\\" like shopping centers and restaurants. I don't know about your Sims, but mine tend to get a little stir-crazy and cranky when they haven't been out of the house in a while. I'm warning you, though: with this expansion pack, romantic relationships are very difficult to maintain (kinda like in real life!). Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Fun","review":"I love the Sims. Whenit first came out, i played it all day every day. With every expansion I would get back into the game again, but not this one. I only played it for about 3 hours and I was done. It takes FOREVER for things to load and its so chopy and I have a good computer. It takes up a lot of space. The other problem is that they think its so great to have a few new furnishing and floors and wallpapers, but you can download practically anything you want from the internet. The internet is just like millions of expansions packs. You can download anything. This expansion sure didnt get me hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"When will it stop?","review":"First off, I loved the first game, and the first expansions where interesting additions to an already great and addictive game. However, these additions didn't a whole lot to gameplay except for giving you new skins and items for your house.

They take up soo much memory and then can run slow or you have to turn off all the extra items to get them to run that you lose some excitment. I bought a brand new computer just to help play the Sims Hot Date only to find that it won't play on Windows XP. Bigger problem is that Maxis states that they won't write a patch to fix this problem. You can't buy a computer now days without XP and it won't run on Windows 2000 either. Good luck to all those who don't know like me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best expansion pack yet!","review":"If you are a fan of the Sims game, this is for you.Creating a downtown area is fun because you have an unlimited budget. Plus the buy icons have been organized into catagories to make it easier to find what your looking for. There are new skins and heads (true, you can download clothes and items off the internet but they're never as good as the ones included in the games.)I would say it's the best of the three expansion pack since it add a new element (leaving the home.) Hopefully in the expanisons packs to come, will be able to go to more places (maybe to work?) If you don't raise your expectations extreamly high, then you definetly wouln't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would like to give 5 stars, but....","review":"I would really love to give this game a 5 star review, but there are too many bugs in this game if you are running Windows 2000. I was able to run The Sims, The Sims Living Large and The Sims House Party with NO PROBLEM while running Windows 2000, and all Hot Date ever does is crash right when I'm starting to have fun. Until Maxis releases a patch to fix this game, do not bother buying it if you are running Windows 2000.PS - if you don't believe me about all the problems with this game, feel free to visit thesims.com website and check out the message boards/BBS - there are a ton of posts about people having problems with this game, and there are also posts from people who love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Expansion to a Already Great Game","review":"This is a great addition to your game. While past expansions have simply offered new objects, jobs and skins. Hot Date takes it up a notch by introducing a whole new enviroment. Now instead of mearly sitting around the house, your sims can now roam around downtown to their hearts content. This also adds a multitude of new social interactions such as leap into arms, or snuggle together at the couch as opposed of the traditional five hugs in a row to get those relationship points up. The only evident downside is that with the new interactions it now gets harder for your sims to get to the level of marriage. However that is only a minor detail, and only requires a little bit of work to surpass. Overall a great game."},{"rating":"1","title":"No","review":"This is the worst game ever.

It's not like in the other 3 Sim games, I must agree with 2 star or less people, this game needs to be debugged. The items and such are great the 1st time, but get boring the next. I dislike the Gossip reaction-this should've been left out the game. It's like Barbie and Ken going Sim, though worse.

The place where you store your games and GBA in, and games, is onlt like 7\\" tall, and 4\\" wide.

The single zip aroung which is cheaper is also better quality. Don't waste your money on this.(Even though you probably got it for free. ) Any carrying case is better.

You cant fit many accessories inside and maybe three games."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a waste","review":"I bought this along with my GBA the day it came out. This is the same thing as the zip around case, but with a shoulder strap. It holds about six games if they are packed neatly and a GBA. It doesn't hold anything else.

Don't get this if you are big or planning to buy more than six games."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Game Case Ever","review":"I really think this shoulder holster is a great idea for Gameboy Advance because now you don't have to worry about leaving the usual case without straps somewhere and forgeting about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to see here folks, move it along.....","review":"Do not spend any of your hard earned cash on this. Even though I got it for free, I find it barely useful. Problems, oh yeah. First, it doesn't seem like it was actually designed for the GBA. Also, you are NEVER, repeat, NEVER going to wear this as a shoulder holster. The GBA fits inside sort of and I can almost fit a worm light in the case with the GBA. Almost! You can put a couple of games in a little mesh pocket insde with the GBA but when you open the case, WHOOPS, the pocket doesn't hold the games secure and they just fell out of the case. Hope you noticed. Tip for others, that game you lost, check under the seat in the car. I cannot possibly convey what a disappointing product this case has been.

The bristles fade halfway when you need to replace the head of the toothbrush.Oral-B claims that this toothbrush will remove as much plaque as regular brushing and flossing combined. They do make a great toothbrush; but I still use floss or a gum stimulant with a rubber tip to remove food particles after brushing with the toothbrush.If your dentist recommends this, good for you!

It makes my head think but my feet want to dance.In \\"The Girl That Broke Joe's Heart\\" he sings about being attracted to a girl who did his friend wrong. He has to choose between his own physical attraction to her and his loyalty to a good friend. What I especially like is that he doesn't demonize the girl, he just feels the sorrow of having to make that decision. I feel that sorrow along with him.\\"Sweeter Than Sugarcane\\" is a soft, bluegrassy ballad and \\"Leanin' \\" is a fun country rocker. This CD is so much fun to listen to.

I had to stop putting them in the top rack of my dishwasher because the plastic started getting dingy and lost its transparency (let's be honest, we need to simplify our lives, isn't that why we bought it in the first place). The locking mechanism loosened and you had to wiggle the bowl locked. The shredder cannot handle shredding large amounts of food. For example, when shredding motzerella the shaft becomes very hot and starts to skip.(if you have one shred the motz by hand) For the price you pay you only get one cutting disk that slices very thin, you have to spend another [$$$] for a better grater/slicer. On the up and up the little bowl is a plus if you puree baby food, garlic, etc. and the control pad is easy to clean.

If you like slower moving mysteries, this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only if you are desperate!","review":"Basically it passes time. You can definately put the book down because you won't care what happens to characters.. The one thing I don't think any of the other reviewers have complained about is the horrible paragraphs about technical mathematics. If it is not Soccor it's linear equations.. is this fiction or a text?"},{"rating":"2","title":"surprisingly good","review":"As a bookseller who reads mostly spy thrillers and murder mysteries, this novel was surprisingly interesting. The writing is intelligent without being stuffy, the characters are well-developed. A thoroughly enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't put it down except to pay for pizza","review":"I love books that are just the right amount of eerie (can't do real scary stuff). This one was great. I said I would read a chapter while waiting for the pizza guy-- a few hours later I'd finished it.The novel is tightly plotted-- with some deliberate loose ends left, but all essential questions satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy, trite and cliche-ridden","review":"Dear Amazon.com, please make it possible to award a book NO stars. I purchased this book after reading all the rave reviews for it here. What a disappointment. The story's full of hack stereotypes, like the feisty, wise-cracking Jewish sister, the distracted, intellectual (he's a physicist) WASP husband, the studly kid's soccer coach who gets to be (big surprise) the potential extramartial interest. And then there's the embarrassing cliches: the young black woman who's forever saying \\"You go, girlfriend!\\" and the elderly English teacher WHO WEARS LAVENDER SCENT.Another reviewer felt that the main character wasn't very likeable. For me, the less-than-lovable heroine was the ONLY interesting thing in this sad mess.If you feel compelled to read this book, borrow someone else's copy or wait until it comes out in paperback, but please don't waste your money on the hardcover. Then save it for a brainless beach read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book...","review":"This book was a fun, easy read that I found entertaining. I cared about the heroine, Emma, because she seemed so real in her response to the tragedies she suffered. Two of my other favorite characters were Ida Green a no-nonsense psychic and Arthur, a libidinous book editor. I think you'll enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"predictable and full of cliches","review":"This was just an ok book if you are desperate for something to read. It was not at all thought-provoking and was full of stereotypes: the liberal, urban Jew - the uptight WASP - the soul talking, sassy black woman - the womanizing jock, etc., etc. The villain of the story could be picked out of the line-up after a few pages. To all this, add a cop-out ending and you have a very unimaginative story that has been told much better elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliched and predictable","review":"I love mysteries and ghost stories. But genre fiction doesn't have to mean poor quality. This book is one of the silliest compendiums of cliched characters, predictable plot, and derivations from B movies that I've ever read. I had the flu and needed light reading, and I'll grant that this is a mindless page turner, so the book has its uses, I guess. If your mind's fully functioning, though, read Minette Walters or Thomas Cook for spooky psychological thrillers, Edith Wharton or M.R. James for ghosts--not this nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I so enjoyed 'The Shore of Women' and had high hopes of a good read with 'Child of Venus'. No such luck. I did manage to finish it, although I found myself skipping and skimming much of it. Just plain boring. Never got into any real action at all, much of it was simple rambling and thoughts on paper. Maybe if I had read the first two in the trilogy, but even then I just don't think this book works well. I just can not recommend it. Try something by Sheri S. Tepper instead--or read 'The Shore of Women'."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Novels they made me read in High School","review":"Could this have been one of my first literary departures from reality? I don't know, but since then I have been an avid reader of Fantasy and other books of the like. But this is a great retelling of the Exodus story with a small furry mammal twist. Hazel was a strong leader even if Bigwig seemed to be the stronger. the real power and respect lay with Hazel. So it is in the human worl. Children can greatly benefit from reading thhis as it easily correlates with some of the baser sides of human society. I try to watch the film version of it at least once a year and I now want my children to enjoy this fantasy classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Couldn't put it down!","review":"I was not supposed to like this book. I don't read fiction. I certainly would not read a book about the life of a bunch of rabbits. Fortunately, I was forced to read it. It was required reading. My approach to required reading is this; I read a couple book reviews and the notes inside the cover. I then read the first couple chapters and then the last chapter. I wrap it up by listening to my other classmates talk about the book. I am very good at it and everybody thinks I have read these silly books. My plan didn't work with this book because after I read the first couple chapters I could not put it down. I just had to know what happened to these rabbits next. I told myself I would just read a little more to see what happens next. I kept saying that until I finished the book. It was absolutely outstanding!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Big adventure through small animals","review":"Watership Down is a book in the tradtion of all great adventure novels. An equal mix of humor, danger and suspense draws the reader into the rabbits world, eager to follow them on their journey from their doomed warren to Watership Down.Make no mistake; this is no mere child's tale of cute talking bunnies.

This is a beautiful story of loyalty, innocence and charm"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest books of all time","review":"This book was great and, for those who said it was horrible only found fault with the fact that it is about rabbits. The story is about rabbits and it wouldn't have worked with any other animals but rabbit's so get over it.If you get past that you will realize how great a book it is. The book is very detailed and for good reason, it sets the setting up perfect, to the point were you can smells the forset. It also gives the characters depth. I didn't fell like I was just reading about nobody but people I know. I'am a 13-year-old male and if you don't get the plot of this book you most likly work at burger king. A must read"},{"rating":"2","title":"MUCH better than I expected..","review":"I am typically more of a fan of fantasy style stories, so when a good friend recommended that I pick up a 500 page book about rabbits, naturally I was more than a little skeptical. I figured it was some children's story, and the foreward seems to allude to that as well, but at 500 pages and no \\"Harry Potter\\" in the title, I don't think many kids pick it up. After finishing the book, I couldn't agree more that this is indeed a must-read. As the book reached its climax, I couldn't put it down. For any fiction fan in the mood for a change of scenery, this book is a very safe bet."},{"rating":"2","title":"QUESTION","review":"I'm just wondering if the cover shown in this picture is the cover you actually get when you purchase the book.

Who'd a Thunk it?","review":"This review will be short as my hands have a hard enough time typing these days. I picked up this book a long while back with the idea of seeing what all the fuss was about. A story about a bunch of rabits? How can it be THAT good? After reading it, I absolutely loved it and subsequently went on to read \\"More Tales from Watership Down\\". I can't tell you how upset I am that the story ends there. But anyway, it's an incredible story that has me wondering if the author somehow had an \\"in\\" with this bunch of rabits and how could he possibly know all of this for it certainly seemed \\"real\\" and plausible in the telling. The fact that kids now read this in English Lit (it was new when I was in school) is great because that stuff can often be somewhat dull and hard to read. THIS however is NOT one of those. I will love this book forever and will probably be reading it again sometime soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"I once heard someone say that there are books we enjoy reading and books we enjoy having read.Watership Down is the former.This is a book I find myself coming back to again and again. The story is compelling, characters well drawn and well paced. A firm favourite."},{"rating":"2","title":"WATERSHIP DOWN","review":"Well written, imaginative, good adventure. In writing about rabbits you soon see the author bringing out the parallel to humans. Writers are always comparing people to wolves or lions or other predatory mammals. As Adams points out in this adventure tale, we are much more like rabbits. Brave rabbits, but still rabbits. Which, when you consider how ill equipped we are by Nature to defend ourselves (except with our minds), the rabbit comparison is much more apt.Adams does a good job and I can see why this book is becoming a classic.GvG"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Purchase!","review":"I have been listening to Watership Down on my commute to and from work.

I got to page 7 and stopped because it was torture. and I didn't get it why not make a story about humans not silly talking bunnies. And read stephen king or micheal chriton instead, I read this book to page 7 and nothing was happening. I HATE THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I was REALLY looking forward to this one. When I was a kid a friend of my mom's gave her a copy of this book. I remember wanting to read it because I respected the friend giving the book. Then Sawyer was Boone's reading copy on LOST. That gave it more weight. \\"Obviously, this is a fantastic piece of literature,\\" I thought. Sadly, I did not find that to be the case. There must be something wrong with me for not liking it. Maybe I expected too much. I was hoping for something a kin to Animal Farm, which this book is not. I'm very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"YOU NEED TO READ THIS REVIEW!! IT IS CRUCIAL!!","review":"Watership Down looks really good from the outside but was really boring and intolerable! I an only in sixth grade but I have read The Jungle, Animal Farm, The Accidental Tourist (I know I didn't spell that right , but I did read it!) and many more books like Moo, How Stella got her groove back and many more, but I could not stand this book! If you are looking for adventure, it is not in this book! If you are looking for cute and happy bunny books, this is not one. My teacher who used to be a principal said he would never in his right mind even think of reading this book. Warning: This book Is 494 pages of \\"Blackberry came from the meadow with cowslips and two female rabbits to mate with.\\" Oh man, this book should be banned from the planet! It's not an aligory like it looks either!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A big let-down","review":"I am a teenager and I read the whole book, I found it a total let down. So many people had said that it was a wonderful book. However I found it increadible boring and confusing. The author made up words so that you couldn't follow what the rabbits were saying, the only nice thing that I can say about it is the irony of the book and the little action that is in it. Also the rabbits are incredibly stupid, it isn't until they get to there destination before they figure out that they are a bucks and that they need to mate to keep their warren going. I would advise anyone to not buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"bunnies talk, walk, sleep, eat, and die.","review":"bunnies talk, walk, sleep, eat, and die. Wow...uh huh....that sounds fun. COME ON!!!!! IT WAS BORING!!!!! If an author's going to write about wars and society, use humans, not bunnies (!?) next time. And by the ways, who the hell keeps tallies of how many times they've read a book? It's so obvious it's fabricated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still hate it...","review":"I read this book ten years ago for a high school summer reading assignment. To this day I still hate it. For years I remember being freaked out by rabbits because of this warped little story. Perhaps I didn't appreciate its' literary worth, but as an avid reader, who is now a teacher, I would never recommend this book. It's endlessly long and having to flip to the \\"lapine\\" to look up words in rabbit language was disruptful to reading. I'm shocked to see so many praises for this book. It was wretched."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say Pointless?","review":"Stupid, and pointless.

The characters, are, as you've probabally heard by now, wild rabbits, but unlike most novels about animals, this one avoids the traps of sentimentality and anthropomorphism. The rabbits are taken seriously as characters - they have a well-developed culture and mythology and a distinctly lapine psychology. Mr. Adams did his homework for this one, and the result is a very interesting blend of rabbit lore and human athropology - some of the best parts of the book are the stories the rabbits tell of their culture hero El-ahrairah. No twee, Redwall-esque bunnies here, no sir.This book is one of my favorites; I read it once every couple of years, and it never looses it's charm. Highly reccomended."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Book.","review":"I finished reading this book today. I simply loved it! It is a book for all ages. A rabbit named Fiver predicts the downfall of his warren, and he and his brother gather followers and try to make their way to the downs so they may start a new warren. It was a wonderful fanasty-adventure story,a real page-turner. One of the things I liked about this story was that there was no hero; all the rabbits had an ability and helped the warren. My favorite parts had to do with another warren called Efrafa. The Lapine (the rabbit language) glossary and the quotes at the beginning of each chapter were special bonuses!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"This is a classic children's tale, but I swear that few stories are as compelling for adults as well. Yes, it's a story about bunny rabbits; but before you know it they've become real, viable characters that you care about. It's easy to suspend your disbelief and immserse yourself in the world of Hazel, Fiver, and the rest. Great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was writing better when I was five.","review":"Why is everyone so obsessed with this book? Let's see, it's nearly five hundred pages and covers the quest of - I lost count- some rabbits hoping to establish a new warren. Okay, sounds bearable, right? It takes 120 pages just to get to that point. They go through all these trials and tribulations while setting up and getting situated, on and on and on. By the time I reached the end, (it took some serious self-motivation,) I felt confused. After all the hype, all the wonderful things everyone says, this book is a sham. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless they had read every other book in the world and were desperate for reading material. (like me) This is the most dissappointing book I think I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing so Great about this book","review":"People nowadays use the words 'masterpiece' and 'classic' maybe a little too much. There are only a few fiction books I really love among all the ones I have read; this is not one of them.People have said ther is suspense in this book, but bewarned its only at the very verye end. In the beginning I was almost put to sleep by the rabbits and their endless journeys. I enjoy intellectually mature books- even long descriptive books (e.g. Tolkien, Les Miserables)- but I couldn't get myself involved in this story to much of any degree. It just required too much energy to stay focused on this book because it didn't offer up anything interesting. The rabbits just kept going from place to place to place looking for a warren.If you have to read this for summer reading, be prepared for a long mundane tale. otherwise, just skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really tried to like it; gave up at page 300","review":"I am not the type of person to give up. If I pay my money, I want to get my money's worth. This book is really boring, but since there was no bad language or sex, I didn't have any excuse for not trying to get through it. After about 6 months of forcing myself to read it, after page 300 I finally decided to skim it. Then I skipped to the epilogue.Everyone else loves this book. Maybe there is something wrong with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alas, I couldn't get into it.","review":"Cute as rabbits are, my mother is in a constant battle with the little buggers over her flower garden. Perhaps it was why I could not remain neutral while reading this story. I just couldn't see the vermin as protagonists. They're rabbits, for heaven's sake, not a band of warriors nor a nomadic tribe in the Amazon jungle! The plot plodded and the dialogue was excruciating. My mother nearly had to shoot me to put me out of my misery as I forced my eyes to scan page by page, constantly reminding myself that this was a children's literature classic and a Carnegie medal winner.I welcome anyone to lecture me on the merits of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a little kid's bunny book.","review":"I don't know what started the rumor about rabbits being cute, fuzzy, sweet, little animals. They're certainly not. Read this book, whch quite closely follows the behaviors of real wild rabbits and you'll find that they're the exact opposite. Watership Down is good from the very beginning, and the whole book is thrilling. It's one that you just can't bring yourself to put down. If you read it once you'll want to read it again. I also reccomend you buy Tales from Watership Down which, although it does focus more on the tales of El-ahrairah, is also good. Please buy this book. You won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Stars!","review":"When a small prophetic rabbit foresees a terrible danger in the warren, few believe him. Those few set out on a horrible and wonderful journey to a new home, a home where they will not be disturbed by men. After I started this book, I could not put it down. Watership Down is an excellent blend of action, adventure, and suspense. Although the characters may be fictional, the story is set in a real location in present-day England.This is a wonderful novel and I recommend it to anyone looking for a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED Watership Down!","review":"I remember seeing the movie when I was a young child and it stayed with me ever since. I remembered certain scenes from the film all my life and it did affect me deeply because 30 years later, I still haven't forgotten watching it nor the title. I realized that I needed to revisit this story for that reason and decided to read the novel before seeing the movie again. I'm so glad I did!!!I absolutely LOVED this book, which I finished in a few days. It is beatiful, sad, funny, epic, and haunting all at once! This may be one of the best books I have ever read and I read A LOT.There are some parts that can get a little over-desriptive and boring but they are few and you will hardly notice. For me, the pace really picked up about halfway through and I couldn't put it down. This is definitely and ADULT themed book IMO since some of the trials and lessons are emotionally heavy.Bottom Line: READ IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding, unique adventure.","review":"I'm a voracious reader, yet Watership Down remains a favorite. I read it again last month and continue to think about the qualities and courage of the furry characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fabulous Book","review":"This book is terrific. I recommend it to anybody. The character development, which I feel is the most important thing in any book, was extremely well-done. What makes it so special is that the plot was excellent as well. I wish there was a sequel or something. This is quite possibly my favorite book ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book, not only for children!","review":"I never thought that a book could be so wonderful and imaginative, like a report about real people. The protagonists are like real charakters, their actions full of human qualities (though they are rabbits). It's a real \\"Must\\" for rabbit lovers! Also the second book, \\"Tales from Watership Down\\" should find its place in the bookshelf next to \\"Watership Down\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"READ THIS BOOK!","review":"I know that this is the latest in a long list of glowing reviews for this fabulous book, so I'll make this short. This book has it all. Not only is it a great, complex story with wonderfully developed characters, but it is exquisitely written. Not in a long time have I come across intellegent prose telling a fascinating and exciting story. It is my absolute favorite book!! I highly reccommend it for everyone"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book.","review":"This book is one of my all-time favorites. I love how Richard Adams gave the rabbits their own culture, language, and even their own mythology. I think this book actually does comment on humans. It's not just about rabbits, it's about struggling to fulfill your dreams. I couldn't put this down. I read the whole thing in less than 1 day. I think I may have forgotten to do my homework because I was so engrossed by the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderfull reading!","review":"Watership Down is a wonderfull book that keeps you turning the pages. If you want a good book to read that grips you and dosn't want to let go this book is a great choice. Wonderfull for the young or old or young at heart. I have never looked at my rabbits the same since."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most amazing books I've ever read","review":"I got the Idea to read this book when I saw it mentioned on the back of Brian Jacques Redwall books. And I have to say it's an amazing book. You will love Hazel Fiver Bigwig and the rest of the bunch. Don't be folled by the number of pages. I am 12 years old and I read it all. I think it's a great book for any ages. This book also inspired me to write one of the longest Amazon reconmendations I have ever done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watership down is a harrowing tale of rabbits.","review":"Watership Down is a excellent story of courage, endurance, and frienship personified onto one of natures cutest creatures, the rabbit. I first read this book when I was ten years old, and still the adventures of Hazel, fiver, bigwig, and the rest remain in my memory. In 25 years I have not found a book that shows the extent a creature will go to to survive. This book concerns itself with the tale of how a band of fugitive rabbits leave a doomed warren in search of a new, safe place to live. not only does adams recreate the world through the rabbit's point of view (an example being that a hrududu is a car because of it's sound,) he also creates a set of rabbit fairy tales, which are most interesting. The vivid descriptions and the story itself cause me to place watership down as the finest book I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brave Bunnies Beat Big Bully Bunnies in Blighty!","review":"The first book I ever read, and still one of the most extraordinary - an epic story of courage and survival against the odds as a wimpy group of lonely male rabbits \\" having a fairly lean time of it with the does\\" decide to up camp and set out for fresh pastures. The hawks, cars and tractors encountered en route are nothing compared with the epic bunny war that lies ahead, as our fluffy, bouncing heroes encounter a larger, more militarized group of bunnies (you will be sweating for these rabbits, I swear!) Rather than drawing paralells with our own conflicts in human societies, I simply enjoyed it as a great story, a brilliant evocation of the drama of life in the wild at grass level, and a beautiful statement of the dignity and vulnerability of all animals. You will never look at a rabbit the same way again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern Classic","review":"At the age of 9, this was the first novel I ever read, and as a result it became the yardstick by which I judge all other novels. Simply put, it is side by side with \\"Gone With the Wind\\" as my all time favorite. I have never since read a more vividly imagined work than this world of rabbits in the English countryside. Straightforward Hazel, brash Bigwig and frail but visionary Fiver lead their ragtag band of outcast rabbits from their doomed home warren through an unbelievable series of situations and adventures. The blood in this book did not bother me even in the third grade, as it was not gratuitous or meant to shock, but rather to illustrate that the rabbit, a creature that we all tend to view as cuddly, is a part of the sometimes violent world of nature. Life is hard for even the cutest, most appealing of animals in the wild, whose every moment is taken up with struggle for survival. I doubt that anyone who has read \\"Watership Down\\" has ever looked at rabbits the same again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The folks on the Mayflower have nothing on these rabbits","review":"Watership Down is a classic book of journey, but that is not the best part of this book. The adventures these usually cowardly rabbits have are enjoyable and enthralling. Yet, it is the rabbit culture that makes this book so good. Few have perceived everyday animals as Adam's has shown us the simple rabbit. This book flows well and always leaves you wanting more. The only drawback is that it gives the reader little room for thought. Only a few places in the book does Adam's give us some sort of mystery, but they are small and often predictable. I loved the book and can't wait to read Tales from Watership Down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Read","review":"This is one of my top five favorite books of all time. It's incredibly well written. If you like animals (in this case rabbits), action and captivating characters, you can't go wrong with this book. It's a marvelous tale of family, friendship, loyalty, courage and survival. Some of the descriptions are a bit lengthy for my taste, but otherwise it's spectacular. Also of note, the movie adaptation holds pretty true to the book and is a good alternative for those who have difficulty reading, though there are a few scenes that may be too graphic for very young viewers. However, I ultimately found the book much more satisfying, as it was wonderful creating my own mental images of these adventures. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it Once a Year without fail.","review":"I love Watership Down. It's not just a story about rabbits - it's a peek at humanity and society at it's best and worst, simply from a four legged point of view. I read an average of 5 books a month and yet I make it a point to read this book at least once a year. After all these years, I still find myself looking forward to visiting with Fiver, Hazel and Bigwig. I recently took two books with me for a 12 hour flight to Greece - a new one and Watership Down. It was Watership that I read. If I were lost on a desert island and could have only one book with me, this would be the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the hardcover editions","review":"Of all the editions I have to favor the new cover for the paperback with the beautiful paining of the gate and downs. Not available in hardcover! After much shopping I picked up this hard cover version and was very very happy. A beautifully made book with truly great binding, paper, and cover (with or without the dust jacket). I'd still like to see the modern non-mass market cover in hardcover form but if you are going to gift Watership Down (as you all should) this is the most beautiful and quality printing available. In today's world of cheap books you hold this baby and I actually went \\"ohh\\" a really great gift edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Water ship down for english","review":"At first I wasn't to thrilled to have my English teacher \\"force\\" me to read this book. I mean look at it. It is about bunny rabits! How stupid! Not! This book changed my whole prespective on books. As soon as i started reading I couldn't put it down. It let me escape from my stress full life to a world full of bunny rabbits. It was like a dream. I was into it from the begining to the end. I cryed at the end. Now if you are thinking about reading this book don't wait stupid read it! Your missing out on one of the worlds greatest novels!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of my favorite books ever...","review":"I consider myself tardy in my responsibilities as an avid reader that I have only just read Watership Down at the age of 31. It's a book I've looked at over and over again through the years, and honestly thought that a novel about rabbits just couldn't be that engrossing. I was wrong, and I have suggested to all my reading friends who have also missed this treasure that they pick it up as soon as possible! It was delightful, and I find myself using it as a touchstone for any book I read now. My reading life can now be clearly identified into two separate periods...before Watership Down, and after Watership Down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything you want is all in one book !","review":"I think this book was really great! My 7th grade math teacher recomended it to me. Thanks to him I have discovered another wonderful classic. I think Fiver was the most suspenseful character. What ever he predicted always made you wonder if it was going to come true or not. It made you want to keep turning the pages. This book also teaches you about the outside life. I think after you read this book it seems like you want to meet a rabbit in real life. And sort of get to know him. If you have not read this book read it its the best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple book for simple minds","review":"Watership Down is a plain and simple texted book. I didn't find any challenges in this fiction, which makes me question the motives of educators and why this book in particular is pushed so roughly towards readers at schools. There wasn't much conflict-i.e. action- except for the fact that the bunnies were the problems themselves...Animal Farm by George Orwell was much more of a challenge and a couldn't-put-it-down book. Oh well, fiction has always been going downward in the sense of working the minds, this one is an example of a simple work for the simple minds out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and monotonous","review":"The only reason I read this at all was that it was assigned to me as a student. Other reviewers have pointed out that some books are better appreciated by an older rather than younger audience, but I can't imagine that being the case with this book. It was boring, monotonous, and devoid of any action whatsoever. A large slab of the book if I remember rightly, was devoted to descriptions of defecation.I can't imagine that I would appreciate it any better as an adult, and I will not be wasting my time trying to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"For a book so highly esteemed, very boring","review":"I've been forced to read this book for English class. Honestly, I liked some of the characters and their development was good, but the plot of this book was horrible. It was so boring, especially hearing about how plants look in the moonlight or rabbits \\"passing hraka\\" (hraka in \\"lapine\\" - another annoying feature- means \\"droppings\\"). I found the \\"El-Arairah\\" stories that were completely irrelevant to the main characters interesting and exciting. However, almost the rest of the book was ridiculously boring. If you plan on reading it, read a page a day for the next year and a half, that's the only way to stomach it."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-So","review":"This is a book that my Gifted English class had to read and, as usual, over analyze. We read it over a long period of time with many tests, etc. and I was pretty disappointed. I know that with a story about talking bunnies you shouldn't expect too much but there was something telling me that this book may be a little bit more...I was wrong though. Blah Blah Blah is about all that I saw on the pages after about a week and eventually I just wanted to put the book down and begin stomping on it. I guess that in it's entirety it wasn't all that horrible but I have to ask myself if it was truly worth my time to read it and I am not sure what I would say. It has a lot to say but it could have been said in a much more condensed version. To be honest I could have cut at least a hundred pages from it and still been able to get the same message across. I guess that in the end I would have to say that if you really want to read this, go check it out at you local library."},{"rating":"1","title":"A completely forgettable book.","review":"We read this book for an Honors English class this summer, and were not impressed. It was interesting to read Adam's idea of what warren life might be like, but this book is definately not a classic by any stretch of the imagination. Reading 100 pages about how the rabbits \\"silflay\\" is not my idea of a good time. And what's with these funky names: Hyzenthlay, Bigwig, Chervil, and Thethuthinang? And do we really need to know about how they pass \\"hraka\\"?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a bunnies world afterall","review":"The odd thing is I didn't find this book so extraordinary that it deserves 5 full stars (so many people over rate books) nor was it so horrendous to get 1 star (so many people don't know how to READ). Watership Down is a middling book, nothing worth dwelling on when the book ends. It faded from my thoughts quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entire famly enjoyed this colorful book","review":"This book kept a famly of 3 very engaged and happy for weeks. My 9 year old son said he wished the story had not ended. Brilliant characters, nice story, and the hardback version has wonderful color plates which my son enjoyed so much. It is a difficult book for a 9 year old but if the child can read 6th grade level it should be fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book about rabbits","review":"What a great book. It has everything, adventure, romance, evil villains! Highly recommend to anyone, not just kids. I was 23 and I probably understood it more than if I was a kid."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book of all time.","review":"I first read Watership Down when I was 9 and I loved it immediately. I have read literally, thousands of books, everything from Shakespeare and Dickens to Stephen King and Star Trek(all of which I enjoy) but Watership Down remains my favorite. All I can say about some of the other reviews is: No one with an ounce of intelligence or compassion could possibly hate this book. It can be seen from many different viewpoints, as a condemnation of man's cruelty to his fellow creatures, as an adventure story, as an allegory, and also as a story about wild rabbits. I love the stories about El-ahrairah and the Lapine words. Having rabbits of my own, I see aspects of the characters in their individual personalities. I recommend this book to anyone who loves animals or who is looking for a gripping, beautifully written story."},{"rating":"2","title":"a book that uses youre imagination to the fullest","review":"this book is one of the best ive ever read although it might not appeal to you beacuse its just a bunch of rabbits thats what i thought too its not so this book is a book that forever imprinted the thought of inteligent animals that might not be true they might just be dumb animals but what if....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Courageous and inspiring!","review":"Adams' eloquent tale of a band of rabbits searching for freedom and safety can strike a chord with humans as well. The bonds of friendship forged in adversity are easily understood by anyone who has withstood considerable odds and come out all right. Adams explains the lapine world through their eyes, complete with a \\"Lapine Glossary\\" for those not in the know of rabbitspeak. The protagonists are given very distinct--human, if you will--traits and personalities. Adams creates his own microcosm of our world by bringing up themes familiar to our own world and the creation of new civilizations: the development of leadership and structure, roles in a society, and mutual respect for the members of a competent cadre. Hazel-rah, Bigwig, Fiver, Blackberry, Dandelion, and the rest inhabit a world not unlike our own. This is an adventure, a fairy tale, a parable, and the makings of a legend and a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful tale","review":"of courage, cleverness, heroism, and love.

It may sound like a kiddie book, but Watership Down has something for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOOO good 2 miss!!","review":"If you don't read this book, either you are very busy or very mistaken! I read this book this year in English class had a HUGE test over it & loved every minute of it! I loved the way way Adams gave the rabbits names, character & attitudes. I loved reading the book out loud in class, taking notes & whining to the teacher about letting us skip math class so we could read more! So read this book for the pure enjoyment of the book & life from a different point of view."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Cowslip was almost a Beat and other hidden treasures.","review":"Watership Down is one of the most thrilling reads of the 20th century. Adams manages not to stereotype any human counterparts in his portrayal of another life form. Watership Down will entertain readers of any age with adventure and cliffhangers, but deeper readings are possible for the more mature. The book's onion skin layers are a evidence of a work that transcends the bestseller list and becomes Literature. Please, read this book more than once. If you enjoy T.S. Eliot (or Lawrence Durrell's \\"Book of the Dead,\\") you will feel at home in Cowslip's warren. I promise you a look into post-WWII English life that will teach you about human nature's cliffs and valleys through the Down's lapine characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book is well written but sometimes lacks in plot.","review":"The book is overall well enough written, but it does lack in plot and story sometimes, and it seems that the violence is put only into the story because as a decoy to the fact that there is no other thing to do at that point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I have read hundredes of books, but \\"Watership Down\\" is still among my favorites. The stoy is fine to read to little kids because the characters are interesting and and fun to hear about. Adults like this too. The different levels of meaning are many, making this a good story to read several times.The plot is skillfully done and very entertaining. It would be pointless to restate everything that has been said so many times already, but they are all true. This is a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book gets better and better as you read it.","review":"If you like rabbits, or even are just looking for something to read, this is the book for you. One day, I had nothing to read. So i went to my bookshelf and found this book. Once I started reading it, I could not put it down!!!!! I love to read, and this is one of my two or three favorite books. So, add this book to your shopping cart today. And, when you are finished reading this book, there is a sequal, also by Richard Adams. It is equally good. :-) By Katie Brown"},{"rating":"2","title":"Silly Rabbits","review":"I didn't read the book first. I saw an animated version of the book back in the early eighties. When I saw this version as a child it kind of scared me, especially the bloody scenes with the dog and the mean rabbits. But still I was mesmerized. This story has a spiritual quality unlike children's books I've read before. I felt my soul was being fed when I read some of the rabbit myths in the book. The ending was incredible. Reminded me that like humans, animals have a place in the hereafter. This was actually the third book that I've read more than twice by myself. Excellent use of myth, legends, character development and adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watership Down - A Delight for Anyone from 8 to 80","review":"For some reason I always thought that watership down was the story of a sinking ship and how its passengers were rescued. Boy was I surprised, wonderfully surprised. The more I read the more I wanted to find out what would happen next. I had a little trouble at first with some of the names such as Hazel for a male but that quickly passed as I became more engrossed in the book. The book is funny, sad, happpy and mostly a testament to courage and perseverance. I was thrilled with the group's triumphs, and saddened by their mishaps. On some levels this may be considered a children's book but it's really for folks of all ages who love a well-told story. This is not a book I will give away, sell, or dump in the garbage. This one stays on my shelf to be read again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"\\"Watership Down\\" and \\"Tales from Watership Dowwn\\", are great books.

I \\"got into it\\" after a few pages, where in some books it takes a few chapters! I didn't want to put it down! I liked how each of the rabbits developed their own personality throughout the story.

On the Rowsy Woofs of this World!","review":"You will love this book--it's as simple as that. I was on a train to Biggleswade, England, a couple weeks ago, and it was sunset. There were a bunch of bunnies out in a brussels sprouts field--no doubt at silflay--and it reminded me that it was once again time to read Watership Down. This isn't a book one reads; it's a book one inhabits. You will be transported! Adams has the most incredible touch with the English language--his main characters are so gentle, so touching they'll make you weep. There's savagery in it as well, which can even be shocking at times. And the tales that are interspersed within the novel are works unto themselves (You'll just roar at Rowsy Woof!) I'm an American who now lives in England, and the portrayal of the gentle English countryside is worth the read alone. You will not be disappointed--read this book at once! (P.S. To this day I still refer to the old heap of a Dodge that I had in high school as \\"The Hrududu!\\")"},{"rating":"2","title":"Watership Down Review","review":"At first, when I started reading Warership Down by Richard Adams, I thoght it would be about rabbits eating grass and talking.

My father had suggested it to me. I was initially reluctant to read a book about rabbits, but Hazel and friends quickly won me over. I've probably read it about ten times total, and have moved from my original paperback to a replacement paperback and now also have it for my Kindle. It is my favorite book, and I would urge everyone who hasn't read it to give it a try.

There are plenty of books about talking humans that aren't pure fantasy. why don't you read those?"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"This book was so incredibly boring,. I wish I could give it a no-stars rating. I mean, who cares about a bunch of rabbits. The story was very confusing and got me totally lost. All that happened, was rabbits did this and rabbits did that. There were a few occasional parts that were remotely interesting, but not enough to make it worth reading.

The list that starts \\"Oh, if you like to read you MUST read.....\\" Always number one on my list since that first accidental discovery (It was a last minute grab in the school library as the bell rang..)

I was sad to see the book end because it was so great."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing classic","review":"I was a bit hesitant to reading Watership Down at first. I was afraid it would be a boring story about talking rabbits that lived out their lives in a warren (and 475 pages of it!). I was completely mistaken. Although, it was about rabbits, in no way were their lives unexciting. The story, in fact, was not boring at all. Richard Adams does an amazing job with this book. He takes an idea that is not particularly enthralling and creates an epic adventure story. The farther I got into the story. The more I wanted to read. It just kept getting better and better. I had to constantly remind myself that the characters were rabbits because they were flawlessly given human traits. Before reading this story, I could not understand why it was so praised. Now I see, however, that this book is truly a masterpiece. I recommend this classic to anyone who likes adventure stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless","review":"It has been almost 4 years since I read this book and the memory of its magical story is still as fresh in my mind as it was when I read the last page - sadly, knowing that no book could ever duplicate its splendor for me.

I had to pick a book to read for a 10th grade project, and this was recommended to me by a friend. I wasn't sure I would like it-I'm a horse fan-but I loved it. I was into it from the very beginning. The characters-all rabbits- are very interesting and dynamic. I especially loved the made-up rabbit words, confusing to some people, but i thought it was cool. The story is about a group of rabbits who flee their home in search of a new one. On the way, they encounter hardships and problems as they try to establish a new warren. More characters are added as they go on, and each scene is more interesting than the last. I finished iot in a week, I couldn't put it down. A few not-so-good words, when your get around Keehar-the seagull-so watch out if you read it to little kids. All in all, an awesome book, I recommend it to everyone who can read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Synthesis!","review":"I realize what one reviewer said was true, that WD is an allegory of the Iliad, but Adams makes this obvious, I think, with the quotations at the beginning of each chapter-a handy literature guide for us non-college going folks.I find that Adams, like CS Lewis,skillfully uses collective myths (unlike Tolkien, who just copied them verbatim) to create this tale, then takes it a step further to explain why we need stories and legends in our own lives. As the rabbit Buckthorn says in Cowslip's warren, \\"El-ahrirah is a trickster, and rabbits will always need tricks.\\"This statement is proven time and again by the rabbits' adventures. It's a good read as a child, but as we get older, we recognize the characters and social mores of Cowslip's warren and Efrafa, and appreciate the lessons learned. If you are into anthropology and sociology you will probably especially enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is NOT a waste of time! READ IT!","review":"I was told to read this book by my friend. I totaly told her \\"No way! Who would like to read a book about talking bunnies?\\". She kept on telling me to, though, untill I finally agreed- reluctently. When I did read it, though, I because hooked. It became my favorite book of all times! It takes a while to get in to it- till page 100, which is way to long for some. However, for anyone who has any amount of patience, this book may become a favorite.

The type of book you would never pick up off the shelf, but once you begin to read, there is something magical that happens. You begin to beleive and feel the pain and happiness of these characters. Never has a book with such a story ever touched me the way this book has.

Just because you were forced to read it in school and weren't smart enough to apply yourself, doesn't change the fact that it is a well deserving CLASSIC. I also notice that most of the people who disliked the book, couldn't even spell while submitting a review. Of course it takes imagination to fully appreciate any novel. It is a direct reflection of society. Perhaps if some of you who complain that it was a bore acted as some of the characters did, our society would not be the pitiful mess it is today-by the way...you harsh critics are all the narrow minded type, who would have perished in the old warren because you were too shallow to recognize good sense when you saw it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful reading for All","review":"I have read Watership Down twice and so enjoy this wonderful adventure of a group of rabbits leaving the only place they have known because one of the rabbits has a premonition of a horrible event about to overtake their safe and comfortable warren.

I first read it when I was 8 years old and I couldn't put it down! The characters are really well described and when your only a couple of pages into the book, you feel as if you have known them all your life. My favourite characters are Pipkin, Blackberry and Acorn. He tells it realistically, like when he writes about the wood floating on the water, rabbits might not really understand that in real life. He also points out how hard a rabbits life is and the dangers they can face and what they might think of other objects.The secenery is really well described and that makes it seem real.

For lovers of middle school fictions, bunnies may excite you. Though mature and readers searching for a more challenging read should find some other novel to try on."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was terrible","review":"This book, by Richard Adams, was piontless. I was forced to read this for my Senior English class and I feel that it was the biggest waste of my time. I would only suggest this book to those who have nothing to do except to read about bunnies. There are many \\"bunny\\" terms that make the book hard to understand, and it is pointless. Watership Down is only for those who enjoy bunnies and Frith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"Think before you buy this bookit may have an exciting title but once you read it you start to loose interest in the book pretty fast so I don't recomend this book because to me the book doesn't make any sence at all.

This book is not recomendable at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A housewife's book","review":"This book full of pitiful and weak character. This book is so sappy that ever page you turn just makes you want to drop the heavy weight book down and puke.

I always find it interesting when an author uses animals to craft a very human story. It involves fath, friendship and cooperation plus so much more. These rabbits are shown that freedom is worth fighting for, and it really is inspirational. Read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't explain it","review":"Once you get to the end of this book you'll probably go through all the pages at the back, desperately searching for more of it.

It's one of her all-time favorite stories, and our previous copy had pretty much disintegrated over the years of use.

Now, a grown woman of 35, I have the opportunity to travel for my work and often, while on the plane, I'll chat with fellow travelers about where they live, their interests and of course, their favorite books. In all the conversations I've had, NEVER ONCE has anyone who has read Watership Down NOT stated, without being prompted, that is was without a doubt, their absolute favorite book. It's mine too, I have read it again and again over the years and each time, I am captivated by the excitement, the discovery and the growth of these rabbits. With each read, I do believe I grow just a little myself.

This is pretty amazing, because my sister never likes anything. When i first started, I thought, okay, talking bunnies, sounds like redwall. But as I got into it more, I found it to be much different, and a whole lot better! The characters are far more developed, and their personalities are far more unique (it seems every readwall characters name is martin or logalog) Most people i find who hate it were required to read it for school ( i said most not all) and perhaps they just didn't want to read it so they went in with a bad attitude. This book can teach you alot if you want to know it. I have learned alot from reading it only once, and i found it intriguing and fanscinating. Anyone who read it and hated it should read it again. You can learn alot from little talking bunnies if you just try!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching Classic","review":"When first being introduced to Watership Down I was nothing but skeptical. Talking rabbits seemed like a great thing to read if you had nothing better to do. I was dead wrong. I thought (at first) that I was wasting my time reading about talking rabbits. When I got into probally about the 3rd or 4th chapter I began to really get into the book. The bond between the rabbits is extraordinary. Their bond of friendship is unbreakable. Being a lover of many novels I highly recamend this classic. This story is unforgetable and is by far the best book that I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought this was an awful book","review":"I thought that this book was one of the worst I have read. I had to read it for school and i could barely get through the first chapter let alone the whole book. Anyway, the only reasonI didn't fail the chapter quizzes was because of Cliff Notes and all the help from other friends. My advice to you, it is an evil book and don't buy, or ever read it. It isn't interesting or captivating, it was just plain stupid. I recomend, stick to the Cliff Notes and make your life easier. I'm just trying to spare you the pain that I went through for about 2 months. Everybody has different opinions, I just felt the need to share mine.

I was so angered at how the bunnues were after all just bunnies.For your sanity and time, I beg thee not to atempt this ever bothersome and trite fictional writing.

The book is Chacterized with talking bunnies and animals. I found myself reading like 10 pages just to describe the texture of a plant, when they should be concentrating on the point of the story.

Not in this short little fiction, that's for sure. There was no apparent passion in writing this, or why the bunnies were the way they were.

This story started out as a bedtime tale for Richard Adam's children and should have stayed that way. The book is too drawn out. There are more details about the countryside than the heroic rabbits. Some parts are good, like when the rabbits go get does from the neighboring warren, but most of the book was just boring landscape details."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly Rabbit, talking bunnies are for kids!","review":"I tried reading this book.

But once you get into it, you discover a whole new world, where each rabbit has it's own unique personality and they go through things in life that we as human would never have given a rabbit credit for. It's one of the most creative and imaginative books that I've ever read. It's filled with suspense, intigue, and excitement, and you'll be so hocked on it afterward that you'll want to go and read it again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watership Down","review":"Alright, I'll admit, that I was not so enthusiastic aboutW.D. when I first learned I would be reading it. In fifth grade, myteacher, Mr. Beaty, was 'in-love' with this book. He would set some time from the day for reading us the story. We were allowed to draw pictures of the rabbits. I was only 10 at the time, so, I, of course wasn't happy when we were supposed to read a 400-page book. By and by, my whole class started to love it. I loved their words for cars (at which, as of this point I don't remember), and all the other man-made objects. In 7th grade, I was blessed when my teacher handed out the sumemr-reading list, with W.D. on it!

I encourage everyone not to read this book. The author had to have a glossary in the back just because there were too many dumb terms that he made up. This was the stupidest book in the world. No wonder the author couldn't find someone to publish it. It was the dumbest book in the world. Did I mention that it was about talking bunnies? How totally dumb can that be?

This novel is written with extraordinary character development, remarkable emotional depth and page-turning excitement.Unlike some other imaginative fiction with non-human characters (Lord of the Rings comes to mind) that is best read while in high school, this novel works best for college-age students capable of appreciating the richness of the prose, and it works equally well for older adults (unlike perhaps LOTR).I read this book when I was 23.

We referred to it as the dreaded, hated, despised bunny book. I was much too young to even begin to understand the deaper meanings of this book or to appreciate it in the least bit. I have now revisited it as an adult. It's as if the light bulb came on. It all makes sense to me now.Richard Adams does an amazing job of explaining the inner workings of the rabbit world. You learn new vocabulary and begin to appreciate the complexity of nature (Yes I know it's ficiton, but for a second you can almost imagine this is all real, and that's the beauty of the book.) This is another one of those books that just because you are capable of reading the words does not mean you are capable of understanding the book.

Go and get this book now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good.","review":"Peeps was a sci-fi novel mostly about parasites and evolution. You shouldn't read this book if you don't believe in evolution, I had that mistake. Scott Westerfeld sets the story with parasites that have adapted to the environment and Peeps are humans infected with the parasite, with vampire/cannibalism type traits. It's pretty addicting with all the conspiracies and living organism traits. I think Scott Westerfeld gets carried away with evolution though, it's only a theory, and he uses the book to share his opinion about it very annoyingly."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting but not great","review":"Having recently been thrust into the literary world of vampires this book was a nice easy read with a somewhat realistic plot. Not as good as some other westerfeld books but worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I bought Peeps because I really enjoyed the Uglies series. This is not near as good as the Uglies. I really would not recommend this book for young teens!

I don't think its appropriate for anyone under the age of 17."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your average vamp story","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It certainly is not your typical vampire story. It is the story of Cal, who was a college student from Texas that became a carrier of a virus which caused anyone he kisses (or more) to become a \\"Peep\\" (vampire). When the story opens Cal is in the process of rounding up his ex-girlfriends he infected before realizing he had the virus. Although some of the virus descriptions were rather disgusting (\\"ew, repeat\\") it was all very informative. I liked that the ending left it open so that you could just imagine what would happen next, but am also happy to learn that the sequel \\"End of Days\\" is available. I do have to say this book left me with a strong desire to see if my cats' eyes would show up red by the light of a flashlight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great science fiction in the literal sense","review":"This book's great--suitable for adults as well as teenagers--really excellent science stuff, it's an ongoing gripe of mine that not enough fiction-writers really care about science.

But when I tried it on a hair-based clog in the bathtub drain, the pressure was too much for it. The plastic fitting that goes into the drill chuck shattered from the pressure that built up as the drill attempted to advance the snake into the hair clog. This item would be great if the shank were made of metal instead of plastic. I'm trying to find another one with a metal connection, but no luck so far. I may have to get another plastic unit and just hope for the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic shank, disappointing","review":"I guess I was naive but I expected better. The shank you attach to a drill is made of plastic. Even if you baby it I can see this stripping out in a few uses. Looked like metal in the picture (silver) but the one I received is black plastic. But hey, it's cheap, you get what you pay for I guess"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gear too Weak for Power","review":"This product seemed like a good idea when purchased however within the hour the gear between the snake and the drill had stripped. As nasty as the rest of the snake was it didn't seem worth it to try and return. We continued the job by twisting, pushing, and pulling the snake by hand. If you are looking for a snake I recommend you purchase one that comes with a roll-up case and that is rotated by hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Problem solved","review":"I had a blocked sump pump drain pipe in my side yard and this pipe snake attached to the end of a portable drill burrowed through the pine tree roots and unclogged it in about five minutes. I would have had to dig up the pipe and this snake saved me a lot of time and effort. For the money I paid it was a great investment. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"NEEDS MORE TORQUE, CONSIDER A DRUM MACHINE","review":"This is not a bad product for the price. If you have a distant blockage that is a straight shot you may be ok with this tool. The problem is you lose torque at the distal end of the snake because of its length. If you have a lot of turns (right angles) in your drain pipes this item is difficult to use. It is basically a two man operation (recommended by Cobra products). I give it 4 stars because for $15 it's worth a try. If money is no object, I recommend a drum machine (RIGID 24853 K400). They aren't cheap but a plumber is going to charge a bundle for any drain problem they can't handle."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap","review":"Do not buy!

Worked great. We cleaned it and then put it on the shelf for a little over a year. When we went back to use it on our shower drain a second time, we found that the inner part that is supposed to turn had rusted and so all the tension was building up in the cord. Okay, so we were able to free the rusted head to get it to turn again (the product calls itself rust resistant but that I guess resistant doesn't mean that rust isn't a problem). Seemed like this would solve the problem but then as we kept working the cylinder that attaches by the drill had gotten burned out with all the tension in the line from when the head was stuck. Now the inner mechanism won't turn at all. It's now headed for the trash and we're headed to the store.In sum, this product probably works well if you use it frequently so that it doesn't rust up. But know that it might not be a lasting product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Item was not what I expected. Too stiff, only able to extend a short distance into the pipe, not flexible enough to move past the bend, which is where the problem is. Didn't take long to figure out it was not going to do the job we needed to have done. Now will still have to have a professional come, adding to the cost. Sorry, just not worth the cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Have had this sitting under my work bench for several months since ordering it. Just had the need to use it the other day it worked great. I had a similar but much more expensive product from a major tool company and the drum the snake coiled in regularly popped open during use. This snake is simple to use, no drum to fail, and cleared my drain in just a few minutes of use.

Thankfully, I decided to purchase this drain snake and try it myself. Even though I never used a drain snake before, after managing to muscle the snake through the bend in the bath tub's drain pipe (not easy), the water released and so did my stress.

AS I said, it is very basic but helpful to glace at, It'd be a lot better if the price was at least half."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would not recommend it to an associate.","review":"The books attempts to give the reader a short introduction or insight into process mapping. Yet, it would go to in-depth for the basics. In addition, the author guises the reader by using different terminology for maps, such as deployment flowcharts, and IDEF models. The astonishing fact about the book is that in the end it attempts to tell you how to analyze a business. Readers are better off reviewing rengineering books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Way to Get Up To Speed on Process Mapping","review":"This book is great for anyone who needs to understand process mapping in a hurry. It covers the three basic levels of process mapping clearly and uses very understandable examples. It won't make you an expert but it will make you conversant on this important skill for consultants and others involved in process re-engineering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Explains how to without telling you why to","review":"Tells you how to draw diagrams basically on paper. Not even good as an introduction to process mapping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, efficient, effective, right on target!","review":"This book is rather for beginners in process mapping. It is clear extremely well focused, and effective. I got the information I needed in less than two hours of pleasant lecture. No dumb explanations about obvious real life examples covering more than 60% of the book! Book starts with a crisp and nice presentation of Relationship Map, Cross-functional Process Map and Flowchart. After that Flowcharting, Process Mapping, Relationship Maps, Cross-Functional Process Maps are explained and followed by an easy to understand example. The book ends with Analyzing a Process chapter that I found good to start analyzing and improving my own processes. The book is useful for managers, consultants and students as a start in process mapping and or process improvement projects. I'll keep it as useful reference for my workHighly appreciate your work Robert, thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Coming of Age in WW II Miami","review":"I loved feeling of togetherness and support evoked by the description of WW II civilian life and sacrifice. I'd never realized Miami had such a WW II presence. This book made me want to visit. This would be a good movie or tv series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece, but way too long","review":"Rushdie's prose is dense, filled with great writing and magical imagery. The problem is that there's no real plot to make it chug along, so it's a very long read. I ended up skimming the second half of the book, so that I could brag that I finished it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical","review":"I can't compete with all the wonderful reviews listed below. Just a few of my thoughts on the book: It's one of the very best I've ever read. It's poetry at its best. It's full of magical ideas and the first half of the book might just be the best part of a book I've ever read. I was a tiny bit disappointed with the second half which was still great but lacked a bit of the magic with which the novel started (something I've noticed in the other two books of Rushdie I've finished, The Moor's last Sigh (also excellent) and The Ground Beneath Her Feet, good but not up to par to the other two, as well)(I never got through more than 10 pages of the Satanic Verses which was too complicated for me). Try this book. Chances are you'll love it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must read!","review":"I could go on for a long time about this book. I have read a lot of books but this one is probaly the best post war book, and for sure on of the best books ever written."},{"rating":"1","title":"A clever book, a bit too clever!","review":"The book is a allegorical polemic, done in great style. It has flashes of brilliance and very clever passages. But ultimately, it fails to transcend the contortions of its plot to great, universal literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wicked Sense of Humor","review":"Oh, my goodness. What do I say about this? It's such a rich, excellently written story with lots of interesting action and characters. Bonus: Rushdie has a wicked wicked WICKED sense of humor. And, did I say that the writing is to die for? Envy the size of an elephant inhabited my body as I was reading this ... however, it didn't take any pleasure away from the reading of it. Okay, I'm gonna get bossy now: Put it on your to-do list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feckless like the anglicized Indians that it represents","review":"It is a strange thing that the modern elites of India are unconnected to their own civilization and for them impressing the westerner is the most important task. Rushdie is the perfect example of such an Indian. For an authentic view of India we must still turn to V.S. Naipaul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious nonsense; beautiful scenery","review":"For a book that has received so much praise this is maddeningly self-indulgent. Rushdie details the struggles of partitioning and the development of India with fantastic skill but the main plot is too self-aware. In any other guise this might be described as fantasy but, of course, it is too worthy to be listed as such. Tiresome in the extreme despite the poetic nature of the prose, this is one to read if you want to show off at dinner parties."},{"rating":"1","title":"very very difficult","review":"Unfortunately this is one of those books that are not to be taken lightly.It is a very difficult read, the author has no desire to make it easy for the reader, the temptation to put down the book is constant.I finally decided to skip entire parts that made no sense at all and tried not to waste completely my time. It will take a lot of time and attention, think twice before embarking on it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not realistic, certainly not magical","review":"Presented as the pinnacle of the magic realism movement, this novel left me cold. There are aseveral reasons why one SHOULD like it: -about India -by an Indian (kind of) -\\"difficult\\" -Liberal/socialist -decadent However, no matter how these stack up -for me it was completely boring. I had no interest in any of the characters and as a metaphor for modern India it was markedly unmetaphorical. I learnt nothing of that country. I learnt a lot about the limitations of Magical Realism -an essentially lazy, self indulgent genre. The ego of Rushdie is prominent -as he wrote it he was clearly thinking \\"This is an important work\\". He should read Eliot, Proust and Dosteovsky -and learn his place"},{"rating":"1","title":"not a great novel","review":"There's a lot of praise for this book, and I thought I'd put my two cents in. One important note: Rushdie PURPOSELY inserts historical innacuracies, so don't think you're getting an accurate historical account - that's done on purpose. Indeed, from a post-structuralist theoretical standpoint, Rushdie's project is clearly to deconstruct. But, he goes nowhere with it. His whole novel can be summed up in a few lines: The popular version of history is inherently corrupted by social mediating forces; so, in order to combat that force, I'm going to offer MY version of history to show that there is no ONE history. It's a pretty standard argument, but he doesn't develop it beyond that. I would suggest that you look to Faulkner (who focuses on history's lingering qualities) or Ellison's Invisible Man (in which he focuses on how to break through cycles of historical oppression). They handle the effects of history in a much more engaging and profound way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Midnight's children","review":"Amazing book. I would recommend it to anyone travelling to India or visiting it. It provides a rich literary experience and adds a touch of \\"masala\\" to an ingenious and rare story."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this book...","review":"I really, really wanted to enjoy this book, but I had to stop reading it I was so bored by it. I started reading it knowing that Salman Rushdie is a well-respected author and that the book was rated the best novel in the past 25 years, but I couldn't read the entire novel. Maybe I shouldn't say I don't like since I haven't read the whole book, but I don't know if I could. Perhaps it's because I'm only 16 and the only knowledge I have of Indian culture was a brief unit on the topic freshman year, or maybe I'm just not mature enough to read this book. I usually like every book I read, but this is one of the first I really just did not care for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Wordy","review":"I struggled my way through this book and found the writing style hard to get used to. The main character wasn't likable and I didn't feel much sympathy for him. I also thought that changing some of the character's names or using nicknames at some times and not others was confusing and unnecessary.I know it gets a lot of rave reviews so maybe I'm just not intellectual enough to enjoy it but my tip would be to try before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring. Just a lot of words put together with no story.","review":"A meaningless collection of words. A boring story line if any at all. I could not complete the book; sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Imagery!","review":"Wonderful Imagery!Rushdie creates a wonderful panorama and guides us through post-1947 nehru's india toward indira's new india as his characters move across the length and breadth of india, associating themselves with history, witnessing its events, and occasionally being a part of them. From the old Kashmir with the silent dal lake to the massacre at Jallianwalbagh, From the Streets and Forts of Delhi to the language riots of Bombay, From the military coups in pakistan, along the mysterious rann of kutch to the Mangroves of the Sunderbans, the story keeps turning while showing you all the nuances, sentiments, and personalities of the indian subcontinent. The characters are brilliantly depicted in rich variety and grab the readers attention immediately. It's not a history book but it presents history with stunning images in rushdie's wonderful hinglish. A wonderful read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A roller coaster of a Book","review":"This book is truly pathbreaking. It's got pathos, tragedy, comedy, drama and 'tear-jerking' ...all in all, a totally \\"masala\\" book. Lesser writers would have floundered to paint on such a huge canvas, but not Rushdie. He straddles the past and the future, the magical and the mundane, the east and the west, history and fantasy with equal grace. If Rushdie were a filmmaker, he would be a person who could mix Manmohan Desai, Ram Gopal Verma and Ray into a lethal combination.Saleem Sinai is not however the typical potboiler hero...he's got his magical moments but the weight of power and history weighs him down.Shiva, however, is the villian like a Bollywood villian.But, reviewing this book here seems so difficult, my advice is to go read it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"unbridled but unwarranted enthusiasm","review":"Rushdie is so in love with his own writing and condescending of his reader that he feels it necessary to explain his themes and symbols, and to periodically review the main points of the story. I admit that I enjoyed the first few chapters and some of the wordplay, but most of it is out-of-control, self-indulgent rubbish. It is very disappointing to me that this book has won so much critical acclaim."},{"rating":"1","title":"difficult to read","review":"I've read another one of his books and thought it was very good. This one was too disjointed for me.Frankly no one in our reading group enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"dumdum 25 dollar toiletpaper","review":"had fair expectations. rushdie spends too much time being cutesy and obnoxiously witty. read a book on indian history instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Literary marvel","review":"Rushdie's novel has always been on my \\"need-to-read\\" list, but only this year have I sunk my teeth into what (I surmised) may have become a dated novel. To my infinite surprise I discovered one of the true masterpieces of 20th century literature. My only complaint is that the latter half of the book does not seem to follow the impressive lyrical precedent of the first 300 pages - but this is to be expected as the beauty of the writing is unparallelled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every book I have read after this one, has been a let down.","review":"A rich and colourful book that takes you into a fantasy and mystical world. English may be Salman Rushide's second language, but he has mastered it better than most contemporary writers. I cannot read another book after Midnight's Children with as much excitment. It is a must read for anyone.A Booker Prize for literature is nto enough. I nominate it for the Pulitzer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheer Brilliance!","review":"This book has been written by an extraordinary being, whose linguistic arsenal of celestial creativity manifested through impeccable writing skills... have founded my No. 1 author; with Midnight's Children being my personal favourite.Rushdie's magnificent narrative style coupled with a richly-textured storyline all added up to the substance of this best seller; which is beyond my humble words to describe.One of the best fictions that I have read so far. Sheer brilliance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to Absorb","review":"Despite its rave reviews, the author's Wwiting style or \\"voice\\" in which every sentence contains a multiplicity of parenthetical ,sometimes extraneous, statements forced me to abandon the novel as slogging through the maze was just too tiring to be enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and boring","review":"I wanted to read a Rushdie book and I've heard this book being called the \\"Booker of the Bookers\\" (referring to the prize). Rusdie's writing may be poetic and beautiful, but it is hard to trudge through this fairly long book. Furthermore, Midnight's Children is not particularly educational as far as Indian history and culture. The author may deserve his great reputation for his writing style but don't expect to be entertained.Reading this book made me feel like I was back in highschool and reading a required book for English class. My apologies to literature lovers who may consider me a philistine."},{"rating":"1","title":"goodbye Salman","review":"The first half of the book is a drag regarding his growing up stage. Seen along with Satanic Verses that had even a larger portion that was difficult to keep my attention, no more of Salman Rushdie for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Change of Pace","review":"Rushdie certainly stands out in style from other authors and that makes this book a refreshing change of pace. If you are looking for a quick and easy read, this isn't for you. This book, like many classics of the 20th century, has a complicated and convoluted storyline in places. His writing style can be difficult to follow at times as he doesn't follow the typical rules of grammar. As one reviewer indicated, you will enjoy the story more and get more out of it, with even a nominal understanding of some of India's culture and history. That being said, I found myself actually enjoying the story more in retrospect than I did as I was reading it. This book actually lived up to its hype but not in the way I expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much Poo","review":"While I enjoyed the magical realism of the book and the exotic setting, I did not care for the characters. Feces run through this book. At one point, the narrator describes a man defecating into his own hand and proudly proclaiming the length of this fecal masterpiece. The beauty of the language is literally mired in filth."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mixed bag...","review":"Flipping through the reviews, I was amazed at the number of two and five star reviews. I came up with a possible explanation : either reviewers were Indian or very familiar with Indian culture (5), or they were not, and found the subtleties of Rushdie's language and the culture too difficult to negotiate (2). The book is a masterpiece, but requires a serious investment in getting to know India. If you fall in the first category of reviewer, it is a must read. If you are less familiar with Indian culture, you will still marvel at the beatiful language, but be prepared to be a little left out of the inside jokes."},{"rating":"2","title":"overall a good book","review":"It took a few chapters to get used to Rushdie's writing style. By the end of the book it really grew on me and I ended up enjoying the book. The writing has a negative tone, and all the events in the main character's life were foreshadowed - not the whimsical book I was expecting. Still a very good book and worth the read. I look forward to reading more of his work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing Book that does not live up to its promise","review":"I got this book because I thought the premise was very interesting, but I'm having a hard time at page 75 getting to anything that even hints of it. Rushdie's current work is not supposed to be as good as his earlier works, but I would much prefer his memoir to this \\"story.\\" I read some of the good reviews and I realize my opinion may be in the minority, however, if you want a book to immerse yourself in over the holidays, this is not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Midnight's Children","review":"Do they have exclamation points in Hindi?Or is it just understood that everything in Indiashould be said with an exclamation point?I just finished Midnight's Children.It is the masterpiece of Salman Rushdie.And now I want to end every sentence I write aboutthis author, this book, with an exclamation point.Midnight's Children!A masterpiece!Salman Rushdie!Brilliant!My husband and I went to see Salman Rusdie Friday night.He talks just like he writes.He speaks in beautiful metaphorsthat seem to flow from his mouthas naturally as rain from dark clouds."},{"rating":"2","title":"incredible","review":"Excellent storytelling - with a mixture ofopinions, philosophy and history that is never boring, blended with endless surprises."},{"rating":"2","title":"How brilliant and beautiful!","review":"This book is so beautifully written that I have to put it down afterawhile to take it all in. It's like a giant puzzle incorporatinghistory, politics, religion, and individual lives, and Rushdienever once loses a strand. It's rare that a book ishilarious and moving at the same time. Midnight's Children is a truemasterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cartoon epic","review":"The book is too extravagant. The word play is often totally baseless (such as dung-lotus for Padma), although Western readers may not be knowledgable enough about the background to know that, and the racy plot has scenes like in a cartoon book. Very clever but certainly not literature that will stand the test of time. Rushdie's \`Satanic Verses' is a much better novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't do it for me","review":"I guess you have to be a historian on India and its culture because if you are not (like myself), the book was confusing. I could not distinguish the fantasy from the reality - which may have been the intent. Although I fell short on understanding, I feel that Rushdie is an artist in the literary sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why","review":"Rushdie has done much better. This was not up to par. His earlier books were far better. This was difficult to get through."},{"rating":"1","title":"struggling to stay interested","review":"this was recommended by a doctor friend i met while travelling in borneo last year. i have tried a few times now, still struggling to really 'get into it' though. i wont quit. hopefully i can post a better review when i can finally finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clever, but not a great novel","review":"My explanation for two- and five- star ratings for the book is just the opposite of what an earlier review surmised. I believe it is 5-star by those people who know India/Pakistan only superficially and so assume that Rushdie is on to something; it also includes the Macaulayites or those Indians/Pakis who have learned about it secondhand from English books. Often the word-play, puns, or etymologies used by Rushdie don't make sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I really love all of Howard's most recent works, and many of her earlier works as well (\\"White Lies,\\" \\"Diamond Bay,\\" \\"Midnight Rainbow,\\" even \\"Against the Rules\\"). This, however is not one of the ones I like.Howard has always written about very Alpha Male heroes. In some of her earlier work, including this one, she takes that portrayal to an extreme. The \\"hero\\" in this work seems lacking in emotion and even leaning towards the emotionally abusive.The \\"heroine,\\" on the other hand, is written as an emotional wimp. It's written that she's \\"strong,\\" but she lets the \\"hero\\" walk all over her, making herself totally emotionally available to a man who, quite frankly, seems unworthy of it.I love most of Howard's work, but this is not a book I'm going to keep in my personal collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will give you frown lines....","review":"OK, this is an OLD story by Linda Howards ( nothing at all like her more recent books), nevertheless, its STILL one of the MOST annoying love stories out there. If you can take 250pgs worth of seeing a weak, spineless goodie-goodie heroine getting walked all over for the sake of \\" showing what love is all about to the man who abuses me in every way\\" , then DO read this.Hero walks into town to get revenge from his family after years of being away. Heroine sees the hero, she falls for him, he abuses her constantly, but she cant help falling in love, the MORE abusive and spiteful he gets the MORE she loves him...

This one was a major disappointment. I almost did not finish it. It was awkwardly written. But then I realized that Ms. Howard was still in early stages of novel writing. This book was written in 1985 and boy, what a difference 12 years has made. I say 12 because I refer to \\"Son of the Morning\\" which was written by Ms. Howard in 1997 and was one of best books I have ever read. So don't judge Linda Howard by this book. You have lots of treats ahead if you stick with the later-written books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting!","review":"Another Linda Howard - she never disappoints!

The story was what you expect from Linda Howard, but the wording was so ultra-flowery, over-the-top, and full of cliches that I was wondering at one point if it was somehow intended to be a parody of the romantic genre. --but no. I've noticed that Linda Howard does tend to recycle some of her descriptions from book to book. --Imagine taking all of her cheesiest descriptions from each of her books, concentrating them into one small book and removing the more believable character development. That's this book, a stick figure Linda Howard novel with saccharine descriptions stuffed around it in an attempt to fill it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tears of the Renegade","review":"I loved this book.

I seriously think the author got bored and decided not finish the book. I have never read a book that puts in all kinds of secrets and not explain them at all, but this one did. I think Ballantine Books should refund mine and everyone elses money on this one because the editor clearly didnt do his/her job.

There are plenty of photographs, though most are blabk and white.The book would be improved if they added details on how to adjust pricing for the condition of the document.

While Pfanz's book has great detail on the fighting, it plunges to the other end of the spectrum with no helpful information on Lee's decisions. This is critical to any understanding of the battle because the second day's fighting was the result of what Lee did or did not do.As a result, this reader is of the opinion that one must look to other works to provide much-needed information on such critical questions of \\"how and why\\" events unfolded as they did."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very detailed well researched book.","review":"This is the most detailed look at the second day of Gettysburg I have ever seen.

This is a good book for the amateur and professional Civil War buff"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Disappointment","review":"Pfanz's book is notable not only for the information it contains, but also for the information left out. Unlike Martin's \\"Gettysburg, July 1\\", Pfanz has definite opinions about the people and their judgements at Gettysburg. And he is more than willing to add/twist/omit certain facts to make his case. In summary, while Pfanz presented some interesting information, that information can readily be found elsewhere. Further, his \\"wise cracks\\" and omissions make his conclusions very suspect. I would NOT recommend this book to any serious student of Gettysburg. I regret I purchased my copy; I think you will feel the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exhaustive study of Longstreet's July 2 attack","review":"Decidedly for the Civil War buff, this meticulous book discusses the components of the attack on the Union left in the late afternoon of July 2. There is little or nothing about any engagements at Culps Hill on the right the same day. However, the waves of attack on the left are fully documented. This is slow but thorough reading, and one is unlikely to find any other exposition in greater detail. One drawback, there are only a few photos of the battlefield, and relatively few maps to help keep track of the complex action. But, there are many vignettes and interesting backgrounds of key leaders on both sides. The relative time frames are not distinguished clearly, but the key components (Round Tops, Wheatfield, battery duels, etc.) are well expounded in considerable detail. A must for one fascinated by the penultimate battle of the War."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genious","review":"Harry W. Pfanz has written down the most information about the Gettsburg battle in the Civil War then anyother author. The facts just surprise you.

That period was the bridge between his \\"Jazz Brothers\\" days when he was a protege of the late Dizzy Gillespie (and sounded it) and his most commercially successful period, when his sound got him recognized by some experts as the inventor of what is now termed \\"smooth jazz\\". I don't know about that--the way I see it, Mangione has always sounded best fronting a full orchestra. You'll hear echoes of that in this album and in a similar effort \\"Chase the Clouds Away\\".

I recommend this novel for any reader that is not afraid of knowing truth as depicted from this obvious strong, confident writer and black man. I also caution the reader to examine oneself and the societal impact of the subjects discussed before developing an opinion of this work.

Whenever any of these movies premiered in NYC I would be there on opening day to see it. The Greatest Story Ever Told has been one of my favorite films so I was excited to see the blu-ray release of this wonderful movie. However, although the movie on blu-ray looks substantially better than the dvd release, I was quite disappointed in the picture quality of this new release. Good at times, fair at times, never really consistent. This classic movie deserves a restoration similar to The Ten Commandments and Gone With The Wind and The Sound Of Music.

It had a lot of unrealized potential. From a scriptural perspective, I'd give it a C+. It got some things right, but a lot wrong or off. It did a good job with Lazarus (something most other movies skip), but a bad job with the disciples and the unscriptural representation of Simon of Cyrene carrying the cross.From a production perspective, it wasn't too bad but the timing of the movie is dated. Today we like faster paced action and the movie seems to plod along to modern tastes. In 1965 it may have been only a little slow.I've watched many of the Jesus related films that are out there.

I haven't got to travel to tibet as of yet, but I do attend teachings at a Drikung Kagyu monastery where I interact with a few native tibetans. I must admit, I usually chicken out when it comes to trying to really speak. But it is soooo fun to be able to find words and phrases that I already know from practices and be able to see them in other usage.A terrific book! Ok, one thing, the print, especially the tibetan script is tiny, but then there is so much info crammed in this pocket-sized book, who can really complain. if you have a hard time with little print, throw a little reading magnifier strip in your pocket with it :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tibetan Phrasebook","review":"Like most of the books in this series, Lonely Planet attempts to offer the best of all worlds and does a fairly consistent job of it. This phrasebook provides some basic background information on the language and its grammar but I have never found their transliteration schemes to be very accurate for the average American English speaker.Within its covers, you will find just about every essential phrase the average traveler could ever hope for. Its compact size and price make it the cheapest foray available into the Tibetan language. The Tibetan script is included throughout for those who are interested in seeing the written word or just want to point out phrases instead of attempting to pronounce them correctly.At less than $6 USD on average, every Tibetan language enthusiast should have a copy of this phrasebook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not \\"Kitchen Confidential\\" (not even close!)","review":"I had great expectations for this book--specifically, to see what the world of waiting is like from the inside, as I have never waited tables. After the first 50 pages, the novelty of my newly-aquired knowledge of restaurant drama wore off.From the very beginning, I found Debra Ginsburg's writing sophomoric. I was irritated by her overuse of adverbs (especially \\"truly\\").I also didn't find much in the way of character development. She never gave the reader so much as a hint of other interests.I was expecting something amazing like \\"Kitchen Confidential\\". I agree with the reviewer who stated that this author bit off more than she can chew."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agrees with Bruce Henderson...","review":"I thought Bruce's book of the same title was much better, and truer to my own experiences as a server. I would suggest others might want to look at that book if they're seeking \\"the original\\" chronicle of what servers go through."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring!","review":"I love books that depict real life. I thought this one would have some good stories and was impressed with reader reviews. Unfortunately I was disappointed. I rarely stop reading a book before the end but at about 75% I couldn't take it anymore. Just a long life story about someone who happens to be a waitress. No juicy stories to speak of and much much longer than necessary. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was surprised at how much I liked this book.","review":"Though hesitant to purchase it at first, I really enjoyed this book. I've never been a waitress, but it made me feel as though I had. Admittedly, it's a bit self absorbed. You might think, Who is this woman? and Why should I care about her life story? But Ginsberg is a natural storyteller who drew me right in. This slice-of-life book illustrates the warm relationships the author shares with her family and (mostly transient) friends, as well as the sometimes bizarre, funny, and horrifying interactions she has with her patrons. I found myself eagerly turning the pages, and yet not wanting it to end. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"An entertaining look at the industry","review":"If you have never worked in the restaurant field, you are sure to find this book entertaining with the colorful people Debra encounters through 20 years of waiting on table.If you have worked in the industry, as I have, as a waiter, cook, bartender and now manager, you are sure to be able to relate with Debra's experiences. One I started reading, I found it hard to put the book down.Several times I laughed out loud as one of her recollections prompted me to recall an experience of my own, be it a colorful co-worker, or a guest that either made my night, or made my night an unbelievable problem.She has shown that waiting tables is not just a job, it's an adventure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative and a bit whiny","review":"While the author claims to like her work as a waitress, enjoys the flexibility and money, the book is full of complaints about restaurant managers, cooks and customers. And the story wanders in many places; she may be telling a story about a current and yet again unsatisfactory job and start talking about something unrelated and then come back to the present. My head was swimming. There is an undertone of indignation through out the story. I did develop a great appreciation of wait staff, however and do realize how hard they work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Wait","review":"I was disappointed in this book. As a former waitress myself, I found this book devoid of the true essence and excitement of working in the restaurant industry. There are missed opportunities to go into detail about colleagues or customers and pull the reader deeper into her tale. Instead, the book is a mishmash of people and places that never build a connection compelling enough to want to read on. The book's only \\"true confession\\" is that Ms. Ginsberg does not have a very high opinion of her profession or her customers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waiting:the true confessions of a waitress","review":"Excellent book! It gave me an insider's view of a job that is much more difficult than I had ever imagined. I've alwayed believed in tipping well, but now I appreciate the service I recieved even more.I also enjoyed reading about the small, but satisfying, slices of life that Debra shared; not only about herself, but the soap oprahs behind the swinging doors!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reviews as insightful as the book!","review":"I find it amusing that most of the reviews I've read for this book follow a similar pattern. Former and/or current servers love it. Readers who have never served hate it and even seem angry at Ginsberg for writing it.\\"Waiting\\" is hilarious. It's full of fun tales from behind the scenes in the food service business. Better yet, it's an honest glimpse into the writer's life. Not heavy, but meaty enough make the book more than a collection of amusing anecdotes--which wouldn't be so bad, either.So why do so many non-servers dislike it? Perhaps they don't like knowing that the person overseeing their dining experience is a real person. Maybe they don't appreciate learning how their servers probabaly feel about them. Or maybe they just don't like looking into the mirror Ginsberg places squarely before them in this book.My advice? Why don't you all find a manager to complain to. Maybe you can get a free desert out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting subject beaten to death with the dull stick","review":"Dreadful and quite disappointing. What could have been very engaging material suffers from the author's deadly boring style and tendency to overexplain and preach. This woman claims to be a professional writer, yet she has no ability to draw the reader in or to tell a compelling story--and there are many, many compelling stories to be told in the restaurant business."},{"rating":"1","title":"The negative reviews are quite accurate...","review":"One of the basic axioms of a writer is \\"Don't tell me, show me.\\" Don't say you're funny. Don't say you can write well. And don't say you have an insight to the basic human experience. Especially when you don't.There was an opportunity for some good stories in this book, and Ginsburg may be a good observor of human nature, but her writing is not particularly compelling and the stories don't grab you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A WEIGHTING EXPERIENCE","review":"I must disagree with summerfield2 in a major way. I feel the author did a good job of telling her story though I skipped the last 20 pages as I wasn't interested in the subject matter of comparing the job of waiting in various movies.The author did not complain about her job, but detailed the raunchy \\"goings on\\" in most restaurants among the help and then again the strange \\"goings on\\" of certain patrons while at the same time getting out the orders and trying to please the customers.Actually the rate of pay for waiting is quite good compared to the hours worked, but, of course, depending on the restaurant of choice. The hours can be most flexible and the job, though taxing physically, can be very interesting and satisfying. A good read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry to disagree","review":"... I found the book quite boring. I was hoping for some funny stories and perhaps some perspective on what we can do to make a servers life a little more pleasant and avoid some of those nasty misunderstandings that can lead to mutual unhappiness on both sides. Instead I found myself suffering through a life story that did not interest me in the slightest. Avoid this book if you were hoping she would just stick to talking about the job."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most unfulfilling of meals","review":"I can't understand why this book was published. There are so many good books in this genre (try \\"Tender at the Bone\\" or the restaurant chapter of \\"Saturday Night,\\" for example), why publish one that has nothing going for it? The author has no mastery over the use of description, there's no detail about the places, the characters, the work, even her experiences. it's a quick, easy read, but like fast-food, you aren;t so happy when you're finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waiting, True confessions of a Waitress","review":"I have been a waitress for twenty years plus, often questioned by friends and family why, I would recomend this book to anyonewondering why thier bright and talented friend or family memberwaiting tables doesn't have a \\"real\\" job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I have worked in the restaurant industry for eleven years and have often penned my own stories of my experiences there, but Debra Ginsberg wrote the book I could only dream of. She does a remarkable job of describing the challenges of the job, the atmosphere behind the scenes of a restaurant and the physical demands of the job. Anyone who has spent time in the arena of foodservice will enjoy Debra's book, and I wish it were required reading for everyone who patronizes restaurants. My favorite aspect of this book is the way that Debra is able to address the public's rather simple perception of waitresses and compare that with a much more realistic portrait of the intelligent, independent women (and men) who are able to do well in the industry. This was an amazing book and I will be recommending it to many friends and members of my family who have not worked in restaurants, but have lived vicariously (and are much better tippers because of it) through my stories over the years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank Goodness She Has a Day Job","review":"Quite simply, the extent to which this book reeks is astonishing. Debra Ginsberg, should be slapped in the face with leather gloves for ever thinking she was entitled to put pen to paper. Not until the last chapter does she realize that her life has been without consequence. I could have told her that after reading the first couple of pages. Do yourself a favor: If you're in need of some good waitress stories, go get yourself a job at a local restaurant. You have my guarantee that your experiences will be better than the slop Ginsberg slings. Her writing, full of cliché and nothingness, is unforgivable. Even the most casual reader can play a remarkably crowded game of connect-the-dots with her use of the word \\"singularly.\\" Well, Debra Ginsberg has written history's singularly most unimportant book."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Insure Pleasure - - - Read Something Else","review":"An utterly disappointing read. Overall, this book was a total waste of time. I'd read the other reviews looking forward to a delightful read giving me some insight into the food industry and the entire waitstaff experience and was totally let down. It was like expecting the Palm for a delicious steak and getting to dine at Goober's Dew Drop Inn. Need I say more."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Insult to the Industry","review":"I stopped reading the book when the subject of tipping came about and Mrs. Debra's started her litany about the fact that 100% of any received tip should go integrally to her pocket.When we in Europe go to Restaurants, it is the complete experience that interests us, the atmosphere, the food served, the reputation of the restaurant. Waiters should be invisible and are part of that experience. If and when we tip, the tip is for all of those who contributed to the experience.Everytime I am in America, I am frustrated by waiters asking how I am doing and comment on my tie.I thought the book was going to give me an insight of a certain part of the industry. It does not achieve that goal unfortunately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waiting doesn't get it done","review":"Ginsberg writes down to her audience; bad tipper, bad managers, grumpy cooks. Men who grope her, coworkers that cheat her. In her life's journey, detailed sometimes in confession-style honesty (but without the contrition), she wants us to know that the waitress we ignore is an important part of our restaurant experience and should be handled with care.She doesn't get it.In a service industry like food service, we don't want to know the details of our servers bad day, single motherhood, or wacky friends. While Ginsberg tells us continuously of her love of writing, including several unpublished attempts before this memoir, perhaps the best confession she could have offered is an admission that she's just not that good at it. Anyone can write down her work stories, the fun, the funny, and the tragic. Repeating them does not make a writer.If her life's journey was to get material for a good book, waiting didn't get it done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waiting...for the Novel to End","review":"Seemingly the only negative review of this book, I am dissapointed with Ginsberg for promising a \\"lively and insightful look into restaurants\\" and delivering quite the opposite. Claiming to be part social commentary, part ettiquette guide, and part memoir, this book bit of more than it can chew and ends up to be a rambling no-direction three hundred pages. From a literary point of view, the writing is simple and there is an abundance of cliches and kitchy, 'witty' comments with the use of the word 'waiting'. Ginsberg does provide some positive, and occasionally laughable perspectives of waitressing, but Waiting is simply a good concept with poor execution."},{"rating":"2","title":"So true!","review":"I have been a server for almost 20 years now and couldnt agree or relate to the writer more! We are definetly a different breed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh..","review":"Some interesting restaurant stories, but while she spends a lot of time saying that she has no problem being a waitress, she spends even more time saying she's really a writer. I wanted some funny/awful/sweet stories of things that happened in the restaurant, not a psychosocial treatise on the lot of the single working mother. For that we have Barbara Ehrenreich."},{"rating":"2","title":"A look from the other side of the table","review":"Interesting to read about restaurants from a waitress' point of view. She had many good stories to tell. I don't think I could do that job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waiting: Real Life Stories","review":"Excellent book. Enjoyed reading the way life is to Ms. Ginsberg as she relives her days as a waitress. She includes the family life also - her style is very warm, amusing and true to life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad Tippers and Other Tales from the Edge of the Table","review":"THIS is a good book. You've just got to trust me on this one. Part memoir, part guide on how to treat your waitress, this book rocks!Based on the author's life, Ginsberg's book follows her from when it was cool to be a waitress to when it was necessary. From \\"low end\\" waitressing to raking in the dough at fancy restaurants and exclusive country clubs, Ginsberg has been there, done that, and now she's going to sit you down and tell you about it. Her writing is very accessible and you won't be able to put it down. For most of the book you will think that she is foolish to continue working as a (gasp) waitress while she has a college degree and a natural talent for writing, but by the end you'll realize that if she hadn't, you wouldn't have been able to go through it with her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Academy Award Should Be Repossessed","review":"If you liked the original, this \\"director's cut\\" should be avoided. For starters, why not include the original theatrical release on the Blu-ray??? Give me a break. At least I would have been able to salvage the disc. Seriously, it wasn't good enough to win the academy award; why re-edit it? None of the extra footage added anything to the movie on any level. It was just a wasted effort.....a total disappointment. Don't say I didn't warn you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amadeus","review":"With the VHS (video) version, the story is more complete in the sense that you see the whole story as it was originally portrayed in the movie.

OK, it's a fiction, but a great film. Th film itself is an Opera, with the Mozart music. It recall to us what is a great fim : the intact emotion. Mavelous"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and refreshing interpretation of musical genius","review":"The underlying theme here is that genius is given by God sometimes to those who may not deserve it. I pitied Salieri in this film. Excellent acting by F. Murray Abraham. The interaction between Salieri and Mozart during the composition of the Requiem is fascinating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful masterpiece....","review":"The best movie chronicling the life of a composer I have seen to date. Except, the storyline involving Salieri's connection to Mozart's death, isn't exactly factual, it was clever to assume so. Tom Hulce as Mozart gives a breathtaking performance. He becomes the character. I loved his crazy laugh! This is definitely a movie to see - it was quite epic for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Brilliant like Mozart himself!","review":"I am a high school freshmen and we saw this film in class as apart of our history lessons. I just gotta say that this film was simply brilliant just like Mozart himself! This film gave me an insight on Mozart himself. It was sad though, at the end when Mozart died. As for that guy who's against Mozart, well, I felt mad and yet sympathized him. This film is really, really good! A good look back at history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"I loved Amadues. It's been my favourite movie since I was 6(I am 13 now!) I think they really did do a superb job in making the scenes look like it's 18th/19th Century style, and how Mozart's life was even more exciting that you could see the movie!I really enjoyed it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A highly entertaining film","review":"This film won best picture and was on AFI's top 100 list and for good cause. When I first watched it, I thought, Mozart, opera, blah, boring. But I was highly surprised. The movie is really entertaining and the music is great. It shows jealousy, mediocrity, and greatness. Everyone can relate to Antonio Salieri, we've all watched someone who is better than us at something and thought what he thought, but he gets his revenge. Also this the is the best way to get interested in classical music which isn't so bad after all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amadeus - Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition)","review":"Amadeus - Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition)~ F. Murray Abraham is a supperior cut since it allows the viewer to better understand the relationship between Mozart and Sallieri. It also adds valuable scenes for instance when Constanza Mozart is turned down by Salieri. For my part they could have added even more since I absloutely love this movie and I think they could have fleshed out some scenes even more (like another 30 minutes or so). F. Murray Abraham is stupendous in his role as Salieri and Tom Hulce is also great in his interpretation of Mozart. I love the music, the costumes and the scenery of this amazing movie and I think it is a movie not to be missed. Most definitely reccommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy the original theatrical release","review":"I love \\"Amadeus\\" and consider it one of the best movies of all time. However, the director's cut makes the movie feel too long without adding substantially to the story. Yes, it does \\"flesh out a couple of small subplots and shed new light on certain key scenes\\". But this clarity comes at a cost to the overall tempo and feel of the movie.I'm also one who believes that we don't need to know everything (think about the suitcase in \\"Pulp Fiction\\"). By giving just a hint rather than fleshing out the details, a filmmaker leaves room for the imagination of the viewer, which can make a film more satisfying in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Movie, Sounds Great in Surround Sound","review":"I bought this movie because it was affordable and i wanted to bump it on my new surround sound. The movie is a classic, and is a very interesting piece of historical fiction. Not a movie i can watch 5 times in a week, but great to have around for a lazy Saturday when you was a substance filled movie watching experience. The packaging is standard, and it arrived on time in good condition. Definitely a movie you can watch with your parents or your children (pending their age). Good acting, amazing music, and sounded really nice on the surround sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reductive","review":"I'm doing a term paper on Mozart for an elective course, and I must say, the film \\"Amadeus\\" is so far from fact that I couldn't really enjoy it. Just don't watch it thinking you're going to learn much of who Mozart really was.He and his wife produced six children, for example - the movie shows only one. Wouldn't the death of 4 of his kids in infancy made him slightly less chipper?Of course I loved the snippets of music; who wouldn't? But it was more like a smooth melding of \\"Greatest Hits Melodies\\" than a chance to really get into his music.Can someone recommend - can someone MAKE - a movie that really does Mozart justice?This movie is really a Johnny One Note."},{"rating":"1","title":"for the dvd not the movie","review":"this movie is great. the dvd thats another story. no special features , second side doesnt work in my dvd player. geeze was i wrong to put this on my christmas list. well buy the tape. not the dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!!!","review":"The dvd played a picture with NO sound! I never received a refund. I never received a call back or email or anything. DO NOT BUY!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the point?","review":"I don't get the point of making a fictionalised version of a real person's story. Either tell the real story or present the work as pure fiction. Why overwrite Mozart's life story with your own?Mozart was a genius. In this movie, he was portrayed as a buffoon. It was irritating, served no purpose and detracted from the story. The story itself is only very loosely based on history. If you like fiction, this would be fine for you, but if you want to learn about Mozart, I would recommend reading the bookLoving Mozart: A Past Life Memory of the Composer's Final Years.I give this movie a 1, at least for the nice music and opera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"Great disappointment - Movie has NO SOUND - This was Xmas present for my Dad!!!

Moreover the copy didn't contain Dutch subtitles, so I really wonder what I'd ever again buy at Amazon. I was flabberghasted to see that it was possible to make even two fatal mistakes in just one very simple order like this. Ridiculous.Bye bye, Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely the worst video quality I have seen","review":"I don't think Warner Brothers could have found a poorer print to make this dvd from. I couldn't even focus on the movie because of the amount 'specs' and 'flakes' present throughout the presentation. I had to do a double take to make sure I had a dvd on rather than a worn rental video tape. There was also some of the worst digital video breakup around minute 98 that I have seen from a dvd.Also, although not stated anywhere, the disc is two-sided and requires you to flip it over at the end of side one. I wasn't aware of it and when side one was complete, it just went to the menu. No mention to flip the disc over or anything. just unbelievably bad.I am extremely disappointed in this dvd and would strongly suggest you not purchase it. If you do, be sure you express your displeasure with Warner brothers as I have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nearly ruined an amazing movie!","review":"I absolutely LOVED the theatrical release, bought the soundtrack on LP, the VHS version, and was delighted to see Amadeus on DVD at a video store. I snapped it up without paying much attention to the words \\"Director's Cut\\" at the bottom of the case. Then I tried to watch it. The Director's Cut nearly ruined the whole movie for me. The added material slowed down the pace, did not add to the story, and was a major distraction from the music. I could hardly wait for our family's next yard sale so I could unload this thing. Fortunately, I found a DVD of the theatrical cut a couple of years later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio did not work","review":"Picture was fine, music was able to be heard but no dialogue.

The theatrical release won 8 academy awards including Best Picture not Director's cut which truly would've ruined this picture. Would pay full price for fully restored theatrical release on Blu-ray which would include separate uncompressed high quality separate sound track of full Mozart scores featured in movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful movie......","review":"In my opinion this is one of the best movies ever made. The acting and the music by far are wonderful.When seeing this movie for the first time when I was 15, it gave me a new interest in learning about that divinely talented man, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for a Theatrical Release","review":"I'm in agreement with many others who have reviewed the Director's Cut - the added footage ruins the flow of the movie and coherence of the characters.I love the theatrical release of this movie, and I'm very disappointed that they chose not to include the theatrical release in this blu-ray set. Amadeus is a gorgeous film, and I would very much like to enjoy the original in hi-def splendor.As of now it's a choice between watching a pretty movie and a good movie. I'll be watching my old DVD theatrical version until they release it on Blu-Ray. Watching the blu-ray directors cut equates to wasting 3 hours getting mad about what they did to an excellent movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A travesty","review":"A beautiful transfer of video and sound ruined by gratuitous extra footage.

Although there are gaping historical accuracies, it is truer to life than certain other productions in the same genre (e.g., Immortal Beloved). The acting is superb; Abraham plays the part of the aging, frustrated mediocrity very convincingly, and the character of Mozart is also very good (although I am not so familiar with the actor). Indeed, everyone in the movie, from the main characters to the NDs, is very convincing. Visual factors, such as set design and lighting, are flawless. The score, as one might expect, is collected from Mozart's great works. Although classical music in modern movies sometimes backfires, it is executed perfectly here, and the effect is very nice. I have no noteworthy qualms about this movie, neither with the execution nor with the design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Movie of All Time!","review":"We all have different tastes, and this movie happens to be my personal favorite. Mozart was a genius and his mind worked like no other composer. He was also quite difficult, as great minds sometimes are.Amadeus the movie combines humor, the amazing story of this brilliant composer, darkness, sorrow, and the life of Mozart creating a fantastic film. The music of course is so incredible, and the story behind it is something that you should not miss out on seeing. I highly recommend buying this movie if you love laughing, music, biographies, excellent acting, Mozart's era, or just about anything. It is for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Extras","review":"Amadeus is a very good film. The main reason I'm writing is that the set I received had no extras. Disc A had the movie. Disc B was supposed to be about the making of Amadeus, but it had the same content as Disc A: the movie and a few extras. So if you are interested in the extras, be aware. You may not get what is promised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie!","review":"This was a movie which was so entertaining from start to finish. It was funny and the music is so entertaining. If you love the music from Mozart, this will be the movie to watch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"I saw this movie for the first time when i was 10 and i fell in love with it. I love the music in this movie and im in love with Tom Hulce in this movie. Tom Hulce and F. murray Abraham were great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a wonderful masterpiece","review":"I just happened to watch the film and the documentary \\"The making of Amadeus\\" yesterday - not the first time though. All I can say is that after all these years, I am still deeply touched by the story, its characters and the absolute perfectionism and emotion with which the film was realized. Understanding Mozart's life is certainly not to be achieved by watching a movie - even though this one is wonderfully crafted. However this devine spirit that must have lead Mozart in creating music comes across very intensely - and becomes even more poignant through the documentary. It shows the immense dedication and emotionality that everyone in the project contributed: Shaffer, Forman, all actors and production staff. I am thankful for this wonderful work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who has actually seen the DVD version?","review":"I've seen this film many times--but before I buy the DVD I'd like a review of the DVD--who has seen it on DVD? Though I know the DVD version is probably spectacular, I'd still like to know what other people think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Libel and slander","review":"I'm usually not a big stickler for historical accuracy in movies, but Amadeus is outrageous for its slander of Salieri. In fact, not only was he a consistent supporter and advocate for Mozart, he later provided patronage and assistance for three young men named Beethoven, Schubert and Liszt. Just about the only thing Salieri is remembered for in the history books is his astounding generosity and enjoyment of competition. Depicting Salieri as homicidal with jealousy is rather like making a movie in which Abraham Lincoln buys Frederic Douglass and makes him his house slave."},{"rating":"1","title":"Profound disappointment","review":"When I bought this DVD I thought I was buying the whole movie of Amadeus as I remember it from 1984. Instead the original movie was cut drastically, and many scenes I remember, including sample scenes from Mozart's operas, especially Don Giovanni, were missing, and only the bare bones of Salieri's \\"plot\\" was depicted.Please tell me, what happened to the rest of the movie?Or did I miss something?I tried the various options on the opening menu and could find no evidence that any more footage from the original, other than what I saw, was on the DVD. If I am wrong I would gladly keep the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Cinematic Failure","review":"Based on the superior and intellectually taunt stage play, the film version of Amadeus boasts an exceptional performance by Abraham, remarkable art direction and costume design, and a fascinating glimpse into the Austrian court. Unfortunately, it is also riddled with enough minor annoyances to completely undercut these virtues. Chief among these annoyances is an extensive dilution of the original play's theme, which is generally trashed in favor of a more soap opera-ish focus. Another significant annoyance is the wild disparity in accents used by the actors in the film, with Hulce a prime example; his otherwise interesting performance is significantly hampered by a determinedly modern American accent, a circumstance which makes it difficult to accept him in the title role. At best, Amadeus is an interesting failure; at worst, it is an example of a brilliant play watered down to appeal to the lowest common denominator of popular taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's Go Crazy","review":"The classic \\"battle of the bands\\" movie, in which our hero (The Kid) overcomes adversity and defeats the entrenched musical establishment by kicking butt in a triumphant orchestral finale.Oh wait, that's Purple Rain.Um, this movie is basically a Purple Rain [imitation]."},{"rating":"1","title":"What&#65533;s all the fuss about?","review":"I fell prey to a deception: Academy Award: Best Picture, Produced by: Saul Zaentz. In this case, that combination was hardly worth the paper on which it was printed.I knew little about the life of Mozart when I started watching, and knew little more upon completion. Sure it's lavish, and sure it's grand, and it is fun. Maybe too many caricatures, not enough reality? I can't imagine the finished product is the film they set out to make.Don't get me wrong. It's not the responsibility of every historical film to educate, but usually a certain amount of education comes with the territory. Here it is all a la carte I am saddened to say.This film hardly stands in there with many of the Best Picture winners, but it is by no means the bottom of the heap either.On to the next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manic, Ultimately Flat","review":"Great sets and costumes don't redeem almost three hours of enduring a muddled screenplay and poor, often over-the-top, acting by the protagonist and others. A promising beginning deteriorated steadily to a point where I was ready to bail out but somehow stuck with it.I decided to try this after getting into Mozart the last couple of years. I thought at the least the score would be good. But instead of his concertos, symphonies, and serenades, we get his unfamiliar (to me) operas.A perfect example of Hollywood rewarding the lushness of the production despite a tiresome (and historically inaccurate) story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Film!","review":"I first saw this film in my AP European History class (but don't watch it for its historical content :)I recently bought it and watched it again.

The Director's Cut, which I saw last spring when it was shown in NYC, includes a scene in which Mozart's wife disrobes in front of Salieri; I assume this is the reason for the new rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surrealistic and spellbinding","review":"This is my second viewing of the movie, and I realize how very much I missed the first time. One should be prepared for it. Do not expect it to be a faithful biography, because it certainly isn't. And it's not supposed to be. That is not the purpose.Rather, this is a bit of a fantasy retelling of the life and times of a brilliant composer. The film is hypnotic in the images produced, and the Mozart music is enthralling.There is darkness here as we're taken into the mind of Salieri and his envy of Mozart's ability to create such beautiful music. And we must bear in mind that this portrayal is undoubtedly an injustice to the historical Salieri. This is much more of a \\"what if\\" than a realistic picture.That in mind, this is a picture to be savored, to be enjoyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie except for one thing","review":"It's too bad a movie of this caliber had to be a flipper. This is the type of movie that sets a mood and tone that shouldn't be disrupted. Beyond that, everything else was great. I loved how the music flowed on my home theater system.

I decided to get the Director's cut of Amadeus which had deleted scenes added. I was prepared for them some of them being silly or unnecessary (as some were), but overall they RUIN the movie! For one thing, the rating is changed from PG to R! I wasn't aware of this when I bought it, but I can see why! I wish I could erase these extra scenes from my memory. You could sympathize with Salieri in the original release. With the deleted scenes added, he's just a villain -- guilty of far worse crimes than anything he accuses Mozart of. The point of the movie is lost, the characters no longer make sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Knight at the Opera","review":"Movie making at its best. This somewhat forgotten classic is rarely seen on television and is worth every penny of purchase or rental.Abraham won a well deserved Oscar, yet it's Hulce who steals the show with his credible,offbeat portrayal of Mozart.Oh well, perhaps life is just as unfair today as it was in 18th century Austria. Whether or not you've seen this production, further babble from this reviewer can do nothing to heighten viewer interest. Let the show begin!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love This Movie","review":"One of my favorite movies ever. Who cares how much of Mozart's life was embellished or just plain fictionalized in \\"Amadeus\\"? It introduced Mozart to thousands of people (the two soundtrack albums sold as if they were #1 pop hits). Certainly, it helped fuel a Mozart revival and increase the number of his compositions in orchestra repertoires. Bravo!I will never forget how the entire audience, when I first saw \\"Amadeus,\\" sat quietly all the way through the final credits at the end of the movie. And this was an audience in Dallas, full of teen-agers on a Saturday night. No one moved until the last note sounded of the gorgeous \\"Romanza\\" movement from the D minor piano concerto. What a tribute to Mozart's music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful story!","review":"The 'film' is wonderful! The acting is great, and the music is beyond beautiful!

It means \\"loved by God.\\" The film studies the contrast between Mozart's genius and Salieri's mediocrity. It is really about Mozart's rival with Pinto from \\"Animal House\\" in a supporting role. Late in life, Salieri confesses to having poisoned Mozart. Scholars generally agree that Mozart died from Rheumatic fever, Another conspiracy theory debunked! Amadeus won 8 Academy Awards. Saul Zaentz is the producer, the guy who clashed with John Fogerty over rights to the songs Fogerty wrote for CCR. Zaentz headed Fantasy Records."},{"rating":"1","title":"great movie - horrible mastering of dvd","review":"the movie is stellar, the people who mastered this dvd should be ashamed. This is for the 1997 & Jan 08 re-release of this movie. I owned the 1997 release and they split the movie half on side 1, the other on side 2. I thought the re-release, which I repurchased, would have the movie on 1 side, as technology has improved immensely, it was just the same horrible sub VHS copy as my original dvd. Having the movie as a \\"flipper\\" is impractical.

I accidentally ordered this director's cut, which I avoid religiously because I've never liked director's cut movies. This one is arguably the WORST I've seen. Even though Salieri is bad and is responsible for the death of Amadeus in the theatrical version, in this version he is made truly evil. That's only one thing I hated about it... I can't even list all the things I hated. There's even nudity, which just does not fit with the theme of this incredible movie.

I didn't even like classical music at the time. Well, I was astounded and moved by it like no other film I had ever seen. The acting was exellent, the story enthralling, and the music! It was like listening to the voice of God. A kings composer forgoten overnight and a forgoten nobody becomes one of history's most renouned composers, if not the greatest in history. F. Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce are brilliant, as is Jeffrey Jones as the bumbling Emperor of Austria who \\"had no ear at all.\\" I imediatly purchased the soundtrack and other comositions by Mozart, amazing for a guy who thought he hated classical music.

Mozart remained a success toward the end of his life, while the legend that Salieri poisoned Mozart out of jealousy is just that. Toward the end of his life, Salieri went crazy and started saying wild things, including that he killed Mozart -- of which there is not a scrap of evidence.OK. I'm done ranting.

There was background music playing and I could see them speaking but couldn't hear them. Weird. Ok so i checked the player, it was fine. After fiddling with the menu for what seemed like 10 minutes, I got sound. Good. Let's watch the movie. Chapter 23 ends. Yep, just ends and I was like where is the rest of the movie??? There weren't two discs...where could the rest of the movie possibly be? So I thought for a moment and I took the disc out and flipped it over. There it was, 14 more chapters. I don't think I have ever flipped a disc in my life...seriously. OK, play... again background music and NO talking again. Had to fiddle with it and the menu many more minutes.

Gratuitous nudity and thin scenes that should have been left on the film edit floor. I cant understand what they substatially did for this great movie other than significantly dilute it.

I have always considered the theatrical release one of the best movies ever. This version changes the movie entirely. Salieri goes from being a sympathetic character who speaks for 'mediocrity' to a horrible person that is no different from the typical bad guy in most dramas. The uniqueness, comedy, and enjoyment of the movie is ruined. I would definitely wait until the theatrical release is out on blu-ray. Up converted DVD is just find for this movie, and the theatrical release is available on dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teachers Beware","review":"I have shown the original version of this movie many times over the years in my classroom as part of a unit on Mozart and was very familiar with the content of the movie. This newer version contains scenes that were not in the original and I was not aware that scene 16 contains nudity until I showed it to my seventh graders-so beware! By the way, this movie is unrated as there were no ratings for movies at that time-the original does contain some inappropriate language which I explain to my students that the use of this language helps to explain Mozart's behavior."},{"rating":"2","title":"One giant \\"Special Feature\\"","review":"This is a wonderful piece of eye candy for anyone who enjoyed Amadeus. My only complaint, is that one brief but classic bit of footage was removed from the director's cut: It was when Salieri was talking to God of \\"ruin(ing) your incarnation...\\" and his face twisted into pure bitterness as he looked upward, then he glanced at the priest, and broke into an inexplicably sweet face. It was such a charater-enriching moment, that made me decide to keep my original, and treat this new set as a giant \\"Extra\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is grand","review":"This is a great movie. If I had never seen it, I would never have developed an interest in the music or the life of Mozart. This movie is by non means a biography of W. A. Mozart, but it does focus around his life.

From what I have read on Mozart, the movie plays well, touching lightly on different parts of Mozart's life. While not going into great depth on anything, the movie is one not to be missed. The best thing about the movie is the approach from another composer who has admired Mozart's work anonymously, and feels his actions may have lead to Mozart's demise. The musical scores are awesome... listen in Surround!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I prefer the theatrical version","review":"Since the middle 90s I have a beautiful laserdisc of the theatrical version of this movie and I'll keep it as long as the theatrical version won't be available again.

Most of the time, the director's cuts are wonderful but this time, it's awfull."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Greatest Movies EVER","review":"What more can be said about this classic? This is one of my favorite movies of all time. The direction, acting, sets, music, ALL superb. The Director's Cut stretches the length to neary 3 hours but it goes by quickly. It looks and sounds great on Blu-ray and if you're a fan you should upgrade from DVD. The use of Mozart's music set to certain scenes of the film is superb (like every time the mysterious masked man appears). The scenes of the operas are amazing. For a film about the demise of one of our greatest composers there is a surprising amount of humor as well. Movies don't get better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with Theatrical Version","review":"This version of \\"Amadeus\\" was fabulously disappointing. The writing in the extra scenes are atrociously bad. They don't flow at all and they are so badly written they make what was left in the theatrical version look bad. It's amazing to see how they made a Best Picture out of this movie.The extra scenes are also dull, obviously written to flesh out a plot that didn't need fleshing out- you can infer everything these scenes add, or, make your own interpretation of Salieri's motivations and character. In this way, the scenes insult the intelligence of the viewer. And they're boring too! They slow the pace of the movie down, and it's far less exciting. That's something the theatrical version did well - it was very exciting.For people who know the original well, you're not missing anything with the Director's Cut.For people who have never seen Amadeus, at least see the theatrical version first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sumptuous, but it's not Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart....","review":"Despite the beautiful costumes, production values, and exquisite music, I have never been able to sit through this entire movie because of the DISTORTION of Mozart's personality--created to 'justify' the irritation that Salieri was supposed to have felt because of the superiority of Mozart's music. Mozart was NOT the 'goofball' depicted in this movie! He had a sense of naughty humor (read his letters exchanged with a cousin, gathered and published in a book that I'm sure you'll find in the library). But he knew how to behave himself and was not as irresponsible as the writers made him look (in order to 'prove' their point about jealousy)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"After looking everywhere could not find it!!!This was a must have for Xmas gift.

This movie is funny at times and incredibly gives a accruate portrait of what life was like back then.

Beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Original Version Still Best","review":"If you still prefer the theatrical release of this movie (meaning no extra storyline) then this is the one for you. I actually have both versions and prefer this one. Plus, this version has a bit of (tasteful) nudity; which isn't a big deal unless you're planning on showing this movie in an educational setting. Having to swap discs is a bit of a drag, but if that's what it takes to get the original version, then so be it."},{"rating":"2","title":"AVOID RANCID DIRECTORS CUT","review":"Amadeus was my favorite movie since I had first seen it in 1986. The whole affair is pretty special to me. Naturally the music, the scenery, the characters all make this one of the greatest movies of all time, only to be replaced by Saving Private Ryan and Braveheart as my favorites.I went out to get the Director's Cut version and have to say, as with most deleted scenes, there is a good reason they are deleted. While it does fill in some holes in the plot, they take away from the original release's magic, and ruin the feel as it was intended. I dumped the Director's Cut and am more than happy with the original DVD release where I cannot tell any difference in picture quality, and it would seem the sound is better.Five stars for this excellent movie....-5 stars for the piece of crap Director's Cut release. Save your money and enjoy the movie as it was intended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Thing Directors Don't Get Their Cut","review":"Amadeus featured amazing performances by the actors, great costumes and wonderful writing, not to mention beautifully integrated music supporting and enlarging the action of the film... but the director was clearly in love with the complexities he went through in recreating Mozart's operatic performances. This \\"director's cut\\" version included a disproportionate amount of opera performance, which in my view did little to enlarge or enhance the viewer's understanding of Mozart's musical genius.You're better off with the movie cut as it originally appeared in theatres. Much tighter, more concentrated, and a proper balance of music and story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"good stuff","review":"Product arrived in the promised time frame.

I enjoy both versions of the film.My major complaint with this release is the quality of the video. Warner has used DNR (digital noise reduction) to \\"clean up\\" the film. The film grain is no longer visible - even when the video is projected onto a large screen - and fine detail has been lost or smeared.This really breaks my heart, as this is one of my favorite films. I can only hope there is eventually a better video mastering committed to disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do they do this?","review":"You can omit the trailers, the commentary and all the extras.

I don't understand the technology of mixing sound, but it was the way Mozart washed over me in the theater that gave gave me the feeling of being in the period theater during the performance scenes.That being said, I found the Director's cut to be interesting. I did enjoy the extended opera scenes, but didn't care too much for the addition to the scene with Salieri and Constanze - however, it was very interesting to see the scene in an informational kind of way.If you are a lover of the original movie, this is still a wonderful piece for your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mozart Lover","review":"Always a lover of created stories of real people. The Characters were over the top. Mozart's fear of his father was carried off so well and the snobbery of the court musicians was fabulous. The characters are a true study in acting so the movie is worth watching for the tremendous variety of character studies by their actor/ess."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mediocre Mozart","review":"As a work of fiction, this movie was acceptable. Yet, it is the reason that many people think Mozart was a childish pervert. He wasn't. He actually was very intellegent and capable of upholding the strict standards of decorum of 18th century Vienna. Shaffer has created a fictional Mozart, and that has greatly influenced the way society pictures the true Mozart. If one wishes to see a mediocre example of film-making, watch this movie.

First off, like many other classics on my list (Spinal Tap,eg), this is a movie my wife didn't think was funny. Perhaps a gender issue, I don't know, but I found Major League to be original and entertaining.

It also reverberates with Century's own pride at being welcomed into this \\"exotic\\" environment. This is just the kind of book that most liberal white Americans believe helps to promote racial tolerance; instead, it really sets the race movement back. Instead of fixating, sometimes with pecular intensity, on the up-and-down lives of his black subjects, Century--like most naive white liberals--should fixate first on his own racial sensitivities, expectations, and attitudes.

But when it gets right down to it, this snazzy-looking little number may or may not suit your personal needs.Pluses: Easy to set, whether you have arthritis or are wearing enormous oven mits. When set 15+ minutes, the ring is very loud and clear, with an appealling old-fashioned bell sound. Numbers are easy to read.Minuses: The picture is misleading and the construction questionable: the handle is metal, but both the black and silver sections of the base are plastic. When set to shorter intervals, the \\"no ring\\" problem described by the previous reviewer becomes an (annoying) issue.All in all I would say I am disappointed with this item, but since I use it primarily to time family activities, it's not what I would call a soufflé-in-the-rain type catastrophe.If you are looking for an all-purpose kitchen timer, however, this is definitely not your best bet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attractive and ergonomic, but ultimately impractical","review":"Great sleek design; chrome and black are classics. The very ergonomic twistable handle makes picking up and setting this timer a pleasure. However, the fatal drawback to this timer is that the dial face rests flat on your kitchen counter and even curves downward. Once you start using it, you quickly realize that probably every other timer you've owned had a flat, vertical face which was viewable from distance. With this timer, when you've set it on the counter so that '0' is viewable, you can't see the pointer to the number of minutes remaining because it may be on the other side. Or if you set the timer down with the pointer on the number of minutes you've just set viewable, then as the pointer rotates around out of sight down toward zero, you can't tell how much time is left. So while this timer is beautiful and ergonomic, it's not practical. Don't buy it unless you really love the design and can think of a way to mount it on a wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced","review":"Don't have it, was shopping online for rocking horses and found it somewhere else for 30 dollars less!!!

Apparently there is a difference in the dash trim between 2003/2004 models and the 2005-2008. The dash kit was upgraded to cover all models from 2003 to 2008. However, they did not change the part number. So, I ordered a 99-8205 kit for my 2008 Matrix and received the older kit for the '03/'04 models. They have the same part number. I asked Metra customer service to send me the correct pieces and they said NO. The better option would be to order the Scosche TA2044B which is available here at Amazon for a better price and no hassle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice kit!","review":"I bought this kit for a double din Pioneer P4200DVD system. It would work with a normal double din head unit perfectly, however, with the P4200DVD, the faceplate is motorized and the trim ring in this kit would not allow the faceplate to move. I remedied this by removing the bottom portion of the trim ring. Now it works fine.This is a good kit for my 04 Matrix--it fits perfectly. Expect to do some modifications to the kit to get everything to work correctly.

In my case I was installing a head unit with a 7\\" LCD, and the kit had to be trimmed accurately as not to hit the factory fascia. Only 1/8\\" made the difference of fitting and showing a gap. I could be wrong, but this seems to be the only kit available for double din on a '04 Matrix other than complete scratch fabrication."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"My Alpine double din stereo looks OEM in my car with this unit.

I've installed a few decks, so this was not my first time. Took about 20-30 minutes to assemble the Metra pieces, of which the instructions were not easy to follow. The screws included hang on by a thread, so I ended up having to use super glue to hold the sides on. After getting it together I went to install it in the car. The problem was the mounting kit is too wide to fit into the trim piece. I tried both face plates, all the different options, and nothing worked. It is roughly 1/8 inch too wide - which is just enough to make it NOT WORK.Out of my frustration I overnighted the Scosche Pt2049B, and it is perfect. Came already assembled - and it feels literally 10x stronger. Installed in 5 minutes.No questions here- buy the Scosche.I don't work for either company - however I attempted both and one worked, and the other didn't.

The author kept giving out so-called compliments that people looked white. She seems not to like her own race very much. The sexual episodes seemed out of place; I really couldn't see what they had to do with this book. So I turned to the chapter called \\"Research\\" hoping to find proof, but it was lacking there, too.

I expect that you will see a lot more of this talented trio in the future.The combined effect of the emotional web that centers on these 3 gifted performers is enhanced by the rest of the superb ensemble cast and increases the believability of the story-line and the setting. The struggles of everyday life among a group of friends, lovers, and relatives in an economically depressed area is so vivid and life-like that viewers from all walks of life will easily relate to them.As other reviewers have mentioned, the story and the characters develop gradually but relentlessly.

Her mettle is tested with the first song (not the overture, which is the beginning of a famous Oum Kalthoum song called Alf Leil), 'Ifrah ya Elbi,' (Rejoice, oh Heart), and she does a wonderful job. Since this cd is live, her voice grows weaker towards the end of the cd, but not considerably so. I would have preferred a longer more reverent rendition of 'Enta Omry,' but her cover of 'El-Atlaal' made up for it...(even though a longer cover of El-Atlaal would've been nice too.) I think the cd spends way too much time singing Daretel Ayam...despite these minor flaws i enjoyed the cd very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flowers, colour and love","review":"A wonderful wonderful book.Although the book was written some 150 year ago, Mary Eliza Rogers takes you into the intimacies of daily life in Palestine in the 1850's as if it was occurring today. She writes from her heart with honesty,integrity and a clear mind. And although written at a time of Victorian prejudicies and colonialism she writes without bias or judgement. From her beautiful and colourful descriptions one can envisage the Holy Land as it was before undergoing the process of modernisation and change. For anyone who has any attachment to this land it is a truly wonderful and personal experience to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious treats","review":"Real meat treats your dogs will love!

It is a true guide in every sense.The author sites various examples in mythology and history as well as offering up his own personal experiences to illustrate how significant and important our journeys are and how much we have to gain and learn about ourselves if we simply focus and honor the process of the journey.I am very grateful for the insites and will put them into play in my next journey,which will now be sooner than later thanks to this wonderful and stimulating work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silence is Louder","review":"I do so find it amusing to read reviews of this film which claim that \\"nothing happens\\" or describe it as being \\"slow\\". Definitely this film aims at avoiding linear narrative. I would say it is closer in spirit to the Wong Kar Wai films where mood is as much part of the story as are the silences which are loaded with more internal conflicts and reconsiderations and resolutions than all the dialogue in the world. Brilliant acting by Mr. Pearce and Ms. Bonham Carter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Painfully Beautiful","review":"Not only the story being beautiful, the movie is beautifully done in terms of music, images, and story's structure. Similar sweetness and sadness are seen in the movie \\"My Girl\\"(1991).It appears to be a mystic story, but it is rather realistic when thinking of how humans interpret all situations quite subjectively. The more honestly we live, the more subjective we become. The story itself is very sad, but because of its sadness the movie is painfully beautiful. I would imagine this one can be hard to watch for some people who are dealing with a great deal of grief."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceeded My Expectations","review":"I must admit that my sole interest in seeing this film was one of sheer curiosity, it having been written and produced by my mother's cousin, Michael Petroni. I really didn't know what to expect and purposely didn't read any reviews or opinions beforehand in order to form as unbiased an opinion as possible and had no intention of sharing my opinion with the public, once made. That changed, however, before the final credits rolled.This film was so beautifully executed in every way, so deeply intense and so profoundly thought provoking that I was spell-bound throughout its entirety. It was everything I look for in a good, quality motion picture. I completely concur with all of the opinions expressed here. While this film may not be for everyone, it is definitely for anyone who has good taste in fine art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looked For a Long Time for This","review":"Thank you Amazon for finding this for me.

If you like slow, languid pacing, bitter-sweet emotions and gorgeous music and cinematography, then treat yourself to this little known gem. I only gave it 4 stars because the ending was a bit ambiquous, but beautiful just the same. I didn't want it to end. Helena Bonham-Carter and Guy Pearce were perfectly cast and the younger actors did an excellent job which is rare considering the complexity of emotions in their characters. All in all, a fine piece of cinema."},{"rating":"2","title":"Franklin CET-180, A must for any travel to Europe","review":"This product makes the difference between being able to communicate in Europe when your only language in English.

The rust formed on the spots where the slicing blade is welded to the disc. This is not unreasonable -- not EVERYTHING can be made of stainless steel -- but I can't believe nobody mentioned it in all those reviews, and neither did the owner's manual. I'm exchanging this unit for another one, whose discs I will NOT put in the dishwasher.Otherwise, I'm sure the replacement will prove to be a fine unit.

I like the feed tube design better on Cuisinart but I like the heavy duty cast aluminum base of the KitchenAid and the color choices. And MORE POWER. KitchenAid also has outstanding customer service.

Right after the warrantee ended a small piece of plastic on the cover broke rendering the unit useless. I called for a new cover and it is on back order---at least 3 months. No good. The customer service staff insist it isn't a design flaw, however, with a back order of this magnitude I challenge this comment.

It sturdy and not too loud and also very handy to pulverize, puree, shred or slice anything you want. (And it's red!!) You can even make your own grated parmesan in there by just dumping blocks of cheese in the bowl fitted with the blade -no more tasteless sawdust from the supermarket! Cleanup is easy too, although I recommend not to put the bowl and lid in the dishwasher as the insane heat in there tends to produce cracks in that type of plastic. The only drawback is the absence of a good storage system for the attachments -there is a box, but it's pretty bulky..."},{"rating":"2","title":"After all the research I did I am a little disappointed","review":"This is a heavyweight food processor with a powerful motor and steady base and simple controls. I was convinced by a lot of research that it was the best model on the market, but it has a few faults.The tops of the blade attachments pop off, get lost, and then the blade attachments become impossible to clean.Stuff gets in the nooks and crannys of the lid and you need a q-tip to get it out.Most of the accessories are fairly useless because the mouth opening is not as wide as it could be for slicing.Still, this thing works really well for making bread dough and pesto etc. It weighs a ton and doesn't shake much even with a big ball of bread dough going around."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"I don't know how I survived without this machine.

I finally decided to buy this Kitchenaid after I because frustrated with only being able to make one quarter of a batch of scones at a time in the Krups. I could not believe how much better the Kitchenaid was! It's much quieter, much more powerful, and easier to use and clean. I sliced a pound of mushrooms in it in about ten seconds. The mini-bowl is more useful than it looks. It chops even small amounts of garlic and herbs finely without turning it into mush. The safety mechanism is also hassle-free, unlike the new Cuisinart, the bowl and the lid twist on and off in a snap. I use this machine much more often than I thought I would. Along with my Kitchenaid stand mixer, it allows me to make meals that I wouldn't otherwise think of making at home.

Whether you loved Cohn or whether you hated him, this movie is a farce from start to finish. I happened across the film when it was being shown on A&E; one night and dispersed between parts of the film were several gentlemen in the studio who knew Cohn personally and who commented how inaccurate the film was and how it beared no reality to Cohn's real life.Cohn's delusions of the Rosenberg's was absurd. Trying to garner sympathy for the traitors that gave atomic weapon secrets to the Soviets was the height of lunacy. This is a terrible, terrible movie and I caution anyone who wants the real story about Cohn not to watch this trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"McCarthy's right hand man","review":"James Woods gives a riveting performance of Roy Cohn, the lawyer at the center of the US communist witch hunts of the early 1950s. The spoiled brat and closet gay on whom Joe McCarthy so naively relied is shown in a series of flashbacks from his hospital bed in the 1980s. The pace is fast with characters such as Bobby Kennedy, Walter Winchell and Ethel Rosenberg popping up here and there to shed light on Cohn's selfish character. Cohn's habit of helping himself at meals to other people's plates, notably Cardinal Spellman's, sums him up precisely. Naturally, there are moot points. There is, for example, no real evidence Cohn was David Schine's lover and Cohn's relationship with his father was more complex than the comtempt shown in the movie. No matter. Cohn's ability to ruin other people whilst serving his own career and bank balance is succinctly portrayed in an excellently written script."},{"rating":"2","title":"Count me in...","review":"WOW!

If he doesn't like the LAPD, that's fine, it's his opinion, but such antics as writing sarcastic comments about \\"the look\\" of police officer's familes really left a bad taste in my mouth.

As a former officer, having experienced the Watts riots, worker the riots and assigned to 77 Street Division, all I can say is he is WRONG about the riot. His depiction of a rouge Department is unbelievable. Allow me one example. I worked Wilshire Division in 1962. We had two man patrol units then and even before that. The author claims two man units were introduced just prior to the riots because of the tension building in the community. That is false. There was no tension. The bottom line is simple. EVERY NEWS channel showed the looting as it was occurring. It could not be stopped. There were 200,000 people rioting with 3,000 officers on duty to protect 465 square miles of LA. All we could do is surround the area and prevent the riot from spreading. Not until the National Guard was called in and a curfew established was order established.

A great read!My impression, contrary to some of the reviews posted here, is that Joe Domanick has focused on the facts and is not pursuing a political agenda. Much of what he says has been proven by recent events and makes sense in the light of the Rodney King case and its aftermath, as well as the O.J. case. His criticism is focused on the leadership and structure of the LAPD, rather than on characterizing individual officers as inherently bad.

What is really impressive about the many editions of this book that have been published to date is that the author constantly updates the information in the book, so that it is as accurate as it can be given the odd and fluctuating state of celebrity mindsets (and fortunes).So if you are willing to assume that some of the information may become outdated, you will probably enjoy this book quite a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as described -- Couldn't be happier!","review":"I did not buy this through Amazon (HomeDepot was much cheaper) but the basket itself is great for bike helmets and other small items."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice basket - mounting bracket somewhat iffy","review":"The basket itself is nice.

In fact, I have found they are too warm to wear above 35 degrees F and make my hands sweat. The cut is generous bordering on a little saggy. Glove liners are highly recommended not only because they add even more warmth, but also because as on reviewer pointed out, the inner glove is not stitched into the shell, so if you're not careful taking off the gloves, moist hands will turn the gloves' liners inside-out. Overall, they do the job of keeping my hands warm with reasonable grip at a reasonable cost. Have not used these gloves in rainy weather, but they do not seem to be very water-resistant.

You don't really get an idea from the picture how big they are. Picture ski gloves and you'll have an idea how big they are.The sizing for these unisex gloves are fine. I'm female and usually wear a medium in men's. These gloves in medium fit me fine. Keep in mind that there are two layers to the glove. The inner layer, a fleece glove, is what fits me fine as a medium. The outer layer is bigger of course, to fit over the inner layer. You could wear the outer layer alone without the inner liner but you must expect it to be larger and fit loosely without the inner liner to fill it out.These gloves are definitely for winter weather in my experience. They are too warm for fall/40 degree and above weather and cause my hands to sweat after a few minutes of riding.The fused ring and pinky finger section addresses a big problem I get where my last two fingers freeze. I think that's a great feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so great","review":"completely worn out in the palm and fingers. used a little more than 1 season and the gloves are completely coming apart"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific","review":"These gloves single-handedly got me through winter biking this year. I love the design and the feel. And paired with the fleece liners, I had no problem biking with these in freezing temps for an hour or more. Below freezing, though, and my fingers started to really feel the cold after about a half an hour. As for the sizing, I'm a pretty average-hand-sized guy and the large was definitely the way to go. If I wanted to wear these without liners, a medium might have fit better, but I needed these to be big enough to fit over a liner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid gloves!","review":"I bike anywhere from 20 degrees and up generally for 30 mins at a time on my commute. These gloves are good for 20s and into the 30s. At 40 and up they are definitely too hot. I've never had these claw gloves before but they work great - not awkward and no problem controlling shifting and braking. I didn't give the glove 5 stars because my hands do start sweating after about 15+ minutes of riding. I kind of feel bad not giving the 5th star for buying gloves to keep warm and then complain that they are too hot. I've definitely pulled the insert out inadvertently but had no problem getting it back into the glove. (saw another review where that was outlined as an issue - it's not for me.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn how to take them off?","review":"I read the review about them being too warm for a lot of situations and also the review that the inner glove can get easily turned inside out.When I first put these on I thought they were like gloves I had before, i.e. the inner glove was partially sewn into the outer glove, so inseparable. Took my hand out and tried to put them back on. No way that was going to happen, the inner liner was completely inside out and totally resistant to being put back in its proper place!Then I realized the inner glove and the outer glove are two separate pieces. Problem solved. When pulling off the glove, first pull of the outer section. Then pull off the inner glove. No problemo, they are simply two separable pieces.The weather a bit too warm for both sections? Then just put on the outer glove. On a very cold day, put them both on.Problems solved and for the money, I am a happy camper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Winter!","review":"Yes as stated they do work well in the fall. but as for anything below 40F with wind. they just don't cut it. There's always wind here in germany when I ride in the winter which makes these gloves unusable until the weather warms a bit! I read the other reviews and thats why I bought these gloves. I was even sucked in by the pics lol! they are pretty though. Anyways look for somthing warmer if you can!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BikeSomeWhere Co. sells shady version of this Glove","review":"I love these PB Borealis gloves, actually. But I recently bought a pair from BikeSomeWhere Storefront on Amazon and the glove was made of a strange foamy material, not to Planet Bike standards. The material that covers the top of the hand has large pores, but the real Borealis glove has a tight-knit material. The palm of the hand is like spray-on foam, but the real Borealis glove has a leather/suede palm. My husband and I each got a pair from Amazon (sold by different companies), but the size large from the BikeSomeWhere Storefront is questionable. Don't buy these gloves from the BikeSomeWhere Storefront company."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should be giving these one star...","review":"But I agree with the other 2 star reviews. I've use these ONCE (once is enough, as they are at the peak of their condition, and they don't function correctly). I also bike to work, and its about a 4.5 mile bike each way. It was ~25 degrees out this morning, and i figured I'd go to these, my \\"winter\\" gloves from my thinner fall gloves.Halfway through my ride, my wrists and hands were getting sweaty, while my middle finger, index finger, and thumb were all halfway to numb. They are certainly not windproof, and judging by the look of the material (this is not confirmed, as it wasn't raining this morning) they wouldn't be very waterproof either (there is plenty of felt-y material on the gloves).Do not buy; they wouldn't be useful in any temperature condition, since at 25 degrees, the hands are too hot (which would remain the same for any temperature above this) and the fingers are too cold (which would be true for any temperature below this)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flexible, comfortable, and very warm.","review":"These gloves will keep my hands quite warm this winter in our moderate Puget Sound weather. They're very comfortable and allow easy, non-slip, secure hand and finger control.About the concerns with the lining turning inside out and being difficult to get back into place: I've found that by simply giving each glove finger tip a quick pinch and pull frees all fingers from the lining, and the lining stays put. It only takes a few seconds. I do that with all of my bike gloves - and I think I own two of every kind ever invented. Turning them inside out to remove them gets them off your hands quickly, but you're always stuck standing there a while getting the gloves back to normal. I even wiggle my fingerless gloves off that way now. It's easier in the long run, for me, anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good warm gloves, but the liner comes out","review":"They are very nice and comfortable, and kept my fingers in good shape all the way through the New England winter, but the inner lining comes out of the outer lining in the wash or if you remove them too quickly and it's very hard to get back in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gloves - very warm","review":"I recently purchased these gloves and am very satisfied. They do keep your hands warm on morning rides but I have yet to test them in the deep winter cold.

I also can't speak to thier durability but they do seem well constructed.I'll have to update this review following a full winter of bike rides"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Winter Glove...Great Price","review":"I could not ask for a better winter and cold weather bike glove. These are extremely comfortable, have the flexibility I want and wear very well. They are easy to get on and off. The grip is absolutely great. I would not advise wearing these in even mild warm weather though as your hands will sweat. The liners work quite well and if you have any difficulty with them, a stick works just fine putting them back into place. The price of these gloves is great...you are getting a lot of glove for relatively little money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great at the right temp","review":"I bought these for cold weather riding (commuting) in South Dakota. I found that wearing these gloves at temps over 40F isn't a good idea as they do NOT breath well so my hands would sweat and soak the gloves. This normally wouldn't be a big deal but since I needed the gloves the next day, I had to buy a glove dryer to get them dry fast enough to use. Just letting them sit on the counter would take 3-4 days to dry out (again, they don't breath at all). Between the temps of 20F-40F however, they are the perfect glove. Hands might be a little chilly to start the ride but by the time my blood is flowing from the ride, they worked great. Either way, I still use the glove dryer to keep them moisture-free (yes, I have a glove dryer at work and at home). If you plan to ride regularly at temps below 20F, I'd keep looking...they aren't warm enough for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly excellent","review":"I agree with the majority of the reviewers who have praised these gloves. They keep your hands very warm and i haven't experienced any grip problems. I bought the large which are actually slightly too big for my hands and this has cause some dexterity issues but I doubt medium would have been large enough. The only real drawback has already been pointed out by others, which is the lining is not attached and so it can want to come out of the glove along with your hand. If you are careful and take it off finger by finger this isn't a problem but it's still an annoyance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Waterproof","review":"Pros+ Good fit+ Good exterior grip+ Good interior comfot+ Four finger design is a good balance of warmth and controlCons- Lack of water proofing pretty much defeats the purpose of warm all-weather biking gloveIf by some chance, you're in a place that's cold but never wet, these might be a good option. If you're exposed to snow or rain, these gloves appear useless. I returned them and exchanged for the slightly less versatile but waterproofSugoi Firewall Z Glove."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm Gloves!","review":"These gloves are comfortable, fit well, and are extremely warm! Great fit especially around the wrists for keeping in the warmth. The only reason I gave these gloves 4 stars was because my hands sweat a lot in them (I've worn them down to about 35 degrees and they've sweat every time), and it takes hours for the sweat to dry out of them. I don't even know if it's possible to have a warm glove that doesn't make you sweat badly or for them to dry out quicker but for me that is what would give them 5 stars.Overall I'm extremely happy with the gloves and they do the most important thing which is keeping my hands warm when it's cold. I will probably be wearing these down to about 20 degrees Fahrenheit and don't ever see my hands getting cold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for Chicago Winter","review":"I use these to bike Chicago everyday.

I have always used my regular winter gloves for bicycling, until now.I've only tried these a few times, but they are great. It was 32 degrees yesterday and my hands were warm and toasty. The velcro \\"hook and loop closure\\" allows you to adjust the fit around your wrist to keep air out. The five-fingered fleece liner is removable and allows for quick drying after the ride. (This was always a problem with my regular winter gloves. Even the next day, they would be damp on the inside.)Planet Bike also promotes the \\"grippy material\\" on the palm of the glove, but I have to admit that may be more hype than genuine benefit.As to size, I bought the XL.

I live on the California coast near Santa Barbara and my commutes are usually 6 miles or less on fairly flat roads. Temperatures on the coldest days are in high 30\\"s to low 40's. The gloves are plenty warm for those distances and temps and that terrain. If there were steeper terrain, or warmer temp. or longer distances, I think the gloves might be too warm, causing sweaty hands. In that case, I would remove the inner liner and replace it with a thin cotton glove, as recommended in other reviews. The hassle is a small price to pay for essentially having gloves that cover a huge range of temps. The buttons for my Blackburn Flea head and tail light are somewhat difficult to operate with the gloves. No big deal there. I also like the way Planet Bike operates their business.

The book's over 300 pages long and very little of note happens until the last 50 or so pages; there are so many characters and storylines that I ended up not caring much about any of them. And the amount of filler is staggering; the author spends several sides explaining the airline policy on stewardesses who are made pregnant by pilots. Of course, the research Hailey has done can't be faulted, and it certainly gives an insight into the running of an airport, but honestly after 200-odd pages of adultery, marital discord, delays, airline stowaways, 'feisty' employees who remove all the capital letters from their typewriters and flippant stewardesses planning seductions in Naples, I really couldn't care less what happened in the end. Don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"CAUTION: Don't opperate a plane while reading!","review":"This book is SCARY! Every fear you have about flying becomes a reality.

The plot revolves around a beleaguered airport manager juggling a failing marriage and a crisis on location, his arrogant and philandering pilot brother in law, an out of work man teetering over into desperation and how their paths cross on one dangerous night.

There was no solution at Line6, but I eventually ran across a fix. Unsurprisingly, Vista is to blame, specifically the power profiles on Vista. The fault lay in the processor power-state transitions. This works ok on Vista on a laptop if you select the \\"Always On\\" power state.

If you have trouble walking the straight and narrow during the day, at least you can be straight at night; for this really does keep the neck and spine properly alligned. Mine wore out after years of enjoyment, so I ordered this one. Don't get this brand. It is from China, meaning that it is the cheapest product imaginable to mankind.

My only glitch was with the fettucini (wider noodle cutter). I can't figure out what the problem was, but when I put the dough through the cutter, it would clump up inside and not cut clean strips. I hope with some trial and error, I'll get it right. Not sure if it is the thickness of the dough, or the recipe that wasn't quite right. HOWEVER, the roller and the smaller noodle cutter were both EXCELLENT! I absolutely love the ease with which you can make your own homemade pasta...can't wait to try out many different recipes! P.S.

I am shocked as this was around $150 dollars and had good reviews (one can buy a lot of pasta for this price).

So I inform the company Simple Beautiful, via amazon, to see if we could get that roller replaced. Unfortunately, the 90 return period had ended.While I fault myself for not ensuring brand new equipment works right out of the box \\"immediately\\", I am dissappointed that this company would not replace the pasta roller. It's not like we didn't want to keep the set, we do. It's just that I now have to spend $70 to get a new individual pasta roller.

Did a little Amazon surfing, came across these attachments, saw that people liked it, thought I'd give it a try: I successfully made pasta the same day the attachments were delivered.

I had never made pasta before and even the first batch came out perfect. I use semolina flour and used the recipe on the package. I really like having both hands free and not having to crank. I can't imagine trying to handle the dough and having to crank at the same time. This set of a roller and two cutter is very versatile. I can make lasagna noodles and fettucini from thick to thin and spaghetti (regular all the way down to really small). Great product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not good at all.... from an Italian","review":"I purchased my KA mixer a few weeks ago and I just got now this attachment. I was really looking forward to get it, I'm Italian, living outside my Country, and I always made home made pasta by hand. Well, the mixer worked fine, the flat pasta came out allright after trying a few times, byt spaghetti and fettuccine were a total mess. The spaces are too close and the spaghetti will come out attached one to each other. They are drying right now, but they look more like lasagna than spaghetti.... And I tried to use more and more flour, let it dry first... nothing worked. A real waste of money, I'll take out my old manual machine, way better.Don't waste any money on this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic gears are worthless","review":"We bought this unit for Christmas, and used it for the first time today, On the first use, the plastic gears crumbled.Very dissapointed.

It was very diffiult to feed the pasta into the roller and the pasta recipe included was too dry. I returned this to Filenes and with the same money, I bought the Ron Popeil pasta maker, which is very easy to uses and requires almost no work on your part. Don't buy this, buy the other Ron pasta maker. With Ron Popeil, you can just through in the ingredients and pasta comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst thought-out attachments ever.","review":"I bought this as a replacement for my $30.00 Atlas pasta roller, thinking that it would make pasta making that much more fun. Huge mistake.First off, there were quality problems. After exactly one year of use, mine broke due to low-quality steel used in one of the attachments. So I'm out $100, and I'll get over it.The bigger problem is that you have to continually change out the attachments to make pasta. First, you attach the roller, and get the dough down to the proper thickness. Then you must remove the attachment, and replace it with a cutter or crimper to form the dough into its final form. Attaching, then detaching, gets very old, very fast. I felt a certain glee when I threw these pieces of junk into the dumpster. I'll look forward to my old Atlas next time I feel the need to roll pasta dough.Worst thing Kitchenaid has ever made!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A defective product. Stay away from it. Sue it if you know laws.","review":"The pasta roller stopped working only after a couple of uses. When opened it, I was extremely surprised to find out that it is using a plastic part to carry over the torque generated from the mixer. How can't you use a plastic part for do such a crucial job?!! It is a design problem from the beginning. It is NOT a random quality problem!!If I am lawyer or are familar with law, I would definitely sue this company. This crappy design is all by intention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor packaging in shipment damaged product","review":"I just received this product to give as a Christmas gift. So, I am really rating the packaging and not the product. Equipment this heavy cannot be put in a cardboard box of the same size as the KitchenAid box.

That one is very limited (it's the food grinder/stuffer/pasta maker); it can only make pasta of one thickness, which is too thick for my taste. This roller attachment is great. It is built like a tank, in typical KitchenAid fashion; it's very substantial. It's also easy to clean. I've used the roller & the fettucini cutter and they both work well. I have no complaints whatsoever. Amazon also seems to have the best price on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"What fun!","review":"My pasta roller & cutters arrived a few days ago and I have already made 2 batches of noodles. The first batch was fettuccine that I served with a cheesy alfredo sauce. Everyone loved it! I really enjoyed the process of making the pasta, too. I used the 1st recipe in the book and it was good.

Eventhough I am female, I didn't read the instructions and I have fettucini drying as I write. I can't wait to taste it. It was so simple and fast. The 3 attachments are truly heavy duty.I was looking for a crank type pasta maker when I stumbled accross this \\"attachment\\" option. I already own the big, expensive Kitchenaid mixer.

First batch of pasta may contain copper!","review":"I attended a cooking demonstration featuring the KitchenAid Pasta Roller attachment. It looked fun and really easy so I bought it. Unfortunately, my delight in this product was thwarted by the \\"dirt\\" that seamed to be leaching from the rollers. I tried cleaning the rollers with the supplied brush and then I ran a clean dry cloth along (not through!) the rollers and found that the \\"dirt\\" was actually metal! I removed the roller from the mixer and found that a copper piece attached to the underside of the roller which scrapes the roller and keeps the dough from entering the housing of the unit was flaking off in little slivers. I don't know if this problem would have corrected itself, but for the amount of \\"dough\\" this thing cost, I wasn't going to wait and find out.As for the operation of the roller attachment. It was fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Product has some issues","review":"I am a big kitchenaid fan. I have had this pasta maker for approx. 2 years and it is great. However, today the metal shaft that turns the rollers sheared, making the item useless. If the item was cheap (it is not) or make of plastic, I might not be so upset. But the shaft is solid metal and should not have sheared. It is my belief, that making pasta should not cause a solid metal shaft to shear. Mfg said item is out of warranty so they will not replace. Now I must decide to buy new one ($89+)or roll pasta by hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money, internal plastic components","review":"I've had my set of rollers for about two years, used them less than a dozen times, was always very careful with them, and followed the manual's usage instructions perfectly. Today, as I was rolling dough through the roller on the highest setting, I heard something snap. The mixer was still going but the rollers had stopped. I disassembled it to find that the internal axel was made of plastic and had broken cleanly into two parts. This is the piece that is in between the square head that goes into the mixer and the rollers. Without it, the entire set is useless. I am never buying another KitchenAid product again. My 4 1/2 quart 325 Watt KitchenAid mixer got more use but in the end, it broke too and I gave up on it after sending it out for repair once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasagna Yes, Fettuccine No, Spaghetti No","review":"Rolls out beautiful lasagna dough if you follow the receipt.The instruction manual is wrong when it says you can cut pasta dough at the #4 or #5 thicknesses.The fettuccine and spaghetti strands stick together as it comes out of the cutter. I called KitchenAid and the customer service person said you had to roll Spaghetti to #5 or #6 and Fettuccine to #7 or #8. These settings are too thin for my taste. KitchenAid offered to sell me a new one at a discount. I declined."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works","review":"I wish it were maybe a little bit wider, to make a wider batch, but it does a great job anyways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I have had this now for over a year and LOVE it! Prior to buying this I had never made pasta before and was actually nervous the first time. No need to be with this attachment. The instructions were easy to follow and I was making fettuccine in no time.I really would recommend this item to anyone who loves pasta. There is nothing better than homemade, fresh pasta especially since it is so easy.I did see some say that it was hard to clean but I haven't had any problems with that. They do give you a stiff brush that helps sweep away any debris once it has dried on there. Maybe they should add a bit more flour before putting it through the attachments otherwise I could see how the attachments might get yucky. I usually dust the dough right before putting it through."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT","review":"If you love being in the kitchen, love cooking, and love your KitchenAid, these rollers you will also love. It was fun making my own pasta and it tasted sooo much better than store bought. You can't screw it up, either. Easy to use, easy to clean, a no-brainer. Sure, you can buy a bag of pasta for a buck, but spending the money on these is worth it if you love cooking and doing this stuff and also appreciate home made foods with no ingredients you cannot pronounce!"},{"rating":"2","title":"High quality, great results every time","review":"Prior to these my only experience was with hand crank pasta rollers many years ago. I too considered the plastic extrusion style pasta makers but feared they would clog up like a Playdough press. Whether that is true or not, after multiple uses of these rollers I have nothing but good things to say. The roller and cutters have worked perfectly for me every single time, and even just holding them in your hand the build quality is immediately apparent. I can recommend these without hesitation."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Repairs Available!","review":"I loved using the pasta roller and the cutters, but slightly over a year later I noticed that the linguine cutter had slipped a spring on the bottom, which allowed the scraping plate to come loose. I contacted KitchenAid and was told basically, \\"Sorry, nothing we can do\\". They said the cutters are not repairable, and are not sold individually. Their only suggestion was to purchase a new complete set of cutters from them! At the price they charge, I highly doubt that I will be doing that!Buy the set if you want to, but be aware that KitchenAid won't help you if they are out of warrantee and something breaks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fatal flaw","review":"We have had this unit for over a year, and it is still shedding metal particles into our pasta. We keep hoping that they will go away soon, if we keep using it. No luck yet. Continue to cut out big metal shavings from our finished noodles. If we didn't have this issue, it would be a 5-star unit. Otherwise sturdy and mechanically sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's like having a third hand!","review":"I have had these now for a while and honestly, I don't know why I didn't buy them sooner. Making fresh pasta is wonderful, but can be a messy, time consuming experience. I also have a hand crank Atlas machine that I've used for years and it does a great job as well. The difference that having the rollers for the Kitchenaid is that it gives you a free hand. It really works well when you have one hand for feeding into the rollers/cutters and another for catching what comes out the other side. It is suspended higher than the hand crank model that is mere inches off the counter or table. And this isn't for just rolling pasta, it also works for home made crackers! No one would be disappointed purchasing these. They are well built, and with proper care, will provide generations of use, just like the Kitchenaid. I have no regrets on this purchase, other than wishing I had done it years ago!"},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it!","review":"Never made pasta before, saw this attachment and thought it would be fun. It was easy, I followed the receipt in the booklet using the mixer to make the pasta and then the pasta rollers. It was so easy and the pasta was wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes life a LOT easier!","review":"I bought this for a gift for someone because I love mine so much! The pasta attachments are so much easier to use than a hand-crank machine since they allow you to have a free hand to guide the pasta as it comes through the machine. They're also easier to clean and store. Bravo KitchenAid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I bought this set of three, but I only used the smooth pasta roller. Unfortunately, dough would get caught and was hard to clean out. Then, it stopped working. It was like the motor would go, but the roller wouldn't turn. I was thankful for Amazon's return policy. I know others who love theirs and it works wonderfully, this just wasn't my experience with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"plastic parts shear off and fail","review":"The pasta roller works fine for a while but ours stopped rollingwith a \\"snap\\".

The plastic on the bottom of the rollers interferred with the pasta rolling process. It started out good, and not too far into the process the dough starting getting caught in the one end of the plastic and would not go through the other side and we had to use the manual pasta machine instead. I had to return the item. I do not understand why the plastic is on the bottom of the rollers, you do not see this on the manual machine, and the plastic is not on the other pasta rollers in the set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Qualtiy Control by the vendor","review":"The original box it came in was ripped and damaged and the interior packaging was not there (plastic wrapping) - Obvious the item was returned by someone else and then repackaged and sent to me.

Getting these for our anniversary was the best purchase. It has saved us about an hour when we make fresh pasta.

This product either doesn't age well or needs periodic lube job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its so easy","review":"I'm a novice cook, 2 months new. Eating healthy and economically is important to me therefore it can't get any better than making it from scratch. I thought making my own pasta was going to be a real challenge especially after I failed the 1st time, but that's only because I left the dough out too long and it wouldn't roll without falling apart. However, once I got the recipe right, letting it rest for the right amount of time is key, watched a few Kitchenaid pasta rolling videos which are abundant I was able to make pasta. With the pasta roller it made the task so easy and totally entertaining. It was worth every penny spent to make some quality semolina fettuccini. This household will never see boxed pasta again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy duty marvel","review":"I purchased this as a gift for my daughter-in-law. She loves it! The pieces are much larger and sturdier than I expected them to be, so they handle more dough each time. For 3 pieces, I thought the price was pretty good too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the right tools make your job easier","review":"As a professional chef the KitchenAid Pasta Roller makes my job easier. I had been using a hand crank roller for the past 10 years or so and as much as I had grown to love the process of the hand crank, with the KitchenAid Pasta Roller I am able to roll out pasta faster, which affords me more time to prep and plan other things in the kitchen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pasta is easy with this attachment","review":"My mom gave me her hand cranked pasta roller and it was great but you need 3 or 4 hands to use it comfortably. Then my brother asked my mom for the pasta roller and I thought that was a great excuse to return the hand cranked one and get the KitchenAid fettucinne/spaghetti roller. Wow! It works great and you only need two hands. If you want to make your own pasta, I would highly recommend this assortment! It is easy to use and easy to clean and makes great noodles. What more could you ask for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tool!","review":"Makes great pasta! I thought it would be hard to clean since it cannot be immersed in water, but once the dough on the rollers dries, the brush it comes with helps clean it up just fine! Would love an attachment like this one that also makes short pasta."},{"rating":"2","title":"On time","review":"I order this item late as a Christmas present think I would have to put a picture in a box under the tree. I was delivered a day early. Good experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Really Bad Idea: Can't Clean, Poor Design","review":"I was very disappointed in these attachments. As noted elsewhere, I had metal in my initial batches of pasta. The pasta did not roll properly and I ended up with mush. Finally, there is no way ro really clean it, as you can't use water. I gave up on this and purchased a stand-alone pasta maker, which works much better and is easier to clean. These attachments were a complete waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product.","review":"I look for excused to make pasta now. It's easy to use, quick, and fun. Actually, it's as fast as making boxed noodles/spaghetti."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wider would be better! Four hands better than two!","review":"I used the roller for the first time today to make 2.5 inch ravioli. The instructions were clear, the dough rolled perfectly, but the width barely could accommodate my press. The dough had to be pulled and prodded a bit. Fortunately, the dough allowed some extra handling. An inch or two more width would have been most welcome. It also was a help that two of us were making the ravioli - one to feed the dough into the roller, one to hold the dough as it came out of the roller. Following the rolling suggestions - beginning at the number one setting and progressing to five was exactly right. Flouring the dough lightly, as suggested, made rolling very easy. I had no trouble with clean-up at all; no dough stuck, flour could just be brushed with the tool provided. All in all, I'm pleased with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amore","review":"Gave this along with drying rack and pasta recipe book as a gift.

It apparently ruined the motor. The mixer is being repaired and I'm waiting for a refund from the seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pasta Cutters Suck","review":"I have been using the pasta making attachment for several months now and am completely disappointed. The roller works great and I use it for making ravioli and lasagna noodles. But the fettucini and spaghetti rollers/cutter are horrible. They score the pasta NOT cut it into individual pieces!!!! So that after it goes through the machine I have to separate each strand by hand which is insane. I just made enough dough for 11 people who are coming for a dinner party tonight. I have given up on the separation of EACH STRAND of spaghetti (which stretches the strand and makes for inconsistent sizes) and am going to the supermarket to get some dried pasta. I am not a happy girl, what a waste of time. I am going to try and return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only pasta attachment you should buy.","review":"These stainless steel rollers work beautifully, and with a little (very little) practice you can roll out pasta for any shape. The two cuting attachments also work well, but do limit you to two sizes. This should not deter you to buy, many pastas are easily shaped by hand, the real work is in the rolling.It is worth noting that most of the problems people experience in making pasta have to do with achieving a proper dough, not too sticky, not too dry. These tools do the job they were designed for very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pasta roller attachment","review":"I purchased this attachment yesterday and used it tonight for the first time. The device is great with a couple of small hitches:The area through which the pasta is pressed is narrowIf you encounter an air pocket the flat pasta press will shred the pastaThese are minor areas of concern both of which can be overcome by closely monitoring the dough and the attachment."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"It arrived on time and as described.

I have used these a couple of times now and have had ZERO issues. Haven't had and metal being rolled into my pasta and they make the pasta look picture perfect. I think some of the bad reviews are from people that aren't familiar with making pasta, also aren't familiar with using rollers and cutters. I used to be a chef and would love to of had these in my kitchens to make things go faster since I used to make pasta all by hand. All in all these are perfect for a home setting and will continue to use these for years to come hoping they last for as long as my other kitchenaid products have. Very happy with these!!! Very well made, and well worth the money.Only con I can think of is, I wish they were a little wider (like 9\\") to fit more pasta to cut, but that isn't a big deal at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pasta Attachment for Kitchen Aide Mixer","review":"The Fettucccine attachment works fine, the roller works fine, however the spaghetti attachment DOES NOT CUT THE SPAGHETTI."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its firmware corrupted quickly","review":"It got corrupted for a few days when I used it with windows vista as a ready boost which totally useless technology . . .

Once I started reading it, I was compelled to continue because of how shockingly ethnocentric and subjective this supposed History book was written. The ebook is worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprised I didn't like it...boring read","review":"I am shocked I didn't find this book interesting. I tried and tried, but I lost interest almost immediately. The reviews are great on this, but I couldn't seem to find what they saw that I missed.The story dragged to the point of yawning. Too much details on how to make beans and bacon on an open fire and too much conversation about nothing between secondary characters made me cringe and want to flip to the end to find out what happened to Eirica.I liked the promise in the storyline, but felt like the author wasn't concentrating enough on the main character of an abused and broken woman who was trying to start her life over with 3 kids and one on the way. The male lead of James Jones was too tame and boring for me and found him non-essential to the story.I really wish I could've enjoyed the book since everyone else did, but I am sorry to say I found it terribly lacking but will try this author again to see if maybe I missed something this time.Tracy Talley~@"},{"rating":"2","title":"NASCAR For Dummies takes the checkered","review":"I was doing research for a NASCAR Web site that I was creatingwhen I came across this title.

This is the only attachment that required assembly, which isn't a bad thing in and of itself, but once it was assembled it had a decidedly flimsy nature about it.

It's also fairly compact and lightweight so if u DO need to carry it around, you won't have to pack/insulate it in the original packaging box (my friend has to do this with his Bose system b/c of its shape).As others have observed, the sound quality is fairly rich and full at low to medium volumes (great for a bedroom). However, as you increase the volume higher and higher, the bass gets a little distorted and it starts to sound a bit hollow (not great for a living room).

The highest speed is laughable..you could probably stick your hand in the bowl in the middle of mixing and *maybe* get pinched. If you even think about using the bread hook you'll blow the motor...it can't handle it.Like another review said, it goes to show that a higher price tag does not mean higher quality.

My last mixer's cord is twisted up like a telephone handset cord, and I'm always knocking ingredient containers over because it gets in the way.Mainly, though, I wanted to offer this observation: this mixer is very quiet compared to other mixers.

It has a stir setting that really is a stirring speed and it doesn't get bogged down (even when stirring together butter and sugar before actually creaming them). The high speed will go through anything (even though I had forgotten to soften the butter before creaming it). It's also very, very quiet.

Take a small piece (less than 1 inch square) of kitchen plastic wrap and place it over the beater end that goes into the mixer. Smooth it around the beater shaft and insert into the mixer. It will--and should--be snug. Twist it back and forth and push until it goes in all the way. Insert the other beater.

That made me decide to give my current KitchenAid Ultra Power hand mixer the heave-ho. It is SO wimpy, and there is very little difference between the 5 speed settings. I think mine has lasted so long because not much is required of the motor. Certainly, it can handle cake batter just fine, but that's not all I demand from a mixer. I like knowing a mixer has extra power even if I don't need to use it very often.

It did do a good job on potatoes, shredding them nicely. You also need two pairs of pliers to take the drum off the shaft when you're done. And, a plastic spatula from my Braun food processor was great to scrape the potato remains from the drum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adds a lot to your basic Kitchenaid","review":"I have one of those big Kitchenaid mixers (mainly for making bread. One of us needs non-wheat bread and the other won't eat American-style bread. Nothing to do but bake our own.)Well, I decided to put that big mixer to work overtime doing sausage (we got spoiled in Europe on homemade, unadulterated Italian sausage made by the neighborhood grocer.) And we like salad and slaw. This gadget goes together easily. You pop the unit onto the front connector on the mixer and feed the vegetables or meat into the hopper. You can shred, slice and grate.The only thing this set doesn't do is fine chopping, but you know, you could probably add a tiny mini-processor and still have your counter relatively uncluttered."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say","review":"It's Kitchenaid, it speaks foe itself.

It has little to do with the Sex Lives of Popes.Half of the popes' sex lives dealt with are ones who were legitimately married and he has basically nothing to say about popes after 1800, except for on page 264:\\"John Paul II ... was rumoured [sic] that he was married and widowed.\\" Really?Cawthorne has a field day with Alexander VI, the most infamous pope of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly researched and poorly written","review":"Meh.

Dennis Embo's spiritual odyssey from Catholicism to Armstrongism to a deeper Catholicism parallels my own journey from liberal Protestantism to the Worldwide Church of God to evangelical Protestantism. From his quest for spiritual truth to his search for his birth mother, Embo weaves the threads of his life story into a fascinating allegory of God's sovereignty and faithfulness.Embo's story not only provides a glimpse into changes in American and Catholic culture during the past 50 years but also illustrates how God can lead us in ways we never would have imagined to draw us closer to Him. In my case, the book came into my life at a fortuitous (divinely appointed?) time when I needed to be reminded that despite our differences, Catholics and Protestants worship the same God and serve the same Jesus.

It was great, but this product took a good idea and ran with it. For anyone who owns a KitchenAid Stand Mixer, this was well-worth the money. It grinds raw tomatoes to a thick sauce, disgarding the seeds and skins to a separate discharge funnel. Place two bowls under both the tomato sauce end and the skins/ seeds ends, turn on a switch and you're in business.

I ended up using the pumpkin screen - I had also ordered the set of different size screens - as I had a significant amount of pulp leaking around the narrow end of the output area (apologies for my terminology) with the screen that comes with the machine. Still worked just great, and leakage stopped. I did reprocess the outflow and got a little more pulp - the reprocessed waste was completely dry. I processed 8 flats of peaches and 4 of apricots in an hour, including screen changes, and this was my first time using the machine. I was absolutely delighted.

It doesn't provide a desktop scheduler to sync with like PALM and Visor units. Bottom Line, to sync up with a desktop PC you must have microsoft outlook.

I tried to bend it back, but it only got worse, hitting and then breaking the other beater. There is only a one-year warranty on this appliance, so I need to buy new beaters (at least $15 at minimum) or see if a family friend can weld them back together.

I bought this mixer, and the only reason I considered spending this much for a hand mixer is because of the name. My mixer was ok, while not good enough to justify the high price. I thought I could at least count on it lasting. I was wrong. Two weeks after the one year warranty was up, one of the beaters broke while making mashed potatoes. Before realizing it was past the warranty date, I called Kitchen Aid and was told that Amazon is \\"like E-Bay,\\" selling used items. I assured them that I paid for a new product!So now I learned. Just buy the cheaper mixers, and realize \\"throw away\\" culture makes it too costly to try to alter this reality! It got worse... i was told that the warranty I had was expired, and months after this whole incident, they actually had the NERVE to send me something to tell me the warranty was about to expire, and I shouldn't take a chance, should pay them more to extend the warranty they refused to acknowledge!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good hand mixer","review":"I purchased this when my 11 year old Cuisinart hand mixer unexpectedly died on me in the middle of making a cake. I was attracted to this one because of the 9 speeds and because the other reviews were favorable (plus, Amazon offered a good price). I did not like my old one (was given to me as a wedding shower gift, so I did not pick it out) because the slowest speed was still quite fast and often caused liquids to splash out of the bowl. This mixer doesn't seem to have that problem and I really like that aspect of it. However, on the flip side, the highest speed doesn't seem to be as fast as my old one. Maybe I just need to adjust to it, but I was a little disappointed that it didn't seem to go as fast as I thought it should. There seems to be little incremental difference between each speed. Overall, I am happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hand Mixer","review":"I already have this product myself so there were no surprises when I decided to buy it for a gift.

But Kitcehn Aid proved me wrong. This expensive mixer's Beater blade broke off from the four welded places on the shaft while mixing ingadients for a pie. We have used this mixer infrequently for light duty mixing work. I called Kitchen Aid but they refused to send a replacement blade becasue the mixer is now just outside the warranty.

Same for crepes (NO, crepes are not supposed to have lumps). I ended up giving it away and buying a cheaper mixer that works great. Also, I'm not impressed with my $400.00 stand mixer either. It has the bowl lift feature (like the Pros-ha-ha)which actually shakes when you turn it on. Even Alton Brown mentioned that. Also, the bowl lift makes it difficult to add ingredients.

Not sure if weld broke or metal snapped but beaters should last at least a decade. Never had beaters break on a GE or Sunbeam or other value brand. Kitchenaid wants more for shipping new beaters than it would cost to buy new of other brand. I swear I still have indestructable beaters laying around kitchen since the 1970s!

I works fine, lots of power and reliable, good for most applications. BUT the wire blades do not do mashed potatoes properly. Doing mashed potatoes with a mixer needs some amount of cutting action to tear up the potatoes. The smooth round stainless wire blades do not break down the potatoes at all. I've tried dozens of times, adding liquid, a dryer mix, more cooking time etc. Always a lumpy mess of mashed potatoes. OTOH our previous cheap mixer and cheap sheet metal blades the potatoes whip up quickly, and the lumps are broken down fast. Its kind of obvious that the engineer designing this unit never tried to use it. I'd like to see an additional set of alternate mashing blades then it would be a 5 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the 20 in many ways","review":"Aficionados of O'Brian's seafaring novels from the Napoleonic Wars all have their favorites. Of the 20 Aubrey/Maturin novels, this one may be the best in many ways. Captain Aubrey's career seems on the fast track (maybe fast tack, given the theme)in this episode in which he takes the rank of Commodore and sails a small fleet to wrest Mauritius from the \\"foul and most foreign French.\\"His companion, Dr. Stephen Maturin comes into his own in this episode, showing his full talents as an intelligence agent and giving an idea of the resources at his command. There are setbacks, of course but the combimnations of land and sea warfare are engaging.

This is the first hardcover of them that I have purchased: I intended to start my own collection rather than check them out from the library.I use the past tense because, instead of being a quality hardcover, the Norton hardcover edition that I purchased is of poorer print quality than an average paperback. The words are fuzzy and indistinct: it looks as though it were printed at draft quality on a circa 1995 printer. The poor contrast provided by the subpar paper further hinders readability.I'm afraid that I must recommend PO'B fans to search elsewhere--perhaps a used bookstore--to obtain this excellent series.

His wife, Sophie, lost her dowry and story begins with Jack hurting for money. So the opportunity to have command and be back on full pay is most welcome. Commodore Aubrey's command is complicated by the personalities of his subordinate commanders.

I fixed it as best as I could but about an inch all around one side on the trim is a light blue from the dye.

I think something with a greater proportion of soft fruit/vegetable matter to seed (like cooked apples or tomatoes) might work ok. But it just bogged down and clogged up, creating a huge mess. The hole at the end of the strainer (where the rejected material comes out) is just too small. I went back to doing it manually with my colander before it was over.To reinforce what everyone else has said, it is also annoying that the tray is so small, and basically requires you buy the extender tray to use it. Once purchased, the extender tray isn't a sealed fit, leaks, and adds to the messiness factor. The grinder has only 2 cutter sizes. I expected the larger cutter to allow a coarser grind.

If Bob wanted to make an electronica album, first of all, he's about 5 years too late. Secondly, he's the wrong guy to do it. His voice does not merge well with the electronic beeps and blips - and speaking of his voice, what is with this Cher-like voice modulation on the first track? I cringed when I heard that. Some artists simply should not try \\"genre-busting\\".There are a handful of artists out there that if I hear they have a new album out, I scoop it up immediately, because I know it is going to be good. Well, Bob just moved to the \\"preview\\" list.

I quit buying records, because everything disappointed - compared to Bob. Then I saw Bob had a new CD, available for previewing (if you trust those headphones). It's Bob, why bother previewing. Just buy it. But the opposite thing happened. I was annoyed. I wanted the songs to end. I'd skip to the next, hoping the intro was a teaser, and the real song was coming. But it never came.

Weirdness and random noises just for the sakeof \\"look what noise I can make\\" doesn't work for me; ithas to actually contribute something to the song. Instead,I find myself thinking Bob Mould:Modulate::Michael Stipe:Reveal(do they still use that notation on SATs?).

It seems like Bob thought that recording an electronic album would be a great concept, but he neither has the credentials or know-how to do it well.It has none of the energy of Husker Du or Sugar, and there is a distinct lack of musical themes or ideas.

This album is pretty dissapointing.","review":"I have been listening to Bob for many years, and although I am a true Husker fan, I love almost all of the post husker du material. The idea of evolving as a musician is very acceptable and respectable in most cases. I don't quite understand the idea behind this effort. \\"180rain\\", the first track on the record, is extremely weak. \\"semper fi\\"???? what kind of title is that? At least he decided to put \\"trade\\" on this record, which dates back to late 80's husker du. I am really excited to see (a very thin) Bob on tour this april.

Unfortunately for us, Modulate is no Workbook. I was thrilled to hear that he is continuing to record; that was not a foregone conclusion in the late 1990's. However, Modulate is not a pleasing listen. It sounds like a rocker was playing with a computer to create new noises. Not a very cohesive album, there also is not much redeeming quality here for a Bob Mould fan to enjoy. I am pleased that Bob is continuing to record music, and ecstatic that he is exploring new styles and sounds, but I sure hope it gets better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mould fans beware: this is not the album you wanted","review":"If you thought that Bob Mould's self-named album had some good threads for songs but was weakened by the drum machines, poor arrangement and just a little bit too much self indulgence, then you need to take pains to never hear the music on this album. In all fairness, I suppose that it is possible that people new to Mould would like this album, but I've started listening to Husker Du back in the early 1980s, and was a big fan of his first, second and fourth solo albums.

There are only 2-3 decent songs on the album and one of them was written during the Workbook/Black Sheets time period. He just doesn't come across like he's passionate about making music anymore. And in my opinion this album is just the latest in a string of less and less inspired work. Beaster was his last really good album - but you can even see the decay in the quality of his lyrics between Black Sheets and Copper Blue. Oh well, maybe you've got to hit some lows before you can hit the highs again. Overall he's still my favorite songwriter of all time hands down - and his recent stuff is still listenable to if mediocre especially by Bob's standards. And I'm sure I'll always buy his latest album in the hope that one day he hits his stride again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new direction, but a great record","review":"It's been 4 years since Bob Mould released a record, and a lot has happened in that time. Modulate is definitely a new direction he's taking, and it may come as a surprise to a lot of fans. He's experimenting with electronic loops and tracking, but still present is the loud guitar sound which he pioneered in the 1980's with Husker Du and in the 1990's with Sugar. The best results are the straightforward \\"Sound on Sound\\", the melancholy buzz of \\"Lost Zoloft\\" and the sweetness of \\"Trade\\". He expands on the direction he took with the song \\"Egoverride\\" from 1996 but adds a different dimension. Repeated listenings to this CD will reward even the die-hard fans. I've had this CD for a while and can say that it has grown a LOT on me. Beware of the people that are quick to judge Bob's new direction. A quick listen to \\"Sound on Sound\\" and \\"Slay/Sway\\" at high volume should convince even the most skeptical. The coming tour should also NOT be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"COMPLETE PIECE OF CRAP - DO NOT BUY","review":"The whole idea of using the auger in the grinder to push meat into sausage casings is flawed - not only does the auger get warm and melt the fat, but you are almost RE-grinding the meat by using this. As a consequence, I made five pounds of breakfast sausage this morning and ended up with the casings stuffed with PASTE, not ground meat. In other words, I wanted breakfast SAUSAGE and ended up with something more like a breakfast HOT DOG. Blecch,Also, the hopper on the grinder only holds a small amount, so you're trying to guide the stuffed casing with one hand, push the meat into the auger (no, it doesn't gravity feed) with the other hand and keep adding meat to the hopper with the other hand - yes, that's THREE hands....and don't even get me started on the \\"pusher\\" for the grinder.Yes, a \\"real\\" stuffer is expensive, but the savings in frustration is well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ineffective","review":"A sausage stuffer should provide maximum pressure to force meat down a narrow tube without incorporating air. This does not do that. Like others have pointed out, there is no seal for the plunger, which means it is difficult to force the meat into the \\"grinder\\" attachment. Once there, the spinning worm gear does not provide enough force on its own; only forcing more meat upon it with the plunger will help it to extrude properly. Even then, more air is incorporated. And, of course, it is far too high off the counter surface for sausage stuffing.While the idea of using a hand-crank stuffer when you have all the power of a Kitchen-Aid right there may seem unappealing, a cheap hand-crank stuffer will be far more effective than this. I urge you to go that route. You might think the low price on this piece may make any suffering worthwhile, but I urge you to reconsider."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works fine if you read the instructions!","review":"I bought this attachment with the intention of making boudain blanc, one of my husband's family favorites.

Together, they worked just fine.The instructions are very clear about putting shortening on the outside of the stuffer tube. I liberally used Crisco when I put the attachment on the mixer and was able to stuff 10 casings, each about 4 feet long, without needing to reapply it. The 'trick' was holding the loose end of the casing with one hand and centering it while squinching (for lack of a better description) it on the tube, sometimes with a little twisting motion.When it came to actually making the sausage it's important to note that this was definitely not a one-person operation. I operated the stuffer and grinder while my husband guided the stuffed casing to the counter, twisting into links as needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth the $10","review":"I agree with the folks who gave this a one star(because there is no lower rating). The grinder is OK but you need to grind through the course plate first then the finer one. The stuffer was useless. Too much air got into the attachment and thus the sausage casing.

However with sausage meat that is at all sticky or already been ground, stuffing is a VERY SLOW LABORIOUS process: when one tamps the sausage down into the grinder, a good deal of it comes back up.Go ahead and use the KitchenAid to grind and mix your sausage--but to stuff casings get a manual stuffer with proper design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hole to small - Metal not plastic.","review":"Can't use this stuffer. First, there was a sharp lip on the stuffer and I could not get the casings over it. When I finally did I had a hard time slidding the casing up because the plastic surface was to rough.

The grinder attachment's corkscrew action is not enough to push meat through the tube on its own, so you're forced to push down with the plunger.

The difficult part was refilling the tube with the ground sausage without including pockets of air. I'd be very interested in how other folks got this item to work with any kind of efficiency... my 5# of sausage probably took us between 60 and 90 minutes to stuff. This was long enough to make it difficult to keep the meat cold during the process. We managed, but I'll be looking for another stuffing alternative.

The one caveat is that it is so efficient that it is easy to over stuff the casing causing it to burst when you twist the links.That said, the meat grinder is pretty good but don't waste your money or your time on the sausage stuffing attachment"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mess","review":"I love my KitchenAid stand mixer and the meat grinding attachment. However, this attachment is another story. The sausage mixture should be pulled through the stuffer tube by the auger in the mixer, that didn't happen. The only way to make this work was to use the plastic food pusher to push the mixture in into the hopper and force it into the stuffer tube. This process was a mess, with the meat mixture \\"squishing\\" around the poorly designed pusher base and collecting on the pusher.Someone suggesting contacting KitchenAid to get one of the \\"old style\\" wooden pushers - which is a solid piece and wouldn't allow the meat to squish back up around the pusher base. I called KA and they told me that they no longer have these pushers and they were discontinued long ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"The food grinder works great, the stuffer is a waste. The plastic plunger for the food grinder is too small and the meat seeps up the sides. As someone else mentioned, I will try a wooden dowel next time. I was very frustrated and gave up on stuffing the sausage. I ended up with 10 pounds of sausage patties."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's a trick","review":"The first few times we used our sausage stuffer attachment, I wondered how anyone could give this a positive review. It honestly seemed tp stuff just as fast with the machine off, and the poorly-fitting plunger pushed huge amounts of air through the stuffer and into the sausage. Then I found the trick to getting it to work.Getting air out of the system is the only way to get the feed screw to work. The easiest way to do this is to work a drinking straw up and down the feed chute while gently pressing on the plunger. You'll feel the plunger drop as air escapes. Once the air's out, the stuffer will actually stuff pretty well. Keep working the straw as you go.The straw trick actually made this thing worth the $9. Without it, it's terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible attachment - don't waste your money - it STINKS!","review":"As others have noted - you will experience unacceptable difficulties in three areas:1) Unimaginably slow feeding/extruding of the raw sausage mixture2) Excessive amounts of air entering grinder chamber and eventually blowing up your casings like a balloon3) The plunger end of the handle tool is too narrow and much of the meat mixture just oozes out of the chamber instead of getting rammed down.Note that these are issues with the design of the grinder assembly in terms of its ability to handle sausage meat. The sausage feed tubes are just ordinary, plastic, tapered tubes.Look elsewhere to stuff sausage - I'm going to purchase a standalone electric stuffer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless Attachment for kitchenaid mixer","review":"I have always like my kichenaid products. This stuffer is worthless. This was not my first time making sausage, and Ithough why not save some time and actually by a stuffer rather than use a funnel. I thought I would be saving time and effort, but boy was that wrong! I found it faster to stuff by hand (which I hate to do). It was impossible to control air entering into the stuffer and control the meat moving consistantly into the casing without getting too warm for food safety. I am going to buy a hand stuffer (maybe the Grizzly or a cabella's upright). It cracked the first time I used it, which it should not have done with the minimal amount of pressure put on it. I bought this at a store that is over 90 miles away so I will not be returning it. Until this point I had loved every attachemnet I had for my mixer, though my overall favorite is still the meat grinder. For that to work so well, why is the sausage stuffer soo pitifully bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for someone starting out","review":"This thing is great for someone starting out in sausage making.

I thought this would be quick, I was wrong. Very slow process. Better off buying a professional sausage stuffer if your going to make a lot of sausage. This is only good for a very little amount and home use only. Takes me longer to stuff sausage with this than it takes to cook them. Only buy if your going to make a little bit of sausage once or twice a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Bad Design Will Waste Your Time","review":"Technically, it is the plunger on the Kitchen Aid food/meat grinder that will waste your time. The plunger is great for the larger chunks of meat. But once the meat is ground, the gap between the plunger and the wall of the grinder is large enough to allow the meat to pass. So as I tried to push the meat down into the auger, feeding it into the sausage stuffer, most of the meat was pushed out the sides. Increasing the speed of the auger doesn't help.If this product came with a plunger with rubber/silicone extensions that create a fairly good seal, it would probably work much better and earn more 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"self","review":"I bought this to makesausage.

I could have done a better job using a funnel and a spoon. It took me 5 hours to stuff 3.5# of sausage. It is really a pain to use. Really! The food pusher is too small and allows the chicken glop to ooze around it. So I ended up having to push it into the small feeder tube by hand then use the pusher to shove it down to the auger. 3.5# done a teaspoon at a time like this. And it is very messy to use as well. There was raw chicken glop all over the place and along with all of the hours of work already, it took another hour and half to clean up the mess. If there were minus stars this POS would get a minus 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy","review":"I bought this and the grinder attachment to make the occasional 5 pounds of homemade sausage. The grinder is usable, but I would recommend a separate grinder if you are serious. The stuffing attachment is useless.

Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"would not buy","review":"the grinder attachment that you use for this sausage stuffer does not work good at all.

Unless your mixture is really fine, the forcemeat and larger chunks of fat tend to clog up at the end of the feeder. I make a lot of dried sausage (sopressata, salami, etc) where you want some larger chunks of fatback in the mixture. This can become a problem when you need to clear a jam 3 or 4 times when stuffing only 5-10 lbs of sausage. It just takes too long. Then there is the issue of bubbles. You really have to work the casings and squeeze in the meat to get a firm fill. It's all just too much work and you almost need 2 people (one to feed and the other to work the casing). I may just buy one of those manual old fashioned cast iron stuffers for $50 and see how it goes..."},{"rating":"1","title":"tried and tried and tried","review":"As much as I would have liked to write a good review, I have to say I gave it a good shot. I tried all the \\"tricks\\" previous posters suggested but in the end it was hopeless. Every other KitchenAid accessory I ever purchased was well worth it except for this one. I ended up getting a sausage/jerky gun to fill my casings, that was OK but kinda slow and it only held a small amount of meat. Although I didn't want to spring for the $$$, I'm going to get a dedicated sausage press and do it right. For me, it's also a matter of saving time and it seems a \\"real\\" sausage press will save me the most."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great For Small Quantities","review":"I had this product since 1982 and, if used correctly, it works great for small batches of sausage for home use.My favorite hobbies include cooking gourmet meals. In 1981 I received an issue of Cook's Magazine that had a number of sausage recipes. I tried them all with the KitchenAid stuffer in 3 pound batches. The results were amazing.One needs to learn how to use the stuffer by preparing small batches, getting a feel for how firm to pack the casings and being sure to take the grinder blade out before stuffing. After a few attempts it works perfectly and makes great sausage.Tip: Season the meat after it is ground, unlike other instructions say. You get a more complete mix of spices.Tip: Homemade sausage \\"cures\\" overnight in the refrigerator for a better taste!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You're Doing it Wrong","review":"Once you realize how it properly is assembled for stuffing, you realize how great a product it is. TAKE OUT THE BLADE AND GRINDING PLATE. If you don't remove these, it will seem impossible to stuff a full length casing. It took me an hour doing this. I dissembled, and removed the blade and plate, replacing it with the plastic spinner in the box, and once I did that, the auger did its job and started pulling the meat through, instead of the vicious plunger stuffing that was needed before.Once this was done, I stuffed 10lbs in about 30 minutes (50 links). My recipe:10 lbs pork shoulder2 lbs bacon (unsliced)2 lbs ultra-sharp cheddar (shredded)2 tbs ground fennel2 tbs ground corriander2 tbs ginger1 tbs ground mustard1 tbs chili powder2 tbs red flake pepper1/4 cup watersprinkling of saltUse natural hog casings and your all set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Homemade sausage made easy!","review":"If you have a Kitchenaid mixer with the food grinder attachment, this sausage maker attachment is a neccesity! It is very easy to attach to the grinder. Get some casings from your supermarket butcher department, slip them onto the sausage tube, put the meat mixture in the grinder and turn it on. Sausage comes out of the tube with ease. It never sticks. Just slide the casings off as the meat extrudes. Twist the casing to size the sausages. There is nothing easier. Beats a hand grinder sausage extruder. Get this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time & Money","review":"The plunger does not have a tight enough seal to stuff the already ground and seasoned sausage meat into the casing.

So how did they manage to mess this one up? The flare at the wide end of the horn does not sit flat against the head of the grinder, so when you go to tighten the ring down to hold it into place, the collar can not screw on all the way. The result? A build up of meat in the front part of the collar. This eventually begins to drip down making a bloody mess of whatever is under the grinder attachment. How hard would it have been for Kitchenaid to design the horn so it fitted flat in place and the collar would have screwed on tight?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad sad sad","review":"Could not use it, grinder too weak to make a fart let alone a sausage.

I wanted to try to make sausage at home with my KitchenAid mixer and grinder attachment. It took 3 hrs to stuff 10 lb meat. It is worthless, time consuming, labor intensive. The plunger pulls back the meat you push in. The worm inside the grinder tube does not move efficently. And yes we did not attach the knife and plate. The tray needs to be larger, the grinding unit needs to be larger, the plunger needs to be straight. This is an awful design engineering. KitchenAid needs to replace their designer, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"The thing barely works","review":"I usually do my research before buying, and to do this I read the worst reviews. Had I done this in this case I never would have purchased the stuffer.As many have said, the biggest problem is with the plunger which is not wide enough to fit the chute. Meat squishes up on the sides and sticks to it. The result is overworking & heating the meat which is bad. Unlike others, I had no problem getting the casings on or with them ripping.I'm glad the stuffer tubes are only a cheap add-on for the grinder so there's not too much down the tubes. The grinder works fantastically."},{"rating":"2","title":"can't go wrong","review":"The tube is easy to use and and clean.

The stuffer constantly gets jammed; at the same time, the food pusher creates suction and nearly all that you push down gets pulled back up the chute. This creates an extremely lengthy and frustrating experience. In addition, the back-breaking work that the food pusher requires forced me to stand on a chair so I could stand above it and push down. I then needed a second person to hold the partially stuffed sausage that was on the end of the attachment or the weight of the sausage hanging down would eventually pull the casing off of the attachment.The product is as cheap and poorly designed as possible.

I spent more time taking off the attachment and clearing the plastic piece then stuffing sausage. Then it would get stuck again, take off attachment, clean out plastic, just so that it could spurt out an ounce or two of sausage- and then inevitably get stuck again. Since the worm drive is still turning, while the sausage is stuck, it is melting and smearing the fat- rendering most of the sausage that I made useless. So frustrating. And an expensive mistake.Not to mention the sharp corners of the plastic which caused tears in even the toughest casing.I am following the sage advice of everyone I have spoken to and am dropping the money (about $130) for a legitimate 5lb. handcrank stuffer.DO NOT BUY!!!

This is astonishing, considering the author sat under the preaching of the great C H Spurgeon, heir to the Reformed Puritan tradition. It is mystical, even gnostic or pelagian in many places. There is no mention of a church, of the sacraments. Instead, the Christian \\"worker\\" is portrayed as an isolated self-made spiritual giant. The influences are clearly Wesleyan with references to entire sanctification and the second blessing. Spurgeon's meticulous teaching is rejected through Chambers' confusion of the classic Protestant doctrine of justification with sanctification. The substitutionary atonement of Christ on the cross for the sins of God's people is strangely bypassed - instead the crucifixion is depicted as a mystical \\"higher life\\" example of how individual Christians are to live. There is much practical wisdom, but READ WITH DISCERNMENT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It is not about praise","review":"If you truly understand Oswald Chambers you will understand my one star rating. I love this book. But his goal was never intended to be an author but to assist Christians with building their relationship with God.If his words lead you back to your Bible he (and his wife) has accomplished his goal. If not, then his life was a waste.I used to think that everyone should read his works. In fact, I wanted to buy several copies to give away. But I am finding his writings are not for everyone. I think a lot of it has to do with where you are in your relationship with God - it is a life long process.Personally, I will read this little book everyday till I die. Every year brings greater understanding. If this book finds its way to your hands then thank God for it.

That is perfect barney-bait.By the time I was at 20 miles, I'd begun to hate the day I'd imagined that the author knew what he was talking about. OK, I finished--walked the last 2-1/2 miles to a 3:55. After I was able to think about marathons again, I found Joe Henderson's \\"Run Long\\" book. It had everything this breezy pamphlet did not. I trained out of Henderson's until 1992, then ran with Jim O'Brien's track club at Cal Tech.Subsequently I went on to finish over 25 marathons, before getting into ultras [50k on up to 100-miles].

If you have visited the Angkor temples then this book is wonderful to browse through and compare to how different they are now that the temples have been restored and cleaned up (and swarming with tourists). Even places like Ta Prohm which tourists like to think as still in pure jungle would be surprised at how much has actually changed from these photos.If you have ever visited Angkor, or have any interest in the monuments then this book is one you should have a look at for its wonderful and rare images of a lost world."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Treasured Book","review":"This must be the most beautiful and single-most precious collection of writings by any author.

I kept waiting and waiting for something to happen, but all I got was political maneuvering, winter manor administration (do you *really* want to read about sewage treatment in a fantasy novel?), and endless internal monologues. You get detailed to death.I think one of the problems is that the 'opponent' here is not a sentient entity (so far as we know), but the magical equivalent of a natural phenomenon. It's difficult to feel much emotion towards it, and while I was rather glad to have a break from Lackey's usual sadistic evil mages, I don't think this quite worked.

It does hold a lot of extra food items to grind,it snaps on very easy and securely,it gives the option of a mess free place to sit a scoop or the plunger,it is easy to clean if you dont let the food dry hard,it virtually eliminated the chance of dripping raw product into the processed food, however if you use it for runny items like applesauce with the fruit/veg. attachment dont try filling it past where you would without the tray as the juices will run through the gap and run down the outside which could get messy."},{"rating":"2","title":"beats the manual Squeezit","review":"Easily made tomato sauce till the cows came home this year.

It's as simple as that. The tiny, integral food tray built into the strainer is FAR TOO SMALL to use with anything beyond a pint or two of product. If you're going to process 100 lbs of apples into applesauce as we did this summer, then you absolutely need something bigger. Even this tray was not as big as I would like, but it was big enough to do the job at hand. It does need to be placed correctly on the strainer tray, but there are stops built into the attachment to do this. It does come loose periodically, but even that wasn't too big of deal. All in all, a really good piece of equipment at a reasonable price, that should last year after year if properly cared for."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have","review":"The Food Tray attachment is an absolute must have.

We had an older Kitchenaid Slicer/Shredder attachment and it always worked great. The cones were sharp and stayed sharp and would bite you, if you weren't careful. Recently, we had to buy a new set as the white plastic piece that attaches to the mixer was cracking after years of use (no complaint about that).The new cones are not only not sharp, they were never even beveled. All of the cutting surfaces show a simple flat face (90 degrees to cone's surface) and the cones are now made of a softer inferior steel. When we tried to shred some carrots for muffins, we got mashed carrots. The parts also get stuck together and only a set of pliers will disconnect them, while damaging the parts. Kitchenaid is not the product it used to be and it is time for a successor and a better product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was very excited when I ordered this product because of the potential time and hassle it would save me. I was disappointed to find out that two of the cone attachments are pretty much the same and I must have been in disbelief after reading the customer reviews regarding the difficulty with disassembling this product after use. It is quite difficult to disassemble because when you are removing the cone, there is no good way of grabbing it to turn it to the left to remove it. The first test was carrots which wasn't bad but when I removed the cone it made quite a big mess on my counter and floor. I am returning this product and intend on getting a food processor instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"This is definately not the quality you would expect from Kitchenaid. It does a horrible job at slicing or shredding. The thick slicer and coarse shredder are so fine I can't imagine why you would even need the thin or fine ones. They turned my food into mush. It was also hard to get the food through. It felt like it was trying to kick it back out instead of pulling it through like most shredders do.When finished I rinsed the parts and set them aside for washing. A half hour later when I started cleaning dishes I found the cones were rusty already. Now they have tarnish spots all over.Overall I am extremely disappointed in this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I had read the reviews","review":"Love my Kitchenaid stand mixer.

Why?The blades are dull and VERY hard to separate from the shaft.Cucumbers and zucchini with the \\"slicer\\" attachment come out as mangled bits. The \\"shredder\\" simply liquefies vegetables and doesn't produce nice strings. Cheese has to be frozen in order to not gum it up.This had the potential to be a great product, but Kitchenaid completely blew it.The blades need to be MUCH sharper (think food processor), be stainless steel, and have a solid shaft that doesn't have to be removed.Even a $25 salad shooter got it right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time on this product","review":"I purchased this KitchenAid attachment mainly to grind nuts and chocolate when baking cookies.

My main interest was to shred cheese and I found many reviews talking positive about the ability to shred cheese easily. My wife has carpal tunnel and both of us hate shredding cheese with a manual cheese grater. I bought this item thinking that I would shred cheese in bulk and store in a ziploc bag. I was very excited but lost the excitement after my first attempt. Issue #1: Cheese needs to be frozen before you shred. Issue #2: Cheese starts flying around the counter top and I feel like I need three hands to do a good job; one hand to push the cheese down, the other to hold the huge bowl, and the third to try and deflect cheese from flying out. I get tired holding a huge bowl with one hand and trying to shred with the other hand. Issue #3: Hand washing this item is not so easy and I do not like it. My overall comments: It is not worth the money. This item is not for all folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"rust on kitchenaid","review":"I was very disappointed when I removed the blades for this slicer shredder from the dishwasher and found that they had rusted.

Came out mushed celery and a huge mess to clean up.I tried the shredding attachment and things came out slices with ridges. What's that all about?So how does this thing work? Kitchen aid isn't known for making junk. This has to work for somebody and can't just work for extremely hard vegetables.There are zero instructions except the one that everyone else seems to miss about the square hole in the plastic houseing specifically designed to tighten and loosen the cones from the shaft.If you know how this works, please let me know.

I wanted to be able to slice onions and celery, or other soft vegetables and fruits. This is not a good item for that. If you want to shred cheese or other firm items it works okay to great. After I was disappointed with the onions and celery I tried potatoes since I make homemade chips I was hopeful it would cut down on the work, all it gave me were potatoes that already looked chewed up. I suggest spending the money on a food processor if you want to slice and shred softer items."},{"rating":"2","title":"so far so good. wife is happy with it.","review":"Thus far, we have had it a few weeks. Wife uses the mixer all the time with no problems so we decided to try this attachment. She makes a potato dish which requires a lot of shredding. She gave this two thumbs up as she used it to shred the potatoes this last time. Read the earlier comments and decided the issues raised could be overcome, and so far they have. The insert/rotor has to be grabbed with a pliers or something to get it to twist out, but if you are careful it is not hard. I also think hand washing the cone/slicers and immediately drying them will keep rust at bay, rather than top rack of the dishwasher. Less handy, but lets face it, you are spending time in your kitchen for a reason usually."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont' waste your money","review":"This is the poorest excuse for a slicer/grater I have ever seen! It simply destroys things like potatoes and carrots. The cones are absolutely not sharp. I did get an e-mail reply from Kitchenaid which suggested that I return them to the place where I purchased them - fat chance when I got them in a set! They obviously know there is nothing they can do to make this attachment work - which is what I asked about - I thought maybe there was something I was doing wrong. I must say the food grinder works swell and so does the strainer attachment so I don't feel completely ripped off.

Next time I will spend in a food processor or a hand grater."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay but not great","review":"I've only had this for a few days and haven't tried the shredder yet but as a slicer I'm rather disappointed in it. I tried it on a couple of relatively firm cucumbers and it did slice them, just not in nice uniform slices like the box shows. Some of the slices were thick on one side, very thin on the other. Others were elongated, more oval than round. The skin of the cucumbers would get caught and pull off and it would more or less just mash the spots where the skin ripped off. All in all, this product is not worth the $50 if you buy it individually but if you get it in the meat grinder/pasta maker/slicer 3 pack like I did it's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nemesis of all things cheese!","review":"This is a large, heavy-duty attachment. It takes up a lot of storage space, but it is absolutely worth it.I have a giant Cuisinart food processor, but when I want to convert a block of cheese into a bowl of shreds, this is what I reach for every time. One of the best things about it is that it shreds directly into an external bowl, so it can't get full, or compress the cheese. If the bowl starts getting full, I just turn it off, put another bowl in front of it, and turn it back on. It gets power directly from the drive shaft of the stand mixer, so nothing slows it down.My salad shooter is now relegated to the basement!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good slicer too, but...","review":"After reading the reviews here, I wasn't sure if it sliced onions well. I am happy to say that the onions are sliced nicely. I was using a mandolin and throwing away too much, to prevent hurting myself. This is much quicker and safer. I also tried bell peppers, but the results weren't as good. Some of the peppers were mushed and some were huge slices. I had to get out the knife anyway and fix the large pieces manually.Does anyone have a good solution for the (slight) problem of sliced vegetables flying about?

The shredder attachment does a combination of things: it makes a ridiculous amount of liquid, it shreds about 50-60% of the material but it's all mixed in with way too many to pick out medium and large chunks. Supposedly it works best on medium to firm cheese, fruit and veggies. I've tried it with carrots, coconut, and zuchini with no success.

I am very displeased with the overall quality of this set. The plastic housing is thinner material than my original, so I have no doubt it too will crack. But the worst part is the blades. I use the small shredder and the disc slicer regularly and when I tried these out, they were so dull that they didn't cut my vegetables as much as \\"chew\\" them up. I am very disappointed with kitchenaid or whoever bothers to manufacture this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"useless!","review":"I tried to shred some almonds - parts of the almonds are shredded however about 50% falls out next to the grinder blade in larger and smaller almond bits. Very messy and disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"No sharp cutting edge","review":"The so-called cutting edges on the attachments are as dull as can be. They do not cut veges, they club them to death. The hopper for putting veges in has a lot of slack, and the item to slice or grate can slip around and avoid being cut at all. I returned this item the day after I bought it. I'm sticking with my inexpensive food processor for cutting chores!"},{"rating":"2","title":"KitchenAId Attachment","review":"I used to shred my potatoes, cabbage and carrots by a small hand grater and would almost every time get my finder or hand cut. Now I use these attachments three or more times a week. My husband loves hash browns and coleslaw so much that this machine in a few months has been worth the money. I try to make every from scratch. It is also so easy to clean. I love it. (so does my husband)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This attachment does not fit properly in my machine. The shaft is too long to lock it in place. Rather than going through the trouble of returning it, I think my husband can make it work but it's super frustrating. I had also hoped that one of the inserts would produce a slightly larger end product. It slices a little too thin for soups, which was my primary reason for buying.Amazon handled the order well, and it shipped super fast. I think it was on my doorstep within 24hrs and it was the week of Christmas! I did not pay extra for expedited shipping. Thanks amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised","review":"When I used the slicer, it sure did not work on carrots. It did work well on shredding cheese.Getting the silly thing put together and then, ugh, taking it apart was difficult for me. I am 64 and my hands are not as strong as they used to be. Maybe this would not be a problem for a younger person. I would not spend the money if I knew when I bought it what I know now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the easiest to operate","review":"I've used this only once to shred cabbage. It did a great job of making tiny shreds, but the unit and cone was so hard for me to attach and I don't think it's very safe. At least, I'm not very comfortable using it. I love my kitchenaid artisan stand mixer, but don't think I'll be buying any more of the attachments when there are so many other products that are less expensive and look to be easier to use. I'll probably sell this attachment set and get a mandolin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lot of Great Memories","review":"As a die-hard Astros fan, this DVD was greatly enjoyable.

They are single and unattached, if that makes a difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read some excerpts","review":"This book is definitely written from a very, very Christian perspective. Some people may wish to actually read some excerpts from this book and definitely read the prayer in the back before deciding to purchase it. If you like what you read...buy it...if not...keep looking. This book will appeal to a certain audience. If you are not in that audience there are penalty of other books out there that can assist men and women in balancing the feminine and masculine aspects of their own respective beings. For those who decide not to purchase this book but are still looking for something from a Christian base, I would suggest something by Cloud and Townsend. If you want something Spiritual with a respective definition of the male and female roll, the Hindus may have some very good holistically spiritually based relationship books."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can quit apologizing for who I am","review":"This book gave me permission to quit apologizing for who I am. God made me who I am on purpose. I am not too much; I am not too little. I have unconsciously been living for years feeling sorry for the people in my life because of my perceived sense of failing them. Now I can lift my head because the blanket of guilt I wasn't even aware of has been removed. It's ok to be feminine. It's ok to be vulnerable. It doesn't make you weak. I don't have to prove anything to anyone.I can raise my daughters to be empowered by their femininity. If you have little girls, this book is a must-read. I would also recommend it to anyone with aspirations for counseling or therapy. It tangibly illustrates and puts into words much of the why behind female responses and reasoning. Women are not irrational and controlled by emotion. We are designed by a loving creator as we are for a reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating by John and Stasi Eldredge","review":"Love this book!!! I can't put it down. It is breaking bondages and healing my heart. It's drawing me closer to my Heavenly Father. I am receiving so much revelation and healing from this book, I can't say it enough. I am recommending it to all the women in my life. You will not be disappointed in this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read!","review":"WOW! This is truly one of the best books I have read in years- it speaks truth and hope into lives. What is revealed about a woman's heart in relation to how God created us is inspiring and enlightening. I found healing and stength in places of my life that I wasn't even aware were stripping me of love. I can't imagine a woman reading this book and not being moved at the core of her being. Thank you John & Stasi Eldridge for expressing in words what some never grasp in a lifetime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too repetitive","review":"I'm sure the author(s) could've gotten their point across in a 30-page book.

I'm bored already, but I'm gonna hang in there to see what blows up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great and inspirational gift","review":"Gave this book as a Christmas gift to a friend of ours. Very inspirational and she learned alot about herself. Great book. I read it myself several times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changing my life!","review":"This book is so amazing! I wish I had read this as a tween! This book will heal your heart and help you cherish your God-given nature as a woman. If you are a male reader... this book will definitely help you understand women. A MUST READ!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it","review":"When I first began to read Captivating expected it to be based on Christian beliefs. As I continued reading, I found this was not true. The book makes many references to popular fiction (fairy tales, books, movies) while including just enough scripture to be considered spiritual. Even when considering the book from a secular point of view, it did not make sense. It presented ideas that were contradictory to one another and did not address the contradiction. I never felt sure about the message of the book; it went in circles without reaching conclusions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Captivating","review":"Although I was initally excited about the captivating study guide, as I progressed I became more disturbed. In Chapter 6, The author relates our relationship to God in a sexual way by using the Song of Solomon. I believe the Song of Solomon to be an allergory of a husband of wife relationship. It disturbs me to think that we could relate to God in such a preverse way. This could be a very confusing study guide for those new in their faith or that are sexually active. I believe this to be a distortion and misinterpretation of scripture. I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful book","review":"This book has a better writing style than other Christian nonfiction I've read, and I found it very helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I wasn't sure what to think after reading all of the reviews.

Updating and revising a bestseller, this is the woman's equivalent of \\"Wild at Heart.\\" While every boy and man out there wants to know if they have what it takes (the knight in shining armor), every girl and woman need to know a simple thing: are they captivating? Are they a princess worth fighting for? Are they beautiful? John and Stasi write together, with a collection of experiences and anecdotes, to address how G-d answers that question.

I now feel more beautiful then I have ever felt in my life. I didn't understand that at all until I read this book.

However, I just could not connect with it. It has set on my nightstand for months now because each time I would pick it up to read it, I just could not relate to it. I am sure there are some women this book would be great for, but I was not one of them. I would give the book 2 out of 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Quite so Captivating","review":"While the idea behind this book is what every woman is searching for - the usefullness of this book stops there. This book is poorly reserched. By the end the same concepts, ideas, and statments are no more than reworded and placed on the page. It tells a woman what she wants to hear - that God loves us and created each of us as a beautiful woman. However its' lack of reaserch stops us there. We feel cheated, like the annoyed person telling you what you want to hear in hopes that you will shut up and get over it. If perhaps the authors had set down and researched the concept rather than pushing a deadline in hopes of adding cash to their pockets we would have seen God working through them. Instead we see a follower of God following the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"just couldn't relate","review":"I just could not relate to this book at all.

It was very fluffy, not much substance"},{"rating":"1","title":"Old fashioned pathetic whiney tale","review":"This is by far the worst book our book club has read. A story of a messed up chick who can't get past her feelings of not being pretty. Throughout the whole book beauty is a central theme, every woman wants to be told they are captivating to attract a man blah blah blah. I had to check the copyright date, thinking this was a book written in 1920. The book angered me in that this drivel is what gives women a bad name, wanting to be rescued instead of snapping out of your issues and making the most of what you have be given in life.

I was curious about it, so I decided to read the book a bit before buying it. I was shocked with how much examples from movies that the author uses in her book. I've never read a christian book with so many examples from movies. I don't think movies are a good source to use as examples for matters of the human heart. I did notice some resentment towards the Proverbs 31 Woman. How can you be resentful towards the Word of God? Just reading the back cover made red lights turn on in my head. I hope that whoever reads this book will be sure to not take it literally. I recommend Elisabeth Elliot...if your looking for bibically sound teaching."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty much AMAZING","review":"I LOVE this book. Although it was sometimes hard to get through,nearly every chapter gave me new insights into the heart of God and a better understanding of my desires as a woman. I think every woman (and man, for that matter) should read this book.

It's so focused on the wounded or helpless woman seeking rescue, you'll probably wonder if these authors developed their view of women from patients in crisis therapy. Or maybe that's the kind of woman who shows up in their Christian-fundamentalist seminars. Either way, It just doesn't describe the women I know.Also annoying was that this book didn't seem to have a clear purpose or much substance. It's easy to find a fictional movie character or Bible quote to support anything in the world (you can find Scripture passages recommending killing children), but what does that prove? Not much. It circled around and around vague phrases like 'the secret of a woman's soul', but didn't provide much in the way of insight or interest. It's like they kept promising they had something important to say, but by the end I was wondering 'what was the point of all that?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.

The only thing I want to point out is this:If you DON'T want a scripturally-based view of who you are as a woman, read this book.

We all fall short of the goal...does that mean we should throw out the goal????New American Standard Bible (1995) Proverbs 12:1Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge, But he who hates reproof is stupid.This book is like SO MANY \\"teachers\\" today:\\"For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires; and will turn their ears away from the truth; and will turn aside to myths\\" (2 Timothy 4:3-4, NASB).Come on ladies, God has MORE for us!

First of all, it's not based on the Proverbs 31 woman. The books that say \\"Follow rules A, B, and C to be a good Christian woman\\" drive me nuts!! They make me feel so completely inadequate. This book was so different than any other book I had read. The Eldredges describe a woman's deep desire to feel beautiful, cherished, and fought-for (how we want a knight in shining armor coming to our rescue), and how that relates to our relationship with God. The book describes how women reflect the part of God that wants to be desired and cherished as well.This book really spoke to my heart, and encouraged me in my walk with God.

What?\\"Well, according to the reviews on this site, I'm not the only one who feels differently than this book tells me I should.

But if you're looking for biblically sound answers to the questions you have as a Christian woman - STEER CLEAR! While there are parts of the book that have merit, you have to wade through so much false teaching to get to the good stuff. You have to ask yourself - is it really worth it? The answer is \\"no\\" in my opinion, and my Pastor agreed.

Unless you consider movie quotations and situations as theology. And what they did take from Scripture, much of it was taken out of context, like the passages from Song of Solomon.

Both were very insightful. Both made me look at myself in a new light. You can tell the writers speak from the heart and from experience.

The authors take verses out of context to prove their points and the new Christians were being misled. I am throwing away both my book and study guide since I wouldn't want anyone else to fall victim to the faulty teaching. Stasi herself seems to have many issues that are unresolved and if you view the videos that come with the book it is clear that the women in the group need help in climbing out of the pit instead of repeatedly discussing their difficult past (which since I am a former social worker didn't seem all that difficult by comparison to what many women suffer in our world)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow","review":"According to this book all women are shallow. All we care about is me, myself, and I.

It makes little sense to walk out of a light-hearted romantic comedy and then turn to the Bible to find a series of proof-texts to back up the warm, fuzzy emotions delivered by Hollywood's view of romance. It is time for Christians to become more critically minded about sex, romance, and marriage. We should turn to the scriptures first and ask for the counsel of those around us who exemplify feminine strength. Christians should be the ones critiquing overly romanitcized love, not endorsing it.

If women are hard to figure out ... it may be because people focus on the personality of someone rather than the soul. The soul knows the truth and it speaks from the heart and not the head.

It is not theologically sound at all. It uses very few scriptures, and when it does they are taken way out of context.

As a Christian I watch very few secular movies so the comparissons and references to fictional characters is lost on me. Besides do I want to strive to be like a fictional character? NO. Whatever tidbits of truth are here should of been aligned with TRUTH. I believe the authors have written so many books of fantasy they've lost touch with their God. A real Christian writer should be able to speak to men and women about the roles God intended them to live out by referencing only Jesus.

I don't have feelings of abandonment by the men in my life, I don't walk around internally screaming \\"Look at me! Am I beautiful?

But, I'm just one reader..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not me, either","review":"I expected a lot more from this book since it was recommended by so many Christian friends. I just didn't get it. I understood what the author is saying, however I outgrew most of this by the time I graduated high school. Are there really grown women out there secretly waiting for princes to sweep them off their feet? I know that God created me to be feminine, fun, and nurturing, but I don't dwell on these qualities. Perhaps that's why this book didn't connect with me. I'm not really interested in overanalyzing my inner and outer attributes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deficient of Solid Biblical Truth","review":"My Bible study leader recommended this book, saying that it is a \\"life-changing book.\\" Upon finishing \\"Captivating,\\" I found it to be anything but. There were a few passages here and there in which I liked; although, I found the majority of the book to be watered-down and lacking of substantiated biblical support. Rather than backing up their claims with Scripture, John and Stasi Eldredge support their arguments using the plots of movies (i.e. Lord of the Rings). What is the problem with this? Movies are fictional. They are not real.All in all, I do NOT recommend this book. It is watered-down and deficient of solid biblical truth. Several of my friends have also been disappointed with the content of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Capsizing, not capitvating","review":"If you are looking for a book of fluff and childhood memories dredged from your past, skim through this book. Do not link it to a Bible study because it is not remotely associated with God's truth. For a new Christian this is dangerous territory because you may see your own husband as not measuring up. Well who can measure up to God's fulfillment as our bridgegroom and Lord? I am disappointed that I was duped into buying this book because of the Eldredge name. There are slim references to Scripture and for me it doesn't measure up."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent shape","review":"I purchased this book as a used but like new condition and was surprised that when I got it you would not have known it was a used book it was in perfect condition and the price was great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...","review":"This is what I would truly see as an evangelical perspective on women being the submissive in the relationship and being a man's dominion to be conquered and controlled while she has no clue on how to conduct her life beyond being someone's property - either the church or her man. Good read if you enjoy that lifestyle, who am I to judge? Definitely not a turn on for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This is a great book for women, Moms with daughters, or men to understand their wives. It made me realize how God created me, and all women, and rejoice in that and grow in that, not stifle it.

Much of what is said in the book you will know in your heart if you are in touch with it. However, after hearing what many churches say a woman's role should be, it is a breath of fresh air to be appreciated and affirmed and have it backed up by scripture and written by both sexes. If you are in need of hearing how precious you are as a woman, or you are a man and would like to better understand the women in your life, then this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Fluff","review":"I picked up this book with a bible study group and we got through the third chapter before giving up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just pathetic.","review":"This book does nothing for \\"opening\\" women's hearts.

Definitely, I have read better books than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking!","review":"This book opened my eyes and my heart to see women in a whole new light. The creation of Eve is so beautifully described, you can't help but be in awe. It helped me see the things in my childhood and past that have shaped me into the woman that I am today. It also helped me see the areas that I need to give special attention in my own daughter's childhood, so that she may have stronger confidence. Things that I had never even thought of. I also learned to stop and see the gifts that God has given me in an ordinary day. This book helped me to understand that a simple thing such as a sunset is a gift from the Father because He loves us and wants us to delight in such beautiful things. I highly recommend this book, especially if you are a woman recovering from an abusive childhood. You will forever be changed."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Set Me Free","review":"The best book on the christian life for women.

The only problem is, I definitely don't think this was written for men. So, now that is out of the way, I'll move on...I think this is an excellent book to really capture the essence of a woman. From the guys who brought you \\"Wild At Heart\\" for us men, they really take the time to explain how a woman works and how they can better understand themselves. The reason I said before that it was written for women is because they assume that you understand what they're talking about, probably being a woman reading the book, and that all the concepts just flow. For a guy, its a little hard to understand, but my wife seems to love it.Overall, I think its a great read for any woman looking to explore why they are the way they are and how to deal with the feelings and emotions that come from being a woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Understanding a Woman's Captivating Heart","review":"Very Good Book.Have read it several timesHelps to understand women a little... lolDon't know they can ever be fully understood... only loved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the read","review":"This book has proved to not only be very insightful, but very emotional.

It really could have been condensed into about 25 pages. I felt like it dragged on and on. I also felt like saying, \\"get over it\\" throughout the whole book. Yeah, everyone has had a bad past but rather than dwelling on it and considering how it has effected our lives let's just come to the understanding that we are beautiful, God loves us, and let's move on. No sense in getting emotional about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Captivating Read","review":"This book is an insightful look into a woman's heart and can speak in a powerful way to our shared journey as women of faith.

I recommended this book again and again and bought many copies as gifts."},{"rating":"2","title":"just what i needed","review":"This is an incredible book that reminds the woman how beautiful she is inside and out. It reminds us that despite what the world tells us, we are worthy and valuable. We are worth fighting for and being won. This was just the encouragement needed. John and Stasi Eldredge have a good perception of the woman and her emotional needs. I highly recommend it to any woman!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not a one-dimensional human","review":"Why I hate this book:Women are individual humans, not a category you can fulfill with stereotyped roles. And I don't want to prized for being beautiful and be part of a hero's story. I AM the hero and don't need someone else to provide my adventure. I have a lot of positive characteristics besides beauty, and want to be recognized and appreciated for ALL of them. And I am beautiful whether or not it is recognized by a man.This book is great to use in your Bible study/reading group if you want to foster women's dependence on men. Horrible if you want to attract a respectful man who wants an autonomous and powerful wife, like himself, and to get to know you for who you, individually, are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, Uplifting Book","review":"This book was lovely. I received a free copy of Captivating to review from BookSneeze and I'm glad I did- I probably wouldn't have bought it on my own but feel enriched having read it. The premise of women as wonderful, special daughters of God is refreshing and enjoyable. Although my person beliefs aren't quite the same as the authors, I loved how clearly they described Christ waiting at the gate- just waiting for us to come unto Him. I also found myself agreeing with their ideas of what women want from men and our innate, God-given differences. This was uplifting and inspiring- a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep and insightful","review":"I got this book as an engaged man seeking to learn more about the motivations, needs, and inner beauty of my bride-to-be, and was not disappointed. Though written to women, this book revealed to me fundamental designs which God uses to reveal Himself uniquely to and through women, and glean insights into how I as a man and husband can demonstrate Christlikeness to my wife.There were some presumptions by the Eldridges that all women have been significantly wounded in their parental relationships, which has not been the experience of my fiance nor myself; however, all have been wounded by the effects of sin, and this book is insightful, practical, and unafraid to confront the fears and woundings which seem so often to hinder women from sharing their true beauty with the world.I would recommend this as a great book for reading and discussion by both men and women in deep relationships such as marriage or engagement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully Written","review":"I find the book to be wonderfully written and broad in inspiration. I expected your usual Christian based read pinpointing once again where I am missing it in my walk with God and my role as a woman. However, this book is total opposite and I appreciate that insight.

The foam insert is hard to get the DVDs in and out. Plus you can't really see what you are looking at other than the edge of a DVD. So you could end up pulling out 10 DVDs from the difficult foam until you finally find what you are looking for. The cardboard box is cheap and will most likely fall apart after a year or two of consistent use. It is also not the easiest to store due to the rounded top (nothing will stay on top).

Upon arrival though, it's extremely underwhelming. The discs are held together in cheap black foam inside the \\"Collector's Tox Box\\" (which isn't impressive at all BTW). There's no individual case, nor jewel case for any of the discs, they just sit in foam. Literally.Also, no bonus content that's exclusive to the box set versus the 3 Blu-ray editions separately. That fact is what really finalizes my opinion on disliking this.I'm so torn.

Personally, if it had separate dvd cases I don't think I would take the measures to keep it in as good condition. This is a great boxed set with all three movies with the blue-ray, dvd, and digital copise, plus a bonus features dvd. The box itself pays homage to the toybox that Andy has, and they're placed neatly inside.If the lack of cases is truly something that bothers you, I'd suggest buying the jewel-cases for CDs, which fit quite nicely inside the box.

I am not sure if the comparison was the older DVD Ultimate Edition versions of Toy Story but for the Blu-Ray editions, its all featured.The packaging is quite nice - cheap cardboard I doubt it. Of course, if handle with care it is durable. Still, while the placement of the disc I felt its best if its in a casing, the foam that holds all ten-disc is something I would rather avoid. The box is rather big and the extra stuff which was stuck on the box is rather annoying.If you love Toy Story series and for those that have yet to own the previous DVD or Blu-Ray editions, this is worth forking out to own this edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimate?

It's nice and for the price of the trilogy I won't complainwhat I will complain about is the fact that the disc are not in jewel cases or circular plastic cases. The discs are placed in a piece of black foam. Nothing really special, just slots in the foam for each and every discs. You know what this is called? It's called lazy production value.don't buy this product, you are better off just buying a combo pack sometime down the line.

Unfortunately, this case is the latter.The packaging is an absolute injustice for a trilogy of this caliber. Given the quality of all three movies and their popularity, I expected the royal treatment with this box set. What we get instead is cheap black foam that I can already see is leaving a fine residue on the discs as I remove/insert the discs. It is difficult to find the disc that you want to see, since the discs are packaged close together in line -- In order to find a particular disc, you need to remove several until you find the one you want. Also, there is no way to take the discs out or reinsert them without feeling like you will eventually damage them.My recommendation -- spend the extra $10 and buy the movies individually.

I still bought the sets, knowing that eventually OF COURSE there would be a trilogy set released with collactables and special features like always.BUT, to hold back the digital copy, which is almost a given with most blu-rays nowadays, for the special boxset, is just mean.Ugh.500 stars for the movies, 1 for their strategies.I'll still probably buy this set anyway :D"},{"rating":"2","title":"love this and so does my 1 1/2 yr old son!","review":"My son is a toy story fanatic and when i opened that box and pointed out that it was andy's toy box holding the dvds, he flipped! super cute, super personal, love the digital copies and my son was one happy camper! this is a must for toy story fans (which we all are)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Packaging EVER!","review":"Of course the movies are great! That's why you're here looking at this, because you've already seen the movies and know how wonderful they are.Now that we've established that, go buy the movies individually. I can't even begin to describe how bad the packaging is. The packaging is hard to store, hard to get movies out of, and hard to put them in. It's just 10 slots cut into some foam, so you don't know what disk is what without handling them all. They are a pain to put back into the case because of the way the foam is cut. And, to those that want to keep your disks in good condition for years of watching pleasure, you can't remove the disks without handling the face of them, so they will wind up with all sorts of fingerprints and skin oil on them.I have many trilogies, collections, and sets of movies, on Blu-Ray and on DVD. This is hands-down, by far, the worst packaging of them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great price, TERRIBLE packaging, be aware","review":"My son got this for Christmas from his grandparents and although we are extremely grateful and the price on this is great, the way the discs are packaged is terrible. As others have stated, they do not come in individual cases or even slip cases, they are just positioned in a foam block. It is really difficult for my son to properly put them away himself, so I am worried that over time they will get left out and scratched.Be aware that if you want to keep them well protected, you will want to purchase jewel cases or at least sleeves separately. The foam block CAN be removed and the discs stored in jewel cases inside the toy box, which is what I'm guessing we'll end up doing.Can't complain about the price though, and it only took me about 5 minutes to get all the digital copies loaded into iTunes and onto the ipod, which is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"box set for toy story 1,2 and 3","review":"I have to say that I think this pack is wonderful. Not only the blu ray but having the dvds too. In regards to the packaging I have to say I like it a lot. Having been in packaging for 16years it really is one of the nicer packs I have seen. It seems that other opinions are saying there is not enough protection for the disc.Actually that is not the case. The foam they used is very good packaging foam , not cheap.

Her more recent novels, such as Tall, Dark, and Deadly were a fun mix of romance and suspense. That's what I expected when I picked this book up. Instead, I found three formulaic love stories. The so-called suspense in each was hardly worth it. The chemistry between the couples was nearly non-existent. Out of the three stories, the best was the middle one, starring Wendy Hawk and Brad McKenna. Though the plot was predictable, (of course he was going to fit in to her world and of course his love would make her forgether dead husband) it was the best of the three. The connection between the characters (they all come back in Borrowed Angel, the last of the tales) is cute- it is sometimes nice to catch up with old characters. All in all, not terrible as a diversion, but not the best romance novel around."},{"rating":"2","title":"So and so","review":"The movie was interesting and great to have for road trips, but when I was watching it, My DS power light went red and my charger light (No charger in there) was orange and the sound started blaring, wich scared me.

Not about design, or the elements of design, or how various design elements might be used either separately or in conjunction to evoke feelings or images.The book is broken into sections, one for each design element such as color, texture, etc. The first page of each section is a very general description of that design element. This is then followed by 15 pages or so of full-page pictures highlighting that design element. Looking at 15 pages of colorful objects or highly textured objects may be mildly interesting but it isn't terribly informative or useful.This book may be marginally adequate if you just want to flip through the pictures looking for inspiration.

I have gone through so many juicers that i thought this one is worth a try and it is actually pretty good. Forget about the little strainer that comes with it, that is a waste of time. Just place a large bowl and a strainer over the bowl and juice as much as you want. On the downside I did have some screeching sound coming from the mixer but as one reviewer stated, she had to grease the little extending pole before using it.

I don't understand why it it not metal because that little nub of plastic is the only thing that holds the outside juicer attachment in place. Mine just sheared completely off during the 2nd use.

I mean the ones that are the size of a toddler's head. For these, it took a lot of work to get all of the lemon juiced, and several times emptying the strainer. That said, for my normal lemons, and the grapefruit sized lemons, it worked perfectly.I would suggest juicing into a pitcher, rather than a batter bowl as I did, to minimize splash even more.

It is easy to assemble and clean, but the juicing process is very inefficient. I have juice running down my arm because of the angle the orange has to be held against the reamer. In order to maintain adequate pressure on the fruit to maximize juice extraction, the mixer has to be held in place with the other hand.

You can only juice 1-2 oranges before the pulp strainer is full.I think the second complaint is the more serious of the two. Last night I juiced 8 oranges.

Geez!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Wanted to Like It, But...","review":"This movie was loosely--and I do mean loosely--based on a Ray Bradbury short story of the same name. The Bradbury story was clever and thought-provoking. This movie had a great cast, from Ben Kingsley to Catherine McCormack. Too bad the script was terrible. It had cardboard characters (Kingsley plays a one-dimensional, evil capitalist; no other kind exists in movies these days) and pitifully executed action--the underwater scene where a man holds his breath for over 5 minutes and kills a giant moray eel with a knife to the gill, while avoiding the foot-long teeth and snapping jaws, had to be seen to be disbelieved. To add insult to injury, the science was so bad, it made The Core and Armegeddon seem scholarly--I still don't see how THAT could be possible. They even screwed up a drowning resuscitation scene so badly....never mind.Terrible. I wish I didn't waste the time on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound of Thunder","review":"This is one of the worst movie I have ever seen. Its special effects are poor and it is hard to understand what is happening. A lot of the film is totally dark and it is almost impossible to know what is going on. And the dinosaurs were terrible this is a real picture movie, and the use creatures look totally unrealistic and creatures that never existed. And its special effects would have been outdated 10 years ago. I hated this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Distant Sound of Foo!","review":"The source material is good. This is garbage. Stupid does not even begin to describe this mess. The viewer must wonder how such an interesting and thought provoking idea could result in a travesty of Hollywood excess and mis-management. The writers, producers and director should be ashamed of themselves. The writers especially do the concept a disservice. I avoided this until I was desperate for something to watch, and it was still a mistake. Maybe some day a good production of Ray Bradbury's concepts will come to fruition. Butterflies rule!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thunder Rattles the Timeline.","review":"When watching this sci-fi journey, adpated by ray bradbury's short story, you might wonder, as I did, why the movie wasn't highly publicized or why it made so little.The fact is that when it came down to TIMELINE and JURASSIC PARK franchise, it seemed that the makers of this movie wanted to steer clear of that familiarity and do some different visual effects. Granted, there are some really good special effects but there are others which leave much to be desired and lacking.The premise is a solid story which is the only reason why I'm giving it two stars instead of one.In order to fully enjoy this movie you must make yourself believe that it was a straight to T.V. or video movie and not a movie that overspent their expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good B-rated sci-fi movie","review":"I'm not sure why this movie has gotten so many bad reviews. I've seen it three times on the Sci-Fi channel and each time I couldn't stop watching it. The movie has many unexpected twists and the creatures are truly creative and scary. Among the creatures are some very large hanging bats, some strange looking gorilla-reptile things, a water eel-snake thing, large flying birds, dinosaurs, and some people-eating vines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Those that rate at 1 or 2 must only watch block busters","review":"This movie was exactly what I would expect for a regular Sci-Fi video, or made for TV or B movie. I'm guessing that all those those who rated this video as 1 or 2 are the type of movie renter who only picks from the new releases or top picks video sections at the rental store.The CGI was good for a low budget and the sets were good. The acting was OK not great but better than I have seen on some enjoyable Sci-Fi that that I have watched. The movie did just as good at following the book as most block busters.

It's got some o.k. special effects, o.k. acting and an interesting plot, plus, on top of everything, it's got sexy Edward Burns in it which was primarily the main motivator for me to watch this movie. If Edward Burns wasn't in it, I think I would've just given it 3 stars but as it is, with him in it, the story becomes intriguing and makes it worth watching. I didn't see any other well-known actors in there, other than him. Not a bad movie altogether, I would get a copy, if I were you, for those slow, rainy days. Get a copy today, especially if you're an Edward Burns fan, like me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh","review":"I don't know what went wrong with this movie. Yes, now I do. I did a search for another movie this one reminded me of- one that disappointed me just as much... The Relic- another film set in Chicago.

There are ideas here that could have made a great script & movie. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really that bad","review":"I have to admit that I actually enjoyed this a bit.I love time travel and you didn't need a degree in physics to understand whats going on.Acting was pretty good. Kingsley was great.The CGI on the other hand did leave alot to be desired, although the baboon/reptile was a neat concept.What upset me more than anything else was the fact that I paid 12.00 bucks for it. Not pricey, but if i had rented this on Netflix, I would have noticed a glaring omission. There are absolutely no extras on the DVD. None but 2 previews. That is what made me give it 1 star.No deleted scenes, no commentary, nada, zilch. Hell, they could have done a bio on Bradbury and it would have been something interesting.Putting out DVD's at this stage of the game w/o extras is a crime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the critics say","review":"If it's not a blockbuster, some movies get panned to death and end up with a 1-star rating.

They completely missed the meaning of the title and that disappointed me. Not only does thunder refer to the Thunder Lizzard they shoot but to the very end of the written story (and I'm sure this is not a spoiler) the sniveling coward Eckels clawing through the mud on his boot and finding the butterfly waited. \\"He heard Travis shift his rifle, click the safety catch, and raise the weapon. There was a sound of thunder.\\" That was the whole point of the story. The movie missed it. Duh! What were they thinking?

Bradbury's short story is one of THE classic scifi stories, up there with greats by Arthur C. Clarke, Isaac Asimov and even the original god H.G. Wells.This is the kind of movie that makes you wonder how some talent keeps getting work at all, in this case Peter Hyams, who could not have done a worse job. And what fooled the actors into taking a role in this beast.A real bottom dweller. Not good camp. An awful awful awful adaptation. Awful effects.Terrible in every way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the worst of movie of the year!","review":"Bad acting by almost everyone (except Ben Kingsley).The lead guy has perpetual hoarse voice and a constant somewhat annoyed facial movements as his acting.The lead actress with Brit accent slowed down as the movie progressed but said her initial (and the most important) dialog at such a horrible way!I dont think this was B movie -- more like C- !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected","review":"My husband I rented this last night. I was going to purchase it, but after seeing all the bad reviews, decided to rent. I was pleasantly surprised. It was very interesting and thought the acting and the storyline was good. I loved the fact that all the chaos and changes in the world was caused by one little butterfly. It really makes you think of all the decisions you make and how your world can really be dramatically different by just one alteration in a decision you have made in your past.

Everything's bad -- acting, filming, effects and so on. Really awful. Foisting this on the public was a crime.Find Bradbury's short story and enjoy the movie in your head and don't pollute your mind with this Peter Hyam's wreck. He owes an apology and money back to everyone who paid to see it. Seriously. If ever a movie was worth filing a class action suit, this is it? Did anyone at the studio watch this abomination before it was released?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, this is bad","review":"You have to wonder what Ben Kingsley, Edward Burns, and Catherine McCormack did to wind up in this excuse for a sci-fi romp. Based, barely, on the acclaimed Ray Bradbury short story, A Sound of Thunder follows a time travel mishap that leads to an alteration of evolution on Earth, which proves to be very bad for a time safari leader (Burns) and his crew, who find themselves neck deep in screwy-evolution, mixed up uber-beasts. It's a glorified B-movie all the way, but the sad part is that A Sound of Thunder isn't even fun to watch. The acting is terrible, with Burns acting like a cardboard cutout and Kingsley sleepwalking, but then again, the twitchy script doesn't really help them out much. Not to mention that the CGI monster effects are deliriously bad, and when you see them, you'll think your watching a Sci-Fi Channel original movie. But hey, what else would you expect from Peter Hyams; the same guy who brought us schlock like End of Days and Timecop? Avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY ENTERTAINING","review":"I received the movie in the mail today, ordering it as a family member told me it was real good. I feel that most reviewers were very critical on this movie. As a scifi fan, I for one appreciated the movie. kind of a \\"what if\\" type scifi creature flick. A warning that we shouldn't interfere with the way things are. A few politicians should watch this movie. Maybe a subtle warning would finally sink in! I've watched a few of The SciFi Channels movies, and believe me, anything would be an improvement. I guess this is one of those movies that you like, or don't like. I for one thought it was worth the money! I only wish that like most movies, it would be available in full screen.

This movie hurt to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"The more you think about it, the worse it gets","review":"Don't you hate movies that punish you for paying attention? The problem here isn't that the movie isn't \\"scientifically accurate\\" (in science fiction, it's perfectly acceptable for the science to be fictious). It's not even that the special effects are poor, or that the acting is cheesy (there's plenty of classic sci-fi that feature both bad effects and bad acting, but still somehow work). No, the problem here is that good speculative fiction still needs some level of internal logic. The script for this film utterly lacks that.It must also be noted that this is a truly sub-par DVD as well. There are no special features unless you count the two theatrical trailers. Rent it if you must, but do not buy this disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"As bad as it gets....","review":"This movie is trash. Taking a wonderful and profound work of Ray Bradbury and turning it into this muck...unforgivable.The acting? Atrocious. It was even to bad to be comical. It was almost as if the actor's had signed up to do it years ago, and were resentful of having to now take time out and do it.And what in the H was Ben Kingsly doing in this?! Good god. He is a huge talent...what was the behind this? Who knows! Just don't watch it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow. This movie sucked","review":"What else to write other than it sucked? The \\"special effects\\" (there was absolutely nothing special about them) were so cheesy that at times I realized I wasn't even paying attention to the dialogue. But that didn't really matter. The dialogue almost sucked as much as the effects. I honestly don't know if I've seen Ed Burns act any better though. Of course, he sucked as well. He's a horrible actor. Everything I've seen of him is horrible.I liked this film for one reason - Ben Kingsley. I like seeing actors of such high caliber showing off their bad acting skills as adept as their good performances. Granted, it's not Ben's fault. He didn't have much to work with. Just a sleezy soul patch. It's his agent's fault, I imagine for getting him this part. I'll anxiously await the next 'Sexy Beast' film from this legend.

The scenes in the forest are a clear antecedent to those writers in the 20th century working the magic realism vein. Above and beyond all of this though is the magnificent use of language to create atmosphere and brilliantly delineated characters. It's a gorgeous book ; the effect as rich as a Gauguin painting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, It Could Have Been Worse","review":"I love Hawthorne. But of all his novels, I like this one the least. It lacks the swift action of \\"Fanshawe\\" (1828), the memorable characters of \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" (1850), the suspense and deep psychological insights of \\"The House of the Seven Gables\\" (1851), or the images of \\"The Marble Faun\\" (1860). I would not make time to read this. But then it is not quite a flop either. There is some interesting interaction amongst the characters. Also, Hawthorne does give us an important message about the hypocrisy behind utopia."},{"rating":"2","title":"It grows on you.

I enjoyed picking out all my friends' favorite animals and dressing them up. This book features two kinds of stuffed animals: doll-style (upright with an animal head) and animal-style (more realisticly posed). Both are very cute, and the doll-style patterns include clothing. There is a good variety of projects ranging from cats and pigs to lions and roosters. I would rate the patterns at a medium skill level, since some of the pieces are a little tricky to fit together, and they call for plastic doll joints in the arms, legs, and head. I wish the book had color pictures - the black-and-white ones do not show much detail. Overall, though, this book offers nicely designed patterns with clear instructions.

Plastic gear was worn where it constantly rotates against the metal frame. I really expected it to last until at least the beater eject button stopped working.

There is a constant undercurrent of disdain (and sometimes outright contempt) for all \\"civilians,\\" i.e., non-actors, even those of us who were once young and foolish enough to consider ourselves Dillman fans. The general mood of regret over the path his career has taken severely undercut the wry humor of some of the anecdotes. Mr. Dillman's personal life has clearly been much more fulfilling and I'm glad for him, but frankly, I wish I hadn't read his book and gotten to know him better as the rather disappointed person he seems to be.

It was dull when I first used it and the sinew of the meat wound up in the blade causing it to clog and not cut the meat. I sharpened the blade with a Tool and Cutter Grinder that Machinists use for sharpening metal cutting tools. It worked for a while but then went dull again.

The problem is that the connective tissue in the meat is getting stuck on the blade. I even had the meat half frozen like it suggested and it still got bound up. I started out with the largest size hole plate and no luck. I am so frustrated in the time it takes to clean it off just and get it going again.

This grinder is awful. I tried grinding meat for meatloaf, was meticulous in trimming meat of most fat and used very cold (but not frozen) meat. After a minute, the meat began to look like pate. It was mush. I pulled the grinder apart and found the meat all stuck in the holes of the grinder. I then tried the coarse blade. Same thing, I had to clean the grinder often and I do not like the quality of the grind. The manual said to put it through twice so I took what I did with the coarse blade to put it through a second time. If I wanted to make a meat mousse it would have been perfect. I hate this grinder and would never recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meat gets clogged? Easy solution...","review":"I LOVE my Kitchenaid mixer and the grinder attachment to it.Grinds everything perfectly fine!To anyone saying that meat or fat gets wound around the blade and clogs the holes, there's an easy solution.Cut your meat into pieces and freeze in a single or 2 layers for 30-40 minutes. Meat frozen to medium hardness gets through this grinder in no time."},{"rating":"1","title":"It ruined the turkey on the very first try","review":"Wish you could see the picture of gray gook on the turkey breast meat, but it could not upload here. Towards the end of grinding one pound cubed meat, it no longer came out thru the holes on the metal plate, instead it oozed between the screw-on ring and metal plate, with the gray (oil or metal shavings?). Although the turkey was very lean and well trimmed, any sinew present wrapped around the blade so that it no longer sliced well. The only reason for this purchase is because I used one at a friend's house and it was perfect.

The best thing that I could say about it is that it is possible to grind a pound of ground meat as long as you have two people and at least an hour to spare.It took 40 minutes to grind it and we had to take it apart and clean it three times. Any silver skin, tendon or fat immediately clogs the grinder.Even with already ground meat, it is excruciatingly slow.It would be one thing if it came free with the Kitchen Aid. It does not.We also got the black grease in the meat that has been often commented on. Finally, we can hear the motor straining and I'm quite sure that if we were to grind another five pounds of meat it would burn the motor out.The cutter is not sharp, at all. It's a joke actually.

After calling a very helpful lady at customer service, she said this can happen when the blades are new and that it's better if the food you are grinding is very cold, or slightly frozen.

I have an ancient manual meat grinder like your grandmother had and I still use that for all my grinding. I've tried on two occasions to use this grinder/stuffer and it takes FOREVER! The blade on the grinder is stamped junk, the plates are the same and neither are sharp. It will almost instantly plug up with sinew and will barely push meat out as you try to stuff it in the top with the plunger. It's a lesson in frustration at best. Even if you have all your meat ground and mixed and are just trying to use the auger and sausage tip to stuff casings it is painfully slow. Don't bother, move along, don't waste your money. Buy an old cast iron hand grinder for $5 at a tag sale and buy a real sausage stuffer.

The center plastic screw/metal rod assembly comes apart. Other reviews noting \\"grey metal deposits\\" at the center are correct. Use a wrench to unscrew the center mount and you will find dark machine oil on the threads and in the center shaft. The oil will ooze out between small gaps seemingly from nowhere. I cleaned it 3 times but oil is still escaping from deep within. Test it with boiled white potato and watch the center of the grinder dump oil into the food. KitchenAid tech support suggested the copper bearing at the back was overheating (wrong location and wrong diagnosis) and leaking oil.

Don't Buy","review":"Attempting to use this product was so frustrating that I almost threw the entire mixer across kitchen. I attempted to use it 3 times with 3 different cuts of meat. I followed the instructions and partially froze the meat. The slightest amount of fat instantly wraps around cutting blade instead of getting cut. This blocks the meat from going through the grinder. Un-jamming takes about a minute and needs to be done every minute or so of use. Pork butt is impossible to grind. Lean beef and chicken did eventually grind, but it was more of a mush consistancy than ground (yes, I used the attachment with large holes).Every time I used it I did notice that parts of the meat were turning brown. I assumed that it was from the meat being pulverized to the point where it actually started cooking. Then I read the other reviews which assume that it is metal dust from the cheap blade(entirely possible).I recieved this thing as a gift, it is getting thrown away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as expected","review":"I bought this in a knee-jerk reaction to the 'pink slime' news and it was a good idea even so. I tried it for the first time yesterday grinding about three pounds of round roast and it did a good job. The grill part did get clogged near the end of the first grind, but that was due to a normal build-up of the tougher parts of the meat. BTW, I did trim off the obvious outer layer of fat before I got started. After the first grind I dismantled it and cleared out the blocked meat and did the second grind without any more blockage. I separated out three patties for dinner tonight, and then mixed the remaining with ground pork for meatballs. I don't think it's worth the trouble (to clean up) grinding less than three pounds. The build quality is very good and it looks like it should provide good occasional service for years to come.

Don't over feed it, it's prone to bottle neck and nothing gets to the worm. Wait to you see the piece of meat cleared and it will go a lot faster than forcing it through.

Unfortunately, I was not very happy with it. First off, all meat was chilled in the freezer so it would be more firm. It was okay in grinding the deer meat. However, if I ground beef chuck to add to the deer meat, it did not do well at all. I was very diligent in removing any sinew/silver skin from the chuck, but it still clogged the grinder. Additionally, the grinder regularly put out gray/silver metal findings that others have complained about. I did not find this acceptable. By the way, I have to chuckle about the directions that say to freeze the metal blade before grinding. Seriously, how long do you think you have to grind meat before the \\"chilled\\" blade warms up. I returned this for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk. Plain and simple.","review":"No meat grinder should be made with a plastic housing. The housing cracks after a few uses.

It performs reasonably well - unless using the grinder or making bread dough. Initially I used the \\"grinder\\" attachment for extruding spaghetti as advertized. This didn't work. The motor started to labor and smoke. I tried making my dough softer, but this was vastly less than ideal. I figured it would work for meat grinding with the metal screen and knife since the machine wasn't laboring. I was wrong. The body of the grinder barrel fractured in 2 pieces under the stress of the meat and torque of the motor. I didn't hit a bone. Perhaps it was too cold, and the plastic was brittle. I suppose the attachment could be used for something, but processing chilled meat in a cool environment should not be a consideration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad","review":"The food grinder works well in a pinch. I have a LEM meat grinder which works much better, but I was glad I had this available when the blade broke and I needed to finish a job. I found that the plunger was easier to use when rubbed down with some olive oil. The motor doesn't pull the meat through for me, so the plunger is a must. It does help to have the meat really cold too. It's cheap and an attachment, not a full blown grinder machine, so don't expect it to be a work horse, but with patience it will get the job done."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is great and works well.","review":"After learning that our ground beef can be a mixture from several country's, we decided to try grinding our own meat.I read the reviews for this product and was not sure that I would like it since so many reviews had issues with the cleaning of the grinder.But, I found that the whole thing is designed to be taken apart, and the worm is completely removable with little effort. In fact, in the manual there are directions for inserting a metal strainer over the worm. To do so requires that you take the entire attachment apart.I have no idea where metal flakes or any grease would have come from. Maybe it was an older model? I would recommend it, and encourage anyone who is disturbed by the stories we hear about the ground meat we purchase in the stores to use this at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for meat but not tendon","review":"This grinder works well for grinding beef and makes great meat balls.The only complain is the tendon from the beef chunks stuck the holes and I need to remove the blades several times to complete the grinding.Also, the applicator is not the wooden one as shown in the photo anymore.

I looked closely at the plate, noticed a difference in the two sides, cleaned and switched to the \\"different\\" side. Continued grinding the chicken, same thing. Now both sides of the plate are the same. I wasn't that impressed with the pureer years ago, I'm beyond disappointed in the grinder!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pink Slime?

STEAK burger and Italian Steak Balls... MEAT... it's amazing. This tool works HARD too, a real work horse! After it grinds your meat to perfection (as well as grain or nuts if you wish), it comes apart like a breeze, can be washed and sterilized, and goes back together easier than a pre-school puzzle.

After removing the grinder attachment twice, I finally had to chop the apples into very small pieces to get the thing to work.

I exchanged the food grinder only to have the same problem. Kitchenaid sent a new housing and it also does not fit properly. On one occasion my mixer fell over because the food grinder and mixer did not fit together properly. Kitchenaid is now sending me a new mixer. Hopefully this will resolve the problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gray ooze in my Ground Beef - Do Not Buy!","review":"I wish I had heeded the advice of the other reviewers. I used the Grinder attachment one time to grind some sirloin and chuck for beef jerky. However, after about five minutes, all the ground beef coming out of the attachment was contaiminated with a greasy gray ooze coming from the center of the grinder plate assembly. I don't care if this is food-safe grease, it is very unattractive and has no place in anything that I want to eat.Irrespective of the grease in my food, I guess the grinder worked OK. It made a mess, and juices from the beef squirted all over the kitchen, but I could deal with that better than contaimination in my food. Overall, this is a pretty flimsy piece of equipment and is VERY hard to clean as well.Do not buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"not a commercial grinder","review":"I bought this one for my DH. He has been really happy with it, but I should say this is not a commercial food grinder that you will be able to grind up 90 lbs of meat at a time without any babying. The first time we used it, we learned quickly that any of the white connective tissue will clog the grinding plates. For our home use, making a little bit of ground meat here and there, this works great.

I was interested in making my own sausages.The grinder emulsified a pork shoulder. Even when I trimmed the fat and silver skin off (and nearly freezing the meat), the blade kept getting clogged from whatever marbled fat that was in the meat. It made the motor bog and run very hot (Artisan model). There were also some odd deposits in the meat coming from the grinder (others complain about this too).Basically, if you are somewhat serious about making sausages or ground meat in batches larger than 2 lbs., save a little more and buy a quality meat grinder and seperate stuffer. This attachment will only frustrate you and possibly kill off your very expensive mixer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metal dust in food","review":"1-star only because 0-star is not an option.

Yes, you will find metal particles in your ground meat. I guess, people who have not complained about this issue and rated the product 5-star haven't observed their ground meat carefully enough or their problem is less severe. But, the problem defintely exists. In fact, I did not notice the problem for first couple of uses. I can't imagine how this is an isolated incident, when so many people have faced the same problem.

I've found that you can't stuff the grinder full of meat or the mixer motor begins to bog down pretty badly. I have the Kitchenaid Pro-line version of the mixer, not the lower powered mixer. If you're going to be using the lower end model, make sure you don't overwork the unit.Usually, I need to cube the meat and only feed a few pieces at a time. Still, it gives a nice consistant grind and is easy to clean up when I'm done.When I make cranberry/orange relish, the grinder does a good job of keeping the juice where it belongs and not leaking all over like the old mechanical grinder I used to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"DANGEROUS METAL PARTICLES","review":"The metal parts of this product are shoddily made of inadequate materials.

It grinds OK, but when you're finished, there is always some meat caught between the blade and the disc. The blade doesn't seem to hold its' sharpness. But the most frustrating problem is that both the feed shaft and the housing are made of molded plastic on metal. After relatively little use, the plastic begins to crack and break away from the metal. Since this is used for grinding meat, the cracks make it extreamly hard to clean. I recommend against this accessory and suggest finding a seperate all metal meat grinder (which I am in the process of doing)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it used to be","review":"We replaced our food grinder after 15 years of hard use.

Unfortunately, I experienced the well-documented problem of dark grey meat extruding from the center hole of the grinder- very, very unappetizing. Did try a lower speed, tightened the ring very loosely, and cleaned the grinder thoroughly; none of these strategies prevented the greyness. So, I will reluctantly return the item. Other than the greyness, it was effective at grinding meat. Since I don't grind large quantities of meat at a time, I'll use a food processor for future meat grinding, which works pretty well based on my limited experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Durability","review":"I was able to only grind about 40 pounds of meat before this thing broke.

They are well made and give your foot plenty of support where it is needed. You'll notice they mostly come in colors suitable for nurses, but I am not a nurse, so I wear the black ones and sometimes children see my feet in bathroom stalls and think a man is there!

His adventures vary from the many runaways, to his cleverness with chores (the whitewashing of the fence) and the chilling witness of a murder. His many experiences, have aided his transition from an immature boy, to a well versed, developed young man. Many lessons can be learned from this classic tale. Through his actions Tom displays an enviable character who has no regard for rules and society.

I was wrong.I wanted my son to read some of the classic adventures, which The Adventures of Tom Sawyer clearly qualifies. I was hoping it would be an easier read, with vocabulary that a most modern day kids could understand. I read the 1st few chapters only to be disappointed. I knew right away this \\"new edition\\" would not register well with a middle school aged child.A fabulous story but not a good read for the younger generation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quality binding","review":"Really poorly bound, or maybe the pages just aren't cut properly. In any case when the book is closed, on the long edge the pages are not flush and even. I don't think the book will fall apart, but it just seems sloppy. Also there are distracting 'notes' throughout the book. These explain some of the 'old fashioned' terms used, but I think are unnecessary and certainly not part of the original work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom Saywer, the best book ever and a must read!!","review":"The book Tom Saywer is a book about a boy who hates to read, hates school, and hates all work but, is a very ittelligent boy.

I think it is cool that this book is written in old country style lingo. It kind of makes you feel that you live in those times and spoke that type of English. This book covers some kid's dream of having adventures. What can't Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn do in this book? I mean, running away and becoming pirates, then come back and walk into their own funeral, what kind of kid actually does that? Only Tom Sawyer and his friends can. I liked this book because I like adventure books. I recommend this book to all the people who are reading this review right now. It is one of those books that are classics and reading it is a must. This book is 319 pages of pure literature gold. So, read this book, and enjoy another literacy classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mark's Tom","review":"I read this book back to back with The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. It would be easy to compare and contrast the two stories, as they stand alone as novels in writing style but overlap slightly in story line. One similarity of both novels is neither seems to have a plot, as though the novel is merely made up as a series of stories. That is, until the final crescendo, which ties up all the loose ends of the earlier exploits.In Tom Sawyer I found what may well be the most animated character I've ever read. His energy was contagious; his adventures left me anticipating each turned page; his friendships made me envious to not grow up on his street. I found him deeply imaginitive, intellegent, sincere and ideal. I felt I earned insight into boys lives from reading his pages.I would read this book again and again, just to get to know Tom better."},{"rating":"2","title":"PRMARK review-izzle","review":"I really enjoyed Tom Sawyer. When compared to Huck Finn, on the other hand, it failed in comparison. Tom Sawyer seemed to be much more of just a story, with no real moral or theme behind it. It was just a tale of two boys adventures. But it was still very descriptive and well-written. It was a quick read and a fun story, something that anyone can read and enjoy. It had alot of action and adventure, which made it fun to read, and not hard to get through. I recommend Tom Sawyer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom's Adventures","review":"Tom Sawyer is an excellent classic that I think everyone should read. No matter what your age, this book is inspiring to everyone who reads it. It brings back childhood memories for the adults, and is applicable to every kid's life. Tom is an energetic boy from the early 1800's of about 13. He is forever searching for trouble, and he nearly always succeds. Join Tom, his best friends Huck Finn and Joe Harper, along with his new girlfriend Becky as they find themselves witnessing a murder, deserted on an island, and lost for days in an immense cave. This book isn't one where you can just go on living without ever reading it all the way through.

The main thing that happens is the murder of Dr. Robbinson. Also tom has many schemes and tricks. But a lot of Tom's attention is drawn to Becky Thatcher.All I learned is that Tom is a average boy who just wants to have fun all day. All though he's not a great exampkle for kids.

If you have to read a book about mindless adventures, scheming, and with a boneless plot and a style that rambles on and on and gives away about a million plot details prematurely to boot, I suggest you search for something else. It isn't even funny. Not a bit.What is it about this book that attracts people so much and makes it a regular staple of school reading lists? The language? The characters?

In takes place in the 1840's in Hannibal, Missouri, where it tells about a teenager (about the age of 12,13), wher he gets in LOTS of trouble. It starts out, with Tom just a normal kid, who teases, and pushes around kids, until he sees Becky Thatcher, the girl of his dreams. He had tons of dreams about her, and once in the story, they got engaged. But soon, when he met up with Huck Finn, they go to the graveyard, where a mysterious thing happens. I said this book, is funny because of what Tom does (pushes kids, grabs hair, etc). And I said this book was mean, because of what happens at the graveyard (read it to find out). I give this book 5 stars, and from a scale of 1-10, I give this a 9.5. So when you're sitting around the house doing nothin', go somewhere, and read The Adventures Of Tom Sawyer, by Mark Twain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This book was very good!

Everything a classic should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun adventure story for both children and adults","review":"\\"Tom Sawyer\\" is a fun book. Good story, great writing (of course -- it's by Twain). And it's not just for kids. Twain says in his intro that he wrote the book not only for children, but also for adults, to help them remember how they acted and thought as children. Although there are very, very few readers who ever acted as Tom Sawyer does, the story still works. Heck, it doesn't even matter that it is not entirely believable, because the reader is having too much fun following the adventure. And although it is not a \\"deep\\" book, Twain still manages to insert the occasional Twain-ish penetrating insights into human nature. It doesn't matter how old you are: If you've never read it, go for it and have some fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"loved the book, would not be his best book in my opinion, great read, have read most of this author's books"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom Sawyer review","review":"This book was just as advertised.

Three times in a row, just to make sure that I had gotten everything out of it that I should have.Twain is brilliant, witty and wise in all of his novels and this is no exception. Tom seems to possess all the most intriguing, loveable, foolhardy and frustrating qualities of boyhood, rolled into one skinny body full of opinions. Becky, as well, encapsulates the wildly disparate characteristics of girls that drive boys to distraction.It's a romp; it's a lark; and it's good literature all done up in a neat, little package.Please read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU GOT TOO READ THIS REVIEW","review":"This book is about two kids that wittnessed a killing and the guys injun joe and two more guyes and they dug up a dead body and found a map that lead to the gold.

I do not stand alone here, most of my friends and most of the other reviewers agree with me. I do not recommend this book unless you enjoy the mostly-made-up adventures of young boys who enjoy playing with dead rats on strings. This probably won't be a very helpful review, will it? I do recommend it though if for some reason you feel the need to read every single book which is considered \\"classic\\" literature.

The dough hook actually comes in handy to mix ingredients for meatloaf! The only downfall I have ever experienced with this mixer is the fact you frequently have to raise the mixer to make sure all ingredients in the bottom are blended. This was my \\"saving grace\\" at Christmas time baking so many different types of cookies and quick breads! I do not have any of the attachments for it except the splatter shield (a must have,) and the chute (another smart investment). The wire whip makes whipping up home made cheese cake a breeze!

It's a great product.It's unfair to blame K.A. stand mixers for consumer errorsand lack of common sense.Knowing how to handle doughs is imperative. Abusing small appliances leads to false evaluation.I bake bread three times a week using a breadmachine dough cycle, then ovenbake. For anyone baking bread as often as I,use a reliable breadmachine, such as the Zojirushi V-20 or Williams-Sonoma or Breadman Ultimate.I have complete faith in Kitchen Aid products."},{"rating":"1","title":"over priced for the quality","review":"I have owned my mixer for 14 months and it quit on Thanksgiving Day. For the price, the quality doesn't match. I found out it has a nylon gear in the beater gear system and that gear was stripped, therefore the mixer would run but not rotate the beaters. They would not cover it under the warranty because it was 2 months over, neither would they sell you the nylon gear alone, but you have to buy the stack assembly of gears (...). If it only lasts a year this is not a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"go for a more powerful version!","review":"I bought this when my friend took back her 5 qt. Ultra that I had on long-term loan. I had become dependent on the thing, you see! Alas, I could only afford the 250 Watt, 4 1/2 Cup version. What a disappointment!!! It barely holds a single small batch of cookie or bread dough, overheating & straining with that. Also, don't bother with buying a pour shield- Something about the shape of the 4 1/2 qt. mixing bowl sends everything up & out, unlike the bigger bowl on the more powerful version. (The pour shield is engineered with openings along the edge which allow the flour or liquids to still gush all over.) The mixing paddles & what-not don't mix the entire bowl on this version, either, so you have to do a bunch of stopping & scraping the sides which is unecessary with the bigger one.

I called KitchenAid to find out what was going on and was told that the oil is harmless, and that I should use my mixer more often. HUH?? I asked about repairing the leak and was told that they all do it, if you don't use them enough! As for reparing it, well that could be as much as $125.00.

I never mixed more than two loaves at a time although the manual says it can handle 3 3/4 loaves. Luckily this time I was able to bring it back and get a refund. These mixers are junk!!!

Being on a student family budget, it was a big purchase for us! After hearing so many great things and reading 5 star reviews, I think I must have really gotten a dud. I will say that it is so nice to have an electric stand mixer. However, ours has given us a lot of problems every time I pull it out. Motor oil leaking into the food? Check. Bowl doesn't fit into the base? Check. When bowl finally gets into place, it won't ever come out without a strong man around? Check. Speeds up and slows down without being touched? Check. Doesn't handle bread dough very well? Check.I cannot use this without my husband around to help me get the bowl in and out. I have to watch carefully for leaking oil. I have to cut many recipes in half because it it too small and weak to handle them. I have found myself pulling out my hand mixer anytime I can get away with NOT using this. We should have held out for a better one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE my kitchenaid","review":"I LOVE my kitchenaid.

Make sure to get the accessories, because you will use them. Durable in a variety of sizes and colors, this is a must have for any kitchen.

I told her I bought one and exchanged it twice before returning it for good. All of them had gear problems.My ex-wire had one for 15 years without a hiccup. KitchenAid has changed hands and the bean counters figured a way to make more profit by issuing a dozen confusing models and stuffing them with plastic insides. Takes a real idiot to ruin a KitchenAid mixer.If you to www.kitchenaid.com and compare the various mixers you'll see than only the Accolade and the professional mixers have metal gears. A good mixer should have hard, well-machined metal gears. Some of the kitchenaid mixers have metal gears but there are complaints all over the net saying the metal gears are cheaply made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my mother's KitchenAid","review":"My mother, grandmother, and aunts have all owned their KitchenAid mixers for over 30 years. Even with frequent use, not one of them has experienced any sort of mechanical problem. So, I was delighted to receive what I thought would be a mixer that would last me a lifetime. My classic appeared to be a workhorse - never straining, reliable. Less than 2 years later, with perhaps monthly use for relatively light-moderate tasks (no breads), my mixer made a few loud sounds and then lost all speeds except stir and 10.Upon researching, I discovered that Whirlpool changed the materials used to make the mixer when they took over. Initially, gears were made of plastic. Next (I suspect due to complaints), KA advertised \\"all metal gears\\" yet held those gears together with a piece of plastic prone to breaking. As of April 2007, some models are reportedly made with all-metal construction; however, KA apparently makes no promises because old stock may still be on shelves."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful addition to the kitchen","review":"I bought my daughter this mixer about a year ago.

The manual says that I would have to knead for about 8-10 minutes, but this thing is so awesome that it only takes like 5 minutes. The only thing I don't like too much is that I have to scrape the sides of the bowl after a few minutes of kneading.

I did that with all three books, but I think at the end I just read them to find out how the story would end, and not because I was caught up in it as used to happen with her other books.

It was more like watching things happening. People talking. Doing things. But there was no passion or anything. The romantic relationship and the plot were not really write well together.

The story line of the ghost inhabiting Hayley could have been taken directly from the Trilogy of Three Sisters Island, just substitute evil force with Amelia. This trilogy seemed to be more \\"microwave\\" than true creating by the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nora Roberts is awesome!","review":"This trilogy was great. The character development is engaging and thorough. I felt as I always do that I know these people by the time I finish reading the book. Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as quick of a read...","review":"as I expected. Since I breezed through the first two books, this book dragged. It was very interesting and I love the surprise at the end, but I didn't care for the way the characters were left at the end. I wish Roberts would have gone on a little. It was a somewhat abrupt ending. I did like and very much enjoyed the series and plan to read more books by Roberts in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Red Lily","review":"The story was slow, predictable and boring. I am still amazed I hung in there and finished reading it. It's a dud in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Red Lily, a perfect ending to another great trilogy from Nora Roberts!","review":"Nora Roberts once again makes you feel as you are a part of the story. Her writing takes you deep into each character until you feel you have met them all personally. Just like Nora....you cannot put it down once you start reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pretty Good Book!!","review":"This is the conclusion of the Trilogy. It tells the story of Hayley Phillips, a young mother who came to Memphis to start a new life. What she finds is a new job, a beautiful home she shares with her distant cousin Roz and some new best friends. What she didn't count on was falling in love with Roz's son Harper. She also didn't count on being possessed by the family ghost. Through the many interactions with Amelia they find out what happened to her and they finally put her to rest. This was a pretty good book . The only thing I didn't like about this trilogy was the gardening descriptions which really bored me. I skipped those parts. Even though I did skip those parts I still liked it!! So it didn't keep me from enjoying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Disappointment","review":"This was the final book from the \`In the Garden' trilogy and focused on the romance between Harper and Hailey. We all knew this match was forthcoming, but it was a major disappointment; Harper and Hailey were not particularly romantic together. It seemed, at least to me, that most of the book was focused on the Harper Ghost and Hailey's daughter, Lily. Although Harper and Hailey do \`get together' in this book, most of the groundwork for their romance comes from the first two books. Aside from being pretty skimpy in terms of romance, this book was flat-out unbelievable. Hailey is \`inhabited' by the Harper ghost during odd moments (like while having sex), and it was just too surreal to even make it good fiction. The entire trilogy was weak and I wouldn't recommend this book. I only finished it because I had read the first two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super fast!!","review":"This was the last book of a trilogy that I absolutely LOVED!! The delivery was fast and the quality was excellent. I will do it again. Thank You!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book wasn't for me","review":"This book was part of a different series that my mom also likes. And that's why I bought it for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"This trilogy is fabulous if you enjoy Norah Roberts. She is an entertainng writer who is easy to read and enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not excellent","review":"I came away from this conclusion to Roberts' \\"In the Garden\\" trilogy a bit disappointed, but satisfied overall. There was just a bit too much of the stereotypical ghost behavior, although I was quite pleased at the different approach from the other two novels. The characters remain sympathetic and likable, although I think Hayley is just a bit too sicky sweet for my taste. The chemistry remains light and easy. The dénouement was a tiny bit anticlimactic, but the drama and excitement beforehand made up for it somewhat.All in all, a fitting end to an excellent trilogy by an author who rarely lets her readers down. While not one of Roberts' strongest series, it is quite enjoyable and memorable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disapointing","review":"I have never felt compelled to write a book review before, but certain aspects of this book are quite disapointing.Without giving away the entire plot of the book, Roberts completely sidesteps a huge moral issue. It is an important enough plot point that the rest of the book and the two earlier books in the trilogy now ring false.Additionally, the dialogue is ridiculous. Roberts has become so mannered with her character's dialogue that the book is full of one word sentences. I'm not sure how she expects that writing style to further the theme of the novel, but it is quite unsuccessful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ebook","review":"This book was the third book in the garden trilogy. It was a good book to end the trilogy. I enjoyed all three books. Nora Roberts is a good writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Nora Roberts book","review":"I was disappointed.

I reccomend this book to romance lovers andthose interested in a good ghost story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Red Lily Great Ending!!","review":"When I bought the In the Garden Trilogy, and started with Blue Dahlia, It took me awhile to get into. Usually when reading Nora the first chapter starts a frenzy of reading for me. But after I got acquainted with all of the characters I really fell in love with it. Blue Dahlia, and Black Rose were great, but my favorite of the series was Red Lily. I love the characters Hayley and Harper, they had chemistry from the first encounter in the first book. I love the way their relationship develops. All in all this was a stunning series, as always, and I enjoyed reading it very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Red Lily","review":"I rate the third book in Nora Robert's Garden Trilogy as a 4-star very good Romance novel. It has the momentum that good character and tense plot bring to a \\"good read\\" so that I didn't want to put the book down until I finished reading it. I found the denouement a bit weak at the end--the story seemed to stop in its tracks and that's they only reason I didn't give it five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"So this is Nora Roberts . . .","review":"This was my first Nora Roberts and one of the only books I never finished. After several chapters, nothing had happened. No suspense was developed. Just page after page of aimless dialogue among a cast of cookie-cutter romance characters. Only the heroine had a personality - one so insipid and self-absorbed that I began to hope the dreaded ghost would get her. But even the supernatural failed to pump any energy into this listless story. I really wanted to like the author because she has so many books available, but if this is typical of her writing, I'm baffled by her popularity."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star","review":"I didn't really like Red Lily. Even less then I disliked Blue Dahlia. I don't know what it was about this book but I just didn't find myself connecting with charactors Hayley and Harper were okay but not very memerable. The ghost story wasn't very exciting and I didn't care for the conclusion. I guess this just wasn't my cup of tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"its vegan and yummy","review":"I am not diabetic but was looking for a cook book that had recipes that were low on the glycemic index. This is an awesome book for beginning vegetarians (like me) who want healthy recipes without a lot of ingredients. I also like this book because it has recipes for a lot of foods I want to keep eating like french toast. I highly recommend this book. It is also a great way to eat if you want to lose weight. In the first two weeks of eating whole vegetarian foods I lost 5 lbs and my partner lost 8 lbs."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disapointment.","review":"Expeected more from this cookbook.

The description is a bit misleading, and neglects to emphasize this. I've made one extremely disappointing recipe, and doubt I'll be tempted to try much else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Readable and relevant","review":"Very well written with some wisdom from the 1830's that directly bears on recent economic difficulties. Balzac's country doctor describes in detail how he worked to improve the overall good of his community; the narrative is clear and readable without being preachy. The characters and their motivations are believable and I was engaged until the end. Depictions of moral and right behavior, responsibility for others, redemption, and spiritual strength resulted in a satisfying read. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating story, surprise ending","review":"I wanted to read some books that reflected french culture.

I put the flat noodle plate in and 40 minutes later, I still did not have decent noodles. The holes in the plate are too narrow for the dough to pass through without overtaxing the motor on the mixer. It got very hot.

I also have the roto slicer/shredder, fruit/veggie strainer, food grinder & sausage stuffer attachments...none of these have even made my stand mixer very warm. --That tells me the pasta maker attachment is a bad product. I am thankful that my model is 525 watts...I could only imagine what would have happened if I had a classic 300 watt model!My best advice is to pick up an inexpensive pasta machine or an Emperia hand crank pasta machine. They run between $20-40 without a motor or $80-120 with a motor (that you can also buy separately for $50-80). --A very small price to pay, if you want to keep your KitchenAid Stand Mixer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Even if you already own the food grinder don't waste your money on the pasta attachment. Since this is more of an extrusion pasta maker, the pasta does not get the nice thin texture that is necessary in fresh pasta. I made lasagna noodles from this attachment and had to roll out every noodle by hand after it had been extruded because it wasn't thin enough.If you love fresh pasta, as I do, you would be better off buying the actual stainless steel, traditional pasta roller attachment for your kitchen aid. It is more expensive, but well worth the extra money. I use this attachment all the time and always get the results that I am looking for.

With a solid rhythm team consisting of veteran's George Duvivier {bass} and Jo Jones {drums} present on most of the tracks, the music is rock solid. The presence of Roy Eldridge on trumpet and Sir Charles Thompson on piano are an added + contributing nicely to this well rounded and evenly balanced session.

It takes about 5 seconds to open any can and is easy to clean with a damp paper towel without removing it from the mixer though it comes off easier than any other attachment I have. It stands out much farther than I expected (about 4 inches) from the machine, but I suppose that this is so the can won't come near the bowl or shield.

It really only works sometimes on some cans and usually take several revolutions just like most electric can openers. It only gets worse with time just like most electric can openers. Far too often you are left with a lid you have to open the rest of the way with a manual can opener just like most electric can openers. It sticks out of the front of the kitchen aid like an ugly sore thumb unlike most can openers.I still find a good manual can openers to be far superior to any electric option.

I always have to pry it open with a fork or knife; some part of the lid is always attached to the sides of the can.I'm throwing mine in the garbage and buying a hand-held can opener again.

The grade level for this book would be about a Pre-school - Kindergarten book due to the lack of words and more pictures.

On watching it on DVD I wish I had viewed the whole when it first aired. It really sneaks up on you in subtle ways, and is very deep emotionally.

The characters are underdeveloped and I'm not engaged emotionally with them. The characters are at times aggravating, the \\"liberal pastor\\" is portrayed as more or less an atheist, the conservative wife does nothing except for cry and pray, the daughter is a waste of ink, and the bad guys are all minorities. Honestly, the only characters I liked were murdered off early on.The flow of the book is choppy. He seemed to jump forward in time and change perspective without notice from time to time. Some of the events aren't rationalized very well, leaving the reader to come to their own conclusions as to why they happened. I this may be the reason why some readers find the events unbelievable.As a sermon I didn't care for it much either.

Often, the component added spills or gets on the mixer.The rim of the bowl is too big as well. With the whisk attachment on the mixer, you cannot swing the top without hitting the rim.

It was up there with the 50 pounds of paprika I couldn't live without. I love my KA mixer, I think maybe I used this thing twice. It does work if you remember to drag out the step stool and deal with all the dross on top of the fridge, but I really think it's not worth the effort. I never had any trouble using it, but if you are like me, the counter gets flour on it anyway when you do the final kneading, so what's the problem. It's just one more thing to wash. Other than dry ingrediants, I can't think of what else you would use it for. It's cute, I'm trying to teach the cats to jump through it until I put it back up in the cupboard...that means I'd have to clear off the step stool again and climb up...maybe it belongs down cellar, that's easier.

I understand how much it costs, how long it takes, and the work that goes into it by all the departments.

Second, the shoot is not at a sharp enough angle for the ingredients (like dry flour) to slide down the shoot, leaving you shaking the already flimsily attached pouring shield to get the flour into the bowl.

With this book, Huxley acheives a subtlety of presentation that many authors will never achieve. He concisely summarises and presents the theological and spiritual fundaments of the major religions in a way that is accessible to the devoted reader. It has a very different feel to some of his other works like Brave New World and The Doors of Perception.

I was extremely nervous about it sticking, about it burning up the motor, about making a complete mess of my kitchen, and about wasting time. Granted I did have my husband helping me, but nevertheless I think it was way easier than others described it, and in the future I think I could do it myself (just turn off the mixer when you need to separate the noodles). You have to follow the instructions exactly-sift the flour, lay the noodles down to separate, etc. But otherwise after a couple of tries we got the hang of it right away.

A little way into the second batch, it started smoking.

But having had experiences with other forms, I found this to be a rather satisfying venture. DO NOT get your pasta too wet or you're destined to have a \\"Horrible\\" experience. Of course some sticking occured, but I simply pinched off those parts and threw them back in to get recycled. I also used a whole wheat pasta recipe, so I don't know if that made a difference. Clean up was a snap--I just let the dough dry on all the parts and it popped right off when I cleaned everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the roller attachments instead","review":"These dies make really thick pasta; there's no choice for things like lasagne or ravioli strips. The hollow/ziti/macaroni die really doesn't function, because when you cut the pasta off the die, it closes down one end. If you want it to be hollow, you have to use a toothpick to reopen every piece of pasta. Who's going to do that? Something similar happens with the spaghetti/fettucini dies--once cut with a knife, they all stick together. I recommend the roller option. I love that one! It works like a dream; really, it's incredible how fast it works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets a bad rap","review":"I have to say that I was a bit sketchy on this product after reading other reviews. I'm glad I bought it anyway. One major key to using this attachment successfully is the dough consistency. Dryer is better - but not too dry. You'll get the hang of it after a couple tries. I do recommend making pasta with another person as another set of hands will come in handy.

HOWEVER, this particular attachment is not worthy of purchase at all for any reason. I have followed the instructions to the n-th degree and have yet to extract any usable noodles from the attachment.

When I saw these on Amazon they appeared to be more of a splash cover for the Kitchenaid stand mixer bowls, the image appeared to have a hole in the center, thus I thought it would be like the bowl cover for my hand mixer bowl I ordered through the Pampered Chef. I thought the lid could be placed on the bowl and the beater could go through the center hole and thus prevent splashing. No such luck, no hole in the middle and even if I adapted it and cut the plastic away from the indented center, the blade would not turn as it should. So now I have lids to put on the bowl to keep dirt and dust out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WATCH FOR MILDEW, but otherwise wonderful!","review":"This is a great lid that seals the bowl with the attachments inside. But I recently opened it up after not using it for awhile and I discovered everything covered in mildew.

I loved the idea of having the option of both cordless or corded, but mainly wanted the freedom for cordless trimming, so I could make the mess outdoors. The trimmer fits nicely in the hand. Although I am able to trim my Affenpinscher's face and ear area to some extent, it doesn't quite get through some of her thick fur. I also attempted to trim my Norfolk Terrier's coat as well, but it wound up VERY uneven. I wound up resorting to scissors, which defeats the purpose of why I bought the trimmer in the first place.If you want a trimmer that basically is for a quick touch-up, this would be for you. The battery died quickly on me. I would say I didn't get more than 15 minutes of trimming time. I guess I'll have to revert back to my old corded trimmer.I highly recommend the Oster name.

Eric, a bisexual man, Michelle a very \\"promiscious girl\\" and Tracy the uppity rich girl, are all tied together in a plot that also includes Tracy's boyfriend Brandon. There are a lot of twists and turns, and never a dull moment. Sex, sex, sex, lies, murder, backstabbing and more steamy sex make for a very catchy storyline. The only problem was no one practiced safe sex in this novel, I think the author should have put in that they were using condoms, a condom is not mentoned in this story,and that is just plain old nasty!

Jams while scanning which causes you to lose your scan work. 7. More issues We are going to throw this printer away.

Unfortunately, the initial color and black cartridges ran out in no time and did so simultaneously (although I almost never need/want to make color prints). I purchased refills at my local Wal-Mart in June . . . but the Kodak 5500 printer refused to recognize these brand-new color and black cartridges upon installation, \\"reading\\" them as empty in the information screen and refusing to allow the machine to function. Well, I purchased a second set of refills, same place . . . managed to get two months of occasional printing from them (I'm not a daily nor a heavy user). Today = crisis; the black cartridge is showing on the readout as two-thirds full, however, all my efforts to print simple one-page letters turn out totally blank. Junk, junk, junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"peice of junk - dont buy it","review":"this printer is probably the worst purchase I have made. It always says the paper tray is out of paper when its not, you have to just push the ok button anyway to get it to print. the scanner always scans a 8.5x11 sheet at 8.5 x 14 with a big bright green band in the space between 11 inches and 14 inches. I bought it because the ink was supposed to cheap, but it runs out of ink all so quickly. And then it just stops printing way before there is any visible lack of ink in the prints, it just says ink low and I am not printing anymore untl you give kodak more money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst....","review":"Horrible printer. I have only had the printer for 6 months and the scanner won't allow me to print the files that I scan. Every time I try to open the All in One program, the kodak image locks up on my computer so I can't even get into the program to use the features. Now the ink won't print on the paper even after changing the cartridges. I have also tried to download the new program they offer to help with the problems it is having and I can't even do that. My computer is not that old so it is not the computer I am using. I have contacted Kodak and have spent numerous hours talking to there support center and nobody can help me.

Also there is no 64 bit version of the home software so i guess i don't get to use that...the system tray software just repeatedly pops up a window asking \\"Photo paper tray?\\" until you kill the process. also not terribly helpful.I also cannot update the software on this computer because it is connected over the network instead of through usb. very charming.Although it seems like a decent machine when it does work.

I have a HP Deskjet that is probably 10-15 years old that prints all my black and white documents just fine. I pulled the 5500 out to scan a document recently. That's all I need it for, so why in the world does the \\"all-in-one\\" demand that I refill the ink. It literally does not function without ink cartridges full of ink.

The whole reason for this printer was to reduce ink costs. The Kodak idea was to sell ink reservoirs and the print head remains in the printer. The problem with the concept is that the print heads wear out. Kodak, at the present time, does not sell replacement print heads. If you go through the laborious process of contacting customer service they will send you a new one along with some replacement ink \\"cartridges\\". They've done this for me 3 or 4 times. My question to them was why not sell the print heads as expendable supplies but they do not acknowledge that it is an expendable and don't have plans to sell them. I wanted to find out if, in fact, I would be saving money on ink if I had to buy the print heads.Saving money on ink would be the only reason to buy this printer.

Well, it will do NOTHING if you run out of ink. No scan, no fax. Yes, at midnight with a deadline approaching, if you run out of ink the thing turns into a giant paperweight.The software that comes with it hangs my computer during set up. There is a hack around this on their website - you have to run a tool to clean the registry. OK - software update available it says.

The plot is great. What isn't great is how verbose this book is in places, and how mind-numbingly dry it is in others. There were about ten places in this book where I thought I'd never finish a page, just because of how tedious the writing had gotten. It's a shame too, because as I said before the plot is tremendous, the setting unique and interesting, and three out of the four characters were very well fleshed out and intriguing. The character of Nikki, however, takes the sails out of this narrative...there was no reason why the author needed this character in the book. My other main grievance is - not enough attention was given to the German sniper...this book could have easily benefitted from taking about fifty pages worth of dull descriptions, histories, and chapters and devoting them to Thorvald.Dissapointing, to say the least.

Enemy at the Gates by William Craig, focuses on the whole battle of Stalingrad, from August 42' right up until the German POWs returned from Russia in the late forties. Craig only devotes about two pages to the Vassili - Konings duel while War of the Rats makes it the centerpiece of the story. Interesting side note: The Waffen SS never had any Major Konings in its records, so either he was made up by the Russian Propaganda, or the SS destroyed every trace of his existence to avoid embarrassement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't Put it Down!","review":"When I first picked up this book I was hesitant, given that it is a novel and not a non-fiction. But Robbins descriptions of Stalingrad really seemed to put me right into that hell-torn city. While i'm sure that the story of Vasily Zaitsev was fabricated a bit, it was nonetheless an exciting read. The duel with Heinz Thorvald was particularly thrilling as well, although most historians doubt the man actually existed. I could have done without some of the cheesy love story with Zaitsev's fellow sniper/lover Tania though. Overall, this book was one that I had a difficult time putting down, and I even learned a little bit from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard work really does pay off.","review":"Bravo to Mr. Robbins for putting all that historical research into this book. I thought he successfully captured many of the more profound implications of Stalingrad while the various sub-plots unfolded.I found myself anxious to learn how the individual skills and personalities of the two snipers, Z and T, would result in one besting the other after a long, challenging duel. As it turns out, Z shoots T only after T fails to fire on Z, and after Z stupidly exposes himself as a result of the failed \\"shell-casing\\" trick. So, basically Z wins because his horrible blunder turned out to be less horrible than T freezing up and failing to fire his rifle.Z wins as a result of dumb luck, not skill. T loses because he failed to execute his greatest skill - firing quickly. An odd conclusion to the duel, but perhaps rather than dull writing, it is another example of Mr. Robbins analysis of Stalingrad - random, unmerciful destruction."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sniper novel well worth reading","review":"I'll be brief, the book is excellent and the only thing keeping me from giving it five stars is that the author took a few real people like Zaitsev and mixed them with fictional characters to make a story. The story itself is superb and is set in the battle of Stalingrad where a Russian sniper, Zaitsev, is hunted by the Nazi super sniper, Thorvald. I'd have preferred fictional names throughout to avoid the reader believing certain incidents actually occurred when they didn't but otherwise this is an exceptional novel and so well researched that the reader should get a feel for what soldiers on both sides felt in the Battle of Stalingrad. The battle itself is well documented in a non fiction work titled, Enemy at the Gates for which the movie version of this book is named. My advice, buy the book, rent the movie, and don't expect them to match very closely. This book is by far the better of the two."},{"rating":"1","title":"degenerates into soap opera","review":"This book starts out extremely well.It appears to be a terse account of the battle of Stalingrad;One looks forward to a duel between two snipers and a gritty account of this horrific battle;however the female character is introduced and the novel takes a complete turn as if another author takes over the writing. It then becomes one of those literal romances without insight into the characters and any discernment or accounting of this historical tragedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth reading","review":"This is a bad book.

Told from the Russian perspective, you cannot help but chear for the young hero in this contest. He is the common man hero pitted against the cold and calculating professional assassin. The book is even more exciting than the later movie adaptation, _Enemy at the Gates_.The naration is superb in this audio recording only enhancing an already fast-moving and inspiring action adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"RAT WAR RAGES IN PAGES!","review":"I usually dont get into war novels but this one intrigued me due to the fact that it was mainly about two men hunting each other amongnst a huge and dirty war raging all around them. Also there was an interesting angle in this story that the two antagonists were so much alike, and yet so different in background and country. The characters were very rich and interesting, and I liked the American woman turned sniper angle also, that was done very well. The only reason I did not give it a 5-star rating was the ending was quite too abrupt for me as a reader. I was not sure what happened to the survivors and the final confrontation between the two men was not as exciting as I have read in other action-like novels. But still a good read and I am looking forward to the movie coming out on this book in February titled \\"ENEMY AT THE GATES\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lyrical war story.","review":"Two master snipers, one Russian, the other German, face off in the hell that is the battle of Stalingrad. Vasily Zietsev is a hunter from the Siberian steppes whose marksmanship and woodcraft ability are instrumental in his appointment of head of the Russian sniper troops. In fact his troops are so succesful that the Germans finally call on their master, Heinz Thorvald, to end Zietsev's life. So begins the duel in the rubble of Stalingrad from which only one man will emerge alive.I found this book very well written. The prose is quite lyrical and not what you'd expect from a war story. This novel is not a techno-thriller but deals with the characters and how the siege of Stalingrad has affected them. The sniper duel is almost an afterthought as Mr. Robbins spins his tale of love, death, cowardice and heroisim. Even if you don't like war stories I think you'll find this book entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great depiction of war become \\"personal\\" in the rubble.","review":"Robbins does a great job on two fronts - First, a vivid depiction of what the Battle of Staligrad must have been like for the soldiers - Second, a strong, suspenseful story in which modern war becomes personal for the snipers who fight each other. This book kept me reading; I had no idea how it would end. Looking forward to more from Mr. Robbins."},{"rating":"1","title":"War of the Rat's Enemies at the Gates","review":"It's always nice to see war novels use the Russian Front in World War II; especially the epic battle of Stalingrad. \\"The War of the Rats\\" is the book on which the screen play for \\"Enemy at the Gates\\" was based. The book is a reasonable portrayal of the horrors of war especially street to street fighting. The characterization of the Communist political officers, the German Gestapo and the high ranking officers on both sides are two dimensional and horribly predictable. The \\"heroes\\" are righteous, valiant, selfless and experts in their sniper knowledge domain. Both want to share their knowledge and generate clones of themselves.Sound formulaic and trite? You are correct. But, don't go to the movie for any relief. It is also formulaic, trite and has an unbelievably hokey love scene. If you want a really great war movie see \\"Black Hawk Down\\". If you want a great war novel of read \\"Flight of the Intruder\\". Do NOT bother with this book or its poor derivative movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two snipers, One fate","review":"I spent half a summer vacation researching the movie \\"Enemy at the Gates\\", and found this gem within three days of my research. I immediately picked up a copy in paperback after reading some online reviews, and went straight to reading. After four hours of reading, I spent another eight reading it twice more. By the third time, I was adamant about my support of Heinz Thorvald and Nikki Mond, his assistant. Though the lines of Fact and Fiction are somewhat blurred, David L. Robbins does a splendid job of writing drama to a historical background. This book is my Bible, and if six stars out of five were numerically possible, rest assured this book would get it from me. A further note; I have seen the behind-the-sceness featurettes of Enemy at the Gates, and I feel that Ed Harris was the only one who read this book. Jude Law, maybe, but I'm not sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Novel by a wonderful writer!!","review":"Enjoy it 100%!!! I think that if David L. Robbins didn't get a movie right from the producer of 'enemy at the gate,' he should sue them. 'cause the movie itself is definitely originated and based on mr david robbin's novel. if they goofied it by claiming it was inspired by william craig's 'enemy at the gate,' then they are definitely lying. 'war of the rats' could be read as a sequal to 'the master sniper' by stephen hunter and if you like the great snipers' novel, you would be greatly enjoyed by reading stephen hunter's 'point of impact' series (except the detoured one, 'dirty white boys.' 'black light' and 'time to hunt' are both great books after 'point of impact.' the other great and fasinating sniper novel is: 'white star' by james thayer, an amazing duel between two retired american and russian snipers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rottenkrieg, not Rattenkrieg","review":"Simply put, this book is a sheer waste of time. The author fails miserably in an attempt to brew a concotion of fact+fiction. Although this book has all the right characters (Vassily Zaitsev, Heinz (Koenig) Thorvald, Tania etc), it is evident that the author cannot weave a compelling plot.If you are interested in the duel between Vassily and Thorvald, see \\"Enemy at the Gates\\" MOVIE. If you want to know about the battle for Stalingrad, read \\"Enemy at the Gates\\" BOOK. Stay away from this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than 'enemy at the gates'","review":"Same basic plot as the movie 'enemy at the gates' but much better -- no hokey love triangles here - a very well written thriller about an expert German marksman sent in to dispatch Russia's best sniper. I don't believe it is particularly historically accurate, but why should it be? It is historical fiction, and a great read at that. A solid, intelligent plot. If you have to choose between this and 'enemy at the gates' choose this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic Portrayal of Stalingrad","review":"Having read multiple accounts of Stalingrad, I can say that David Robbins has done his research well. His time in Russia definetly paid off. I wonder what made Mr. Robbins to decide to focus his story on the Russian snipers and not discuss any of the other German snipers? And since this was a novelization of history, it would have been nice to hear what happened to the actual characters. Perhaps Mr. Robbins can add that information as a review to the book here at Amazon?Overall, a good book. Made you feel Stalingrad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing!","review":"I thought the author did a wonderful job of turning an event involving millions of men and women to something that revolved around only two men. He did a great job personalizing the war from a different point of view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enemy at the Gates movie is not based on this book","review":"I thought this book was fair. Overall some of the research seems questionable. One clarification to some of the earlier reviews. The soon to be released Paramount movie \\"Enemy at the Gates\\" is not based upon this book but upon the historical events. I am actually more excited about the soon-to-be published novel \\"A Bend in the River\\" that provides a more comprehensive account of these events. Some of the early hubub indicates that this work was much more thoroughly researched and hence provides and more exciting and realistic account of the events. War of the Rats just seemed a little too rushed and didnt really give you a good feel for the ultimate outcome of the Stalingrad campaign."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Happened (revised)","review":"I would like to take this opportunity to revise my previous review of this book. My only proplem with this book is that the Author claims that it is based on an actual sniper duel between Zaitsev and Thorvald, when in all actuality the supposed duel NEVER HAPPENED! It was nothing but a Soviet hoax invented for propaganda purposes. Many reports have different names for the German; Thorvald, Thorwald, Konings to name a few. When in fact no such super sniper existed. There was no SS sniper at Stalingrad, check the records. I challenge the Author to prove his claim."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away","review":"If you know anything more about WW2 other than that it happened in the 20th century you should stay away from this book.It may seem ok for a few pages then starts to be more and more annoying with every scene. To give but one example, two russian and german groups are stuck in a building, in two different halls and the separating doors are locked. What to do? They both decide to dig a tunnel (!) underneath the room to the other side to blow up the enemy, and both start singing to cover the digging noise. \\"Frightful\\" suspense follows, until an explosion is heard in the night, and shortly afterwards, a russian song. I bet the author thought he came up with a masterpiece of suspense.Simply ridiculous. Stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good war novel","review":"I read this book very fast. It is an interesting novel that gives a general overview of urban warfare in Stalingrad. However, as previous reviewers from Venezuela and Canada pointed out, there are historical inaccuracies in the background."},{"rating":"1","title":"War of the Rats","review":"The inaccuracies in \\"War of the Rats\\" ruined it for this reader. It's a question of credibility. Even with fiction, I like to get accurate information--especially in novels that are supposed to be based on real events. If so much is sloppily researched, it's hard to take the book or author seriously. As has been pointed out before, Robbins' firearms descriptions are not accurate. The female protagonist was based on a real person--but the real person was Russian not American. Even small facts that most people should know, are off. E.G. Mr. Robbins' reference to one of his snipers taking top honors in his village's turkey shoot makes me wonder why Mr. Robbins doesn't know there could be no turkeys at that time in that place! The writing is tedious, and the love scenes so poorly written one wonders if this topic also begs for better research by the author!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have heard of this book over the years and thought it would be a good read. Having read a lot about Stalingrad and the monumental struggle for the city, I thought this would be great. I am sure the story is fine but it did not fit in with what I believe to be true about the battle. I recommend some sniper biographys instead.Doug, Virginia"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one...","review":"I enjoy historical fiction, but this book was barely tolerable. I'm not a gun/sniper freak, so the inaccuracies in that area didn't bother me.The cliches, bland description, and unoriginal characters killed the novel. Love in war is fine (See Wouk's War and Remembrance)-- but not under these circumstances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes for interesting reading","review":"This book really gives some insight on what life what like during the battle for Stalingrad, albeit mostly from a Russian/sniper point of view. I didn't read it for technical accuracy. They have gun magazines and pamphlets for that. The one thing I found disappointing was that the author leaves you hanging as to the fate of the surviving main characters. I read somewhere else that Zaitsev was later blinded by a land mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gripping romance and true-life adventure story!","review":"If you want to read a gripping romance and true-life adventure story I highly recommend David L. Robbins' War of the Rats. It stuns yet richly entertains in its detailed retelling of one of the grisliest battles of WWII: Stalingrad. We in the USA cannot imagine the horror of being locked in combat for months within the boundaries of one of our cities but the Russians lived it in Stalingrad. David Robbins tells the story as it must have been lived, with desperation, richness, horror, hope and hopeless despair. It is still unimaginable. But War of the Rats makes it visible in the mind's eye and thereby teaches the terrible lessons of war with fresh urgency. It takes skill to tell a story well enough to keep the reader interested when the ending is known. David Robbins has sufficient skill and more."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Noon in Stalingrad","review":"If \\"War is Hell\\" then its defining moment was in the Russian city of Stalingrad in 1942. There, in a cauldron of ruin, mayhem and death, the Russian Army defeated the German Army and turned the tide of World War Two.In the midst of this battle that claimed over one million lives, there is the true story of two master snipers - Russian Chief Master Sergeant Vasily Zaitzev and German SS Colonel Heinz Thorvald - who are assigned to seek out and kill the other.Author David L. Robbins uses this true story and this desolate/desperate setting as the framework of his novel. The result is compelling story that moves fast, fascinates, and skillfully blends fact with fiction.Mr. Robbins distinguishes himself as a storyteller. His writing is neither literary nor florid. It's designed to grasp the reader and carry him or her like a train on a fast track that rolls, rumbles and weaves from page one through to the final scene.You'll never be bored reading a war novel by David L. Robbins."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great read by an up-and-coming great writer","review":"the war scenes are all three dimensional, the characters are all vivid and alive. david robbin is a fantastic writer with frederic forsythe style. every word, every sentence is right on the target just like what he described those snipers' shooting. this is a wonderful treat and it would be kept as one of the best novels i'd treasured on my bookshelf together with stephen hunter's 'point of impact, black light, time to hunt (dirty white boys is not among them but should be kept as a complete series'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"My expectations were high for a novel about snipers in probably the most intense city battle in history. The result was far short of my hopes. (1) The writer seemed to know little about guns and shooting, which is important in a story when most of the characters are snipers, (2) the description of battle was strangely boring and unmoving [try \\"the forgotten soldier\\" or \\"black hawk down\\"], (3) the love story was simply silly, (4) making the woman American was pointless and unrealistic and (4) everything was relentlessly pro-Russian. Not worth reading, especially considering the weak writing and excessive cliches."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very disappointing book!","review":"I was looking forward to reading an interesting book on how the German and Russian Sniper hunted each other in Stalingrad. Instead this book has focused on how evil and stupid the Germans are and how intelligent and smart the Russians are during crucial battles in Stalingrad. Overall, this book was very disappointig and I am so glad that I borrowed this book from my local library!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time.","review":"Did anyone else feel like the book was just really really tacky? I mean, aside from the dialogue apparently being lifted from a book on phonics? Hares and bears, a chorus of \\"O Tannenbaum\\" rising over Stalingrad on Christmas, Thorvald and his sandwiches. Gag.David Robbins clearly has no knowledge about war or Russia. But that's irrelevant because he's got no business writing novels at all. With his grace, he ought to be writing manuals for electric powered toothbrushes.A small note, despite the risk of sounding like a Russia dweeb: the diminutive name Vasha does not exist in Russian. The main character's name is Vasily, the diminutive should be Vasya. \\"Vasha\\" is the feminine for \\"your,\\" as in, \\"I throw your book in the trash.\\"I know, I know, it's nitpicking, but imagine if some author had a character named Robert and went through an entire book calling him \\"Berb.\\" Sounds a little weird."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this book!","review":"Bad writing and absurd story make this book a waste of time and money. Romance novel pretends to be factual historical storytelling, placing Russian lovers in the highly romantic setting of the Battle for Stalingrad while they single-handedly kill endless scores of Nazis. Hot sex in -30 degree weather? Lice-covered, cold and starving soldiers finding the energy and desire to have great sex in the blood and rubble? Please. The only woman in the book is given the worst lines - \\"We will kill for you\\" she tells her lover as she grips his hand. Casualty figures at front of book differ from figures at end. Serious Stalingrad books offer doubts that the\\"duel\\" ever took place. Dreadful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good but with one inexplicable flaw...","review":"I have no idea why the author placed a lengthy interlude in the book where the hero's girlfriend visits a field brothel with a couple of her male comrades. The passage is unintentionally hilarious as well as being a good argument against the presence of women in infantry units."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Marks for Pure Entertainment Value","review":"For pure entertainment value, \\"War of the Rats\\" merits high accolades. It is highly engaging and suspenseful, and the snipers' duel provides compelling narrative. (I agree with previous reviewers who complained about the sexual interludes -- unnecessary, superfluous and wholly unrealistic.)Regardless of whether this duel ever happened (historian Antony Beevor, in his classic history \\"Stalingrad: The Fateful Siege\\" says it did not), the book was more than worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was expecting more ...","review":"I was disappointed with this book. At times I felt I was reading two different novels: One a love story during WWII (a poor Danielle Steele) and the second a military duel between the two primary antagonists.I'm not sure why the author decided to stick a love story in this novel. He seemed to be doing fine when he stuck to the military aspects of the story but then that love storyline would rear its ugly head and screw things up. I didn't find it all that difficult to believe some of the lines/thoughts the author attributed to the main combatants during the military confrontations, but the love story angle was just silly.My recommendation: If you're interested in this particular part of history, look for a history book. If you need to read this book, borrow it from a friend or from the library. Finally, if you absolutely need to buy it, purchase the paperback version and save some $."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Fantastic. Mr. Robbins has done a terrific job of inviting the reader along for a thoroughly believable tour of downtown Stalingrad, 1942. The characters quickly become your friends, telling you their horrifying stories of what a terrible waste human combat really is. An astounding amount of research is tightly, seamlessly woven into this great novel.If you're looking for heroics, for characters who feel great accomplishment when they defeat another in battle, go elsewhere. When one causes the death of another, who really wins? If you're looking for a happy ending, stop reading historical war novels. If you're looking for pure history, read non-fiction. But if you're looking for a mental picture of the widespread emotions of war, this book should do it.Fiction is entertainment. I was entertained.

Initially I had no interest in the book, then someone, who knew of my interest in cultures, told me it was about dueling snipers at the Battle of Stalingrad. With this new frame of reference I found the book riveting, tight, tense, and culturally insightful about the differences between Germans and Russians which are still true today. The ending was weak, flat, and written to justify the misleading title. Too bad: an ending for a book alternatively titled \\"War of the Snipers\\" or \\"War of Wits\\" would have worked better and been much more gratifying.Josh Hammond, co-author, \\"The Stuff Americans Are Made Of.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"talentlessly written","review":"This was one of the most poorly written books I've read in a quite some time.

I found the characters to be one-dimensional and the storyline dragged on and on. Maybe it was just me... However, the book Stalingrad: The Fateful Siege: 1942 - 1943 by Antony Beevor was all that War of the Rats was not -- fast paced with plenty of insight into the minds of soldiers who fought, and their military leaders.

We have far too much racism in our world today --so why fill your mind with more of it by reading this book? The author's bias is clear. This novel depicts Germans as either stupid or evil, strongly implying that the only good German is a dead one. This is an entirely unacceptable concept. The book implies, however, that Russians are noble in each and every case. I agree with those who have said the book is poorly written. It is not just firearms descriptions that are inaccurate. For example, the female protagonist was Russian in the true story upon which the book is based --how ludicrous to make her American in this book! In addition, the sex scenes are laughable.

The are easy to attach and to take off and clean. They work well - the machine is very powerful.

Need to can applesauce. This attachment to to rescue - separates the cooked apples into great applesauce, and in another bowl all the peels and cores, seeds stems. Makes it almost easy to turn bushels of apples into applesauce!Haven't used the other two attachments yet, but hear from others in the family that the meat grinder is great for making sausage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased","review":"Am pleased with the items. So far I have used the shredder and the juicer. Only complaint is that I have to be careful with how fast I insert the fruit into the juicer due to the seeds getting clogged up. apparently you have to run it on high speed and slowly add the fruit ( blackberries in my case) so that it will extract the seeds.......still all in all a good buy......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Basically doesn't work","review":"I got this for making applesauce, and it doesn't: the main problem seems to be that the auger doesn't go all the way back, so part of the material gets behind it. That probably doesn't matter so much if it's soft material, but something firm like an apple basically plugs up the feed tube so you can't get more in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good accessory for this excellent mixer","review":"I purchased this set about 2 years ago. The shredders work OK, but it is easier and less mess to chop them by hand. Much of the produce gets caught between the housing and the shredder. It's difficult getting uniform cuts. The piece that is poorly designed is the meat grinder. I'm on my second grinder. Both the feeder shaft and the housing are constructed of a plastic molding on metal. Over a relatively short amount of use, they both began to crack apart at the unions. This of course is not good, being they are used on meat and it makes it almost impossible to clean. I would recommend going for a good sharp knife and a seperate all metal meat grinder (which I am now looking for)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Above Expectations","review":"I have been retired a few years after spending more than twenty years in the grocery business. The fruit and vegetable strainer made short work out of a bumper crop of Italian tomatos which we converted the juice into tomato sauce.The food grinder worked better than I expedted when I made sausage from a boston butt pork shoulder. Of course it did not have the power of the commerdial grinders that I used for 20+ years, but it did a real good job. Did a lot better than I expected. I allso got the larger food tray which made the work easier. For the money invested, If you have a Kitchen Aid stand mixer, I would highly reccomend this attachment pack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a lot useful stuff in it","review":"The slicer/shredder:I find the slicer doesn't work good. If you want to shredd a cabage or potatoes for a meal there is a lot garbage produced until you are ready. The grinding plates are very dull and you need to use a lot preasure to get the job done. I should have returned it!The fruit strainer:Is producing a mess and very bad to clean! Would not buy it again! I'd rather try a manual one!The grinder: Good for small jobs. Tried sausage making with it. Took two people and more than 4 hours to process and stuff the casings with it. Okay to clean.Overall: To me a waste of money and cupboard space!"},{"rating":"2","title":"really professional","review":"It really neat to work with this Kitchen aid.

Worked out great, they sent me the pusher at no cost, it arrived within a week. Haven't used the other attachments yet, but they look fine. The grinder works like a charm! Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addation to the stand mixer!","review":"If you want to get the most use out of your stand mixer investment, this is a must have. I would say that I use the meat grinder the most. I like being able to hand pick the cut of meat that I want and then trim the fat off myself. That way I know exactly what I'm getting. Plus, its fun too! Cleanup isn't a breaze, but its not too difficult either. Storage also isn't too bad as most of the pieces fit into their respective attachment, but it will take up a full corner of your cubbard. For a guy, this is a great way to bring gadgets into the kitchen. Arg!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good item - if you will use them!","review":"I have used this product, and I have enjoyed using it. The only complaint is with the slicer/grater, some of the food gets stuck between the blades and the attachment, and the food does not get grated/sliced. If this is your main use of the machine - a food processor would work better. The grinder and strainer work great. Apples and pears worked great... all I had to do is cut the fruit into pieces that would fit through the grinder, cooked them down some to become soft, and put them through... the pulp came out free of peel, stem and seeds... how great! I have also used the grinder to grind up venison meat... I did put it through twice, but it worked great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my kitchenaid and this makes it even more usefull","review":"I grew up around a kitchen aid, and just had to have one for myself, I love it!!! I have tried to use other things to make bread, even bread makers, and have found myself always wanting my kitchen aid back, the same with noodles. With this attachment pack now I dont' need to have a food processer sitting around collecting dust cause I now have a slicer for the kitchen aid. I don't need to worry about grinding up meats either this grinder rocks. If you are lucky to enough to find a good sale on something like a round roast you can grind it into burger yourself and know there is nothing in that nice juicy burger but meat (allot places use beans and ice along with the beef as filler). If you are into the making of jellys or tomato juices to can the strainer attachment works great and all of these attachments come off the mixer easily and can be be tossed in the dishwasher to clean (try that with a food processer)."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than I expected!","review":"Quite a heavy box, but when opened, you can see why!

I have only used food grinder so far and it is a disaster. Altough grinding is good, you can see black stuff mixing with your meat which is disgusting. I called the customer service and they are saying that it is normal because the juice of the meat is mixing with the brass gear and turning black. When I requested a change they said the new part will do the exact same thing. They suggested that I partially froze the meat so the juice does not come out too much.I think this is an engineering flaw that needs to be fixed, and do not buy it if it is not fixed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Misnomer, but still good","review":"When I purchased this book, I was expecting something along the lines of a a player's guide or such.

It's an excellent book and I liked it very much, but it was not what I had in mind for a survival guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great watch","review":"I rarely place reviews, unless something is very bad and people need to be warned or very good. This series is very good and if you have an interest in human survival, well worth watching. The show was made in 1973 to 1975 so is dated inasmuch as cloths, attitudes, etc., but the stories that make up each episode are engaging.I am still only one-third of the way through, having just watched series one, but I am really pleased that I have the box set with another two series.

I can't convey the beauty of the sound in words. The fact that these tunes were recorded in one session, which started late at night and ran until dawn, gave the player's an urgency to do their best, impress their leader and their peers and every recording shines with this feeling. Basie's theme, \\"Jumpin' At the Woodside\\" and Ellington's \\"Take the 'A' Train\\" are both included, though Billy Strayhorn, Ellington's musical partner, and the song's composer, takes the Basie piano on \\"Train.\\" There's even a drum battle in the first tune \\"Battle Royal.\\" But unlike 'battle of the bands' meetings of the past, this is more of a melding of the sounds of the two bands.

Hal Wallis has assembeled some fine artist for this film. This is Geraldine Page,s great performance and it has been noted so. The film allows closeups and the viewer can drink all the emotions of the characters..something that cannot be done on the stage. Looking even closer one must not leave out the performance of Laurence Harvey as doctor John Buchanan. His detachments hold a stark contrast for the rest of the characters in the film.. A vital element for Alma in this tragic riddle.

Spirituality vs. carnality is the theme of a spinster romantically attracted to her childhood neighbor, a wild libertine. Elmer Bernstein's score is magnificant - one of his finest and one of the finest in film history. Listen during Alma's soul-searing final monologue using images of ice and fire and listen to Bernstein's use of harp glissandos that reflect the words. This is Page's finest screen performance and along with the score and the writing are the main reasons for viewing. The prologue and main title are letterboxed - showing the fine use of wide screen. Nominations were also received for Una Merkel's supporting performance as the dotty mother, Bernstein's score and the period Art Direction. Well worth a visit."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Summer Viewing Tradition","review":"I cannot get through a summer without seeing this fine film.

The characters are more complex and geopolitics becomes more convoluted, and hence more believable. The borderline megalomaniac... Queen Victoria... is one of these more fully fleshed out characters. She takes irreversible steps down a path to world domination that will either result in a one world government centered in London or it will wholly destroy Britain. I think the author is contrasting the inadvertent empire that America is stumbling into today to the conscious and deliberate global hegemony of his fictional Britain one hundred years ago. There is a message in this novel... any anglophone superpower seeking to rule the world had better crave power and be willing to grab it with both hands; either that or don't even try.

Better to have them over and watch it again with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff as usual and always!!","review":"I loved this film and it made me laugh until I cry. Terry Jones, though he seems to be my least favorite Python, was hysterical and funny as the woman dressed in drag and Mr. Creotose. I love Eric Idle's singing and John Cleese making love to his wife in front of his students! Terry Gilliam's animation is wonderful and Terry J's and Michael Palin's having a bunch of children was a riot!Graham Chapman, God rest his soul, was the perfect straight man and there had to be a straight man in Python and he was it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Python","review":"The few missteps in this film are more than made up for by such brilliant sketches as Mr. Creosote, the boy's school football match between the students and the masters, and the organ donation scene, not to mention all of the hilarious (and hummable!) musical numbers. Can't these guys get back together for one more film before any more of them pass on?"},{"rating":"2","title":"the meaning of life","review":"This movie is full of the incredible Monty Python genius we all have come to love! It rambles through the hilarious human condition with song and animation peppered in between. \\"Every Sperm is Sacred\\" is one of my favorites. Sexuality is parodied here, so a viewer needs to be open to funny sexually suggestive scenes.This is Five star sacrilicious!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie is a five the spec. ed. dvd is a big fat zero....","review":"Do NOT i repeat DO NOT purchase this sepcial edition dvd... The feature film has major transfer problems... Every time an actor moves in any signficant way all theses didgital lines and transfer problems appear rendering the film to be almost unviewable... Read the other reviews.. It is not just one copy it is all!!! BEWARE wait until universal recalls them and corrects this if they even do.. I say e-mail them and complain..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some side splitting moments","review":"This movie is a series of sketches with the theme being Life from birth to death. In the usual wacky Python manner, you never know what's coming around the next corner! Some sketches like the Protestant and Catholics had me on the floor howling. John Cleese as the school teacher will have you roaring too. Some sketches fall short of the mark, but I find this typical of the TV series too. Overall, it's rather funny because of their unique style of humor and there are moments of comic brilliance. As usual, if you are a Python fan, you should watch this one. Others who are offended easily or don't understand British comedy should steer clear. Again, like the TV series; wait patiently through the slow parts as the funny parts will hit you like a sledgehammer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yup, the dvd picture is f-ed up....","review":"Something went wrong with the print on these dvds, apparently, because everytime someone or something moves, they distort. I've discovered that the Zoom x2 function alleviates this, but if you're watching widescreen it chops it down to approximately fullscreen ratio. So I'm waiting for there to be a recall or something, because I know that if I return this I'll just get another bad copy. It's probably present in the first 100,000 or however many they make in the first batch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly their worst","review":"I am a huge Monty Python fan, and believe that Holy Grail and Life of Brian are examples of true comic genius. Meaning of Life, however, is hardly funny. The long \\"corporate raiders\\" sequence in the beginning has great comic potential, but drags on far too long to be funny. Most of the jokes do have potential, and you know that the gags should be entertaining, but they didn't spark much amusement in me. It doesn't have the wonderful zany spontaneity of their other movies. I would not reccommend this movie to Monty Python fans, because it's quite disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not their best...","review":"I love (and own) every single Monty Python episode, and love every one of their movies except...this one. The surreal opening number by Terry Gilliam is absolutely brilliant, and the first couple of skits are funny, and then it just gets lame, dull, and generally unfunny. They may have had in mind that they were going to push the boundaries of comedy with this movie, but the results are reminiscent of their occasional dud TV episodes, where the viewer sits waiting in vain for something actually funny to happen. If you've never seen Monty Python, DON'T START HERE!! Get Life of Brian or The Holy Grail to see their real brilliance."},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolute Must see","review":"This is the greatest achievement of the Monthy Python, any real python fan knows that, the sperm song is an historical moment (you shouldn't miss that).This is high-class humour, and the most sophisticated the python have done, so beginners might prefer to start with holy grail or better, the flying circus.If you like Wayne's World, don't watch that, this is not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Python at their best","review":"It's hard for me to decide which of Python's three feature films is the best, since they are all excellent. But this movie certainly contains some of Monty Python's best material. A classic mix of the cerebral and the silly.Some people complain that there's too much sex in this movie. Did they perhaps walk out after the hilarious Sex Ed scene? Because sex is just one of many, varied subjects lampooned in this movie. Some complain that it's disgusting, or that there is too much vulgar language. Wimps! People with backbones and an appreciation of satire will find themselves doubled over in laughter at the incredible lengths these five Brits and a Yank go to poke fun at all of us. If this movie offends you, you deserve to be offended!I'm giving 4 stars due to the lack of any special features on the DVD. Either wait for the Special Edition to come out (Special Editions of Holy Grail and Life of Brian are already available), or buy the videotape."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Monty Python film","review":"After classics like \\"Life of Brian\\" and \\"The Holy Grail\\" this is just disappointing. The famous humour has become stale. The Pythons try to be funny by showing exaggerated violence (live organ transplant) and simply disgusting sketches (the fat man in the restaurant). All of these elements have been done before in Flying Circus, but there they were much better. This movie does have some good sketches, though. I really like the \\"Every sperm is sacred\\" song. I'd rather recommend watching \\"Monty Python live at the Hollywood Bowl\\". That is much better than \\"The Meaning of Life\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Philosophy, It is a sport?","review":"As hilarious as it is marvelous.Python's ghreat sense of humour makes you laugh out loud!This great british comedy team is funny.Christmas in Heaven, a vegas style song is revealed as well Every Sperm is Sacred.The Virtual Reunion is just hilarious.And so every philosopher has an \\"s\\" on his name?"},{"rating":"1","title":"You must be joking!","review":"Eighty-five bucks! For a jumped-up CD? How about I offer you four? Come on, haggle! You've got to haggle it's traditional innit? Still, I only want to buy the DVD, not the rights to the movie! Has the WORLD GONE MAD? FIFTY QUID to watch Mr. Creosote throw up again? To listen to that song about SPERM again? Some people may be completely bonkers about this stuff, but not for this much dosh? Oh no. What's so special about a 5\\" disk of plastique which makes it worth more than eight times a long thin piece of plastic tape (which I note can be had for under ten bucks). Huh? Think I'm stupid?::::::All right, you're on. Er, you can keep my name out of it can't you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Universal is in CYA mode","review":"Was excited to get the DVD, but really angry when I saw that Disc 1 is defective! It's ridiculous to think for a second that Universal would institute a recall effort for a DVD that has problems with \\"a small minority\\" of DVD players. I tried it on 4 different players, all different brands, and the problem was evident in all of them. My guess is that this is the line Universal is using so they only have to replace a small number of DVD's - just for us squeaky wheels.As for the DVD features, they're OK but not outstandingly funny. Worth owning once Universal finally puts a non-defective version out. I would wait to buy until then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monty Python's 3rd best film badly needs restoration","review":"This film is a series of shorts that are big budget as far as Monty Python standards go. The first sketch about a group of old accountants staging an office mutiny and turning their building into a pirate ship pretty much falls flat, but the remaining sketches are hilarious.Unfortunately, the quality of the print this was remastered from is in horrible shape. There are scratches and dirt throughout the film. Hopefully, they'll do a restoration on this sometime soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their absolute best.","review":"A long time Python fan, I first saw this movie when it came out in 1983. Just in my early 20's, I was disappointed on first viewing. It seemed bleak, extreme, and not at all in the old Pythonesque spirit of madcap satire. I just got the DVD, and upon reviewing, now at the age of 42, I think this was their most brilliant work by far. They started by taking on the Arthurian, Christian myths. Then, in the life of Brian, they took on Christianity itself. They concluded by taking on the Meaning of Life in its entirety. There are some weak moments but, as is written, if ever you start feeling very small and insecure, just remember how unlikely is your birth! That last statement is, I think the most most congealing and comedic comment ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT THE HELL?","review":"Just a warning, do NOT buy this DVD unless the box it comes in bears the label: \\"FEATURE DVD IS NOT DEFECTIVE AND HAS IN FACT BEEN TESTED AND CLEARED BY SOMEONE WHOSE VISION IS RELATIVELY NORMAL.\\" The feature DVD is obviously screwed up, and after sending off the defective DVD and waiting three weeks for the supposedly fixed DVD, I discovered that the replacement is every bit as defective as the one I returned! Thanks a lot, Universal! Python deserves better."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is DVD?","review":"It's always been an outrageously funny movie but I thought with it being on DVD, they'd remaster the movie....it ain't so! The picture looks the same as your worn out VHS copy...so beware!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MY favorite (if not theirs!)","review":"As a 17-year old freshman at the University of Michigan in 1990, I was exposed to Monty Python when someone rented this from the video store. I was immediately blown away. Although this generally ranks below The Holy Grail and Life of Brian not only on most Python fans' lists, but by the Pythons themselves (I suspect that's why it's out of print!), this is by far my favorite Python film. I think the frenetic pace of it is as close to the brilliant TV series as anything they did post-1974. (Three! oh yes, three, sir)I'm still partial to The Meaning of Life, and I even like the inspiring message Michael (Michelle?) Palin delivers at the end of the film.By the way, it took me many, many times to find the Pythons in the pre-film flick. Very interesting!All in all, don't be swayed by the hype. The Holy Grail and Life of Brian may have been more ground-breaking at the time of their respective releases, but I find this one FUNNIER."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny, stupid!","review":"This movie is 20% comedy, 40% gay, 10% funny, and 30% of a waste of your life. There is barley any comedy, or stuff thats even funny. The best part is watching a group of naked girls chase a stupid man for 10 seconds."},{"rating":"1","title":"A review from Mr. Entertainment Lover","review":"How can people like this film? It's absolutely disgusting! Instead of laughing I found myself getting grossed out. What's the topic of this film? SEX! That's all the whole film is about. It's a shame really! It could have been better! But never the less it's just a film about sex and death. If you want a good film, see Monty Python and the Holy Grail or And Now for Something Completely Different!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's hope this ISN'T the meaning of life!","review":"I made the mistake of watching this movie with some friends a couple years ago. It was absolutely disgusting. It was full of nudity, cussing, violence, crude jokes, and much more! It was just pointless. After watching the movie, you are left thinking, \\"Why did I just watch this?\\" If you want to be grossed out, try this film. Let's hope the real meaning of life is not reflected in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"Watch \\"Saturday Night Live\\" and \\"Jerry Springer\\" on tv...It's free.Orangutans may enjoy this.This is over the top silly,the screenplay is garbage.Get a life..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I walked out on it in theaters back in 1983!","review":"I went and saw another film as I was so disenchanted with this one. The opening had so little to do with the rest of the film I thought I was watching a preview to another film. I don't care for spoofs about Catholics and protestants. The Pythons can't sing or dance (for those on this board who claim their talents are innumerable). I say to the fans of Python: get a life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This disc should have been recalled","review":"If you purchased this disc, and it does not have \\"V2\\" on disc one, contact Universal for a replacmeent, even if it plays fine on your current DVD player.Here is why - the problem is with progressive scan DVD players and progressive scan monitors. Very few people have both, so the problem will not rear its ugly head until you upgrade.The movie is completely unwatchable in this configuration.Do yourself a favor, and get disc one replaced now, before it is too late."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant as always","review":"Although it is the worst movie from them, it is still very very very funny! I couldn't stop laughing when i saw it, and i've already dreamed with the weird elephant from the middle of the film one hundred times! The sperm song is fantastic, and so is the machine that goes 'bing'... I said it was the worst movie only because there are some bad parts, and the creamsom in the beginning is quite weird...but, anyway, is 100% better than any other american movie.It is so necessary as the others..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I LOVE this movie but... quality wise, I prefer the VHS version!","review":"The DVD seems to have a big problem with interlacing.Even when played on a 1080p blue ray up-convertion player on a HD-TV, the picture is terrible.None the 20+ others DVD I own have this problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Moive - pity the DVD is so poor","review":"As much as I love Monty Python and this movie - I can recommed this DVD. The picture and sound quality are really poor - just watch the opening shot of the stars to see what I mean. It seems like the DVD was mastered from a really used video tape. There are no subtitles, no second language and the 'extras' are almost non-existent. I know the name of the production company is Handmade Films but I expect better than this from a DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harious Movie","review":"I've always thought this was a funny movie. Much better than Holy Grail and Life of Brian. Even on top of the comedy, there's a thought provoking story line!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Disc problem...","review":"Glad it isn't just me with the disc/picture quality issues...The movie itself is a masterpiece. Some of their best work. I can't wait to own the special edition. I'd just like one that has decent picture quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps the funniest movie of all time","review":"It's a little bit uneven (the tiger scene, in particular, seemed a bit drawn out), but you'll never notice. This is Monty Python at its absolute best. If you have somehow missed seeing this film, do so immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"(Except for the \\"puking\\"), 'Twas the Best Of Python","review":"The \\"Restaurant\\" segment didn't go down too well (oops, bad choice of words), but the rest of the film was excellent. \\"Every Sperm Is Sacred\\" is an amazingly catchy tune.And there was much rejoicing by Python Lovers everywhere.YAYYYY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this DVD! Disk one replaced.....still defective!","review":"I have just received the replacement disk #1 for this title. My replacement disk is as defective as the original. The visual distortion appears on both of my DVD players. You should wait until this problem is resolved before wasting your money.This is a really good movie and it is a shame that it was released in this way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I thought this film wasn't as good as Holy Grail or Life of Brian. I think it was too sexual with too much swearing. The show was funny and so was Holy Grail without that content. It detracts from the experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monty Python's Worst","review":"This movie was a waste of Monty Python's time. I watched it for only one hour then stopped the tape, because I disliked it so much I knew I wouldn't be able to stand all of it. Monty Python is a fanstastic group of British comedians, and their movie \\"The Holy Grail\\" is one of the greatest movies ever made. However, this one is ROCK BOTTOM for them. Though it has one or two good scenes, that's ALL it has. It may be worth renting, but it's not worth your money to buy. This is a disgrace to them and I hope they never sink that low again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par","review":"I have seen both The Holy Grail, and The Life of Brian and this one did not meet my expectations after seeing those. I laughed thrice, maybe. I almost skipped the entire second section, as younger persons were present and we were utterly disgusted with it. If you have a taste for sexual humor, you'll most definitely enjoy this film more than I. The second disk is not even worth slipping into your player, and if, like me, you have a compatibilty issue with Disk 1 and you live in another country, it's going to be a hassle to get a replacement.The fish were comical, and the entire segment on fighting was brilliant, but that was all of the humor I seemed to find up until a few minutes near the end. If you've never watched Monty Python, I suggest you start with one of the other movies, as this one could turn you off of a truly great source of hilarity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone please take it out of my hands!","review":"I grew up watching \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail,\\" so when I saw this VHS for sale at the low cost of $1 I thought I was in for a treat. Unfortunately it was awful. I know their reputation is built on pushing the limits and nothing is too sacred, but this was disgusting and stupid. I have to be honest in admitting there were a couple of funny parts (when the Yorkshire father says he will sell his children for scientific experiments) but it was not worth the $1 I paid for it and I want it out of my house before my kids find it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Python","review":"You either love them or hate them, but you can't be indifferent to Monty Python! This group has a wacky take on the world. Full of satire done in the classic British fashion of understatement and topped with over-the-top energy, the skits from this movie have become classics with everyone having their favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie is 5 stars, but the transfer is terrible","review":"There are numerous problems with video transfer on this disc. The progressive scan seems to be off in every three out of five frames, causing weird blurring and shifting of scan lines. On some players (mine, for example) the disk is pretty much unwatchable. It looks like a badly deteriorated VHS tape. Wait til Universal studios offers a reissue with the transfer problems corrected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear Universal: Please let me know when you fix this disc","review":"First, THANK GOD for online reviews! I was all set to buy this film for the second time on DVD (I have the earlier Image edition) but will now wait until the Disk 1 problem is corrected. You'd think somebody at Universal would have popped this into a DVD player before pressing a gazillion fawlty copies. Well, you'd THINK that, anyway.The good news for owners of the old, out-of-print Image edition is that they apparently have a superior DVD version of the film. Not only that, but its value, which plummeted upon the announcement of this new edition, is certain to rise again (until Universal gets its act together).As for the film, I'd give it 4 stars. Certainly not as good as Holy Grail and Life of Brian, but LIGHT YEARS ahead of what tries to pass itself off as comedy these days.I'm sure it'll make a great Christmas present to myself ... that is, if a corrected pressing is issued."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning! Poor transfer!","review":"Just a word of advice... a lot of people are reporting problems with Universal's new Monty Python's Meaning of Life DVD. Disc Two of the set is fine, but the movie disc is plagued by strange picture artifacts - blurring of movement, etc. It could very well be an encoding problem with the disc itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny - Funny - Funny","review":"Some of the scenes in \\"Monty Python's The Meaning of Life\\" are so funny that I lost my breath from side splitting laughter. I literally had tears running down my face, the first time I viewed this movie. It's NOT for children, because of occasional nudity and some coarse language. It is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOVE THE MOVIE, BUT THE VIDEO IS JACKED UP!!!","review":"I bought the movie wends. and the video is blurry. My friends also bought the movie, and its blurry on these ALSO!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst mastering I've ever seen","review":"I concur with all of the reviews below. There are major flaws with the mastering of this DVD. Any significant motion on the screen results in lines and bluriness on the moving object. This DVD is nearly unwatchable. I can't believe it was released in this state, and it should be recalled. I recommend staying away from this issue at all costs until this is fixed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ideal for quick learner...","review":"I usually do not have trouble following choreography but this workout has poor instruction, boring music, and just way too fast. I have been working out to belly dance, tahitian, hula,latin, yoga, and pilates for several years now so I thought I would try hip hop.

Lin states the history background in Su's days (Sung Dynasty) and the life and works of Su. Lin translated many of Su's poems in this book published in 1947, including, in my mind, THE most fabulous and, greatest poem (or \\"tse\\" in this particular form) of all Chinese literature - the \\"Mid-Autumn Moon\\", composed in 1076. Lin translated this poem not just by meaning but also in English rhythm. \\"How rare the moon, so round and clear! With cup in hand, I ask of the blue sky, .....\\" (page 175). Critics say that after this poem was written, all the other poems on the harvest moon could be well forgotten. Lin's translation is a piece of art. Lin portraits Su's study, talent, literature works, unswerving mind. Really worth of reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best experience","review":"i want to say that this cd is an incredible experience in a spiritual and music way.

He definitely also walked the talk which is probably why he has left behind countless numbers of admirers. His maxim \\"Do not be afraid\\" is something that sticks with me after his death in the context that he meant to not be afraid to do the right thing.Unafraid, the great man has gone and made a cd with prayers and exhortations to do good that I found very soothing and gave me a very peaceful feeling after listening to it. It's definitely an album to be experienced rather than just listened to in the usual sense to of the word.I notice Sony has decided to classify this as Classical given the Sony Classical label attached to this cd but I suppose the content defies rigid classification. For those who loved the man, this is a good rememberance to keep; for others, this is also a good listening experience with solidly-produced sound as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Liked It","review":"Sure, it's not really singing, it's words to music, mostly non-English words to music.

The extra bowl allows me to mix the batches of bread and leave them rise right in the Kitchenaid bowls.Some cakes have a separate filling and a frosting.

I am a big guy at 6'2\\" and 290lbs. The seat moved my riding position about an inch forward. With the passenger seat on, I couldn't sit fully in the solo seat without leaning forward. I tried all adjustments I could. I purchased all stock bracketing to mount it, pulled my bags off, no improvement. My wife loved the passenger seat, she could ride for hours with no problems. I could not. After about 30 minutes, it was almost unbearable. I put 300+ miles on the seat and then rode it to work a week later. 17 minute ride caused back problems all day.

As I was researching grain mills I found this, and used it as my excuse to buy the mixer. I love the mixer, but the mill is terrible. I wanted to use this mainly to grind gluten free flours, however rice comes out much too grainy to be of any use in baking. Even after several runs through the mill it has the consistency of large grains of sand. I tried to contact Kitchen Aid via e mail to see if there is any kind of internal adjustment that can be made, but they never got back to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I got this mill about two years go and I loved it the first couple of times I used it. However, it killed my KA mixer. I have to agree with a previous review that talked about the amount of strain on the machine. My husband just took ours apart to see why it wouldn't work and the gears are shot. I would not recommend grinding wheat with your KA. If you plan to grind, buy a real grinder and keep the KA just for mixing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does GREAT if.....","review":"This product does a great job...what the manufacturer fails to tell you that your local distributor probably would, mine did, is that you need to first run the wheat through on a really course setting. Then run it through on a finer setting. I actually take the time to run it through 3 times. It doesn't take that much longer, and its worth the time. I have found if I do this, my machine doesn't have to work as hard.This is a great an \\"cheaper\\" way of getting a wheat grinder. ;o )"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great grinder!","review":"We have had this grinder for about 3 years now and we love it. I usually mix 4 cups of wheat and 1 cup of soy beans together to grind into flour for bread making and have had no problems.I've heard many stories of people having their motors burn out from the usage of this attachment. If you keep in mind a few things, you shouldn't have any problems. First off, you should only grind no more than 5 cups at one time, otherwise you risk burning out your motor. Also, I only put my setting on '2'. It may take a bit longer to grind, but I still have a mixer to use afterwards. You can also grind your grain twice. First time on a coarser setting then run it through again to a finer grind. I've never had to do this as using the #2 setting on my mixer and only grinding 5 cups max has given me no problems.FWIW, I have The Professional 5 mixer with a 350 Watt motor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I own a KitchenAid 6 quart Professional mixer with 525 watts of power and purchased this grain mill so we could grind our own wheat for bread.It was a complete disaster. Not only does it completely stress out the mixer but it does not grind nearly fine enough for flour. Following other advise to run the grain through 2 times, we filled the hopper with the berries and before it finished (on medium grind) the mixer was so hot we had to stop the machine for about 45 minutes. Trying to run the medium grind to a finer grind totally cooked my beloved mixer and broke the bearing before the grinding was complete. (We did have the metal gear box but that didn't stop the damage that this mill did).I agree with most of the reviews here purchase a real grain mill and save your mixer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm jealous","review":"I actually purchased this as a gift for someone else, but I wish mine was as tough, versatile and sleek looking as this grinder."},{"rating":"1","title":"why?","review":"I can easily purchase a grain mile (stainless steel inserts) made in Germany for this price.

The material and its extent are good, the only problem I am having is one that is common today. It was written by people who do not have English as their first language. What would make the book alot easier to read and less confusing is the employment of a good English speaking editor to polish the presentation of the ideas. The subject is not so simple that one can forgive arbitrariness in usage of words or phrases to explain the ideas.

And I can't believe that the Optera are for real--you have to see them to believe them.The only thing I laughed at was when the Doctor called the Animus translator thing a hair dryer. The attack of the Menoptera is almost impressive. And never before have I seen Billy laugh so much in a matter of 24 minutes!If you are daring and want to waste money, buy this video.

Although the plot is original, and the script is full of interesting ideas, the realisation on screen is terrible. The action plods along at such a slow rate that it becomes almost unbearable. There are many scenes of \\"aliens\\" simply walking around and saying nothing, and these are also dreadfully slow. William Hartnell is pretty good as the Doctor, and Jacqueline Hill and William Russel are alright as Ian and Barbara, but Maureen O'Brien is just terrible as Vicki. There is an endless line of mistakes in the story (try visiting the DOCTOR WHO BLOOPERS site, and you'll see what I mean), and so on the whole, this is only a partial success, and in plot only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, but this was awful","review":"Although the plot of the story is very good, this adventure really shouldn't have been done.

I know graphics aren't everything, but these graphics are absolutely horrible.Finally, the one and only good thing; the multi player.

Poets such as Gerhard Schumann are also treated, though there is little on art, sculpture and architecture. Nazi heroes themselves owed much to Germany's mythical past (the Teutonic forests and all) which was especially loved by Himmler who saw himself as a reincarnation of the medieval ruler Henry The Fowler. There is an insightful concluding chaper on the myth of death in the second world war. As the Reich crashed into ruins, Goebbels was still proudly glorifying self sacrifice in his movie epic Kolberg. In this way, nazism sought to equate noble death as the moral equivalent of victory. However, to what extent all this propaganda really influenced the man in the street would make another and equally interesting book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gary Fong C4 Cloud Lightshere II","review":"Gary Fong C4 Cloud Lightsphere II, Inverted Dome Flash Diffusion System.Turn your flame thrower into a good light source!

This is a CD for all country fans, the die-hard purists, just to show how easy Hank would have outshone them all through the decades after his death using what is effectively \`The Nashville Sound', and the maybe-maybe not country fans who shy away from the original unembellished country performances. Hank is at his very best and the strings support and enhance his genius rather than in any way detract from the original.

Some of the vocal harmonies are a little annoying but the strings really don't cover the timeless enchanting words and voice of Hank (How could they?) I have the entire series on vinyl and still play them. I have the originals but MGM's idea wasn't that bad for the time. They had the studio musicians who respected the music and that keeps it whre Hank wouldn't object.

I prefer that you buy other releases that use mono sources such as the greatest hits compilations and boxed sets instead of this even though the price is right. I sold my copy to my local used CD store shortly after I heard the CD a few times and even the store manager who is a Hank fan hates this package as much as I do and predicted that it would stay in the store forever but it got sold anyway.

They are supposed to replicate the \\"flame\\" theme of the Hunter books, I suppose, but really they are just very ORANGE."},{"rating":"1","title":"THey are nice, kind of.","review":"If you like pretty colors then you might like these.

I've bought many karaoke musical CDs, and knew not to expect professional sounding tracks, but this disc failed to meet even those low expectations. The music was clearly done on a cheap synthesizer -- no hint of real instruments. The sound was muted, almost mushy, but with occasional, inexplicable jumps in volume and clarity. The only song I'd consider anywhere near decent was the Anthem. For the rest, well, you can do almost as well with a midi piano accompaniment."},{"rating":"2","title":"An essential tool for any kitchen.","review":"I have had one Kitchen Aid mixer or another for years now. I remember my mom's old stand mixer, and can't imagine how I got along before the arrival of the K5. If you bake, you simply must have this mixer. Now, there are other good high-end mixers out there, but for reliability, power, and simple old-fashioned good looks, nothing beats the KA. Before any other kitchen countertop appliance, I would get a stand mixer. And, this is the stand mixer to get.Important Note: This model is the one where you lift the bowl, using a crank on the side. It is not the flip-top model (see the K90 for that). This is superior for heavy duty jobs, but does make it a bit harder to remove the attatchments without making a mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Want to Go Fishing","review":"After reading this book I want to go fishing.The author does a good job of describing the special joys of this passtime.

While Miller certainly wants sell training services many of the new ideas in this book are strategic in nature and apply to any sales approach. The home run concept from my perspective is the idea that sales people have to become part of the over all value proposition and the company needs to put in processes that help their channels achieve this objective. While the book is an interesting read, it is a little on the academic side in parts, but the time spent understanding the nuances of the new concepts and ideas is well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THE GENERAL BOOKS COPY","review":"I bought the copy of this book that was being sold by Amazon and was published by General Books. DON NOT BUY IT!! It was absolutly terrible. I was charged $9.42, when in reality they should have been paying me to read that trash. In the General Books copy there were errors on almost every page. It made it a struggle to read. For example: page 86 \\"liNI) of the second book\\" or on page 69 \\"Ac-corJirgly\\". Those are just two of the hundreds of errors.

But do NOT buy the Seven Treasures edition. Though it is a few dollars cheaper, it has no introduction, no index, no footnotes. There are many typographical errors - anything Dipthongs come out in weird characters, and there are several mispellings (and this beyond the non-standardized pronunciations; at various points the characters' names are misspelled).The entire edition looks as though it has been merely cut and pasted from one of the many free online texts onto MSWord, without much of a proofreading. You may as well do the same and avoid paying the 10 bucks + shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious read","review":"Although usually a fan of 18th Century literature, I found this book extremely tedious to read. The plot is thin, and situations repetitious. The foolish obsession of the heroine with romantic literature is overdone, and her suitor's devotion to her difficult to fathom as Arabella is vain, selfish, and unreasonable.

I think Birdie is a neat character becuase she has breath taking adventures like when there is a forest fire and her sister is in her fort inside a tree. Also, I think it is sort of weird how people acted back then, it's just like now - people drink and bad things happen. If I lived in Birdie's time I think I would have a hard time because back then everyone had a hard time getting and earning money. In this book it is exactly the same. All together I think this book is really good and I would recommend it to people who like to read suspenseful books and who like to read about older times"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Literary Treasure","review":"When I was a child, Lois Lenski was one of my favorite authors.

I can relate to the \\"Southern Accent\\". I can relate to the snake in the story, because the copperhead is a menace to my area. Birdie's hardships were so akin to mine as a young girl.

I first heard it in the late '80s on an ECM compilation, and was driven to buy the complete recording. The compositions are spare, but the space between the sounds are as full of music as the notes themselves. The performance seems driven by the music, in a way a that makes me long for more recordings performed during the lives of the composers.

I strongly reccomend this to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best introduction to a beautiful sound world.","review":"This is the recording that introduced many of us to Arvo Part, and it remains a profoundly moving musical experience many recordings later.

I would venture three observations. First, this music, though it can be listened to casually, really rewards or perhaps demands committment. Second, some appreciation of the spiritual/religious dimension of this music seems significant as it is so significant to the composer. Third, this music really rewards high fidelity sound by top end equipment. It is certainly OK on consumer level gear but the purity and simplicity of the music is most rewarding when the sound is as close to being at the performance as possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"takes you to strangely familiar emotional places","review":"This is for me the introduction to the work of Arvo Part.

If the reader wants to truly understand Bondi's theory, he or she should plan to sit down with a chalk board or a paper and pen in order to keep the character's names and their travels straight.2) The basis for the presentation is so tedious that eventually one reaches the point of sensory overload and, as a result, ends up accepting the conceptual foundation of Bondi's theory as is -- which is no different than taking Einstein's special theory of relativity at face value. In other words, for this reader, Bondi fails to convincingly derive special relativity from Newtonian physics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty but sheer","review":"Quite pretty, but I wanted to use this handkerchief to blow my nose.

Laura longs for the fantastic, and a series of adventures which may or may not be magical ensue. In this book and its sequel Eager seems reluctant to fully embrace magic, and to some the mundane alternative explanations might seem to fall a little flat. But even so, there's plenty of fun, lots of wry, unsentimental commentary by children on the foibles of adults, and many, many literary and historical references. Adults looking for thoughtful, fun books which will pique their childrens' interest need look no further than Edward Eager."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesnt fit well","review":"have to shove my iphone 4 in and it doest cover it all the way and is very tight to get phone in... does not work well and only tried to use it for a few weeks.. then tossed it unfortunately"},{"rating":"1","title":"works but.....","review":"The system is easy to mount and the cymbal is easy to attach BUT the mounting system TOTALLY ruins the thread even after just one tightening!

It's fine with a loud china if your only using it for crashing. I have a vintage Zildjian Pang china-type cymbal that I tried with this recently, and while it's fine for crashing, there is some vibration noise when using mallets or using the cymbal as a ride (this Pang sounds great as a ride!) It's probably not detectable to someone ten feet away, but it's annoying. Maybe Aquarian should consider adding a felt core to help dampen the noise...Overall, these are great for china cymbals and/or rides that get hit hard. Probably helps prevent damage...Note: If you're playing new Zildjian cymbals, you're probably going to crack them no matter what. They're pretty, but even if they don't sound like crap, they will fall apart. They don't make them like they used to.

It sets the stage for what is coming more than has an interesting story line I believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Least Favorite So Far, Still Great","review":"I'd give this a 4 star if I were comparing it to the previous books.

Had this been the first book of Ms. G's that I read, it would have been the last.For whatever reasons, (rush to publication, too many cooks spoiling the broth, aliens replacing the author with a duplicate) DOA is a more apt acronym than you might think. My exact complaints are outlined by earlier customer reviews of Allchans and Reedwstle, so I won't belabor the point. I found the book tedious, dramatically different in style than the first 3 and if it weren't the 4th of 6 books, I wouldn't have bothered to finish it. If DOA is your first taste of the series, I beseech you to give the others a try before writing Jaime/Claire/etc off.----Now, on to casting the film, what about Liam Nielson for Jaime? And what about his wife, Natasha Richardson, as Claire?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The saga continues","review":"Once again I just love these recordings. More characters come to life, Brianna and Roger. The music takes you to King Louis court, you can almost smell the roses. I just wish the story could be read word for word, how many tapes would that be? I suggest you read the book first and your appreciation of the audio version will be greatly enhanced. If you do listen to the recording first I believe it will encourage you to go back and read the book for the parts that were edited out of the recording. It does help to read the books in order, but you can get the jist of the meaning individually. I love the books and the audio tapes and cannot wait for the next book in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stories , Fantastic Author","review":"Diana Gabaldon is my favorite author. You must start with the first book - Outlander. I love everything about them. I am an avid reader of many different kinds of books, but non can compare, she is a literary genius. A friend told me about her and her books, it was the greatest gift I have been given. I started with Outlander and continued on with each book thereafter. Loved them all and this one was no exception. She is an amazing story teller. They make me laugh, cry and I cannot put them down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Autumn","review":"Book arrived in very good condition. Reading this one now and going through the whole series. Happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Disappointment!","review":"As other reviewers stated, the first three books were so wonderful I stayed up all night reading them. I started this one, and kept thinking, \\"Well, maybe it will get better soon,\\" finally (actually pretty quickly) deciding I would rather sleep. As a comment one year after receiving this for Xmas 97, while I've read and re-read the other books, this one continues to gather dust on my bookshelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a bit out of sorts...","review":"While the first three books held me captive (I couldn't read them fast enough), I was disappointed with the long awaited \\"Drums.\\" The magic between Jamie and Claire was missing as if they were part of the story because we expected them to be there. There were many lost opportunities to develop the relationship between Jamie and Brianna and the relationship between Brianna and Roger. I think the novel would have been more interesting if Brianna and Roger had not gone into the past, but continued their search for Jamie and Claire in the history books and continued their lives together. Diana Gabaldon is an excellent author but it seems that this novel was put together without a lot of thought to the characters themselves. The characters did not act as they had in the previous novels. I hope that the next novel, if it comes to pass, continues on with the characters as they were originally written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drums of Autumn","review":"As a fan of all her Outlander series, I enjoyed this one very much.

I didn't particularily like being drug through the story about the attempted abortion of a slave woman under very dire circumstances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding,Spellbinding,Non-Stop Adventure & Romance!!!","review":"This has got to be the greatest series ever written. What I love so much about it, is how Diana explains in full detail how a charactor or scenary looks. I feel as of I can actually see the people and there surroundings perfectly.I have just given the series to my Mom to read. I explained her that these are my Bibles and to take PERFECT care of them.I read the series at work and my co-workers thought I was crazy because every day they would see me crying or hear me laughing out loud...you should have seen me when I finished Drums of Autumn. I was so sad because I did not get to spend my days with Jamie and Claire any more. I can't wait until the 5th book comes out.I thank you so much Diana Gabaldon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This whole series is just delightful. Very well written, well developed storyline, well developed characters. Just absolutely great! Huge books, but you'll blow through them fast. Don't be discouraged by the size or the fact that there's a time travel aspect to it (I put off reading the series for 7 years because of these 2 things). The first one is more of a romance, the second is more historical fiction, the third and fourth are more adventure, the fifth and sixth go back to being more historical fiction, and they all have just about every since genre woven throughout. So it doesn't matter what genre you prefer to read, this series will fit into it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Drums of Autumn","review":"Fascinating. I have read all 4 books and can't wait for the fifth one to be published. Excellent writing. Contrary to some other reviews,I've enjoyed the inclusion of Roger and Brianna and the slower pace in some parts of the book. It helped prolonge the suspense. Keep writing Diana."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, this is the weak link","review":"The fourth in the Outlander series. Claire, a 20th century Englishwoman steps through a circle of stones and is transported 200 years back in time, where she falls in love with 18th century Scotsman, Jamie Fraser. Some reviewers comment that this is the weak link in the series. I agree. While Jamie and Claire fascinate me, and I cannot get enough of them, there were other characters who did not interest me at all. Overall, this is an excellent author."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great read!","review":"I was very disappointed to read some of the negative reviews of 'Drums of Autumn' regarding the extension of Brianna and Roger. I did not feel that they detracted from Jamie and Claire: they are a natural progression of the story. This book was just as rivetting as the 3 before it. Many are the times I have read deep into the early hours of the morning, absolutely absorbed. A neighbour loaned me the first book in the series, 'Outlander' (called 'Crosstitch' in Australia). On my way to France in September I bought 'Dragonfly in Amber' at Sydney airport and while in Paris I was able to get 'Voyager' to read in the plane on my way home (23hour flight). I hate to think that one day these wonderful tales will end. Get those fingers moving, Diana, we are all impatient for the next one ....and the next....and the next!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best series I have ever read !","review":"I must say this series has captured my attention and my heart.

I read them and as a lark, mailed them to him. To my surprise he read them and loved them as much if not more than me! His letters and phone calls were laced with references to one book or another!

He, as am I, will be thrilled to hear there are more to come... Hurry with the next ones please!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I loved this book! The characters were developed well.

I was a little anxious that after three books the writing might have lost some of it's power. Not so. I found that the author has continued her along the same winning way as in the three previous books and with the change of continent, infused not only Jamie with a new and intriguing life ahead, but Claire also is faced (perhaps for the first time) with the uncertainty of not really knowing what lies ahead.I found myself enjoying this fourth book as much as the others ( although I think Crosstitch is still the most riviting of them all for it's sheer suspense) and I am chomping on the bit while waiting for the next installment in the lives of Jamie and Claire"},{"rating":"2","title":"Four to Score!","review":"This is the 4th episode in the Outlander Series. Glad it isnt the last! There are so many side stories to keep your interest and the characters are vivid. Of course, it continues the story of Jamie and Claire and what a story it is! This series is so refreshingly different from the standard 'historical romances' they should not even be labeled as such! I've read the 4 books over the summer and am glad to have the opportunity to catch up on my sleep waiting for the 5th book in November. Diana ends each chapter with a lure to go on to the next, thereby delaying chores, sleep etc. etc. Good author! Diana, you are amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as \\"sharp\\" as others but TERRIFIC nonetheless!","review":"I wish Amazon had a 4.5 star because that is what this book deserves. A better-researched author is not out there! She makes history come alive. If you like historical fiction with a paranormal twist and don't mind ( or are thrilled) with saga-length...this is the series for you. Start with Outlander..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing series","review":"I was enthralled with the Outlander series. So much so that I didn't want it to end. I read the first three without blinking but as I came to the fourth, I knew the end of the series was near. I put down the book half way through because if I didn't finish it, the characters would stay alive in my mind. I waited over a year - reliving the story in my head and still not wanting it to end. I finally picked up the book and late last night, and read the last pages. Now that I've finished, I'm hoping there will be a fifth book. I'd love to hear of any other recommendations for books similar to these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diana has once again captured my imagination.","review":"My co-workers and I have looked forward with anticipation to the arrival of this book. We have shared and reviewed each book in the saga. Our only complaint is that once it is over we know we will have to wait another year for the next edition. Finishing the book was like saying goodbye to old friends. Drums of Autumn held me spellbound as Claire and Jamie try to make their way in the American wilderness. We cheered Brianna's decision to join her mother and father, and were thrilled when Roger finally followed. We cried for Ian and the family. Brianna's arrival at Lallybroch was like coming home again. We are all dying to read the next book. Our lives will be so dull in comparison"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a love-hate","review":"Wow! I've finished book four, Drums of Autumn, and I'll admit, I've got a love-hate relationship with Gabaldon's writing. Talk about an ongoing saga, and the end isn't near... First off, Gabaldon is a phenomenal writer: captivating, creative, humorous, passionate, but on the downside--extremely longwinded. I find it a laborious task to read her writing in its entirety, and I often fail to do so. It's obvious that she takes great pride in researching and accurately depicting the setting and historical information, but in my opinion, it's just too many details about insignificant things. Trust me, I'm hooked into the world of Jaime and Claire. Bree and Roger are proving just as intriguing; however, I find that I have to take breaks from her books to maintain my sanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful story all the way through.","review":"I've recently finished reading the entire series. What I enjoyed the most about this series is that it took so long for me to read. I have trouble getting interested in new authors and new stories which why I was so thrilled to see how exceptional these books are. I have always liked historical fiction, especially when it is realistic and personal. This final book is just as good as the other three and I hope to see a new installment sometime soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't even know there was a series.","review":"I read this book when it was first published. I had no idea there were others until this summer. I have spent much time (lots of late nights) this summer reading from the beginning, the saga of James and Claire Fraser. I had to purchase another copy of Drums of Autumn since I traded mine away three years ago. It was unforgettable as a stand alone book, but once I read them in sequence, I believe this to be the finest series I've ever read ( my apologies to Larry McMurtry). The artful crafting of details drew me into the story to the point I thought of these characters day and night. Hurry! Hurry! Fiery Cross. We are not so patiently waiting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gabaldon","review":"I bought this for my wife. This is her third time through the series. She decided that it is easier to buy them than to continue to check them out at the local library, as she intends to read the series several more times. It must be really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantastic Story!","review":"Diana Gabaldon takes us back in time into the lives of Jamie and Claire. The author as usual does her research on the topics and settings and when the story unfolds you can feel the detail descriptions she portrays to the scenes, the attire, and characters. I thought Drums of Autumn was a wonderful book and I look forward (I'm a little late to this author) to her next book in the series. I highly recommend this romantic and adventurous story."},{"rating":"2","title":"How can you not love Jamie?","review":"To anyone who didn't like this book-you must be crazy. I count this series as the best 4 books I have ever read and recommend them to friends all the time. Yes, there are still some questions left unanswered (like why was Jamie haunting Claire in the beginning of Outlander). But, that's why we can't wait for the next installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book but not as good as the first three","review":"I liked this book but didn't like it as well as the first 3 books in this series. I didn't like Brianna and Roger. I guess I am having a hard time accepting Jamie and Claire getting older too. I felt there wasn't as much time spent on Jamie and Claire as Brianna and Roger which I didn't like. I'm hoping there will be a book 5 out because there are still some unanswered questions. Like how did Jamie kill Randall? Or did he? What happened to Jamie's son? I'll be looking forward to my questions answered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Claire's Story Gets Lost","review":"This book is just not as good. I loved Claire's story with Jamie. And for that reason, Outlander is still my absolute favorite in this series, and one of my all-time favorite books. Unfortunately, as the series has progressed, Claire's story has become lost.This book was primarily about Brianna and Roger, who are flat characters and not that interesting. The manner in which the perspectives switched from Claire's first person narration to third person with everyone else interrupted the flow of the book and was annoying.Furthermore, the plot was not as exciting as the other three books I have read thus far. I think I would recommend stopping at Voyager (with the caveat that I haven't read Fiery Cross or Breath of Snow and Ashes)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Re visit","review":"Loved this book, yet again. This is about my fourth run through Drums of Autumn. My original is paper but have just started down loading to kindle.

The tibits of life during this time was very interesting and was woven throughout the theme of the book. I highly recommend the book especially if you have interest in Scottish history"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not great.","review":"I have absolutely devoured the past three novels of the Outlander series, but this next chapter was extremely hard to get through. There were some great moments, and it sometimes made me laugh. But, unlike the other three, this was extremely slow. It almost felt like a filler, with its only purpose to set you up for the next one. I am happy I read it, because I love Jamie and Claire and their story. This one was just missing the spark of the first three, and I was disappointed. I hope the next books regain the beauty that Drums of Autumn lost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Outstanding!","review":"I knew with a new book coming out sometime in the future I was going to need to refresh myself on this series since it has been a few years since the last book. I decided that audio was the way to go or I would have to give up reading other books. I am so glad that I made this choice! The narrator on this series is OUTSTANDING! She brings the books to life. Start with Outlander and make your commute so much easier!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Series of books I've read.","review":"This is the best series of books that I have read so far.

Not only fiction, but romance and historical novels also. They fit so many different categories that you can't really put them in just one"},{"rating":"2","title":"An old-fashion romantic","review":"Being young in age I never thought that these books would be so incrediblyaddictive.

Every woman should read at least one and find herself immersed in Diana Gabaldon's incredible ability to literally picture life as it quite possibly was but also to enable the reader to picture it with her. As a 73-year old reader having seen something of life I read Diana's books and think we all ought to have known our own Jamie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drums of Autumn","review":"This is the fourth book in the series by Diane Gabaldon. They are very well written books and hard to put down. I would not recommend for the young readers as they can be a little sexually explicit at times. A history lesson and romance novel rolled into one. I loved the book, and I would recommend reading them in order. The fourth book is just as riveting as the first three."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as strong as the books that precede it","review":"While this book is still better than 99 percent of the rest of the books available, when compared to the others in the series it is a step down. It doesn't seem to have its own identify as much as it serves as a link for the preceding book an the next in the series. While it is a link, it is a very long link. However, like all the books in the series, it reads quickly for its length because it is a stirring series with well-told tales. The narrative, however, does not have the same directed flow of the previous Outlander novels, and seems more of a placeholder. That said, I can't wait to read the next in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Canadian version is three bucks more expensive.

Thanks Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS BOOK WAS COMPLETELY SPELLBINDING!!!!","review":"I couldn'tpu it down!! I have learned so much about Scotland and its people, from one book to the next that I can't wait until I visit it. I love the heated romance and passiononate fights between Jamie & Claire!! Diana has a way of making all of her characters come to life. I have re-read all of the series while waiting (on BATED breath)for the 5th one to be completed. Jamie is so charming & protective, that it's easy to fall in love with him. And Claire is so smart and funny, that its no wonder why Jamie loves her (along with her fine fat a---). This book has made me analyze my own relationship, and while real love is not picture (or book) perfect, I sure would love to meet James Alexander Malcom Mackenzie Fraser. So for the sake of my love life...PLEASE...don't ever stop writing about Jamie!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No other author can top Diana Gabaldon!","review":"I had long ago given up on reading romance novels and had switched to mysteries. But one day I was wandering through the romance section in a local bookstore and picked up Outlander. I became engrossed from the first page and ended up buying it and all of the ones following. With Voyager (though it was very hard) I read a little bit at a time, stretching it out for as long as I could until I heard there would be a fourth. I just did not want to let go of the characters! Drums of Autumn is even better than the three before it! Thank you, Diana, for giving us a smart heroine, a fantastically sexy, gentle, strong, funny, wonderful hero, and for giving me back romance"},{"rating":"2","title":"Number 4 a struggle for me","review":"While I thoroughly enjoyed Gabaldon's first 3 in this series I found Drums of Autumn a struggle. I appreciate the fact that she continues to reduce the amount of excessive sex and violence in each volume but I think she fell below her former excellent standards of historical story telling. I suspect she didn't find American history as interesting as Scottish and therefore focused too much on an overabundance of adjectives and personality. Lots of skimming required to just \\"get on with the story.\\" Ending also a bit flat compared to last issues but no doubt sets her up well for number 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waaaaay too long and boring","review":"This book goes on and on and on, and never is there ever any serious conflict. Too much GD pillow talk, and too much needless description of leaves and plants and sunsets and god knows what else. Sooooo boring!!! Badly written romance at its least romantic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drums of Autumn","review":"I have previously read the Diana Gabaldon Outlander series. When I moved, the books got lost. I am now enjoying them immensely on my Kindle. This is a wonderful series, both in a historical sense, and entertaining. This is good reading, and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as perfect as the previous three!","review":"Just finished Drums of Autumn and have already bought The Fiery Cross. This book definitely had a different pace and style than the previous three in the series but I loved it just as much. The book switches POV a lot and sometimes it takes a couple of paragraphs to catch on. I really liked getting to know Brianna and Roger more and LOVED life on Fraser's Ridge. The pace of the book was a bit odd as some sections were very long and only covered a few days and others were shorter and covered months. All in all, though, I have been absolutely delighted with the whole series and I'll be sad to say goodbye to Claire and Jamie in a few years when the last book comes out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Author's Excess Bores This Reader","review":"While reading this book I could hear the author straining in the background. Better throw in a rape, a bear, an indian attack, a storm. The melodrama was over the top. These piled on events were interspersed with long boring stretches like where Claire grows penicillin or describes the mountain. At one point I stopped reading to count the adjectives. You can skip 20 pagers at a clip and miss nothing. I won't be reading another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jack Randall saved this series...","review":"... and his absence killed it. When I read the first book in this series, A Dragonfly in Amber, I was happily suprised that it wasn't a run-of-the-mill, formulaic romance. The characters were shockingly three-dimensional and the antagonist was, well, a bad guy with a face behind the black moustache, so to speak.Well, sequels have been disappointing, not least Drums of Autumn. Brianna has the personality of a paperdoll compared to her mother, and unfortunately a great deal of the book revolves around her. Likewise, her love interest is only slightly more charismatic.In summary, don't miss the first book of this series but don't bother with the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Overwritten","review":"It is very difficult to read one book without reading them all, and that is torture. Claire is too smart to be believable, therefore she becomes an irritating know it all. I had no interest in the North Carolina frontier and will NOT read another. I'm through with Gabaldon. The books are too long, for one thing. A better writer could pull it off. She can't. I hope there will be no more of Claire, Jamie, and Brianna. I've read enough to last several lifetimes."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty darn dumb","review":"This book is SOOOOOOOOO dumb! No plot. No depth to the characters.

I don't know how people could ever want to read it.Actually, the book is a -1, but hey, whose counting? I couldn't even finish the book, it was so dumb.

Such as, there was no discussion of term limits for elected officials (federal). How long the terms were for was discussed but not a word on the limits.Also, I understand this book was written by a woman but this author's over use of the pronouns 'her' and 'she' drove me nuts.

I find it horrible and irresponsible for the author to list \\"characteristics\\" shared by party members whereby she paints a picture of the parties as she sees them (rich, men, white... versus highly educated, working-class, women...) which should have absolutely no relevance. She says \\"some voters will feel more comfortable in a party where they don't fit the profile\\". I assume she meant some will feel more comfortable where they do fit the profile. Shouldn't the \\"profile\\" be based on the beliefs that the party stands for? Sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok but biased","review":"This book does have some very good information in it for someone looking to understand more about politics. The reason I rated this only two stars is because you should know that it is certainly written with a party bias. I've started learning more about politics over the last year and now know enough to recognize that there are Democratic ideals being pushed throughout the book. My concern is that this book is intended for \\"dummies\\" and so many readers may not pick up on the continuous subtle (and some not so subtle) pro-Democrat, anti-Republican examples and comments. I won't list examples here because I disagree completely with what she says. If you buy this book, you will learn more about politics but keep this bias in mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pharmacology Secrets","review":"This book is quite a disappointment for \\"the secrets\\" series.

Whereas Benoni was the hero of \\"his\\" book, he's the goat of \\"hers.\\" I think part of what I didn't like about this book was that a character I really loved was taken and made a mockery of. Hamsun seems more driven to show Rosa's spitefulness & hatred, which gets in the way of his usually beautifully simplistic style. Instead of having the easy-going flow of most of his \\"small Norweigen fishing village\\" novels, it's more of a vitriolic diatrabe. Hamsun is one of the most brilliant novelists of all-time, but this is definately my least-favorite work of all his works translated into English. If you're a Hamsun lover, go ahead & get it. If you've never read Hamsun before, this definately isn't a good place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Marvellous Record of a Rich Discipline","review":"I have been waiting for years for this kind of book. I teach a small history of economic thought part-time to two colleges in Florida and my students have been very reluctant to dig into their pockets to buy the original texts - there are so many important books. This handy compendium brings together the key contributions between the covers of one, utterly essential volume.I like the relative conservatism of the selections - the editors do not impose their view of the canon on others and instead treat us to all the classics. I particularly enjoyed the linking material: everything is placed into its proper context.Lastly - any book that includes \\"The Fable of the Bees\\" gets my vote - Godlike Genius!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A lifetime gift","review":"KitchenAid mixers are built to last a lifetime. I use the dough hook extensively. The mixer has cut bread-mixing/kneading time by two-thirds. I made french bread dough in just over 3 minutes the other day. You will not need to buy any additional accessories - the ones provided are more than adequate. The recipe book provided is top-notch and the directions are well-written. If I had any criticism, it would be the overall weight of the unit. But without the weight, I would question its sturdiness or durability. Overall I am very pleased with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"Works beautifully, LOVE the color. Will be using this for years I am sure.

There are no problems, it's easy to clean, and the bowl cover makes any job, a clean one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous appliance!","review":"I have wanted this mixer for 30 years. I finally bought it as a Christmas present to myself two weeks ago. I made a few batches of Christmas cookies and was very impressed. Today, I was making a double batch of oatmeal cookies (the mixer is really not large enough for this!) and as I was scraping the sides of the bowl, I noticed something shiny in the batter. It turned out to be shavings from the silver strip around the mixer head. I ran my finger around the silver strip and ended up slicing the end of my finger. Needless to say, between the silver shavings and my bleeding finger, the cookie dough went in the garbage. I can not believe that an appliance that cost so much money can be made with such shoddy workmanship. I am so disappointed. ....

It has a good, strong motor and has given me no trouble whatsoever.The attachments are easy to remove, the unit is easy to clean, and the possibilities of adding other attachments makes it a great buy for the price.(incidentally, Amazon is the cheapest I have found) Other attachments are a pasta maker,can opener,meat grinder, slicer, as well as other helpful tools.

Wrong!"},{"rating":"2","title":"22 years working and lots of bread","review":"I read the first review and had to strongly disagree. I have used my Kitchenaid 4-1/2 qt. mixer for over 22 years and it has definitely kneaded ten to twelve cups of flour for bread several times a week. I have never had a problem with it. I do let it cool off after kneading before starting another batch of bread. For Christmas I gave a yellow 4-1/2 qt. mixer to my daughter-in-law and hope it serves her as well and long as mine. My mixer also grinds meat, grinds flour and shreds cabbage for cole slaw with the attachments. I'm hoping to buy the juicer attachment soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why did I wait so long?","review":"My 23 year old son recently graduated from college and moved out of state. The housewarming gift he requested from us was a KitchenAid Mixer. I complied and bought him one. When I opened the box to 'inspect' it for myself, I've got to say I was a little jealous that he was getting one. For Christmas, I ordered one for me from my husband. When I got it the day after Christmas, I was too excited! I've used it several times and each time, I feel like a pro. I cannot believe how effortless it is to make cookie dough, beat cream cheese till smooth, make cake batter from scratch, without all the mess and fuss--and hands free! All these years I've been using a little hand held mixer. It still works, but I think I'm putting it into early retirement! The selection of colors is awesome, too. I got the green to match my newly remodeled kitchen. Looks impressive kept out on the counter."},{"rating":"2","title":"No wonder it's on all the cooking shows!","review":"I have drooled over this for years and now I have one! Yes, it was worth all the anticipation. First of all, it looks like fine art on your counter top. Even my husband walks up to go \\"ahhh\\" and pet it! Second of all, the planetary action is fun to watch! Third of all, it really does mix better. Tried and true recipes I've been making for years turned out better after I began using this mixer. And less of my food sticks to the beater. The only downside that I can see is that because the mixer is located exactly in the middle of the bowl, it can be a little tricky getting new ingredients in WHILE you're mixing. I can help feeling like there's a knack I'll have to learn watching Emeril or something. ;o) Shop around--you can find deals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best applicance ever!!","review":"I'm a guy who loves to cook! I purchased the KtichenAid Stand Mixer, and I absolutely love it... it's wonderful! I had always wanted one but wouldn't buy one due to the price. Well, I finally broke down and bought one and I haven't regretted it once. The only thing I regret is the fact that I waited so long to buy one. From mixing a meatloaf, to hot crabdip this thing is great. Best of all it mixes up my home-made cheesecake batter perfectly! I highly recommend this to anyone that loves to cook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy duty workhorse","review":"These mixers are used in manufacturing environments here and abroad for blending batches of textile-related chemicals for testing and quality control purposes.They work well, last long, and do a difficult job under fairly severe conditions.So it should work well in your kitchen, I think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I love this mixer! This was the one item that I had planned to buy for myself if no one bought it off my wedding registry. Fortunately someone did, and I am so happy with it! This mixer saves so much time.

It is a Godsend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nylon gear problem on new models","review":"Having grown up with a KitchenAid mixer in the house (a 250W model that still works after 20-some years) I was surprised when my mother bought a new 300W model that broke the second time she used it (the motor would turn, but the blade would not). The service center said that the new nylon gears were not as robust as the old metal ones. Thinking that it was no major deal, I bought a 300W model. The unit broke the third time I used it (in the same way) while trying to cream two sticks of butter with one cup of packed brown sugar. Reading the reviews on Amazon.com, I have seen a number of others experiencing this same problem...Its true, they don't make them like they used to!

Not Quite...","review":"I bought one of these about 7 years ago because a friend of mine told me hers had lasted more than 20 years. I was happy to have it because it started me down the road to making my own bread, which I love to do. I generally use the mixer about 20 times a year, almost exclusively for making breads.Well, after 7 years, the motor died. I'd like to replace the mixer I have, but now I'm looking for something a bit more reliable than Kitchen Aid. If I have no other choice, I'd rather not spend $200+ on a mixer which won't last more than 150 uses.I probably just got a lemon, but I'm not inclined to take another chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real home-baked bread again","review":"Although I always liked the look of it, I didn't want this mixer. I wanted a powerful, hand-held model. But I received this as a gift two years ago, and I am very glad I did.This mixer never gets stored away; it's too often in use. And using it is a pleasure, with its well designed utensils and simple controls for mixing anything--from slow stirs for creaming butter and sugar to fast speeds for whipping cream in a jiffy. It wipes clean effortlessly, the attachments are as easy to clean as conventional mixing bowls and utensils, and the machine's timeless and fluid forms have great eye and hand appeal.A final word about this mixer's heavy-duty construction and motor. This machine powerfully mixes the stiffest doughs, so you can bake bread twice a day if you want. My bread machine, though simpler to use, has taken a back seat to this machine. This mixer churns a better loaf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just buy it!","review":"I've used this mixer's big brother for years as a professional, and I can't think of using anything else.

Kenwood is a good machine but unfortunately the lifespan is short (about 2-3 yrs) and it is light duty. One day I bought a KitchenAid from a garage sale. I have never heard about KitchenAid before that. I found it a powerful and good machine. I gave it to my sister who also bakes, and bought a new one. This was 10 years ago. Recently the electricity in my apartment kept tripping each time I tried to use the KitchenAid. I went back to the shop (CK Tan Orchard Road) to have it repaired but they no longer sell this product. I am very sad that I no longer can use the KitchenAid and do not know who now is the agent in Singapore.

I have a counselor for many years and find that they take me away from our often stressful world to a less complicated time. They are my Valium. They help me sleep.This book is out of the predictable style of many regencies. However,I agree with the other reviewer for different reasons. This book is full of meaningless conflict. Dillon, the spurned female lead character acts like someone much, much older than any 28 year old I've ever met. She acts like a 60 year old who hasn't worked at keeping herself open. She's had 10 years to get over being dumped by the hero and hasn't done the work. If you like conflict, nonsensical arguments, illogical interpersonal interactions, get this book. Otherwise, don't bother. The writing is good which is why I gave it two stars instead of one star. What a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy read, fun if a bit inconsistent","review":"This is a collection of short stories from Chris Russell....a sort of best-of previsouly (mostly?) published columns from a true mid-pack runner with a cool house and a cool dog.

It gives a good overview of the entire process, from both the buyer's and the seller's point of view.

On this DVD episode, it's easy to tell that the crew are becoming more comfortable, as the sketches are even better and the extra 'Did You Know...' is considerably funnier than the extra on the first release. The actual movie riffing is on par with 'Hollywood'--high-quality, with the occasional miss. It definitely feels like the latter MST episodes with each member pulling their weight in riffs, but with the welcome move toward more of a PG-13 environment.I'm looking forward to the remaining two releases, and left wondering if more are in the works. Here's hoping they do, because The Film Crew just seems to get better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"What a disappointment!!!My 19 yr old son and I LOVED MST3000...watched and roared with laughter at the horrible movies and hilarious comments by Joel, then Mike and the Bots...we were sad to see them go...but got really excited to see Mike and the gang...minus the Bots...were back!Ordered the movie...waited with anticipation for it to arrive...popped the popcorn, chilled the soda and got ready for the side-splitting hilarity to begin....BUT IT NEVER CAME...the hilarity that is...Dumb comments + stupid pre-movie banter= movie not worth buying nor renting for that matter...what a waste of time and money...won't be making that mistake again....ugh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY BORING MOVIE WITH FEW LAUGHS","review":"One of the worst jobs that Mike Nelson and Company have done so far.

It was the blade that broke in approximately half - widthwise. It made very little sense, as I didn't feel like I was putting excessive pressure on it and I wasn't bending the blade since it was in an apple at the time (it was a big apple so the blade didn't even stick out the other side). My sister also owns the same knife and it makes me nervous as I think they are likely quite dangerous and if they break under other circumstances they could cause some harm - might leave metal shards or have the broken part fly somewhere, like in someone's eye.

Interestingly my computer was happy to read the DVD side but reports the surround sound as 48/24 for both Dolby and DTS not the 96/24 claimed.

These guys are the business, they most certainly have the title of The Best Acid Jazz-funk band anywhere...they even sound better live.When your in need of a good vibe to put a smile on your face, heart in your soul and bounce in your step look no further. They love NYC hence so many of their songs are named after various areas in the Big Apple and each song covers the mood and tempo of the city beautifully.Vibrant, tight pulsating emotive rythmes. Fierce Horns and rolling unrestrained guitar playing, a mad and soulful keyboard player, a 'definately' funky drummer and a solid bassist collectively provide a solid rythmatic experience that will never fail to demand your attention & satisfy. Uplifting, energizing and real coooool at times too: their collective vibe always remains true.In life nothing is guaranteed, so it is important to feel good and satisfied...this music will make you feel good everytime Down To The Bone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Are you kidding?","review":"There is no band to my knowledge that can compare to these guys.

You might hear this CD on your smooth jazz radio station or on an urban station it doesn't matter, the music fits both formats. This is very infectious music that has been created in the studio by the production team of Stuart Wade and Chris Morgans. Wade and Morgans, both from Britain, have created a fusion of melodic jazz with a little bit of funk. All songs are based on a rhythmic bass line - this is getting into the groove. The other instruments play off the bass, but its the bass that makes this CD so infectious. The studio band is sax, flute, keyboards, drums, guitar, programming and of course bass. Great CD to listen to when you drive, just get into the groove and move on down the highway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guitar rock with solid songwriting","review":"For those of us who can't stand DJs as rock stars, and who still groove on rock bands that pen solid hooks with trusty guitars, this is a band worth noting. Great layered production and infectious guitar work make this CD a great listen and Lehman's lyrics will certainly strike a chord in your soul.

Truly a book for the lay person who is \\"concerned\\" about the implications of claiming that the Bible, that we know best, is, or can be the absolute \\"Word of God.\\" Falls a bit short in some chapters of really delivering the promise of the title--the last chapter is a good example--and does not wrap the book's basic premise, posed in a question form, with definitive resolution. This, of course, was probably his goal--to get the questions asked and parsed and left unresolved due to its fundamental resolvability.

If you are looking for a book on \\"How To\\" use a sauna for Detox Therapy - this book is not it. The content of this books spends only one and a half pages on the actual Detox regimen but, even then, only in oblique reference to Scientology and one research paper. The remainder of the content is largely \\"How To Build A Sauna\\". The Bibliography is a recitation of sources, many of which are not in print, or not on point.

She learns numerical order, days of the week, months, weather, and seasons. The magnets aren't super-strong as the previous reviewer stated, but I don't see how that's a problem- they aren't falling off. So unless you go around shaking the calendar, you should be fine. I hung mine high enough that my 4-year-old can reach it, but the baby can't. Then we have no problems with lost magnets.

I wish I had not purchased it. I just got around to opening it after having bought it a few months ago in preparation to home school and it is falling apart straight out of the package. The stickers that are attached to the magnets are peeling off. The magnets aren't very strong so they slip constantly. The overall size and feel of the calendar is dinky and cheap. Anyone else looking at this calendar because of recommendations from MBTP, don't do it! It isn't at all necessary to have this calendar to go along with the curriculum. Any calendar will do. We aren't even using this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made out of thin cardboard","review":"I purchased this for my in home preschool.

I disagree with another poster in that I think they all taste remarkably like the flavors that they are supposed to. There are some unusual flavors like \\"buttered popcorn\\" and \\"peanut butter,\\" but surprisingly they are also awesome tasting. The only problem I had with these pops are that they do come in a plastic bag in a corregated cardboard box, but the last time I got them the box looked like an accordian. This is probably not the fault of the shipper, and I would have sent them back, but the lollypops were in good conditions with the exception of several bent sticks.

It 100% stinks for in the dark battles because the blades only light up when it makes contact with another object. My first toy lightsaber I ever bought was the Hasbro Luke Skywalker lightsaber and it was great! the sound system sounded real, and it lit up all the time. And when it made contact with another saber, you heard the familier chrash. When I bought this lightsaber, I thought it would be similer to that one.

Like all the Episode I lightsabers, it is very durable. Another nice thing is the stobe light that flash on contact like in the movies. The downside to this is that it doesn't light up, just when it is hit. It has a cool energy hum sound and a cool noise for when it is hit. One thing that is very annoying is that that the button that turns it on is very easy to turn so when it is being used in the heat of battle, it is very easy to turn it off. One thing that would have made this lightsaber better is if it was longer. In The Phantom Menace, Darth Maul's lightsaber is as long as Obi Wan's and Qui Gon's put together, not so with the toy. But this toy is definitely worth gatting.

I thought, well, Leon Uris, this should be good.The writing was lousy. It was self-indulgent and preachy, but more to the point, it was just lousy. At times I skipped whole pages. And then there were the things we were asked to believe: not only historical inaccuracies, but Adonis-Zachary, the shining hero of the book, predicting the Japanese invasions that would occur half a century later. Or an entire church full of ex-slaves interrupting their service to gasp, \\"Oh God! How beautiful he is!\\" (I paraphrase).Many times I wondered if the author was in the last stages of alcoholism.Finally, the ending was not only unrealistic and poorly done, it was an abomination to the art of storytelling.I really do feel as though I have just wasted a part of my life by reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry and illogical ending.","review":"This book has one of the poorest endings I've ever read.

While the story of the early days of the Marince Corps is interesting and very well researched, there is virtually no action. I strongly suspect, in spite of no official word from the Uris camp, that this book was finished by others. Re-read earlier works for your Uris fix and pass this one by."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment","review":"Don't bother buying this book unless you feel you must read Uris' last book. Surprised to see it on the half-price table, I bought it from curiosity and finished it out of loyalty, having read 'Battle Cry' in the '50s and almost all his subsequent books. This book has almost no military action, an almost melodramatic plot, and (worst of all for me) the dialog sounds like people speaking in modern times. Having served with the Marine Corps, I found some of the sentiments and attitudes hoaky and the romance between the two main characters (this being a clash of strong wills) was wooden. You'd do better with Ayn Rand. Shortly after starting the book, I noticed that Uris died this year; I'm betting his secretary and a sophomore American Lit major finished it for him.

His final two novels, \\"A God in Ruins\\" and \\"O'Hara's Choice,\\" rank as the two poorest novels that I have read in the past 5 years. Not only were the plots sketchy and improbable, but the main characters were contrived, stereotypical and forgettable. His attempt to push a certain modern political agenda through his books conflicted with events of those times - and in the process alienated many of his faithful readers who enjoyed his previous agenda-neutral historical novels. You would be best served to read all of his earlier works - which I found masterful and riveting - and forget these two books that only show the sad decline of a once-great author."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Promising Series Cut Short","review":"Uris' death, three months prior to this book's publication, not only cut short the career of a great novelist, but also another sequel.I loved his novels Trinity, Redemption and QBVII. They were great stories spun in the tradition of historical novels. His story-telling ability and character creation communicate the humanity of the age and culture about which he writes.O'Hara's Choice is no exception. Patriotic Duty and family loyalty duel in this tale set in the Gilded Age that followed the U. S. Civil War. Leon Uris was a great writer. He had the ability to create characters who communicate the age and times in which Uris set his novels.The worst part of coming to the end of this book is the nagging awareness that this is the last Uris novel the reader will read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising....Then Falls Flat","review":"Having always heard great things about Uris's writing I was excited to read this work about the US Marine Corps. And while it started out well the book falls flat with sappy interludes and silly situations. I had hoped for a story of the United States after the Civil War though the development of the Corps. Unfortunately what I got was a implausible love story told in flowery overemotional language that more suited a Romance novel.I would definitely not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Farstone doesn't care about it's customers.","review":"I have read the previous review and I wanted to add to it.

There was no way you could connect any kind of love between Matthew and Patience, is was just all sex scenes that were obviously written to try and shock the reader, which in truth left this reader cold and annoyed as we have all waited so long for this 2nd book. In the 1st book my heart went out to Matthew and the way he was treated and turned upon. And quite frankly I am angry at Valdez. The ending is thrown together so badly that you are left there thinking to yourself, \\"Oh please\\", and not in a good way. So all I can say to Ms. Valdez is, \\"Poorly done, very poorly done.\\" For this avid Romance reader this book is in the trash, not even worth selling to a buy back book store, it needs to be put out of its misery."},{"rating":"2","title":"not Passion but who cares - good book","review":"My goodness, based on some of the reviews, you would think that Passion was the best erotic historical romance ever written. Yes, it was good but so is Patience. If you've been following the evolution of erotica over the past 5 years since Passion was released, BDSM is the 'new Black'. Ms. Valdez did a good job in following that trend. I thought that Patience the character was a crybaby but so what. The scenes were well-written and in my opinion, made sense from a historical point of view, and were HOT!

Now for those of us who are not faint hearted, Patience is definitely your cup of tea.I did not think this book lacked romance between Patience and Matthew. It was very clear that they cared deeply for each other. It was also refreshing to see that Ms. Valdez did not use prolonged misunderstandings as a way to further the story. Misunderstandings were taken care of rationally. No TSTL heroine here.If you are open minded and want a well written love story with lovemaking scenes to raise your temperature, then I highly recommend this book. I just wished more writers would take a hint from Ms. Valdez and actually deliver on the spice level, while not letting the love story suffer."},{"rating":"1","title":"I waited five years for this sadly disappointing novel!","review":"What a sad disappointment! This novel was not a romance, this novel was not interesting, this novel was not what I had hoped Lisa Valdez would give her patient readers after a five-year wait! Her characters and certainly her fans deserved much more than she delivered. I question almost every aspect of this novel. The plot line is patently ridiculous, the characters are shallow and sad, and the hurried ending is a dismal failure! I know I will not wait with any anticipation for any further novels from Lisa Valdez."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment . . .","review":"I loved Passion and waited with baited breath for this book only to find a dysfunctional abusive relationship that definately wasn't related to love. If I could I would have taken a paddle to the hero! Why couldn't he be beaten a few times to know what it is like How anyone can read love into abuse is beyond me. How did an innocent bible toting virgin turn into such a ho? She was too excepting from the beginning of the things the hero did to her. It didn't make any sense. Picked this up expecting a nice romantic novel and ended up with BDSM. I do not recommend this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Left me cold and disturbed.","review":"Ok, now I loved \\"Passion\\" so I am comfortable with Lisa Valdez's style of writing. And her erotic imagery. But this...just left me perplexed.The sex scene was jaw-droppingly strange. He didn't care about her \\"distress\\" even though she was a virgin. Her tears turned him on?and enough with the \\"Yes, Matthew!\\" She is not a dog! I mean, \\"Stay, Patience\\"?? Really?There was no warmth, and BDSM goes both ways. She's not supposed to submissive ALL the time.And last, there would be a heated coversation, or a tender moment about love and suddenly the word c**k would be thrown around. I'm all for it in the right times, but sometimes it does not fit the moment!Meh."},{"rating":"1","title":"patience is not passion","review":"Patience by Lisa Valdez is disappointing and lacking in a true romance between the major characters of Patience and Matthew. Her previous novel, Passion was romantic, suspenseful, entertaining and at the end of story we cheered for Mark and Passion. Not so with Patience. I still don't know why Matthew and Patience are \\"in love\\". The cringe worthy spanking and crying scenes are inserted without rhyme or reason. Matthew is \\"fighting for his life\\" after he was revealed as a bastard in Passion, however, that part of the story is never really developed and the resolution at the end of the story was weak and manufactured( I could have done without another senseless \\"letter\\"). Did the author lose her way? The story was disjointed and jarring. Who are Matthew's allies and why? Enemies and why? To her credit the scenes between Patience and Passion were the most well-written in the book, in fact, the author's \\"voice\\" was most real there.This book was not worth the four year wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valdez Does It Again!","review":"True, we had to wait a long time for the sequel to 'Passion', but the author did what we hoped; she made the second novel even better than the first. I've read other reviews of 'Patience'. If readers think this is shockingly graphic, they haven't read nearly enough romances. Readers are all different, so what appeals to one may not appeal to another. Regardless, the quality of work Valdez gives us is top notch. Excellently done."},{"rating":"2","title":"It has been 5 years","review":"It has been a while since Passion. So while the 2nd book was always titled Patience, this book title has more prominence with the readers of this book. I will start by saying that I have been disappointed in some of the reviews I have read. It would seem that most of the reviewers wouldn't have bought this book after reading the first one. Therefore I wonder about the credibility of some of them.Lisa Valdez is an erotic romance writer. So to be surprised by the body of work is ridiculous.What I will say is this book starts off very quickly. The language is a bit coarse but it moves like a good Emma Holly book.If you have been waiting 5 years for this book, I doubt you think this is a wholesome regency instead of a sophisticated period book.Have a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Genre","review":"This book needs to be under erotica. It is not a romance novel by any stretch of the imagination. This is porn plain and simple and should be catagorized as such. As I am not into bondage and S/M I did not bother to read past the first chapter. Books even on Amazon really cost too much to throw away without reading. Next time please let me know what I'm buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY BADLY DONE!!!!!!!","review":"I am sorry I cannot recommend this book. Patience's constant crying and Matthew constantly spanking her, where very disturbing to me. Their was something very dysfunctional in their relationship. I don't find being spanked and being given commands such as sit and stay very romantic. This has no place in romance novels. Very Badly Done!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking","review":"After waiting so long for this novel to make an appearance, it was an extreme let down. While sex scenes are hot and contribute to the novel overall, it should not be the main focus of any novel. I feel as if this book was 90% sex and 10% story. Nothing of substance was ever really developed here. But, if you are looking for 50 different ways to perform fellatio - this may be the novel for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close to Passion......","review":"I won't give away the contents of the story but I find it ironic that the names of each book speak for themselves. \\"Passion\\" was not just a clever name. That book was literally filled with such emotion and passion that I have read it at least 7 times. Patience is another story altogether and the name of the book is very fitting. I found myself attempting to have patience as I struggled to read through the boring, loveless, repetitive, emotionless sex scenes. I would say love scenes but there weren't any. You don't feel the love in this book. It's devoid of emotion and extremely cold. I didn't even finish it... and I waited a very, very long time for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately I just didn't care about the characters...","review":"I thought Passion was a 4 star book and the only reason I rated this 2 stars and not 1 is bc I did actually finish it. The problems were numerous. First problem was ultimately I just didn't care about the characters. The second problem was the spanking garbage. Pleeeease, enough with the spanking and her actually liking having a sore bottom. ugh The third problem was the long lectures he gave her on submission and finding out what she desired. They didn't even know one another and he just assumed she needed what he was going to give her. The fourth problem was there was no suspense or conflict to make me want to continue to turn the pages. I really didn't care if she played her cello and I didn't care if he lost his fortune. Overall not a good book I did finish however due to the writing style but I skipped over stuff towards the end. I just didn't care anymore and wanted it to be over!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I loved Passion. It was the first (actually - ONLY) romance novel that made me cry. The suspense was excruciating, the romance sweet, the sex quite sizzling.Waiting for Patience was painful!That said, I hated Patience. I just could not sympathize with the characters. I really thought I liked Mark in Passion, but Ms. Valdez didn't convince me to like him in Patience. There was not enough love in this book. The sex scenes were, well, boring. I am not interested in detailed descriptions of submission training.I did learn a new word. Who would of thought there was different terminology for two very similar acts?A note of interest: There is no teaser for a follow up novel. I was under the impression there would be four in a series. I do hope Ms. Valdez writes another, but only if it is the quality of Passion.I cannot recommend this book. I don't plan on selling Passion, but I'm taking Patience to the paperback exchange."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left me with an icky feeling","review":"Ugh. This book is basically about a woman who learns to be a sexual submissive. Not necessarily by choice either. It felt like she didn't feel she had many options. And of course she willingly gives up her love of music for her man/dominant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to read","review":"I bought this book because I fell in love with the writer after reading Passion - one of my favourite books! Patience was a HUGE disappointment. I actually rolled my eyes a number of times as I was reading it - it was so annoying!!!! I really couldn't stand Patience - crying or on the verge of tears at every term. I just wanted to tell her to shut up and suck it up!! Everytime she had an intimate moment with the hero she was always on the verge of tears. I also just didn't believe in her vulnerability - some nonsense about a music teacher who shunned her - and then she wanted to commit herself to her music. And the hero of the book - he just didn't seem to match the character I grew to know and love in Passion.All I can say is don't bother with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the book and not the reviews","review":"Both of Lisa's book in this series are great books worth reading. I dont understand the calling of Lisa's books derogatory names. If you dont like erotic romances dont read them. But if you are someone that likes a good spicy romance then these books are for you. She already has the excerpt of the first chapter of the 3 novel in this series up on her website."},{"rating":"2","title":"The story - minus the domination scenes = GREAT LOVE STORY","review":"I could have done without the drawn out weird sex scene - I know more than I ever want to about spankings and whatnots - the dialogue during the sex/domination scenes were unnatural and archaic but in other parts of the book Very GOOD! another big BUT ------- I loved Patience and Matthew. I love the moral of the story and I loved their passion for each other.I think overall it was a great love story and if you can overlook the sex scene - I think you'll feel the same"},{"rating":"1","title":"if you like controlling men...","review":"I was so eager to get this book, having waited years and being a fan of Passion. I still haven't finished it and despite being 200 pages in, I just can't get over the whole controlling/misogynistic male lead of Matt and how happy Patience is to be controlled and told what to do. That's just not my idea of romance or escapist reading. I read romances to get away from the realities of everyday life and, yes, to get turned on. And this book does neither for me. I will admit that there are some hot and satisfying scenes, and I occasionally pick the book back up in hopes that Matt will change for the better (that and I want my money's worth!) All that changes though is Patience's realization that she wants to be told what to do and her willingness to be a lapdog to a man."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a load of.......","review":"CRAP! I hated this book. I was so disappointed. The only reason I kept reading was because I didn't want to waste the money I spent for this...even if it was a kindle version.It's just a bad bad story. Patience is a mindless drone, who goes from a strong liberated women to an indecisive, crying, mewling mess. And Matthew....really needs some psychiatric help.The whole sexual relationship they had was so cringe worthy. It wasn't so much the BDSM...which maybe I could have enjoyed were it better written. It was just how their relationship evolved and the descriptions of their sexual acts that left me repulsed. All I could think was how I'd HATE to ever be with a man like Matthew and how Patience is just an idiot. There was nothing enjoyable in how it was portrayed. I mean the scene where Matthew 'allows' patience to climax by humping his boot?!?! WTF!!What a shame as I really loved Passion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmmmm...","review":"I don't know what to say. I was truly expecting more from Ms. Valdez. I LOVED her last novel \\"Passion.\\" But this one was sort of a letdown. First of all, I am a huge fan of Erotica (paranormal and historical), this was very erotic, but missing something. Oh I know....it lack the passion and romance like the other book. Erotic is good, but balance it with romance and passion. I felt Patience gave in too easy to the BSM, and Matthew Morgan Hawkmore, I did not like him, he came across like a bully and spoiled brat! Yes, I get it; he went through a major personal \\"trauma,\\" but come on.......I don't know what else to say but Hmmmmm."},{"rating":"1","title":"I waited all this time for this??????????????","review":"OMG... I expected so more more in this story. Passion was so much better than Patience. I have longed for this book to be released. It took so long I really thought this story was going to be great. How wrong I was. I loved Matthew (hero) in Passion. In this story he seemed like a totally different person. I just didn't feel the love between Matthew and Patience. The plot was boring. Towards the end I did a lot of skimming. Maybe if there was a little more drama between Matthew and his X (Rosalind), it would have added some excitement. This could have been so much better. If you are a Passion fan, then you can understand the disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"not her best","review":"This is a nice book, but in my opinion, it is not her best collection of artists' works.

I had to use this particular travesty of a book for a software engineering course and I got nothing out of it.The title of the book is an absolute misnomer. The term \\"software engineering\\" tends to imply that the text would be of some use in a computer science course in which a fair amount of coding is involved. However, you should expect nothing of the sort from this thing. All that you'll find in this text is list after list of silly terms that have absolutely no bearing on the subject of object-oriented software design. This is a book for those individuals who will end up as managers - those that don't have the ability to write code but who nevertheless feel that they should be in computer science. It's simply a waste of paper that would be more at home in a soft management course in some third tier business school."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Protein Lover's Dream...","review":"I have been on the protein diet for nearly 4 years now and have been successful, however you do get so sick of plain old steaks.

You could also say that MacDonald's presents a menu.I felt like I was being barraged by short staccato sentences which were nothing more than information blasts needed to push the plot forward.Mankell goes into the same stable with Yanni and John Wayne.

In the process of concetrating this fruit they strip it of everything before adding things back, so it is quite processed, even though it says 100% juice. Also, fruit concentrate still has all the same effects on your body that sugar does.

We have plans down the road to make this our \\"dream home\\" and this book has given us lots of dreams and ideas for the present while we wait on the future. He will be so excited!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Everyone different!","review":"I used the generic CVS brand the first time with absolutely no problems. Purchased Dulcolax and had the same intense pain as earlier reviewers. I thought I was going to faint the first time and had cold sweats. I attributed the pain to possibility of food poisoning as we had been out for dinner that evening. Took the pill a second time and pain not as intense but severe cramps. Definitely not a mild laxative. I tried one more time, took it last night, had same severe cramps at 3 in the morning and still have \\"runs\\" to the bathroom and it is 11 am.Everyone is different and I believe the reviewer that recommended taking it early in the day as a trial has a valid point. It is an effective laxative for some but for others it is to be avoided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not gentle and not overnight","review":"I was looking for a mild stool softener to help me through my high protein diet. Hhmm, however decided to write on the label that it's gentle and \\"predictable\\" should take a few pills himself. I was on the toilet for an hour just 2 hours after taking this, and a full day later, and I am not venturing far from home. I have been cramping and miserable for about 24 hours now."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worse pain of my life","review":"I've had 4 wisdom teeth removed, gave birth to three children, had two fillings and one root canal. The pain I experienced from this product beat all of the above by a long shot. It works, but if you're on death's door does it really matter? Stay away!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware !!!","review":"This product may be tried and true by alot of people, but I will never again in life use this ! The severe cramping I endured along with the nausea and profuse sweating was one of the worst experiences in my life. I thought I would eventually pass out. I read the instructions and followed them through. I had plenty to drink as well. It didn't matter. These little pills are just mean and nasty. It is not worth the pain and misery. I will stick with Phillips Milk of Magnesia."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Great Product at Excellent Price\\"","review":"Dulcolax is an excellent product and this seller has it for a great price. The delivery was fast and the product as promised. Great Seller!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ducolax","review":"Sent me the wrong package, not the one that was pictured. Did not work as well & why did come fron England & not the ones I usually get."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Tired. The Roots are Tired. They need a new formula.","review":"I started out with The Roots nine years ago with the \\"Do You Want More Album\\" which I believe along with Iladelph Halflife is their best work. Since Iladelph, I believe The Roots desire for both commerical and monetary success has corrupted the roughness and the realness displayed in the two prior mentioned albums. I thought Phrenology was garbage. There was only one track that I liked. I give The Roots the benefit of the doubt and bought this album despite being unimpressed with the tracks that I heard on Windows Media player because I wanted to believe that The Roots still have it. Unfortunately, they don't. This is probably my last album purchase from this group because I believe that since Iladelph, The Roots are not only different they have completely changed their formula. There is a lot of garbage on the radio waves and a lot of mediocrity in the racks of record stores and you can add this album to that mediocre record rack."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOES THIS HELP?","review":"Dance to it: 5Weirdness: 3Catchiness: 3Originality: 2Abrasiveness: 1Self Indulgence: 10Experimentation: 1Desperation: 10Believability: 2Darkness: 2Hardcore-ness: 1Cover Art: 5Genre Purity: 5Offensiveness: 4Accessibility: 6Notes: arguably ranking among their less dynamic material partly due to the absence of Rahzel, or Scratch, and the guitarist's ever-widening role"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice...","review":"This was the first album that I bought by The Roots, when it came out summer '04. I have to say this is a good album, compared to the other albums that I heard lately. The reason I gave this album 4 stars is because I bought \\"Do You Want More?!!??!!!\\" and \\"Illidelph Halflife\\" and those albums blew me away and \\"The Tipping Point\\" is just a tad bit short of the two.The stand out tracks are:Star/PontroStay CoolDuck DownSomebody's Gotta Do ItBoom Dip Bap (The second unlisted bonus track)Nice album for The Roots, and it is something if you want to get into if you love jazzy hip hop"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stay Cool","review":"At first listen, I did not like The Tipping Point but after a few repeated plays, I found a few gems on it. My 2 favorite songs are Guns are Drawn and Stay Cool. Love the horns on the latter. One thing that I really don't like about this album is the limited live band background. Thats what made The Roots stand out from all the other Hip Hop artist in the industry. One thing you can always count on with them however is the innovative and insightful lyrical content."},{"rating":"2","title":"Man, this album nice.","review":"Well, dang the Roots are back. After a dissapointing album, Phrenology, hearing The Tipping Point brought a nod back to my head. There were a few questionable beats on the album, but they still were good enough not to skip. Man, Black Thought not only can do his own style mcing, but he mimicks other styles to a T. I thought the Roots decided to give Big Daddy Kane and Kool G Rap their own tracks on the album, but when I read through the descriptions of the songs on the cd cover, I found out it was Thought himself. Even Kane and Kool G. gave him props. With that said, I warn all of those who are big Malik B fans, he's still missing. Whatever happened to him? I'm about to put up missing posters all over the US until he's found. If your read Malik, we miss you. Come back. Your presence needs to be back. Your not being on this album is the reason I gave it a 4 and not a 5. Please. With that said, anybody and their mothers gotta pick this album up. Roots still keepin it real."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},W=["disabled"],B={key:0},H={key:1};function N(a,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",M,[(o(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(o(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(o(),i("span",H,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",B,"See more"))],8,W)):b("",!0)])}const j=d(O,[["render",N],["__scopeId","data-v-420521fb"]]),G=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/21.md","filePath":"glossary/21.md"}'),C={name:"glossary/21.md"},P=Object.assign(C,{setup(a){return(e,n)=>(o(),i("div",null,[v(j)]))}});export{G as __pageData,P as default};
