The author successfully covers the main areas of current strategic thinking in a style that is easy-to-understand and jargon free. I'm glad that the author pays particular attention to organisational resourced-based capabilities and their alignment to key success factors as an enabler for successful implementation (strategic implementation being the main area where many organisations fail)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Economists approach but Porter is better","review":"I bought this book because I was hoping it would provide me with good guidance in terms of how to use analysis techniques that would support my strategy consulting work. It has a heavy economists' leaning. This is both good and bad. It is good in that it gives some tried and true ways of understanding contemporary strategy. It is bad in that it misses out on the many ways and means by which non-economists understand contemporary strategy and is very thick in terms of its descriptions. It is not a \\"how to\\" book, that is for sure. Since competition today often seems to defy economic logic, this economic approach can only go so far. And there is still no better economist's approach than Professor Michael Porter's materials and this book certainly adds little to that great body of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Informal Tone and Rather Strangely Written","review":"If you were to write a book on business strategy, what examples would you use on page 1 to illustrate successful strategy?

Grant, you would say \\"Diversification is like sex: its attractions are obvious, often irresistible.

Last year when I got a sandbox from the toy store I bought their very expensive white play sand and it was not sticky at all and poured out very easily from the bag into the sandbox. If I had to do this over again I would have gone back to the toy store and got their over priced sand to put into the base of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kat","review":"these things are the greatest. The Taekwondo studio i go to has three. great for all your moves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I purchased the version with the different targeting areas. The concept is okay, but the product is simply too flimsy. The 'bag' has a molded plastic extension that sets down in to the base, and screws in to what is essentially a giant nut that sits under the base. VERY easy to assemble. When I first got it, I filled the base with water. The water wasn't heavy enough, and every time I kicked the bag at full power, the base would go scooting across the floor. Then I tried filling it with sand. The sand was heavier, which help the bag stay put. But then after 4 months of use (3-4 times a week), the plastic extension broke. Once it was broke and I was able to see how thin the plastic was, I was very disappointed.This product would probably be okay for beginners who have not yet developed any power to their kicks and punches, but it is simply not rugged enough for an advanced student."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only a 1-year limited warranty, Keep your receipt.","review":"I could write a very detailed review, but there's plenty of those here. What I do want to touch on however, is the durability of the base (which holds the water).I've owned a wavemaster, and after a long hard summer of daily annihilation to it, the base finally started leaking water around the pressure area (the area that bends when you punch/kick it). It effectively rendered it quite useless since it's not something I could just \\"patch up\\" being in the area that is constantly bending and shifting when I hit the bag.This is why they only give a 1 year limited warranty. I had mine longer than that, so I knew my chances of getting any kind of assistance or replacement were just about zero. It's a bit sad though considering how much this costs. I'd buy another one if I felt I'd get more than a year out of it, but I'm not that confident.For someone that will only use this occasionally and / or hits very light, maybe it won't break as quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bag will break in time","review":"I purchased six of these for a boxing class. We only use the bags about one hour a week. Within the first year, three of the six bags broke. The bags \\"screw\\" into the base. The plastic part of the bag that screws in will snap and make the bag useless. The plastic used is simply not durable enough to hold up to strong punches. Being a procrastinator, I waited until after the warranty had expired to contact Century. They told me they were aware of the problem and could sell me a replacement part for $250 and $15 shipping. I purchased the bags for $249 each, so I didn't find this helpful at all. If the bags were more durable, I would purchase more, but until they fix the problem, I would not purchase another Wasemaster XXL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to assemble but hard to fill.","review":"This is a great bag once you get it all put together and fill the bottom but the base is a real pain.

I got the one with the circular looking logo... Both say WaveMaster XXL but I don't know if there really is a difference so I haven't created an issue out of it. Yet.Secondly, the packaging was crappy... Granted it's huge and the bag part probably wouldn't need padding, the packaging leaves a lot to be desired. Suppose the base was punctured or something?

The otherwise unremarkable Andrew McCarthy and Jonathan Silverman work incredibly well together as a couple of low-level employees who stumble onto a million dollar corperate insurance scam, and as a reward are invited to spend the weekend at his beautiful house on the beach. Of course they are unaware that Bernie (their boss) is scamming the company and plans to put the blame on them. Then, as they say in showbiz, wackyness ensues.Seriously, McCarthy and Silverman are, for my money, THE GREATEST COMEDIC DUO IN THE HISTORY OF HOLLYWOOD.

So, you guessed it, the hitman tries and tries again to \\"kill\\" Bernie. The physical humor is absolutely the best. It's a unique concept. I guarantee that you will laugh until you hurt.

His guitar duets with Eddie Lang will never lose their novelty, because they are music on the level of the Classical music of Europe. \\"Away Down in The Alley Blues\\" and \\"Hot Fingers\\" are mind-boggling. Lonnie's Blues lyrics are original and greatly detailed. He is the master of romantic balladry. He is a pioneer in Rhythm & Blues.

Apart from the limitations the genre and the era (1920s,30s etc) imposes on him, Lonnie Johnson is definitely an amazing guitar player. If you had to listen to just one CD, I'd go with number 4, which includes Big Leg Woman and I'm Guilty.

Luv that Dru...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dru-Addict","review":"Dru Hill's albums all have inspired me and helped out with many issues. However, this particular album reached me. Don't get me wrong, I am one of the most dedicated fans, but I would have to say they hit the spot on Dru World Order. The album is basically about relationships-good and bad. By listening to the lyrics and flowing with the song, I found myself relating with them in almost every way they mentioned. The vocals are on key point, and I personally think they did better than ever on this album-by sharing most of all their life experiences. i would reccomend this album to anyone who enjoys \\"quality\\" to their music."},{"rating":"2","title":"The DWO!!","review":"Dru Hill is back and better than ever!

(2- rating)I would love to know what is the new fifth member for? I did not hear any new voice ranges, or new style. As a matter a fact this is the worst Dru Hill CD I have ever heard. I was disappointed overall due to lack of anything being fresh. There was not one song that stood out like their previous singles like \\"Tell Me\\" or \\"Beauty\\". I did enjoy a few tracks like, \\"If I Could\\", \\"No Doubt\\", and \\"Ole Love\\". \\"I Do (Millions)\\", \\"Never Stop Loving You\\", and \\"I Should Be\\" were okay too, but there is nothing \\"extraordinary\\" about these tracks. As a fan of Dru Hill, and soloist Jazz, and Sisqo, I was completely displeased with this latest project and really hope that future \\"Dru\\" projects are a lot better than this. I don't regret buying this, however this purchase could have waited."},{"rating":"2","title":"best R&B CD ever this year","review":"i think this CD is the best one they have made. their songs are great because it has great beats. it has songs that make you dance and ballads, which i both love. the new member makes the group better, but they were great before and now. I REALLY RECOMMEND EVERYBODY TO BUY THIS CD YOU WILL LOVE IT LIKE I DO. it is a great holiday gift for everybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very weak & medicore album from a group capable of more","review":"Like many fans I eagerly awaited Dru Hill's Dru World Order,however I was very disapointed as the CD only has four tracks that really impress me. Two of those tracks were the singles I Should Be and I Love You. The only album tracks that impressed me were Xstacey Jones and Never Stop Loving You, other than that it's a filler album as the harmoines are weak and the singing is boring. Two things could have fixed this album the first being enlist better producers such as The Underdogs, Babyface and Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis. Nokio produced over half the album, and much of the songwriting was kept in-house as well which was a mistake for the group. The second thing that could have fixed the album would have been a good cover song as I think Sisqo & Jazz could have easily killed Cameo's Why Have I Lost Your or Gentle by Fredick."},{"rating":"1","title":"...MAYBE NEXT TIME","review":"The idea of a \\"reunion\\" album was an exciting thought, but I just wasn't impressed. I thought maybe this one would grow on me, but after repeated listenings I had to give up hope. There are only about three good tracks on the CD including the first single \\"I Should Be\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new look a t Dru Hill","review":"This album totally exemplifies the vocal talents that dru hill has. As a longtime fan I am definitley impressed with the tunes they have on this album. With them writing most of their songs and with Nokio producing most of them they have really taken their music to a whole different level. There is something for everyone. For those who enjay their dance tunes they will be more than pleased to find they have many. And their ballads are more powerful than ever. And as a true Dru Fan, I would really reccomend eveyone to buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Power of the Dru","review":"Dru Hill really let people get a feel for the music this time, even with a new member they still held B-more down. I recommend this album to any fan of Dru Hill even if they aren't fans of Dru Hill, they should get the album anyway. On a personal note, I have been a fan of Dru Hill ever since they 1st came out. So if you don't have the album go buy it right now, so you can experience the new dru singles like, \\"I love you\\", \\"xstacey jones\\", and especially \\"no doubt\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seductive Soul","review":"This album offers the sexy songs for the ladies and hip hop vibe for the fellows.

I purchased this cd the day it was released and played it nearly the whole way from NYC to NC to visit Moms for thanksgiving. This picks up where their first cd left off, and is miles better than \\"Enter The Dru\\". Best cuts, \\"If I Could\\", \\"She Said,\\" and \\"Men Always Regret\\". Nokio has proven to be a rather talented composer and producer. He's responsible for the latter 2. People, don't sleep, even if Sisqo got on your nerves a while back with his arrogance, he has been humbled and returns nicely to the group format. The new member is cool, too, and Jazz looks to be next for solo stardom. The one mistake has been to release this cd in this crowded quarter, had they waited until January, sales would have better represented the quality of this cd. But when the dust of all these superstar releases clears, Dru Hill still has a good chance of standing tall with this solid effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Please Dont Leave Again","review":"If you have any doubts about buying this album let me erase it for you right now.......go out and get yours right now because almost every song can be played on the radio and be hits......I mean wow this time around there's so much songs on there that you can even dance to and it kind of makes me anticipate each video to see how they portray each song......I'm tired of people using the excuse that sisqo's last album was bad so they're not going to buy this one.....i mean your losing out on alot here.

I watched dru hill on 106 and park and the new dude was acting like he was already famous before he got with dru hill(right). I was one of dru hill's biggest fan back in 96-99, but they fell off. No body wants to hear a bunch of dudes sing and take their shirts off anymore. This is 03 and it's time for a change. Dru hill is weak. Sisqo should just came out of the closet and keep it real.

Dru hill is finished, give it up"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still On Top","review":"This new album was well waited for and enjoyed (I'm sure) by the Dru Hill fans. If your not a fan you will be after hearing how soulful and sexy their music is.

This book is a great example of vile design -- neither visually nor functionally strong. It is easily 30% more bulky than it needs to be (and probably twice as costly). The reason? The authors and designers want you to think you're getting something you aren't.What everybody wants with Flash 5 is a thorough and methodical account of Actionscripting. This book does provide some great examples by outstanding Flash people. But ultimately, it's like the huge box that arrives. You pry it open and inside it's mostly straw. Yes, there are some gems in there, but given the number of web sites that explain many of the same things."},{"rating":"2","title":"VALUABLE RESOURCE FOR STEALING FLASH TIDBITS, PRETTY PICTURE","review":"like other reviewers here, i bought this book looking for actionscript meat...having found little real info elsewhere. i was both excited and disappointed by this book, however. its clear from the description that you wont be getting a clear set of actionscript tutorials, so i dont understand why so many people here were upset by that. what you do get are loads of interesting examples of flash components and how to build them. some of the contributions are more interesting and useful than others, and i was especially peeved that not all of the contributions are included on the CD-ROM!overall, this is a good resource to A) keep on the coffee table for a flash geek dinner party B) consult for design ideas C) as a last resort, consult to adapt actionscript examples provided on the CDif youre looking for more detailed actionscript resources, youll have to wait til more books, such as foundation actionscript, are released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the right book for anyone","review":"This is not for the beginners, and as an advanced actionscripter myself, I gained nothing. Maybe the intermediate will learn a few things or two about duplicating movies and if-else statements, but not much more. You will know how to recreate some tired and highly copied visual effects though, something you could of grabbed from the many flash resources online, and for free. But of course, knowing and understanding is two very different things. Actionscripting is a powerful language; if you don't understand at the basic level what certain commands do, you are going to have to be happy grabbing other people's scripts and editing them to your liking, which won't take you far at all. Plus flash is a heck of a lot more than just eye candy. So the basic point is, don't think of this book as a tutorial."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a well-design book; not helpful","review":"I waited several weeks for my copy of New Masters of Flash and I am extremely disappointed. It is cheaply produced, clumsily written, and perhaps worst of all, the designers of the book have chosen not to show full screens of the timeline and menus but rather -- horribly -- display only tidbits of menus inside of weird polygon shapes. You can't read the menu names, see an entire process, or gain any meaningful insight into how an effect was built. The text was written by designers, not writers, so it is extremely subjective and lengthy and quite unclear. A total disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree, its a disappointment","review":"I've read a lot of Flash books lately, and saw some buzz on this one and was really disappointed. I was pretty excited about getting this book and then was let down after reading it.

There are better books on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Near Perfect","review":"The philosophy in this book is meandering and tangential at best.

Also, the A-Z network encyclopedia E-book was pretty impressive (it includes several diagrams and a heckuva lot of information).The only reason I give this book four stars is the simple fact I wish they would have included an interactive, sample test on the CD.

I was not prepared for it to be so unremittingly awful though. The film is in less than bad shape. The shots are not strong in the slightest and the whole thing is put together terribly. They try to dub it and nothing works. In addition, the actor hired as narrator is doing an absurd imitation of Welles himself. The editing is also semi professional. The whole thing is a shambles. I say avoid it at all costs. Even if you adore Welles and think you need this to complete your knowledge of him and his work, you DON'T. You will be sorely disappointed. It is just awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This may be the worst movie I've every seen.

I'm not sure why these jumpers aren't on the receiver box, that would make it possible to make the transmitter box look a lot nicer, which is important, because it won't fit in my existing doorbell housing, and is dangling off to the side.Seems like a few better design decisions would make this product perfect.- Put the tune selection capability on the receiver unit- Make the transmitter unit pretty enough to look ok mounted next to the existing doorbell"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not loud enough.","review":"Bought it.Installed it.Not loud enough.Had to bring it from room to room because it wasn't loud enough to be heard the next room over when I had the AC going.Sending it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like a \\"charm\\"!","review":"The doorbell extender works perfectly.

Once you do take the time to decipher them, the ideas are so obvious that it's really not necessary to mention them. For example (and I'm approximating because I don't have the book around), a chapter would be titled \\"Passion\\" and then the author just has to mention some guy in the 12th century who said something like \\"Passion consumes you day and night\\".

I always get compliments when I wear the red (Strawberry Martini ... but it actually looks more like a candy apple red to me). It has just enough metallic gold sheen to make the teeth look white rather than tired, and it compliments my peachy skin tone very well.

In the beginning, I could not make it through several of the moves without modifying them, and I was a bit surprised because I've been working out 4-5 days a week for several years. However, I started improving immediately, and I can see and feel a real difference in my body. I highly recommend this workout, especially for those who may want a lower impact but still rigorous fitness routine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough but effective","review":"I have wasted $$$ on semi personal training that did not work. I ordered this and fired my trainer the same week. Within one month, I saw changes that 9 months working at the gym couldn't do.

I was in great shape. Naturally, I couldn't keep up this intense workout regime after having my child. It's been 2 years and i have finally found a workout dvd that actually works. My arms were getting flabby...which has never happenned to me...and 2 months after using this dvd set, they are back to normal. I love this workout and cant' say enough great things about it--it's fun, hard, but you get results.

Of course the battle is not over at the end of the book. I am now half through the second in the series and enjoying it as much as the first. This book, Devil's Kiss, made me thankful that i am a Christian cause i sure would not want to be killed by Sam Balon."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have read better","review":"This book is ok. There are some entertaining moments but overall it is a mediocre book.The author uses this book to push his more radical, right wing Christian values. More sadly is that the book bashes gays, equaling them with satanic creatures. In Johnstone's worldview, gays cannot be real Christians.What is bad about this book is that the character development is flat. We never get to know the characters, nor do we get a chance to watch them develop as the \\"horror\\" builds. One of the best things about a good horror novel is that we get to see the characters respond to the horror and go through their inner demons as they battle the evil. There is not much of that here. People either are evil or good. There is no transition.Want real horror? Try Shirley Jackson, James Herbert, T.E.D. Kline (a rare but worthwhile find), Peter Straub and Robert R. McCammon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, and horribly written.","review":"I never give up on a book, but I came so close with this one. The story is a desperately poor man's version of 'The Stand.' It's chock full of terrible, unnatural-sounding dialogue and grammar errors, and it shifts to different characters/scenes with no indication. The same words (and scenes, practically) are used over and over, out of what seems to be unoriginality. Really poorly written. Plus, lots of conservative Christian commentary on life in general next to relatively explicit sex and orgy scenes. Either of those things are fine, and a better writer could have made it work, but it just comes off as strange and a bit off-putting here making you question the author's mindset. I understand it was Johnstone's first book, and he went on to write 200+ more. I can't imagine why anyone would give him the chance after this debut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series","review":"Once I started reading The Devil's Kiss, I couldn't put it down. Johnstone brings the age old battle of good vs. evil to a whole new level. Johnstone makes Sam Balon a man who everyone can look up to and want to try in their heart to be. I've never read a book that has defined a character of class and courage until now. I have read the other 2 books in the series and hopethat there is more then that. I highly recomend this to anyone who truely likes horror because this book will scare you into a whole new reality of the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"A spellbinding trilogy of characters I didn't like","review":"I have mixed feelings about the entire trilogy of books, although I enjoyed \\"Meridon\\" the most. It is a wonderfully written book, full of vivid imagery and well fleshed-out characters, and the estate of Wideacre is a living, breathing place. My biggest complaint is that I just didn't LIKE many of the characters, especially the main protagonists. With the exception of James Fortescue and Will Tyacke, Philippa Gregory paints an ugly picture of people and all their foibles. I often found myself disgusted with everyone, and there were many times when I would have quit reading if the writing itself weren't so darned GOOD. Despite my feelings about the people, though, I would probably recommend \\"Meridon\\" and its predecessors, \\"Wideacre\\" and \\"The Favored Child,\\" as good pieces of literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting conclusion to this series","review":"I enjoyed this book, but it took such a different turn from the first two in the trilogy. I did appreciate the way the book ended though, I wasn't expecting it to turn out that way!All of Philippa Gregory's books are winners, this one as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful finish !","review":"I have read all three books of the Wideacre and trilogy and just absolutly loved each one! In the first book , Wideacre, I was completely fascinated with the evil mind of Beatrice Lacey , in the Favored Child I felt pity for Julia Lacey and in Meridon I found a character to relate to , who is facing real struggles and is someone you want to suceed! This trilogy takes the reader from the intrigueing and intense mind of Beatrice to fulfilling ending. If you are thinking of reading this book you must read Wideacre and The Favored Child first!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it but the tone was way different from the other two books","review":"I won't give the story line up, but suffice it to say that this book is different from the two that preceeded it. Perhaps after the initial shock of reading Wideacre and then the continued shock on The Favored Child, this much tamer book seemed a bit less gripping. I can see how the authored could have \\"fatigued\\" from the wild stories of the other two books, or perhaps she just wanted to have a \\"happy ending\\" without so much drama, but I have to say it was not what I expected. Nevertheless, it is still definitely worth reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last of a Trilogy","review":"This was my least favorite of the trilogy, but an important peice to end it nonetheless. Very well written (as always), and very interesting. I guess I just didnt like Dandy that much and thought Meridon should do what she needed to do without her, but its very realistic to have this barier to your dreams being someone you love and you cant escape it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment from Gregory","review":"[ASIN:0743249291 Wideacre : A Novel; ASIN:0743249305 The Favored Child : A Novel; ASIN:0743249313 Meridon]Philippa Gregory is one of my favorite authors, yet one of my least favorite authors. She writes brilliantly when writing of major historical characters like King Henry VIII, Queen Elizabeth, Mary, Queen of Scots, Anne Boleyn, Mary Boleyn, as well as the people involved in the War of the Roses. However, when she writes period fiction and/or romances without the historical framework of these real people, her writing descends to abyssmal tales of sorcery, incest and manipulation. True, some of these same themes appear in her better historical works -- but only as sub-plot subject material. However, these heavily-used themes, with little else by way of story line, make reading the Wideacre series a chore, rather than a pleasure. Thank you, Ms. Gregory, for your brilliant historical research and writing. But please, don't waste your talent on trash like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meridon by Philippa Gregory","review":"This was the first in the series that I read by Philippa Gregory. I have been hooked every since and have read all of her books; especially enjoy the historical novels she writes. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just ok.","review":"I read the other two books in the trilogy and loved them! This was really boring. I enjoyed the last 200 pages of the book but the first 300 pages were tedious at best. The story was dull and boring and no connections with the characters. The first two books far outshine this book, but I like the ending and I'm happy with it as the ending of the trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting - third book in trilogy","review":"Meridon is book 3 of the trilogy beginning with Wideacre. The second book of the trilogy is The Favored Child. I'm glad that I began with reading Wideacre. I couldn't put the book down so I was anxious to read the second and third book in the trilogy. I think it's important to read Wideacre first - it really set the stage for the other two books - it really helped me understand the original heroine's lust for the land called Wideacre. I don't believe I would have enjoyed the second and third books nearly as much without knowing the history of Wideacre and the personalities of the characters. Phillipa Gregory is a wonderful writer. She writes with such detail you get lost in her books. I also felt that it was a wonderful learning experience about the way people lived and loved in that period of time in Georgian England. Great Story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good Phillipa Gregory novel or trilogy","review":"I bought the whole trilogy that included Meridon and all it did was depress me. Just when you think someone couldn't be more evil or the book couldn't be more depressing, it would get you again. I was very disappointed with this trilogy because I very much enjoy Gregory's work with the Tudor era."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh.","review":"I bought this trilogy after reading some of the authors other books - The other Boleyn Girl, The Boleyn Inheritance, The Queens Fool, The Constant Princess, etc. I enjoyed those books immensely. They had some humor and intrigue and were very well done.The Wideacre series is nothing like the others. It is a tacky, trashy, tawdry, semi-historical soap opera. Incest, greed, and horses seem to be the main characters of the series. Meridon was a waste of time, and the first two books in the series were not any better. I felt compelled to finish the series only because I had paid for the books, and kept hoping the storyline would improve. I was bored with the same description of Meridons hair as a tumbling mop of copper curls that was used repeatedly, and the whole character of Dandy was useless. And even though I don't have a medical degree, I think that the product of two generations of incest would be not only a little farfetched, but not in the robust health Meridon enjoys for most of her life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the original artists","review":"I didn't realize until I received my order that these are not sung by the original artists.

While this is normally good news, its writing style is some what lacking. because there is much to cover that some times it begins to sound more like an encyclopedia then anything else.

It is always a delight to be entertained with an exciting plot, likeable characters, intriguing villains,and a stirring romance. It's a bonus to learn something at the same time. At a time when feelings may be conflicted about our country's choices, this story based on true events, will make you stand up, smile, and walk a little taller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overlong and fanciful tale","review":"Tha characters invented for this historically based tale are just too fanciful. To prove this point may I take readers to the end chapters where British Admiral Langston is introduced to the story. He is presented by the author as being all put out by the actions of his idiot captain who tried to destroy the American ship at the Azores. This is all too Bush/Blair touchy feely stuff and is intended to portray the British aristocracy as being so pro American that only stupid naval people, albeit acting under the British flag, when they loose to an honourable foe, have to be disowned. And by gum are they disowned in this ridiculous story !! It is all about Rule Britannia, in brotherly love with our brave American (though misguided) allies. GIVE ME A BREAK."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book for everyone.","review":"This book is more definitely not just for the sea-minded. It's an adventure, a romance and a piece of history all rolled into one. The book is so visually descriptive, even if you're not familiar with all the sailing terminology, you'll more than be able to understand what's going on.This is a fascinating account of life on a privateer ship with battle scenes that fly right off the page.

Pac's lyrics are always on par and very heartfelt, it's just that the production on this is horrible. If it was recorded pre-96, The music should sound pre-96, not this club-commercial garbage. The producers of this album were obviously too concerned with making it as marketable as possible, and not true to it's original form. The only track that I can see that hasn't been remixed from it's original version is \\"They dont give a F about us\\", which, IMO, just happens to also be the best track on both discs. It's hard, It's dark, it's nine-six, and sounds the way that it should sound.

Almost every track lyrically sounds like 2pac was warming up on the mic before actually recording the track he was there to record. Outside of Still Ballin and the commercial Thugz Mansion, this rest of this mish mash sounds like demo's and outtakes and not actual songs. Also, ...price tag is ridiculous for this [garbage].Also, his rhymes dont go with the beats on almost all the songs. Because they sound like Pac was freestylin in the studio as opposed to recording a song. Props to Jonny J for trying to create something out of nothing. Also, leave Tyrease and Nas off of Pac's tunes. Not one song on this 2 disk set compares to Pac's 4 tracks on the Gang Related disk.

Even though it isn't on the same level as the CDs released while he was alive (including Makaveli), it is better than most of the garbage that is out now (Ja Rule, Nelly, etc.). My second thought is that the editorial reviewer needs to check his facts, because Suge Knight had almost nothing to do with this album. Yeah, his name is on it, but Nas was on because of Afeni Shakur, not because of Suge. This accoustic song is the best song on the album, and Nas doesn't ruin it. You mention Johnny J, but Johnny J also has no real relationship with Suge anymore.

To waste the raw lyrics of someone who can write no longer by combining them with some sort of R&B/Jazz mess of an instrumental is to defame the memory of him. The inflections of his voice are all but drown out from the overboosted inappropriate background. The actual lyrics are tough to hear at times as well, definitely not true to Pac. I've had it for two days, turned it off mid CD (Disk 2) at one point out of sheer disappointment. If the producers let Pac be Pac, and not THEIR interpretation of him, this CD would be incredible. Sadly enough, there is not one truley raw song on either CD, one even sounds country-music like. I gave it two stars out of respect for the man, the album rates negative.

Sure there are tracks like Ghetto Star, Thugz Man.1&2, Fame, and Street Fame, But then theres two tracks that were on a Death Row release way back in 1999. Also my man Jazie Pha does a nice job on the many tracks he produced, but you know Pac didn't work with him. Whats next Pac & The Neptunes!!! This isn't an album were you can just kick and listen like 1999's Still I Rise, you find chaning track after track. Not a must have, but support Makaveli."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"I never thought I'd see the day where I would give a bad review to a 2pac album. This album is 20% good material, 80% mediocre filler. There's probably a reason why this material wasn't released on the Makaveli album or any of the subsequent releases - it's not as good. Much of the remixes sound worse than the originals. Johnny J produced some decent R&Bish tracks, but the remixes try to hard to catch up to modern day production. The originals were much better. Unless you're a loyal 2pac fan, save your money and skip this album. It's just not as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"SCREW CORPERATE AMERICA!!!!!!!!111","review":"This year the evil record business have been making a sad,sad attempt to make money off two musical legends of the 1990'S, those two men are Kurt Cobain and Tupac Shakur. While Cortney Love has been making change off Cobain's Nirvana album and his PERSONAL JOURNALS, Suge Knight is making money off Tupac releases that have been on bootleg since 1997.Most of the songs are the original songs. Like Until the End of Time, most of these songs were tracks Tupac thew together and never wanted to be released in the first place. Maybe there just trying to get new fans into Tupac or trying to make money off his legacy with songs that can be found on ebay with Makaveli(2,3,4,5 and 7).Nas on a Tupac song? Please. This is just as worst as Biggies Born Again.Don't buy this if your just getting into Tupac, pick up All Eyez On Me and The 7 Day Theory. If your a die-hard Pac fan, and dont own the bootlegs, I guess its worth a shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspect","review":"The album is off the chain! Excelleng lyrics from Pac as usual.

Hence one less star! As for Suge Knight... well enough said!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HIS MUSIC LIVES ON","review":"This is one of my favourite pac albums. Though it has a few downfalls the remixes , though they cant stop pacs creative meaningful accapella verses.

Although 2pac stole the show, he ripped it like only he can, I got to put this up as tied with still I rise, for the third best post-death pac cd, makaveli and until the end of time were slightly better, not to take anything way against this cd because this is an excellent cd and is made by the greatest musican of all time, so pick it up if you haven't already."},{"rating":"2","title":"2pac better dayz","review":"If you like tupac go buy the album i think it's good The only bad thing about it is that they put nas on it and they were enemies they made it look like they were firends and they weren't but over all it's good go get it"},{"rating":"2","title":"pacz back with a tite cd","review":"this cd is hella dope, but like me and other pac fans we want the real tracks not tracks mixed with trick daddy and others.. and the orignal beats and orignal songs, but over all the cd if off the food mark on 24th street payce"},{"rating":"2","title":"2pac Still The Best, Even From The Grave","review":"2 Pac's lyrics will always stay true no matter what generation he's droppin' beats for.

The bootlegs had beats that were probably the original tracks Tupac had for these songs and they were tight as hell. What you get on this mainstream version is pure garbage. Tupac would have never used these beats for ANY song. He's cursing these niccas out in his grave for mutilating his songs. I broke this CD into a million pieces.

Pac's rhymez are fantastic, but the final touch made by Death Row iz a little soft, they could have made the album a little faster, anyway...the best songz are Street Fame (true 2Pac), When We Ride On Our Enemies, My Block, Thug'z Mansion, Better Dayz...I heard that a new album iz comin in 2003, can't wait 4 that one!Once again Tupac Shakur remainz the realest out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOT","review":"Songs like Street Fame, Thugz Mansion, and Catchin Feeling make this album great.

This was just the first one where the guy became famous after Pac's death. I don't know if these 2 were actually in the studio but both did this song.

Marcie Johns had known Chase since they were kids and was driving the car when it killed his wife. She had always loved him, but now he needed her. He needed her to make him stop running and be a man again. She made him an offer that would save the family business and was a gamble with her heart.The story is good, even if a little predictable.

It has plant lists that Passionate Gardening doesn't have. I read Passionate Gardening for inspiration and for vicarious gardening experience, but when it comes down to doing things, I use other books.

I would like to read about Mary Ann up till she enters a nursing home or passes on. She has been a ton of fun at every age so far. In this one she is 27 years old. Her twins, Rose Mary and David are still six and still getting into trouble. David has learned to swear and Rose Mary always gets her way. On top of these troublesome twins, Mary Ann now has to deal with a bull terrier, Bill.At first, things don't look good for Bill, the barmy bull terrier. He tears up Mary Ann's chairs and piddles and poos on her kitchen floor. But Mary Ann has a lot more on her mind when her husband Corny starts making \\"google\\" eyes at a young girl working nearby who obviously has Corny marked as her latest \\"bull's eye.\\"Things just may work out all right tho and Bill may have a paw in it. I laughed out loud four or five times and even got a bit onion eyed at the end. A fabulous ending to a terrific series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware - there are ocean sounds in the background","review":"Any buyer of this product should be aware that this CD combines a very good performance of Vivaldi's Four Seasons and other works with the sound of rolling waves in the background, which in my opinion completely ruin this CD. This CD is only for those who wish to feel as if they are listening to an orchestra on the beach. Even if this could be a good idea the wave sounds themselves are much too loud compared to the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coming to America","review":"Of a good technical visual quality, this DVD presents a hilarious story of setting in California, the USA, where for murky reason residing (to follow a daughter on a student visa, or?) Vlad of Russia, speaking near-perfect English, miraculously befriended Joska from Hungarian origin and tries to meet elementary ties while enjoying relaxed existence in immigrant environment of Los Angeles.A comedy lacking of any sense and ending presents clichés of different ethnic groups mixing into a multicultural pot the USA are.Easy viewing if too superficial recollecting of realistic problems exist."},{"rating":"2","title":"overdrive screwdriver","review":"Well made quality screw driver with stepless silent operation.

The top of the coffee maker was crooked, looked cheap, sent it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Knox to the rescue","review":"Dr. Knox first presents a lively defense of the study of the ancient Greeks as an important part of a liberal arts education - there's value in the ancients if you look beyond the stereotypes. Next he defends the liberal arts education itself - again value beyond the stereotypes. Finally, he defends the modern Greeks against his fellow Classics scholars, who surprisingly have been perpetuating a stereotype about how visiting Greece is disappointing and learning modern Greek is damaging to the \\"ear.\\"All told, an entertaining read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Useless Rehash of Previously Issued DVDs","review":"I agree, there is no reason for this release. It is just a rehash of previous US DVD releases. It is not a true \\"Ruth Rendell\\" collection, as it omits the UK broadcast episodes \\"Talking to Strange Men\\", \\"The Strawberry Tree\\". \\"Heartstones\\" and \\"Thornapple\\". It also fails, as it includes episodes 21-23 of the \\"Inspector Wexford\\" mysteries, all previously issued several times, but again ignores the first 20 episodes of this great series. So...

BIG WHOOP!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Acorn Are You Listening....","review":"It's a shame so much production time and money is spent re-releasing the same ole material. It's obvious the Rendell series are in high demand, just read the reviews!! Since all British mystery series are high in demand on dvd and the Wexford tv series is long overdue for release, you'd think Acorn would spend money more wisely and boost their sales by releasing NEW material and stop dropping us in it with incomplete series releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific programs as indivdual sets or in this compilation","review":"I rented all of these sets (and loved all of them) and am now thrilled to be able to buy them together at a discounted price. I understand some of the frustration from folks who've purchased these sets indivudally at much higher prices but it's not uncommon for distributors to combine sets together in a \\"complete\\" package of everything they have available after marketing them individually. As others have mentioned, this does not purport to be an all-encompassing collection of either Wexford or Rendell mysteries - it is simply (and as advertised) a \\"Ruth Rendell Mysteries Collection\\". If you don't already own these sets, this is an amazing bargain. If you do - you obviously enjoy them, so why give this great compilation only one star? It seems unfair to mislead others into thinking that these are second- or third- rate productions when they are anything but that....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"Did not expect this sad selection of anti-heroes who may be either victims or enablers to plots that consistently defy justice.The production and acting is of good English quality but is not enough to overcome these sorry stories.There is sufficient sex or sex related violence in each episode to satisfy those voyeuristically inclined.The price of this collection is too high, after watching half of the shows I said enough and have put it a way forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"These are not \\"Christie\\" style stories -","review":"I returned these DVD's after viewing the first few disc's, The stories are warped and do not leave you entertained. This was the experience we had after watching a few episodes - they are not \\"Christie\\" like in either plot or acting.So if your looking for a entertaining,cozy mystery - along the genre of Foyle, Poirot, or Midsomer - This DVD collection is NOT it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good vacation read.","review":"What a nice read! Good plot, not too predictable. Characters are all people that everyone knows \\"someone like that\\". Heroine is refreshing, in that she is not one of your voluptious, slightly vacuous, young girls. She appears to be large and sensible and unaware that she herself is attrative, although not conventionally.I enjoyed the book. It doesn't require too much thought and reflection. I read it in just an hour or so, while curled up with a cool drink. Great, relaxing reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unbelieveable heroine and just plain awful prose.","review":"I'm a big fan of Barbara Michaels (and her Elizabeth Peters mysteries too), but this book was a major disappointment. I read it twice, several months apart, to determine whether I might have been mistaken the first time, but it was just as awful the second time. I applaud her sentiments in creating a heroine who is not gorgeous, but she goes too far--Heather is portrayed as genuinely unattractive, making the subsequent romantic stuff unbelievable. And the prose is leaden; the plot dull and warmed over (how many times do we want to read this witchery stuff rehashed?); the premise (Heather being welcomed into the family for no other reason than her name)implausible."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWSOME!","review":"This was not my first Barbara Michaels but it has definately hooked me! The twists and turns of the plot kept me on my toes and I could not put it down till I was finished. The characterization was awsome as well.

I was very entertained by Heather and her experiences at Troytan House. This book was suspenseful and kept my interest right up to the end; however, I was surprised by the number of loose ends that were never explained. Perhaps Heather Tradescant will get a sequel? All in all, I enjoyed the book and plan to read more of Barbara Michaels' work."},{"rating":"1","title":"pass on this book........","review":"This book left a lot of loose ends, was boring, a complete waste of time.

Do yourself a favor, pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"hated it!","review":"I have enjoyed many of her novels but this has to been the all time worst! After I finished it, I literally threw this thing across the room because I was so disgusted and vowed to never read another novel of hers.There was so much she could have done with this story but didn't. So many areas she could have elaborated on to make it more mysterious and interesting. She decided to spend most of her time talking about the meals the heroine ate....constant discussion of the food. And the food wasn't that interesting, believe me.It made me very, very sad to read this book. I loved Ammie Come Home, and many others but this was truly bad. Sorry Barbara, but stop writing these if you truly are tired of the genre, as I have read that you are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep Looking...","review":"I have several other silicone spatulas, and this Kitchenaid scraper is, by far, the worst I've used.

Cheap grocery store spatulas work much better than this one.

Suspenseful in every way a novel can be. She weaves the plots around and around, but always keeps the reader's attention. Highly recommended if you like Southern literature mixed with horror and suspense. Her first novel, but not her last successful one, I'm sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling","review":"I don't normally like the word \\"engrossing,\\" but it does describe this book. I could not put it down! The setting is richly detailed and compelling, and the narrorator's sense of alienation was sympathy-inducing rather than whiney. What makes it really great horror is that it only steps over into implausible, not going so far as to be impossible, and that makes for a definate, up-all-night with the lights on read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Start","review":"Learning that this was her first published book, I started reading it actually looking for signs that this was a beginner author. I soon became swept up in the story so much that I didn't care who had written it or how many books they had written, I just wanted to find out what happened to Eden, the main character of the book. Like so many of us, Eden discovers that something is different about her family and the mystery surrounding her life becomes her new quest as she tries to find out what secrets lie in the past. This was an excellent story and the author has a remarkable talent. I hope to see more of her works published in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read to have and to give","review":"Cherie Priest's 'Four and Twenty Blackbirds' is by far this years best horror/fiction novel. The character development is wonderfully orchestrated as she choreographs the evils lurking in the shadows waiting to jump out at you. A must read. She takes you from the wind beaten mountain paths of Tennessee to the mirky eerie depths of the Florida Everglades on a hunt for an answer to a generations old question. Ms. Priest takes your imagination, sculpts it and displays some of our worst fears in the process. I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astoundingly Captivating","review":"It has been a long time since I have found a book that has held me captive and made me really NOT want to put it down. I felt resentment towards sleep and going to work, because that would interfere with reading this book.There were sections that made my skin crawl, and made me jump at every noise that I heard...I felt like I was there with the main character, experiencing everything that she was....I can only anticipate more from Cherie, and am very anxious to read anything else that she puts out there...This book is a MUST have!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"extraordinarily pleasant to read","review":"Cherie Priest has what some people would call a writer's star quality. Her story is small; there are no big words or big wars, but it reaches out to you with the same force as a newborn baby catches you in its gaze and makes you love it forever. Four and Twenty Blackbirds is a gem in its own right and it deserves to be read, over and over again. Finally a writer who neither wants to be the next Tolkien nor the newest Rice, but just herself. How extraordinarily pleasant to read!This book will be my Halloween gift to all my friends this year - that's how much I enjoyed reading it.Buy it! You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This is an excellent book, though I get the sense that Cherie is only beginning to find her voice. She's going to be big, I promise you that! I can't wait to see what she accomplishes in the next few years."},{"rating":"2","title":"All I can say is \\"Wow.\\"","review":"I was very surprised at this book, even though I'd been watching the author's writing habits and style for a while now. She's very crisp, clean, and draws on strings within the imagination-all things which make up a fascinating read, in my opinion.It's onlly lack is that it was too short, so now I get to sit on my hands waiting for another book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Southern Style Ghost Story","review":"I checked this out at after reading the back cover of Preist's newest novel. I loved this book. I am a big fan of the Southern Vampire mysteries, and this one stacks up to those - if not better written. The characters are wonderful, and the story is gripping. This is well worth the read. I just ordered the other two books in the series and I cannot wait to read them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Technicolor prose","review":"Cherie Priest is an artist. Her medium is language and the pictures she paints with words are as vivid as if they had been filmed in Technicolor. I could not put this book down until I was finished with it. I drove my friends and family crazy by reading them the parts with particularly well done descriptions. Priest has an excellent understanding of Southern culture and she does an equally excellent job in immersing the reader in that world. I frequently had to remind myself that I live in Texas, not Tennessee. If you're looking for a fast-paced spooky adventure, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great first novel with a slight macabre twist","review":"Chosen because of the local but very impressed with the story line and flow. Obviously a great familiarity with area and well researched to produce a very interesting ghost story from a women's point of view. Impressive, will have to read the rest of her stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-written story by an intelligent author","review":"I stumbled across Cherie Priest a couple of years ago on Livejournal. When I discovered her book, I decided to check it out. I'm very glad I did. Four & Twenty Blackbirds is an engaging read from beginning to end. Some people might think that Eden Moore isn't engaging or sympathetic, but I think that she's distant and sometime emotionally detached because you almost have to be if you've lived with the ability to see ghosts from very early in life.Four & Twenty Blackbirds has everything that a good gothic book should have: engaging characters, a strong plot, thrills, and a mystery that's both resolved yet leaves openings for future stories. If you're looking for something new to read, take a chance on this book. I have a feeling that you'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing Tale with a Few Loose Ends","review":"I was on the fence between giving this 3 stars or 4 and went for the 4. This was a great read, I like stories with geneaological backgrounds. It reminded me a bit of Monsters of Templeton....what disappointed me in the end was (at least for me), the author failed to tie it all together. I would have enjoyed one of the characters doing a quick explainer of how everything tied together in the end. Part of it may have been that I was reading the Kindle edition, and therefore have a hard time searching back to look up references to history / kinship,I had the same problem reading Monsters of Templeton. I'm still a little fuzzy on how the family relationships in this novel shook out. Even a little family tree at the end of the book would have helped me. Overall, though, this book grabbed me and kept me intrigued to the last pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time Travel, Physics, History: OH MY!","review":"Based on other books by this author I knew this book would be entertaining. It was fun to read how the Adlers, characters familiar in subsequent tales, met and to watch their relationhip develop.\\"Welcome to Ahwahnee\\" contains fascinating insights into the perspectives of a variety of characters living in Europe and America during some of history's most challenging events as well as how common people carried on their daily lives. How the choices they made affected their lives and the lives of future generations is at times touching and at other times quite funny.This tale stirs an unexpectedly wide variety of emotions as the characters move through portals to other universes searching for their friends and family and ultimately find answers they didn't know they sought.Though there were parts that I found disturbing, overall I found it a fast-paced story with twisting plot lines and entertaining characters.Enjoy,Beach Reader"},{"rating":"2","title":"joker","review":"This is a pretty good joker figure and the only one out right now and one of the only villians out until the penguin set comes out with penguin and catwoman the figure is fun and my son likes him because its the only joker he has from that series i did manage to get him a jokerz from batman beyound that he does not like as well though"},{"rating":"2","title":"He's the Best at What He Does...

It's as if the producers of this DVD didn't want to delve too far into the tantric side of yoga for fear of losing themselves in it.

These are continents, not countries - continents with diverse ethnic groups and cultures, and, of course, many different nations.I also found the format of the book, while visually interesting, to be difficult and frustrating to read. It's hard to manage as a read-aloud... and it may also be too complicated for some young readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Blue Book","review":"Since opinions abound here on Amazon, I shall give my own on this item that I purchased directly through Amazon due to the rave reviews.A six year old boy whom I know well, calls Madlenka \\"The Blue Book\\" since the illistrations seem to hover around the blue/grey spectrum, and that is what stands out in his head... not the story so much as the monotone of the illustrations.The absolute excitement of a loose tooth is not lost on children, and Madlenka's travels are indeed fanciful and fun.

Many would agree that this is the case when talking about such songs like \\"Kidney Bingos\\" and \\"Queen Of Ur...\\". Most of the songs here are extremely catchy and don't seem to have the nihilistic or melodramatic vibe that their other alubms have. Yet, their lyrics are still pretty schizophrenic \\"Money spines, paper lung\\" \\"Lies fly in-formation\\".Funny how the music in Bell is so catchy and even your basic pop addict could get hooked to this cd.

When you look at the budget they had and the limitations they were dealing with they still managed to make a fun, engaging film.If you're too young to remember this film, you may not like it. It's cheezy. And the special effects are...limited.

I was not even a teenager when this movie was released back in 1980 yet a group of friends and I made the pilgrimage to a local cinema to see it. With an interesting set of diverse characters the movie plays as a science fiction version of the Seven Samurai. A \\"Magnificent Seven in Space\\" as it were, it even features Robert Vaughn of that 60s gem. The real pleasure of the DVD however is the wealth of special features. We not only have one optional audio commentary, but two very informative pieces. There are preview trailers for other Corman productions such as \\"Piranha\\". We even get a trivia game.

Essentially, the same as the old Buck Rogers TV series. Space Cowboy, the ship Nell, and \\"John Boy\\" were as I remembered as well.What I did not remember, however, as the incredibly awkward \\"sex\\" talk between \\"John Boy\\" and his love interest (and her father earlier). That was just painful to watch. The implied rape of the Akiran woman (not at all graphical, but you know what happened) was unremembered as well. These aspects were disappointing, as I was hoping I was going to be able to share this with the kids. Too bad, because the rest was fairly enjoyable, if dated and low budgetted."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as I remember","review":"I saw this movie when it first came out in the 70's.

Well-endowed Extra-Terrestrial female? check. Well-endowed female spaceship? check. Lasers! Explosions! Sadness! Euphoria! This movie has it all - and now finally on blu-ray. I just hope the picture quality is better than my old VHS copy (I've never heard of Shout studio before)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining, but for reasons beyond quality.","review":"This is one of those shows you loved as a kid, but to see nowadays makes you clutch your ribs with laughter at the absurdity of the whole thing. Well-known names such as George Peppard and Robert Vaughan shine brightly in their accustomed on-screen personas as they settle into their shoot-em-up-space-battle roles as... well... themselves.All in all, if you're into classic sci-fi movies, you will enjoy this film. If you're used to post-80's sci-fi, expect to fall into the MST3K mentality as you find yourself involuntarily throwing wisecracks at the screen. Either way, you'll probably have fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh well,","review":"I finally got a copy of this . Not much of a story , TV quality special effects (cheap), but still fun to watch !

The writing might be the only thing worse than the acting. It is painful to watch. This movie misses out at being laughably bad because you can tell they are actually trying to make something good.

The picture is crisp and clear, allowing you to see all the amazing details they put into the costumes, starship models, etc. Of course the effects look cheesy, they were never meant to be viewed at 1080p on a forty inch (or up) screen; but the film holds up remarkably well for its age and budgetary restraints. There's a lengthy interview with Richard Thomas and an enjoyable making of, where they talk to many of those who worked on the sets, props, and ships (although of course no James Cameron appearances). Overall I was very pleased with this Blu-Ray, and very glad to finally add this movie to my collection. Well worth the purchase price."},{"rating":"2","title":"really good flick","review":"Roger corman's Star wars this looks like,and verry well done for the budget allowed at the time!the PQ and AQ is excellent,it's not like the latest blockbusters but it does its job as it should,just a good old retro flick,enjoy:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Look, sir! Droids!","review":"I'm a sucker for R2 units (and the action figures thereof), and this one's no exception. R3-T7 shows some advancements in the standard molding and jointing of the R2 droid figures, but it's for a good cause - hiding the figure's joints within a more detailed replica of the actual movie prop. I'm still a bit dubious on the merits of the translucent \\"lightning\\"/\\"laser blast\\" items included with the figures from the new film, but thankfully they're all removable. The detailing is taken to a new level of excellence - trust me, this IS the droid you're looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative and interesting- a fast and fun read!","review":"This book has a little of everything. Mystery, romance, comedy- all of it twisted into a hard edged, youthful take on life. Arnie Carbuckle is the everyman- we can all identify with things that happen to him at work and in his social life. Some of the events are ridiculous, and some might hit close to home, but throughout the novel you root for Arnie.This book is incredibly imaginative.

I fries both the cradle and sometimes the handheld (cooked my M515 yesterday for the second time). Look up Palm USB ESD on Google... Palm is going to replace my handheld again. The serial version of this cradle does not have this issue. If you ask Palm about getting a serial cradle back instead of USB they state you have to buy one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fussy- poor design","review":"The cradle is very finicky. The fit is not very tight and I have to press down on the top of the palm pilot to ensure the contacts are touching. Plus, it has it's own power plug AND the USB connection. I'd recommend the USB cable instead. It connects snugly, easily and is only one thing to plug in, plus very reliable long term. Charges fast too. This cradle just fell short all the way around."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least the power works","review":"I agree with the other comments that the cradle is very tempermental with the M130. I have no problem setting my handheld in the USB cradle, but this one is much more difficult to get in properly.More importantly, I ordered this serial cradle specifically because the USB cradle will not work with Windows NT (a grievance in itself with Palm, who just never bothered to do the work). We never got this cradle to sync with Windows NT; it never recognized a connection to the computer. I couldn't get the cradle to be recognized on my Windows XP laptop at home, either. I sent an e-mail to Palm asking for advice or help with this problem, and two weeks later have heard nothing. I plan to return the item as it was completely useless for my purposes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works flawlessly everyday for a two weeks already","review":"I haven't experienced any of the problems others have written. I find it easy to position my Palm on the cradle. I have the original unit hooked up to my computer at home and bought this USB cradle for use at work and it's been working like a charm for 2 weeks. I hot-sync my Palm M515 throughout the day and carry it with me from meeting to meeting -- this cradle hasn't failed me yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"cradle not compatible with tungsten !!!!","review":"The fact the cradle was listed as compatible, but was not was a great disapointment for me.

Better than my old prong style meter","review":"This ph test kit works better than the prong style meter i used before (which was highly inaccurate and inconsistent). The pH test kit is accurate but also a little harder to judge exact pH levels but after a few uses it becomes so easy you dont have to look at the chart printed on the bottle.Im sure its not as great as a pH pen ($100+ easy) but for the price (4.50usd) you can't really beat it.

Ms. Williams has really taken a subject that most authors bore you to death with and made it fun reading. Yes, I said fun.

Whenever a non-designer co-worker asks for advice on a DTP project, I recommend this book. If they are in my office, I pull out my copy and SHOW them how good it is. This small, easy-to-read book communicates basic design principles clearly without using fancy jargon. The ample \\"before and after\\" examples speak volumes-- with a glance, the reader can see the difference between uninformed design and design with the basic principles used.

It has taught me some things and helped me with my job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely for \\"non-designers\\"","review":"As the book states, it's for \\"non-designers\\" -- like secretaries who have to write a newsletter for their boss. Williams certainly speaks to non-designers. To be fair, I already have a background in design -- part of which came from Design 101 when I was in college. I am an artist, and I am already aware of the basics, and much more.It's \\"classic\\" Williams: simple, yet effective samples, clean design, and clear and concise explanations. The gist of the book is the principles of design -- proximity, alignment, repetition and constrast. I knew that already, so this book didn't hold my attention.I really like Robin Williams' work, but this one was a disappointment for me. I certainly recommend it to a beginner, but for someone with experience, it was 5 minutes worth of reading...er, skimming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new","review":"I didn't learn anything extra from this book. I totally got misled by the other reviews here. If your current profession involves some kind of design (creating reports, writing software to do it, etc.), chances are you won't really learn anything new from this book. Just read some of the reviews here and get the C-R-A-P concept, if you don't know it already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complexity presented in a fun and easy way!","review":"Fun to read, easy to understand, and great examples and fun solutions.

One of my duties included advising the students newspaper. It was obvious the students needed to learn the fundamentals of newspaper design - but I didn't know them myself.I bought two books, and this was one of them. I read the first half of the book the night I received it. The prose is clear. The examples are wonderful. There are a few quizzes to help you.

From a programming background, I have long been looking for that basic book; not having time to go thru an art course. And I must say i was totally satisfied with this.

Try reading any of those programming books...yawnnn..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hidden Treasure","review":"I bought this book some time ago, but a brief flick through the pages convinced me it wasn't going to turn me into a designer. When I purchased this book it was with the view to becoming better versed with graphic design concepts, yet when I finally received it, all I saw was text.It took a car accident, two fractured vertebrae and a few weeks on my back to finally read it. I can't believe I didn't read this book before, it has quadrupled my design abilities with the simplest of qualities that eluded me. I read this book in a day, anyone wishing to get into design should buy this book first. The concepts are explained in an easy-to-understand manner, although, as with so many books of this nature, I think some \\"excercises\\" and samples should be available online - you reading this Robin? ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensible and Practical Advice for Layout and Typography","review":"Robin Williams provides a practical introduction to the classical principles of design in this pamphlet-sized book. Her discussion of layout is organized around four basic design principles: Contrast, Repetition, Alignment and Proximity. Each is presented in its own chapter with plenty of you-can-do-it-at-home examples. The typography section explains the principles of Concord, Conflict and Contrast, based on Williams'classification of type faces by style (Oldstyle, Modern, Slab Serif, Sans Serif, Script and Decorative), weight (Light, Bold), Shape (Narrow, Wide), and spacing. A discussion of color is notably absent; the roots of this book in early grayscale Macintosh computing show through.Williams's book should hit the mark for amateurs creating one-page designs such as simple web sites, brochures or business cards. Set aside an hour or two to read it and do the exercises, and your designs should improve immensely. Mine have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I believe this book is so well written that it would be good reading, even for someone not interested in design.

Anyhow, if you want to make your stuff look professional, read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressions from the Creativity Portal","review":"Two things about this book impressed me. First, the book itself struck me as a compelling piece of design work and an appropriate application of the principles discussed in the book. And second, after studying classroom design textbooks for a few semesters, I found Robin's clear and concise teaching style easy to follow, and her sense of humor refreshing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Opened my eyes!","review":"I read the entire book the day it arrived. The next day I applied the four basic design principles outlined to a report for work. Just a couple of changes to the fonts and alignment - Wow! - a whole new document.This is a great book for those not trained in design. I see my writing in a whole new way. My only complaint...the book was too short. Now, I want to know more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Great book for the computer user who cares about how stuff looks.

I found that it really made a difference in how I layout even simple things in MS Word. Get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugly","review":"I may have too critical a background (been interested in typographic design for a few years), but one thing immediately struck me when I held this book in my hands: it's plain old ugly, sorry. The pages are full of obtrusive big and bold letters shouting all over the place (the chapter numbers measure no less than 5 cm), and the fancy font used for picture captions makes for decent eye-strain but not for much legibility. By reading this book, you may improve your wedding cards that you throw together using MS Office, but for a more comprehensive work on typography I'd rather recommend Bringhurst's \\"The Elements of Typographic Style\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"For complete beginners","review":"I was also misled by the reviews. I am not a designer, and I was looking for something to help my design skills. However, this book was much too basic to teach me anything.

I know these principals, but would like something help me execute them better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is that it?","review":"This book should have been titled \\"Last minute design dos and don'ts\\" or something like that.It's written in the style of a magazine article and not what one would expect from a BOOK. It took me one hour to read (not browse) through the whole thing and although I admit I got one or two good pointers out of that hour, I don't know if it was worth my money.I was expecting a book with some advanced concepts written in a language that the common people would also understand but the book is extremely general.I guess if you have zero clue as to what a webpage is and/or how to creat a homepage, this book could be a good prelude to what you're going to buy later because it definitely is NOT enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best for beginners","review":"The very first lesson produces great results. The author has written a very easy to understand book. It gets down to basics right away and clears up the mystery of how to produce clean, readable pages. I am amazed at how easy it is to do well by following the simple instructions. With the author's methods, anyone can produce professional work that will keep the reader interested. Besides the wonderful style, the writer uses subtle humor to push important points."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderfully concise, and practical guide to basic design","review":"This basic guide to design principles is not only clearly written, it \\"walks the walk\\" as well as \\"talks the talk\\". That is, the basic principles are demonstrated clearly by the book's many \\"before and after\\" graphic examples. It is non-technical and easy to understand. It focuses on a few core ideas that will help anybody improve his or her ability to design attractive printed material. There is some overlap between this and the author's book on web design (The Nondesigners' Web Book), but I found both worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made me a believer","review":"I'm a programmer who is occasionally forced into web design issues. I found this book to be invaluable.For a long time I've had designer friends, seen design books and so on but never found one that distills the basic concepts in such a concise and clear voice.I also, for a long time, attributed design to a vague notion of taste or artistic sensibility when there are facile principles (or best practices) for graphic design.I'm disappointed with the people who reviewed this book seemingly without looking at the title: FOR NON DESIGNERS.

You can sometimes let a backhand shot go from the blue line, and it will go in! unforgiveable. when you are playing, the crowd looks like colored paper, but that is not relivent. Also, there is no player or golie boost in season mode. Also unforgiveable. Don Taylor has dropped many of his dumb jokes, but some are still there. Otherwise, this game is one of the best.

The graphics are greatly improved, and yes, the announcer guy is still annoying, but the music has gotten annoying. I liked last year's more, and at the same time the music this year is kind of featured in a way so as to appear as a music video. Wierd, and lesser quality music.

This game has many improvments over 2002. The only problem is that you cannot change your controls settings. You can only run this game in open gl it does not support direct 3d cards. Most of the gforce 3 cards and radeon cards will not run this game. It is a very fun game if you disreguard these minor problems. It has all the hockey teams in the NHL and some hockey teams from around the world(plus a secret afghanistan team)(it has not china team).

The goalie stance will be alot better, the goalie will now sprawl around like Dominik Hasek (for those who dont know who that is he is a really really GOOD goalie, but sadly he retired.)as in he will lift his legs dive and all sorts of thing they do. The graphics are stunning because you can see the threads on the players socks and the WHOLE ENTIRE audience is 3D. This game features basicly everything that they had last year like NHL cards all 30 teams plus 20 International teams, and you can create your own player with MORE facial options than last year. The games modes are season, play now, playoff, and tournament.

Unfortunatly the recording & performance is too [messed] to save the cuts - it's too bad they never did those songs in the studio.

I once subscribed several years ago and, although it was a look at the pictures and toss after skimming type of magazine, thought enough of the magazine to give it another try, but take my advice and save your money.

But the singer's delivery is so close to Thom Yorke's, you start to ask, \\"Is this an homage or a forgery?\\" These guys are talented, and they have credible influences, but the music's just not original. If you're looking for emotional, epic, radio friendly guitar rock, find yourself Radiohead's Pablo Honey or the Bends and get the real thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"already been done before and by a lot better bands","review":"This album sounds like a million other things. It especially sounds very similar to Radiohead's first two releases. While Radiohead has moved on from The Bends and Pablo Honey, the Radiohead rip off groups, such as Palo Alto, enjoy mimicking the sound of those first two albums. The songs aren't even good on this album. They're really boring. If you're looking for a good rock group with well written songs and some original ideas listen to Travis or The Verve, or of course U2 or Radiohead who Palo Alto obviously listened to. There's nothing wrong with learning from other music. These guys didnt learn though because that means that they would have been thinking. There is no original thought in this album at all. Being influenced is one thing but trying to sound just like a band is something else. Don't buy this, that's my advice to you. Also know that if you don't have OK Computer yet that you need to get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"PALOALTO HITS BIG WITH DEBUT ALBUM","review":"Rock music received a much needed boost on 10/18/00 when Paloalto released thier premiere album after fout months of recording in studio with the legendary Rick Rubin producing. Real songs with genuine lyrics and powerful music are refreshing to hear. Leadman vocalist/songwriter James Grundler has a dynamic voice that is complimented extremely well by the lead guitar work of soon to be well recognized Jason Johnson. The band has been well received by many in the music industry, at least well enough to be asked to tour with Stone Temple Pilots and Peral Jam this past summer. Do yourself a favor and purchase this disk. Be the first to turn other rock enthusiasts on to some really good tunes. Watch out for these new comers as they shold be getting increasing radio play across the country.

However, trailing in the wake of a thousand and one (mostly British) bands like Travis, Doves, Coldplay Deckard, Witness, Muse, et al who all ape Jeff Buckley and Thom Yorke's keening voice and melodramatic style, Paloalto is quite painful to listen to. They are definitely the most American of the \\"delicate boy's voice over raging guitars\\" bit, but they have nothing interesting to say. Shame on Rick Rubin and the folks at Columbia/American Recording who thought that they could jump on the bandwagon--as always, the third generation is a distant xerox of the originals. Undoubtedly someone will claim that they are a wonderful band with much rock passion and so forth, well, to each their own, but if you would be better off getting \\"The Man Who\\" or \\"OK Computer\\" or even Grandaddy's \\"Sophtware Slump.\\" Incidentally, avoid at all costs Witness UK's album, as it is complete crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not get it","review":"I hate to be a jerk, but it is bad - simply do not get it - if the music was as good as the cover of the album we would okay - but it falls oh so short - I can't believe that Rick Rubin signed them, let alone produced them - get something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Promising","review":"Yes, they're similar to Radiohead, but there's more than that. Though certainly not revolutionary, they've created something of their own here. There's a lot of interesting substance on this CD, even if the formula is borrowed. My personal favorite songs are Depression Age, Home, Throw the Brick, and Made of Stone, the album closer. The album isn't as consistent as it might be, either. There are a couple weak tracks here that could've gone away, but it doesn't hurt the CD fatally. Personally, I'm excited for their next release.

He also shows considerable knowledge of Egypt and archeology. These could be the elements of an excellent book or series of books.Unfortunately, he seems to have Hollywood movie rights in mind instead. \\"Cambyses\\" could go straight to video as a B-actioner with its über-villains, cartoon henchmen, impossible coincidences, repeated hairbreadth escapes, stupid action sequences, apocalyptic conclusion, etc. It's further marred by needlessly gruesome descriptions, and soiled by the gratuitous rape / humiliation threats of a ludicrously obscene thug.

However, it turned out to be a slow-moving, pedestrian \\"boy and girl running away in the wilderness from evil people\\" tale. Every cliche appears: the pebble slipping down the hill, giving the good guys' position away; the kindly \\"Columbo\\" like under-rated detective; the coincidences that lead our heroes to run into EXACTLY the particular people who have the unique knowledge they need--at just the right times. Oh, and, of course, the Americans in the novel are all sadistic, boorish louts.Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Lost Army Of Cambyses","review":"This book has a really great story line, but in my opinion it was not well written. I was more interested in the lost army of Cambyses and was disappointed to find that it was just a backdrop for the real story which had nothing to do with Cambyeses.The story line is difficult to follow at times and could have been developed better along more classic lines. The author chose to follow lines of thinking that, I believe, interfered with the story line and actually detracted from what could have been a truly great story. The sexual content that was added was sadistic and violent and detracted from the content of the story as well. It is too bad, because the story line was such, that it could have been a classic which could have been enjoyed by multitudes of readers for years to come had it been developed better."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont waste your money and time","review":"The only reason I gave the book 2 stars is because the author knows something about the archaeology of ancient Egypt, and because he uses the mistry of Cambyses's Army to base the plot on.The book has an unbelievable plot like a third rate movie. The characters are shallowly and two-dimensionally delineated-absolutly no deapth of character. The plot is standard holywood type (as if the writer was actually using a novice writer manual for cheap thrillers).In short- no meat!Save your valuable time and money for better stuff !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond Awful","review":"I'll make this short. I agree wholeheartedly with the 1 and 2 star reviews listed here. Had great hopes for this book from the liner notes but the story and characters were laughable. But what was truly jaw-dropping was the writing - so awful as to be almost a joke. Beyond painful to read. How did this book get past any editor worth his salt. Does this writer have no pride or simply no talent at all. I've seen cartoons that had better writing and characterizations. Both the author and Grove Press should be ashamed of themselves for foisting this abysmal charade on the public, not to mention the poor trees that died to produce it.

Then, it started to pick up, and the ending was full of several surprises that I did not see coming.After finishing it, I am definitely glad I read it and thoroughly enjoyed it on the whole, and recommend it to anyone looking for a interesting story with several good twists.

However, my five-year-old and I were immediately frustrated.To start with, if your default disk for Windows is anything other than c:, this software crashes. That's an indication of badly-engineered code.But it isn't just attention to detail to software engineering that makes this program a bust. The way that the kid interacts with it is confusing and boring. It comes nowhere close to matching the interest generated by the other three kindergarten titles we've tried: Reader Rabbit Kindergarten, Arthur's Kindergarten, and even the very sleepy but serviceable older title from Disney, \\"Winnie the Pooh Kindergarten\\".My child will never ask to use this product again, I'm sure.

The episode was somewhat in the realm of the Twilight Zone and Outer Limits in a way, but of course it's Dr. Who, in my opinion is the most creative (and intelligent) science fiction series in television history. I liked both Jamie and Zoe in this one when they get lost in this strange dimension where time and space doesn't exist and fantasies and storybook characters come to life. Doctor #2 was an interesting character, but not as much wit and charm as the Doctors I'm used to seeing like Tom Baker (#4). In all, Mind Robber is so fun to watch, very nostalgic. I recommend this video to fans of both Dr. Who and classic science fiction fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting point...","review":"An interesting point about this story is that Frazer Hines was sick for part of the filming.

This was a great bargain, and sure beats the heck out of carrying the planer to the workbench when I'm ready to use it.

The central focus of the book is Napoleon's relations with his largely disloyal and useless family members, who owed their success, such as it was, only to his genius for leadership. The author has a humorous writing style which should receive a larger audience. Highly recommended. Writer was justifiably famous during his lifetime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Melodrama...and the emperor!","review":"While this is an impressive work, it has many qualities that keep me from recommending it. Others have mentioned the dearth of dates for historical context. I will concentrate on the most aggravating quality of all.Ludwig's use of the present tense is an affectation that not only grates but casts doubt. Is this history or fiction? Combine this with his penchant for melodramatic exclamations and it frequently feels like you are on a \\"living history\\" bus tour with William Shatner as guide: \\"Look! There comes Napoleon down the street! Now he will exact his revenge on Paoli. Never again shall they laugh at Bonaparte. Insolent fools!\\"The information can be insightful but I can't tell where the facts end and the fanciful editorializing begins."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of twists and turns--great movie","review":"This movie was great.

It sure surprised me. Rent it or buy, but as long as you see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining thriller!","review":"When is this film going to be on DVD?A well-styled thriller mystery with a great cast. Tom Berenger does well as a confused amnesiac who just wants to get to the truth behind his accident--even if it means he discovers things he doesn't really want to know. The ever-lovable Bob Hoskins plays the detective who helps him uncover the truth. Greta Scacchi is his loyal wife (with perhaps a few secrets?).This film is very engrossing and entertaining. Even though I usually can guess the way a mystery movie is going to go (I am getting pretty good at predicting \\"who dunnit\\") this movie had a few more twists that I anticipated. I really enjoyed the surprises in the plot.There are some unanswered questions left unanswered, and more than a few plot holes. But still--don't let that keep you from enjoying the mystery. It's a greatly entertaining tale. It certainly is due for a DVD version!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspenseful movie with a twist.","review":"Tom Berenger plays a man who was in a severe car accident and has no memory of the man he once was.

When Tom Berenger awakes from a bad car accident he finds he can not remember much. He begins to see flashbacks and his conversations with others help him to realize who he really was and who was murdered. This is one of the better movies I have seen Berenger in and I enjoyed it. Good supporting cast, music, and sets. Well worth owning on DVD.

Tom Berenger stars as David Merrick, a wealthy businessman who is in a horrible car crash, needs plastic surgery and has amnesia to boot. Greta Scacchi is his devoted wife who tries to nurse him back to health and help him remember his past. Bob Hoskins shines as a pet store owner/private investigator who also tries to piece the puzzle together. All is not as it seems though; is Scacchi trying to kill her husband? Is she having an affair with a handsome stranger? Is Corbin Bernsen wearing a toupee?The movie keeps your interest and although the twist at the end is fairly obvious, it does keep you guessing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of an early 90s relic","review":"Tom Berenger is the lead here, but he's kind of expressionless as the architect who can't remember. It's a standard amnesia thriller. Bob Hoskins has a key role as a private eye, but he plays it like a TV detective show, so it's less than interesting. There are no scary parts, but the plot does thicken as the thing goes along, somewhat ploddingly. I wasn't hooked at any point. It also suffers a number of unrealistic situations, such the end when everyone flies off in a cop helicopter, ignoring the burning wreck below. That would not happen. This seems more dated than 1991 to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has good twists and turns but the acting is bad","review":"A typically early 90's thriller like Basic Instinct, Fatel Attractiona nd Indecient Praposel.

I am really happy to get this extra memory and back home to manage my palm even better. However, only the appz itself (34KB) can be moved to the card and the DB still left in the 8MB ram area in order to work.Normally, the appz is small relative to the supporting DB. Palm has promised to give you a chance to expand but don't be mislead by the number of MB available. For the time being, a 2MB expansion card is good enough for you to hold that extra piece of sw.Not until all, at least most, sw vendor/developer promised to make their appz support the card then you intend to buy one. It's really useless.I will pcik ZERO star but amazon let me have at least one."},{"rating":"1","title":"It does what it says... and thats it.","review":"I just bought the Palm m505 and this memory card. I assumed that it would triple my memory without a problem. I was half right. It tripled my memory, but only for applications that do not access other files. In other words, your Palm (and I assume any other device using this card) will not be able to access document files put on the card. Nor will readers on the card be able to access the normal memory. I use about 85% of the normal 8 megas on the palm and most of that is for documents and books. This card is useless for that. Right now I have installed everything that I can get to run on the card and its less then 1 MB. I have memory, but nothing that goes on it is very big and the big files wont work on it.I gave it 2 stars because it did do what it said. If I find a way around this dilemna I will love what it can do. Bottom line, it promises more then it delivers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced, undersized","review":"This card is a sham folks, save your money and get a 16MB or 32MB MMC or SD card and download BackupBuddy. They offer two versions, a free utility that installs onto the card and the palm that allows you to do manual backups and restores. Or a very cheap shareware version that does automated incremental backups, encrypts the backup files. Both versions allow you to restore from the card without having to reload the software into the palm.I don't know why Palm choose to sell this card at such a high price... it seems like they took an MMC card and put a backup utility on it, and doubled the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but too expensive","review":"Eventhough it's good and fast due to SD card bandwidth interface, compared to MMC and Sony memory stick. Palm 16 MB SD card is too expensive. The price of [money], you can buy at least 32 MB or even 64 MB of Sandisk SD card from some stores.

There is only ONE track for all four marching bands featured in the movie! I wanted the soundtrack because I loved the performances of Morris Brown, Bethune Cookman, Grambling, Clark Atlanta and the fictional A&T. What I got is 14 tracks of hip-hop, most of which I don't even recall hearing in the movie.I wouldn't have minded if they split up the soundtrack into half marching band tracks and half hip-hop tracks. Splitting it like this would make it equally enjoyable to hip-hop fans and marching band fans. I don't know what producer Dallas Austin was thinking when he put this togther, but he really missed the boat.

In all the tracks, the line gets muddy and out of sync with eachother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Case!","review":"I bought this case to fit my palm m515. Firstly, the palm is secured to the case via a pole to slip in on the left of the case. Not at all secure. My palm actually fell out of the case. Thank goodness it fell on my bed. Also, the front cover has two leather strips (the purpose of which i have no idea) that are exactly in line with the front buttons, and every time i put the palm in my pocket, the case presses the leather strips onto the buttons and turns on the palm. The case really does not offer any form of protection for the palm. Only if it falls flat on it's back or front that it may offer some protection. But if it falls on its right side, top or bottom, you're in trouble. The plam is exactly aligned with the case, and at some places actually protrodues by a couple of millimeters. I sent the case back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not secure.","review":"This product seems nice at first, but within a few hours one will discover that the Palm will not stay in the case. The bar that slides into the stylus slot is too small, and the device slips out in a purse or pocket. The little tabs meant to protect the buttons on the bottom then presses these buttons, turning on the Palm and wasting the battery. Not at all satisfactory."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't fit!!!!","review":"Okay - I read the reviews, I saw the product on Amazon and really really liked the look and functionality of theproduct. I got one! I still like it, it is very functional but my Palm simply falls out of it! This kind iof makes it pretty useless as a protective cover for my palm!I have had the case for a whole day and (I do like it!) but I am taking it back since it fails in its primary function - protecting my palm! I placed it in my backpack and simply walking for a short while saw my palm dislodged and floating around in my bag! Now when I say backpack - it's a laptop backpack and isn't full of junk or things rattling 'round (no I'm not a Uni student!!) so my palm didn't get damaged.I was happy with my purchase but it just doesn't work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Impractical","review":"This just didn't work out for me. First, the on/off button kept getting hit while in my travel bag, leaving me with no Palm on one trip and virtually no power left on another. On top of that, blank notes kept being left due to this issue. The leather flap is constantly in the way when you try and enter something. I gave up and bought the hard case as a replacement. It's smaller and much sturdier so shouldn't have any of the above problems. Plus it opens up all the way for easy use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smaller than it looks!","review":"I was very disappointed in the case. It is small and the pockets are too small. Business cards fit in the clear pocket but try and get them out! Not very functional. The palm fits in akwardly and syncking it in in the case (it is too hard to take it out) is tough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best hands-free way to carry around the Palm m50X","review":"There are a lot of people at work with PDAs, and they all carry them around in some kind of portfolio-style case. This was not acceptable to me--I wanted a hands-free way of keeping my Palm m505 with me.This case is the answer. The black leather is stylish and durable. And this case is low profile--I bought the m505 partly because it's so small, and I wanted a case that's small too. The Palm fits real snugly into this case, and the case is narrow so that you're not always banging it into things as you walk around.The only complaint that kept me from giving it five stars are that I wish Palm built some compartments into the flap cover of the case for carrying extra memory cards. But that's being nit-picky.This is the best way I've seen of keeping your Palm at your side without having to carry it around with your hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy Workmanship","review":"Not a bad case, but the stylus attached to the case, which is supposed to slide into the slot on the left side of the Palm, fits into the slot much too loosely. As a result the Palm can and does easily slide out. That's not acceptable for a product that's supposed to shield the Palm from being dropped and broken. I solved the problem cheaply (and effectively) with Velcro, but Palm shouldn't sell products that need repair at the outset."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Design","review":"This case looks good and that is about it.Zero thought was put into the design of this case. The belt-clip is very difficult to clip on due to its design. The back of the clip is only a third as long as the front. When clipping onto your belt the back gets caught every time. To fully put it on the clip needs to be stretched open. No. It is not spring loaded or hinged. Once it is on, it is clamped there. Watch you don't tear your pants trying to remove it. The swivel? Ho-hum.The magnetic closure is a nice idea but badly executed. The clasp on this case holds the flap out a full centimeter (3/8\\"+) from the body of the case. Not practical at all for something you're wearing on your belt and don't wan't flapping in the breeze or catching your arm or anything else in close quarters.This case is also just small enough that the flip cover does not fit. Not good.If there were zero stars, this case would earn them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need picture of the back of this item.","review":"It would be nice, since this item is billed as somewhat different from the others, to have a picture of the clip on the back so I could know what I'm getting before I buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work as a wallet","review":"It doesn't have enough room for credit cards and documents (i.e. id, license, etc.), the space is very limited, so at the end you have to use it only to carry your Palm, you can not put it in your back pocket because is too big (and you don't want to seat over it neither) and its more like one of those small purse for women than a men's wallet - I would definitely remove the zipper (most men's wallets don't have a place for coins). The strap is not easy to use at all, it's complicated to open and close. Color and quality are very fine, but they are irrelevant if you can't use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Design Flaw","review":"The Leather Palm case has a design flaw that does not allow you to place another stylus in the case securely. The note pad is un-necessary and cumbersome. The case does not allow you to use the Palm's own cover to attach the Palm to the inside of the case, since the case has a rediculous built in attachment for connecting the palm to the interior. The palm is included with it's own cover that is supposed to be used for securring it to the case, which cannot be used with this case. You then have an extra part that ends up left in your desk. Illogical!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"The pictures online and on the box show a metal zipper; it is not. Worse than that, the zipper passes so close to the Palm inside that the edges may get scratched over time. The stiching does not look very durable either."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a 2008 book","review":"I bought this book thinking it was a current reference, based on the Amazon publishing date of 2008.

The book, which I would rather prefer to call it a mess of thoughts and ideas, is unfinished, unstructured and not that reader-friendly.Bakunin had the tendency to write, but not to finish his writings, as he always found something new to write about.Its an interesting book, with some very logical ideas, and should be read with care to be understood effectively. If you don't have a background knowledge of Anarchism though, I would suggest reading something simpler before reading God and the State.The Dover edition, is what you would expect from your average Dover edition book. Simple, good quality, good translation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice stuff","review":"My \\"predicted rating\\" was 4.5 stars, so let's call it 4.5 stars.Bakunin was Marx's biggest (or so they say) rival in the Socialist Party back in the 19th century. So, yes, many of the ideas here are 19th century. There's some altruistic stuff (slavery=bad) that has survived but this book is really just a socialist primer footnote, extra reading for Grad Students or debaters.Bakunin was no writer, he was an activist. He doesn't believe in God, and thinks the State has supplanted God as the means to effectively rail in the rabble. He's not the guy you would invite to the democratic fundraiser.Anyway, sooner or later you may decide to put the book down and actually get out there and do something.

If you have these two packs then don't buy it...........But wait, marketing comes in because they add new stuff exclusive to only this pack and nowhere else like furniture. So they make you have to buy this pack. That is why their stock is so high! This pack DOES not include the other 1,000 expansion packs.

I reccomend it to anyone who likes mindless entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too overrated","review":"I bought this game thinking it would be fun, I'm glad I waited for the price to go down before buying this. I didn't know there was time, a 24 hour day, was used in the game. The problem with this, at least for me, is 1) the time passes too quickly and I have to rush all the time to get things done, and 2) no strategy in the game, everything is linear in our goals. One Sim hour equals one minute in real time, and we can't set the speed slower. There's no adventure, no exploration in The Sims. What we do throughout the game is run our Sims around trying to keep our various moods in the up side of the scale. This quickly becomes routine and boring. I'd rather be playing a 3D action game for two hours straight rather then sending Sims to bed and to work and siting at the table eating over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money","review":"First, Let me say, the reason I gave this a 1 star rating isnt the game itself, I havent gotten to play it yet!

The serial # EA GAMES printed on it (which you have to have to install it on your computer), is invalid!!!! And, I cant get an answer from their tech support/customer service on this. I have found others who have bought this version with the exact same problem. If you can get this in a jewel case, good.

It's pretty fun, but a big time waster. If you let your people get depressed and they don't have a job, forget about it. They'll be too depressed to get happy and too depressed to find a job, so they'll just starve to death. Also, you spend WAY too much time telling them to clean up after themselves.

Then I created a family and started. After about ohhh... 8 minutes I was bored. I thought the sims was great and I thought this would blow my mind. but,it seems to me that the sims, no matter how many expansions you buy, is lacking something. I reserve to cheats usually. Hey, I just want my sims to have a good life instead of (when I dont use cheats) what I usually end up with. A sort of high school dropout attitude/job with a Willie Nelson era house.

First i had to reboot my system 3 times in order to get it to reinstall, then when it did get finished, it wouldn't start up. To add insult to injury, the \\"Hot Date\\" expansion pack did not want to install either.

The most fun about this game is building the home and decorating it. After that I lose interest. I don't need to see simulated people wake up, go to work, have dinner, bathe etc. I see enough of that in my own life. Personally I wish the game was more R-rated. Their actions are all done standing up so they never sit on the couch and hug and kiss for example. I named the charactors after my husband and I and we both ended up dying in a fire. I would suggest getting Zoo Tycoon instead.

The rest of the book tries to cover everything about high performance I/O but does not convey anything USEFUL. I feel the price is way too high for such a mediocre book that talks about too broad a topic and fail to focus on anything specific.

The book begins with a humble, yet elegant invitation (in French) to a party. Neatly juxtaposed with the invite, are several images of the partygoers captured in various moments of laughter and merriment by Msr. Sadibe.The book continues on with various images of life in Mali in the early 1960s and 1970s. Sadibe's superb use of mimimal lighting and candid photos, combined with Magnin's minimal layout provide the reader with a glimpse into the lives of everyday African people. As the journey progresses you can almost feel the gentle, warm sunrays or the sound of 'Soul Makossa' slowly whispering in the late evening breeze.This book is poignant and gentle, a true testimony to the greatness of African photographers such as Msr. Sadibe and Msr. Keita.ESSENTIAL"},{"rating":"1","title":"The book is wildly off track, poor characterization overall","review":"The author did not have to go very far to make substantial errors in this book, The title itself is an error, since these Bedouins are Palestinians, and not Israeli's (They would take great offense to being called Israeli's.

I found valuable pointers on basic development skills including: Conflict and character development, antedotes, using dialog, and point of view. His illustrations and examples are helpful. The book is filled with basic information for the biginning writer and a well organized reminder for those seasoned writer's looking for motivation and insptiration. Although the book was first written in the year 2000 the principles are as applicable today as when they were first written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and superficial","review":"Here's all Noble has to say in this book: set scenes, use dialog, provide anecdotes, spice with flashbacks, drop in a clue or two, and maybe a few other things that, if you know anything about writing, you already know. This book is a total waste of money & time. If you want to read about writing nonfiction, then all you really have to do is read about writing fiction and use the same techniques. Best of that bunch: the Janet Burroway book and the Madison Smart Bell book. You can easily do without this one. What's especially irritating is that Noble's examples are all the old hoaries that have been lauded for years -- the Power of 21, for example, and others well anthologized -- so not even the exemplar narratives are fresh. Sheesh -- how lazy can you get? And when he does choose something new to look at, it's the same new thing (The Perfect Storm) that everyone else is looking at.

I'm still impressed by the apparent accuracy of the information given by the dairyman and the dairy processes @ Organic Pastures Diary.

Some I like, and some I don't, but these guys just rock! They also have great ballads (if you want to call them that). \\"Bad Day\\" is a great slower song, and I'm sure it will be released as a single and fly up the charts. I bought the cd after hearing \\"Hemmorage\\" and \\"innocent\\" and seeing the videos. The lyrics are deep, and you can't help but relate. Brett's voice is amazing! \\"Easy\\" is a great song and so is \\"Slow\\". Every song on the cd is good, and I am not a person who buys a cd unless there is more than a couple good songs on it. These guys will be around a long time! And, I liked this cd so much, I just purchased \\"Sunburn\\", and I'm waiting for it to arrive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!!","review":"This is a WONDERFUL cd. It's the best one I own (not including Sunburn)! I LOVE Hemorrhage (In My Hands)!! Fuel knows how to express all kinds of different emotions with music and without being like all the boy-bands today.

Or...wait, this is Fuel. How silly of me. Really, is anyone as sick of these grunge throwbacks as I am? We all know the formula by now, or should. Subpar lyrics about whatever type of white boy pain, subpar music with energetic but boring drumming, unimaginative basslines, whatever guitars, and 'emotional' vocals. But Fuel just makes it worse. Bad Day? Jesus, the lyrics to that song are LAUGHABLE. I'll admit, Hemorrhage was a good song, but it got played to death and all the strings get on your nerves. Indeed, Fuel abuse the strings as much as Jimmy Eat World, but at least JEW utilizes their strings efficiently. All the songs sound the same, the lyrics are awful, the music doesn't elevate past radio standards; jeesh, why do people still buy corporate, boring rock? I shouldn't worry; in a few years, Fuel will sit alongside The Calling and Wheatus in the used CD section..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fuel","review":"I only like one song from this CD, not too good.

Its worth every penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"They're good live too!","review":"Fuel's CD Something Like Human is a satistying mix of kinda dark, heavy songs like Last Time and Down, which are two of my favorites, but they show they can also pull off lighter material like Bad Day or Innocent. I got to see many of these songs performed in concert, and they did put on a great show! Brett Scallions acted the part of the quintessintal rawk star, climbing the speakers and throwing props into the crowd, and they also played really well, Brett sings with so much emotion. This is one CD that I can listen to over and over again without having to skip tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice introduction to Fuel","review":"Having on a whim brought this CD at my local music store as a side thought to see how this band was, I was surprised and pleasantly surprised by the unique and sublime way this band went about with their style of music. They have won me over as a fan and have ordered from Amazon their other album releases.Fuel is a band that orginates from alternative rock. Rock beats with their own stylish rythmns. Fuel is like tasting the sweetest watermelon on a red hot day. Songs like Last Time, In My Hands, Bad Day, Innocent and Slow bring out the best that this band has to offer. The CD was enjoyable to listen to and I have listened to it countless times since buying the CD.Fuel is a band that'll be around for a long time to come. Watch out for the lyrics in Empty Spaces - they're super."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fuel Rocks","review":"I cought my first bit of Fuel from the Scream 3 soundtrack, in the song 'Sunburn'. Afterwards i went out and bought the cd after listening to a few clips of other songs on Amazon.com. I especially liked about 5 of the songs on that CD. Their new album 'Something Like Human' on the other hand, is a big improvement over Sunburn. The songs Hemorrhage (in my hands), Easy, Solace, and Bad Day are my favorite songs. I can honestly say that i like every song on this CD. Nearly every song seems to throw a little Rock in there, even the slower songs. I would advice this CD to everyone. I hope this album gives Fuel more hits than Sunburn did and puts them on the charts so they can be appreciated for their talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fuel's Something Like Human Rules","review":"Fuel's \\"Hemorrhage in my hands\\" made me want to buy the CD when I first saw it in MTV.

In fact , when I first heard \\"In My Hands \\" I thought it sounded remarkably like \\"Selling The Drama' by the band Live . The rest of the album is more of same . Most of the time sounding like Creed, Live , or 80's hair band Firehouse . (Yikes!) Lyrics are as pretty standard alt confusion.

Believe me:at the moment,this is the best alt.rock album (and the best alt.rock band)you could find,so...enjoy listening to this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Album","review":"I suppose. It doesn't blow you away, or disappoint, but it's still very good. Just because \\"Hemorrhage\\" got overplayed on MTV doesn't mean they're all pop and such. Anyway, SLH is a very good purchase. Brent (I think that's his name) is a very intense singer, as proven on such great songs as Hemorrhage, Innocent, and a very Matchbox 20 remininscent Bad Day. It's in these songs (and other semi-power-ballad tracks) that prove Fuel's highest point. Slow is a very good track as well, sounds like something off of Sunburn though. When Fuel's not blasting intense four minute tracks, they grow very Matchbox20-ish, with a little more edge, though. This is probably their lowest point. Please, don't say these guys are pop, or one-hit wonders-SLH is a complex, if not overly original, but very solid effort from a wonderful post-grunge band."},{"rating":"2","title":"i wasnt expecting much","review":"this cd is alot better than an average person will think. after hearing hemmorhage, they might say \\"oh well they're writing the song and not the album.\\" but it isnt half-bad. i wouldnt even say that their hit is the best one. the song \\"slow\\" in my opinion shows the most talent. so let's keep it at that, its not 5-star but still good. it deserves much credit. keep a listening ear for the following songs: \\"last time\\" \\"hemmorhage\\" \\"innocent\\" \\"slow\\" and \\" scar\\". thats my opinion but give it a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good album.","review":"Fuel is a post-grunge band, surfacing from the ashes of Sound Garden, Alice In Chains, and Nirvanna comes a band talented enough to take their influences from the 90's and produce their own thing.

Best comparison I can give is that the music is playing on \\"speakers\\" in a 40 foot room, and you're standing right next to Billy as he sings along, un-miked. Just bizarre.system is oppo through 6 monster analog cables to Yamaha 2400's analog in, multichannel input selected for playback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too short!","review":"A perfect performance and recording make this SACD a wannahave that will give the listner much pleasure.

Of course, SACDs are few and far between these days. Not many albums are released in multichannel SACD, and they often go out of print in a few years. This one, luckily, is still in print and is a great example of why SACD is so great. Great audio quality and very good discrete instrument placement in all the channels. Like the Elton John albums, the center channel appears to only carry vocals, which I don't actually like since it diminishes instrument separation over the front three channels. If you own an SACD player (the PS3 can play them!) and you don't hate Billy Joel, you owe it to yourself to pick this album up while it's still in print."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great gift","review":"I gave this as a birthday gift to the little girl who helps me with my horses.

The only reason to buy her is for the Apocalypse part. Even if you like her character this toy is horrid. I don't know much about her but from what I saw in the comic she comes with the toy fails to do justice. I'm pretty disappointed as I typically love ML figures. This one looks like one of those tiny toys you get as an accessory to another figure. Her hands are pathetic. Her arms suck too. It's like they didn't care. Also what is up with her head? It's like twice the size it should be. I hate how they purposely put the best part of the BAF with the crappiest figure in a set.I recommend this figure to finish off your Apocalypse but other then that I find this figure to be pretty pointless. You can't even sell her. People are basically giving her away on Ebay and still no one wants her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perceived shortage","review":"Although many of the figures are incredibly cool, Marvel Legends is really starting to tick me off with their manipulitive marketing. There is always a \\"perceived shortage\\" of certain figures. Get it together and make everything available at the same time! I saw this figure at Wal-mart and passed it up because frankly it looked bad, I didn't know the character, and they didn't have the rest of the figures in stock. Then as time passed I ended up getting the other figures later and I can't complete Apocolypse because she is the onlly figure I don't have. I don't even care about this figure but I've got these other stupid body parts with no head for Apocolypse lying around.

I have to say that in comparison with the Black Lace novels I have read, this collection is somewhat lacking. The stories tend to be long, some with numerous pages of background information between small snipits of sexaul action.I would not recommend this book based on the fact that I felt more frustrated after having read it.

Someone is trying to make her think she's inherited the curse of her father's experiments. The killer sports one of the cheapest make-up jobs you're likely to see in a film of this poor quality. Cheap sets and awful dialogue mark this as a \\"quickie\\". Talbott and Agar both did their share of low budget horror flicks and they go through the motions as heroine and hero respectively.

And I wish they'd used more pictures of kids or animals doing different seasonal activities than they used of trees, haystacks (muffins?), and zebras.PS--what is the deal with the Little Einstein promo at the beginning?

But this one really misses the boat. In fact,it seems to be a lame and weak attempt to squeeze more money out of tired parents.While the images of the seasons are lovely, the zebra puppets seem inappropriate and out of place. Plus, their inexplicable dance break (to some AWFUL conga music--what happened to the Vivaldi stuff?) is totally lacking in creativity. Also, a lot of the music is recycled from the Baby Newton (shapes) video.It really seems that Ms. Clark and company are scraping the bottle of the barrel here.My son loves most of the Baby Einsteins, especially Baby MacDonald and Baby Beethoven. Your money as a parent or grandparent would be much more wisely spent on those than this hackneyed attempt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Baby Einstein Ever!","review":"This does not hold my toddler's interest at all.

However, our 7-month old son found this particular DVD nowhere near as interesting as he does the others. He woudn't last longer than five minutes before being distracted by anything else he could find in the room, as opposed to rapt attention during Baby Neptune (his favorite), Baby MacDonald, or the big three of Bach, Beethoven and Mozart.Since some folks have mentioned it, I have no problem with the commercial at the beginning, especially since you can just skip to the next chapter/ beginning of the Baby Monet feature. While a big fan of the series, I am disappointed by the reaction from my son, and don't plan on playing this one that often since he didn't seem to enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get ready to be disappointed!","review":"We have all been waiting for this new DVD from the Baby Einstein group....we were very disappointed! Definitely more for the 6 month group than infants any older or toddlers. Very basic in some ways but then very advanced with lots of stills of Monet works. Very little action compared to Neptune, Noah & Galileo. Anyway, make your own decision but I don't recommend wasting the money. BORING!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully slow moving...","review":"While I appreciate that the concept behind the Baby Einstein product is classical music set to slow moving screen, this one takes the cake!!! We have every dvd in this series and Baby Monet is definitely the worst!!! They show alot of famous pieces of art but I'm not convinced that an infant can appreciate it!!!!!!!! Pass on this one!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unattractive paintings.....long and a bit boring","review":"Baby Monet begins with a zebra puppet painting two muffins which turn into 2 huts of a Monet painting. It was kind of a long introduction. This has mostly live-action of things in nature, not as many toys as most Baby Einstein's videos; which is nice. So, for spring they show time-lapsed photography of plants and flowers, which was kind of neat. Honestly, I thought this video was boring. It was a bit longer then most Baby Einstein's videos. I don't think there was anything with holidays, which is good for those that don't celebrate the holidays (Baby's First Imprssions Seasons had a lot of that). Maybe I just can't appreciate certain artists work but I really did not care at all for the Monet paintings in this video. Frankly I thought they were ugly and it makes me wonder how Monet got so famous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our Favorite Einstein","review":"I totally agree about hating the commercials hidden in the DVD. we keep it on repeat play, and that avoids them. This is our FAVORITE! We both just love the Zebras. They are totally playful and fun, and an attractive puppet (if you have seen the elephant on Baby Noah, you know what I mean) My son is crazy about it. I find it clever, the use of Monet paintings, without dominating the video in impressionism. I also love Vvaldi, so the soundtrack is great too. We have 3, and have seen 7, and this one is the one my 10 month old giggles over and gets excited seeing, and I don't get so sick of it I want to strangle myself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful!","review":"Our one year old loves this one, and so do I. The music is wonderful. The creative incorporation of Vivaldi's Four Seasons and Monet's Masterpieces are entertaining and educational. The children, little puppets and sequences with toys and nature makes this interesting for our child. We watch this one most of all the Baby Einstein's that we have."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed","review":"I have a nineteen month old son and he was bored with this at the first viewing. I thought the DVD would have more Monet paintings (like Baby Van Gogh). Maybe they should have called this Baby Vivaldi. I hate the commercial at the beginning of the DVD as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not captivating","review":"We bought this dvd when my son was just over 3 months old and have played it for him at various ages. In the past 14 months, the video has never once captured his attention as other Baby Einstein titles have. I do not recommend this title."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my baby's favorite!","review":"I have almost all of Baby Einstein's dvd's. I would say this one of the better ones BE has produced. Great puppetry (baby's favorite parts), wonderful seasons scenery and other eye appealing imagery. My baby started watching Monet since 6 month of age and he loves it! It's a treat for me to watch him smile and see his eyes light up at his favorite parts. First Signs, MacDonald, Neptune, DaVinci are also pretty good.I only allow him to watch an hour a day. And the critics who say babies watching tv is no good, I'd disagree. My 4 year old niece who watched BE since 2 weeks old is extremely bright and very talkative, using advanced vocabulary for her age. AND she's bilingual. I'm not saying this result will happen with all babies but I certainly don't think it hurts them intellectually."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Monet DVD","review":"DVD arrived in great condition in a reasonable amount of time and the quality was excellent as stated."},{"rating":"2","title":"My grandbaby loves it","review":"My grandchild will sit and watch these Baby Einstein videos as long as they are on. He has no interest in TV other than these videos. They are great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Baby Einstein movie yet. Result of Disney pressure?","review":"My 6 month old lost interest in the first 5 minutes of this dvd. What happened to the creativity of the earlier videos? Neptune? Numbers nursery?Sure, there are puppets and toys, but it just seems as if they include them in once a segment for the sake of including puppets and toys. No creativity and more stock footage than in a copy of National Geographic.It sure looks a lot like Disney pressure to sell more dvds at any cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy any of the other Baby Einstein videos","review":"My 12 month old daughter LOVES all of the Baby Einstein videos, except this one. We have not gotten past the first two minutes of this one because, for some reason, she always starts to cry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it there are better ones!!","review":"I agree with just about everyone else. This video is boring. My daughter will not watch it like she does some of the other videos."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little boring but ok","review":"My 10 month old sister was bored with it early on, although she did enjoy the parts with the puppets. Otherwise, it was a little too slow moving to keep her attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spam is Spam","review":"The author seems to understand many old mass marketing tricks, but is clueless about the Internet. Spam by any other name is still spam. Mark Twain would, I suspect, be turning his acid tongue to the spammers, not joining them. I highly recommend avoiding this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good advice, but badly outdated at times.","review":"While some of the advice offered by this book was well recieved and noted, much of the book was about writing effective spams (thus rebuking the subtitle, \\"Without getting Flamed\\"). Also, much of the web information was badly out of date; at one point he claims that a mere 15% or web users can view graphics.Say What? Sorry, but \\"forget using graphics\\" does *not* imply good marketing strategy to me. While I understandthat Vitale was trying to avoid being technical, he wouldhave done well to drop a few web tips like \\"forget black-on-grey\\".If you want to write spam, buy this book. If you're overly new to the internet and need help with the basic culture,buy this book. If you want to write effective web pages (like I do), do yourself a favor and search \\"David Seigel\\".His book on third-generation web sites laps this book ineffective web sales."},{"rating":"1","title":"A slow journey into boredom","review":"I was very excited when a buddy bought this book. We had both heard about what a great writer Bellow's was and the premise was very interesting. Unfortunately this book was one of the few books I had to force myself to finish. (And it isn't even very long!) Turns out we both hated the book and after speaking with some others who also read it discovered that they also thought it missed the mark. Hey, look, we all have different tastes, and that's okay...but if you're going to excite me with the synopsis don't rip me off with character's that could easily solve their problems with a quick call to the police or even a punch in the face. Come on Saul, 3 people from Canada can't be wrong - can we?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn-a-minute","review":"Trying to broaden my literary horizons, I thought I'd pick up The Victim by Saul Bellow. After all, one of the quotes on the cover proclaimed \\"One novel by Bellow is worth a dozen from any other author\\". Perhaps true, if those other authors happen to write trade publications for the plumbing industry.The bottom line, it was a festival of boredom. Portnoy's Complaint it's not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Family Film!","review":"My family rented this film recently and I did something I have never done before, immediately looked in to how I could buy it. It's one worth watching over, always good for a laugh and lots of awestruck insight into the animals of Southwest Africa."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to watch","review":"This is a funny movie with funny (and very dated) commentary.

Their age 2 an 8, an enjoy it at about once a week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Educational and comedic for everyone","review":"This movie doesn't have any particular target audience with it's story. There are so many entertaining parts that it is definately a must have for anyone who likes a good laugh. We sometimes try to seperate ourselves for animals that we forget how much their behaviors are like ours. There are so many scenes in this movie that I was laughin out loud. Although even though I saw this movie several years ago I still remember several scenes. So I really do believe it does more than make you laugh, it educates you on how precious the circle of life is. If you have any remote interest in wild animals or just like to laugh this movie is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT increase your endorphines by laughing!","review":"This is a super great movie for people of all ages!

If so, make sure you watch AABP. It is made in the same subtle, comedic style and well worth a watch, even if you are not the \\"National Geographic\\" or \\"Discovery Channel\\" type.

You will too."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT FAMILY MOVIE","review":"I saw this video many years ago on television, and it was one of our family's favorites.

Thanks so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Animals Are Beautiful People","review":"This is a DVD that should be a must see for young and old--and in between. It is informative, entertaining, and amusing. You learn a lot about the dessert and how the animals survive. The background music is a delight. It is a must see for the children and adults will enjoy watching it with their kids. I must have seen it at least 10 times and I just bought it for my grandchildren. I don't think any generation should miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Animals Are Beautiful People","review":"I've always loved this movie and hadn't seen it for years.

Very clever way to show off animals overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEEPLY OFFENSIVE TO TRUE ANIMAL LOVERS","review":"I have read all of the reviews of this films, most of which lavished praise on it. It never ceases to amaze me how few people view films critically instead of for pure entertainment.The people who filmed this movie have no respect for animals. If you look at all of the negative reviews, you will see that in fact many of the animals were manipulated for the purposes of entertainment and faux \\"education\\". Animals made to be inebriated, a massive birds nest burnt down, baby animals thrown into a raging river.If you enjoy going to the circus or rodeo and seeing animals perform with every shred of dignity stolen from them, you will enjoy this movie. Otherwise, stay as far away from it as possible. Someday, it will have historical significance as a documentation of why so many species have gone extinct: man's utter lack of respect for animal life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate, much better choices out there","review":"One's first clue that this is a quite confused video is when the cover of a video of African animals features a tiger. There are no tigers in Africa, except in zoos.Likewise, the scene describing the \\"cowardly, lazy, scavenger\\" hyenas is incredibly inaccurate.A number of scenes are obviously staged, including the very sad intentional burning of a communal weaver bird nest.On the other hand, there's some good photography, especially of insects, and the cycle of life from dry to rainy seasons. I'd borrow instead of buy this clunker if you insist on seeing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"There is a scene in the movie where a Weaver bird's communal nest sets aflame. As stated in the movie these nests can last a hundred years. It's obvious they are holding the twigs with a droplet of water to catch the sun. What are the chances the camara just happens to be focusing on the spot before it sets aflame?Then the scene where the Bushman pretends to be an ostrich to lure a real ostrich off the nest so that a Hyena can come and chase after a newly hatched chick.Oh and then there's a scene where you can barely see but a Bushman pushes the Honey Badger off the rock.Now these people obviously don't like birds since the only suffering you see are the birds. Like when they show the Pelicans whose lake dried up and they starve to death as they can't yet fly.Now I'm not an animal rights activist but some of these scenes were obviously altered and disrepectful of animal life."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a conservationist / nature lover","review":"I have only contempt for this guy who torches a large old weaver bird colony nest for the sake of this movie. As if a dewdrop could start a fire in this desert, and just when the camera was focussing on it. Shame on you low life!Paul W M, Toronto Canada"},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertainment not documentary","review":"This is an entertainment piece, not a documentary. Parts were clearly staged. Today's shows available on National Georgraphic, Animal Planet, etc. are vastly superior to this.I was 13 years old when I first saw this movie in 1974 and thought parts of it were funny. Educational? Not so much. The animals are portrayed as objects to laugh at.The scene of the pelican chicks death march made me bawl and has always haunted me. Fast forward 36 years - while visiting someone last week, they popped in this DVD and it seemed strangely familiar until the pelican scene and dread filled me again. I didn't want to see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"animals are beautiful people","review":"the movie I received was not what I expected, I had seen it on TV years ago and what I got was completely different, the one I saw had giraffes that were drunk with the fruit hippos, or elephants that were drunk, monkeys laying on the ground drunk, it was hillarious and the one that i got from you was not the movie I saw at all, I was very dissapointed, and wish I could find the one that was very funny throughout the movie. Is there a possibility that you know what I'm talking about and maybe I could get the right picture?.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived and abusive of its subject","review":"Anthropomorphizing at its worst. The animals are ridiculed by a narration that imposes insulting \\"human\\" scripts onto their actions. Even the clouds are maligned and portrayed as \\"armies\\". Combine that with the worst musical score you've ever heard, and you have a film that belittles and trivializes the immensity of nature and the lives of non-human animals. It's obvious many of the animals in the movie have been manipulated and deliberately placed in potentially harmful scenarios. I can't believe this won best documentary of the year!! There may be some nice photography here and there and possibly one or two facts, but it's an embarrassing statement about the 'film' makers. It leaves the viewer cold or just plain angry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nudity and drunkenness are family entertainment???","review":"Why would anyone want their children (or students) to view a film that puts drunkenness in a humorous light? And for those who may care, the African family in this film has almost nothing on and the mother is bare-breasted (the family is featured for many minutes)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious Animal Documentary","review":"Who could ever think, that different kind of animals react like human beings? If you watch this documentary, you will see a side of animal behaviors you never saw before in a funny way. It is interesting to see how male ostriches dance for the females or how elephants, baboons and kudus can get drunk from an overripe fruit. Jamie Uys did a wonderful job to capture with the camera all kind of animals at the right time and edited with the perfect background music. Even that this documentary is a few years old, I love to watch it over and over again. This is a perfect entertainment animal movie for the whole family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie for all ages!","review":"Anyone who loves animals and their silly habits will find this film delightful and entertaining. My favorite parts include babboons who cartwheel down the hill and the animals who become intoxicated on the fermented fruit. This film highlights animals and their idiosyncrasies which make them appear to be not so different from humans.This film does a magnificent job detailing the harsh conditions in which these African animals thrive and survive in. There are a few hard parts to deal with, like when a grass birdhouse for hundreds of bird catches on fire, leaving many of them to parish or homeless as well as abandoned pelican chicks who die of thirst and starvation. But, such is nature. These parts may be difficult for young children to deal with, but all in all, the film presents a solid balance which highlights life more than death.Also, a wonderful film for educators who are presenting biomes or animal adaptations in the classroom."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Decent Nature Show","review":"Watched this before on HBO when young and really enjoyed the drunken animal scene, even though now I realize most of the movie was probably staged.

I speak the language fairly well so look up recipes in Italian quite a bit. This book is going to help me a lot and has done so already. For any fan of Italian cuisine, this is a really good addition to your library. It would help people who travel there frequently and would help students of the language. It's not perfect and doesn't claim to have every food related word in the language, but has quite a large collection of food related words. I look forward to learning these words through the years."},{"rating":"1","title":"tarantella not so much","review":"I wanted to like this movie, i really did. It has a wonderful story line and I like mira sorvino as an italinan-american actress.

I must say it has outperformed my expectations, it is very sturdy, the strap is comfortable, it is light (weight) and the lights are super bright. It gives me more than enough light to do what I have to do in the ceiling, even when the light setting is the lowest, but when I amp up I can see clearly far in the distance. When I bought it I also had fishing in mind, but unfortunately I have not gotten out to fish since I've had it. I cannot comment on whether the red flap helps etc. with the fish. But overall I'd say I am very pleased with my purchase an I would recommend this product highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great little headlamp","review":"I got this as a gift for my brother, who duck hunts. I solicited his opinion on the product, and this is what he said.------------------------------it is fantastic, i have used it at least 25 times, at least once a day,since you gave it to me. no complaints except that the button/filter arehard to operate with big gloves on. but really, everything is hard tooperate with big gloves on(ever tried to unzip and pee witth gloves on!!)give the product a highly favorable review.ps installing light fixtures in a dark room has never been easier-twohands good.------------------------------So that's the story. Besides that, I can tell you that it's not too bulky, battery life is great, adjustable brightness is nice to have, aimable beam is very beneficial for different tasks and something more compact units don't often offer, red filter is a must for hunting."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for camping, climbing","review":"I've always bought Petzl since my frist headlamp in 2000 and they are the best.

And the different brightness settings are excellent for night-climbing or hiking in the dark. Can't be beat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"On-off switch broke","review":"I'm quite disappointed in this light. It worked for a little while but now the on-off switch is defective making it difficult to turn on the light and keep it on. I purchased a Streamlight 61052 Septor LED and love it.

We have lots of power outages in our area and so when the lights go out, this comes to the rescue! We used it 2 nights ago when we had company and the electric went out. We were able to play board games for hours. It's great too for replacing flashlights - hands free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bright, Lightweight, Works Great","review":"Bought this unit mainly for camping and nighttime fishing, and it has worked great for those activities. Light angle is easily adjustable with multiple detents, so it stays where you set it. Has two brightness levels (low has been fine for most of my needs and extends battery life). Unit is very light, so wearing it for an hour or two is no problem.Would definitely choose this brand/model again."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEAPLY MADE,POORLY DESIGNED!","review":"Just received my Petzl tacticca plus headlamp.What a poorly designed hunk of junk! It works but but is just badly made.First,the opening to the casing is at the top,so every time you adjust the angle of the light,it pops open spilling out the batteries,because they did'nt provide enough material to make the door stay closed.Also at the bottom the case is too small,so there is a gap of about a 1/4\\".In lieu of hinges,there are 2 fabric straps which keep the case from falling apart,but which when you open the case at all,they push the batteries out.I will need to tape it closed,just to be able to use it! At 40+ dollars,this is a huge rip off!You can get a mini mag flashlight made of aircraft aluminum for much less!Just stealing peoples hard earned money.Will never buy another product from them,that's for sure.There must be better ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect headlight for Photographers","review":"This little light does a nice job lighting your path, is comfortable to wear, the red filter is perfect for night photography.

I highly recommend this headlamp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good seucurity Lamp","review":"I got this light primarily for walking my dog at night. I live in the country on a dirt road w/no streetlights. I also walk her on trails in the woods at night so I need to have a good light. It's good to have my hands free in case I need to get at my weapon. There are coyotes in the area and they regularly take peoples pets, they are viscious, opportunistic , and can smell fear, so it's necessary to be armed especially at night. The Petzl is very bright, I usually keep it on the low setting and it's enough light. If I hear something moving in the woods I can switch to the brighter setting and it really lights the whole area very well. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is there are brighter lights that are about the same size, but they are much more expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"A high quality product with all the right features.","review":"I love my TacTikka Plus Headlamp. It has all of the features you could possibly want. I use mine hiking, camping, for home repairs, and even for reading in bed with the red filter. This product is highly effective and simple to use. Good job Petzl!UPDATE: 12/13/2012 I own three of these. I have had them since December 2007, so four years now. We have used them every day for four years! We replace the batteries in them about every 2-3 weeks depending on our daily usage. Of the three I own two have developed cracks in the casing. I used some epoxy to seal the housing and try to prevent the crack from spreading. They still work, they were not abused or anything. Four years ago they were twenty nine dollars, they cost a little more now but not by too much. Overall, I still really like the product. I understand that the LED technology has improved some. So they're probably even better now.One star removed for the cracks that developed in 2/3 units."},{"rating":"2","title":"A suitable replacement for a Tikka","review":"I purchased this after loosing my old Tikka a few weeks back.

It is PLENTY bright, I almost always use the lowest setting, but I still appreciate that it has 3 intensities. The flip-down red filter is great for extra-late nights around the campfire. My first headlamp was a cheap piece of junk from Wal-Mart, and I got what I paid for. This Petzl has made me proud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Case","review":"Case cracked on it after perhaps 10 backpack trips.Still using it, applied some duct tape.My previous Petzl case also cracked.

Petzl needs to address this or just lose business altogether. I purchased a couple of these headlamps for bug out bags for family members and I am not sure they will survive the long haul after looking them over. They work, but not what I expected from Petzl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, fantastic, durable","review":"Had one of these on my first tour in Afghanistan. Loved it then, but sadly it did not survive an IED attack (along with the other contents of the bag it was in). Tried the single lamp version, and had no complaints with it (though it was not appreciably better in my opinion), but lost it like an idiot in Iraq. Recently bought again and will continue to buy as needed until I get smarter, IED's get less explode-y, or the thing actually breaks. Take your pick which one will likely happen first (hint - it's not the last option). Absolutely cannot go wrong with this headlamp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Petzl E49PC TacTikka Plus 4-LED Headlamp, Camouflage","review":"I'm very happy with this light.Comfortable headband and mount? Check.Four position switch a breeze to operate? Check.Adequate light for most things recreational? Check.Water resistant? Check.Red lens cover? Check. (note, it can be difficultto find/flip down because the little tab is recessedinto the body of the lamp, presumably so it won't catchon something and flip up, thereby destroying your night vision.)Actually, it's a well thought out way of implementing the cover.It's just not very handy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Spent days reviewing headlamps before settling on this after reading all the reviews. I'm not a massive hiker but do go camping quite a bit and am an avid reader in bed. The lowest setting is perfect to read by and the highest is very bright and great for all camp duties. I wanted a light with the night vision red and was very impressed with the brightness of the red on all settings. I had a previous no name brand which didn't come close to this for brightness.I hate bugs flying round my face while reading or cooking and the quick way you can flip to red is perfect. I really didn't want to cycle through other settings to get to my red light so this was perfect again for this. Also doesn't irritate my husband in bed while I get into bed, a quick flip to white and I'm good to go reading still without disturbing anyone.It is powerful enough to do almost anything by and dim enough to read and not disturb. Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Sister is a Quilter","review":"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my sister who is a quilter. She raved about it once she tried it on, loves the light weight and the concentration of light on the areas of the quilt she's working on. The best comments I can give for this review is that she recommended it to several of her friends within days of using it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product,but...","review":"The gear is very comfortable and well built. The red light does not attract many species of flying bugs, this makes it especially helpful in summer night fishing.

Rappeneau is a genius in making such kind of French movies. This is a story that can only happen in a time frame when honor, sacrifice, horism and romance still matters. And French is the best language to express these feelings in such a poetic and elegant way.If you love this moview, I bet that you would also fell in love with Rappeneau's \\"Horseman on the Roof\\" . I wish I could get a copy of this vieotape, or even better, a DVD version."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intriguing film, Depardieu's leading role is totally breathtaking","review":"It's a film that captures your attention from the first minutes till the end. The dramatic storyline by itself is excellent, but what thrilled me the most in the movie was the poetic, clever dialogs and the outstanding role by Gerard Depardieu which, in my opinion, should have won an Oscar. He really fulled the role as the fighting poetist courageous and fearless in the battle field but so vulnerable and overwhelmed when he has the opportunity to express his emotions to the woman he is affectionate of. Depardieu's ability to express the lyrical lines in a believable way really makes this movie as thrilling as it is. Also, even though there are some scenes from the battlefront, it's a film with a positive attitude towards life."},{"rating":"2","title":"MOST BEAUTIFUL MOVIE EVER MADE!!!!","review":"I WAS 13 WHEN THIS MOVIE WAS IN THE THEATER.

IF YOU'VE ONLY SEEN DEPARDIEU IN ENGLISH SPEAKING FILMS, THEN YOU SIMPLY MUST SEE THIS SO YOU CAN FINALLY UNDERSTAND HIS HUGE POPULARITY. YOU WILL NEVER AGAIN WONDER WHY HE'S SO LOVED.

Thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Adaptation of the Literary Work","review":"This multi-award winning 1990 French film is superb in so many respects, not the least of which is its nearly exact replication of the original work of literature. Considered one of the greatest love stories of all time, this movie will appeal to teenagers and adults alike. This DVD in particular offers the original lanugage version of the movie (French) with the option for English subtitles (which actually are Anthony Burgess' translation of the play Cyrano, so they are almost as lyrical as the French dialogue)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most beautiful love story in the french language","review":"My girlfriend told me about the movie when it was showing on the theatre. Though it has a five star rating for the American version, it is just not compariable with this one in the french language. First of all, the fencing part is a lot more real than the black and white version. Secondly, french is such an beautiful language to use in expression of love for an romatic movie. Cyrano's love letters are proundly beautiful. After watching this one, I do not have patience to finish the English version at all. This is my most favorite movie among all of my DVD collections and it will stay as number one. I do not know any french, but I can appreciate the making of this movie very much!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the beauty of the play","review":"the beauty of this play is that is is a very tragic story. Cyrano was a man of wit, poetry, and romance. He fell in love with a woman who adored poetry. He was also ugly and he was so hard on himself for it and thought that no woman could ever want him. Even when he knew that roxanne loved only the poetry, he still felt that she would reject him and ended up never telling her until the end of his life. What makes it so very sad is that in the play you see such passionate romance created by Cyrano, yet he never was able to take her for he was so afraid that his ugliness would turn against him."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's French for \\"Marveleous\\"?","review":"I loved this movie. It's poetic, tragic, romantic and full of wit. Gerard Depardieu's Cyrano was perfect. He wasn't acting, he WAS Cyrano. His love for Roxanne tugged at my heart. It was a noble thing for Cyrano to help Christian woo Roxanne with his beautiful poetry. That kind of giving is a rarity. For fourteen years he kept his secret, all in the name of his love for Roxanne. Even as he was dying, he still denied that it was he who wrote the letters, but Roxanne realized the truth as her eyes were opened to what had been right in front of them for years. I highly recommend this film, whether you speak French or not(Thank goodness for subtitles). It's a tear jerker. And it will make you laugh as well. Cyrano's wit is without rival, especially during the duel scene. The movie was well-acted and well-filmed. And the costumes were great. \\"Cyrano de Bergerac\\" is just superb all around."},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolute gem","review":"I saw this movie many years ago, on video tape, and I am so happy that it is finally coming out on DVD.Like most of the roles that I have seen Gerard acting in, he puts heart & soul into making the movie come alive.

Cyrano was a proud man that had faults as does all men. In order to make for his faults he over excentuates his other qualities.

Unfortunately, I had to rely on the English subtitles. The translation was so grotesque--yes, a word from Cyrano via Brian Hooker--that I could not watch more than 15 minutes. With such a marvelous, witty, timeless English translation as Hooker's, why write a new one? \\"Cyrano\\" is all about words, but instead of soaring poetry, we get something less than even Christian could write. Mealy-mouthed, unpoetic, lumbering, inelegant, a pug, a nob, a button-nose! \\"And so, as I end the refrain, Thrust home!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Great play, miscast Cyrano and a dull, flat English translation","review":"\\"Cyrano\\" is one of the greatest verse plays ever written.Unfortunately Gerard Depardieu is no Cyrano. He's a great, clumsy side of beef, not a shining flame encased in the middleweight body of Hercule Sevanien Cyrano de Bergerac. With the best will in the world, his performance seldom achieves adequacy and never brilliance.The English translation was especially commissioned for this film. It is undistinguished, prosy and dull. It has little of the wit and less of the poetry of the old standard translation commissioned in the 1920s by the great American actor Walter Passmore.Get the Jose Ferrer version.

The master teacher, Quan, uses stories and simple metaphors to present a philosophy of life which transformed my thinking on many levels.

The material beside the rubber toe piece disintegrated. The screws holding the buckles come loose. Stitching in the tongue pulled out.The zippers are also poor quality. After a year of use the zippers became so weak they'd split open requiring fifteen minutes of frustraition getting them together again. Eventually just epoxy'd both zippers closed and resorted to lacing them up.Low boot height, poor ankle protection and weak zippers means this boot provides minimal protection if they manage to remain intact.

My problem with the hose is twofold. One, while it is easy to attach to the faucet, it leaks significantly, which is simply not acceptable for a hose of this apparent quality and price point. Second, while the hose is not kink-free, it is kink-resistant, and it should be, because the hose is so unwieldy.Overall, it's not a bad hose, but it is not worth the price.

The connection to the water outlet leaked. We called the company and they said since it was brand new they would send us a new hose. Never got new hose.

It can only be found after unpacking the product. It says water from the hose can cause cancer and birth defects. It also warns to wash hands after using.Like most people I use the hose for many purposes including filling our above ground pool, watering my vegetable garden and general exterior cleaning chores and this hose produces toxic water that is unsuitable for these purposes.This is not the only hose that carries this warning. I've shopped in three other stores that carry plastic hoses and I could find only one brand of plastic hose that did not have a health warning of toxic materials.After reading the product warning notice I returned this hose to Amazon without using it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Tara","review":"This book is wonderful, Thubton Chodron speaks from her heart in a very clear, and easy to understand manner. I recomend this book to all who wish an end to suffering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great topic but not what I expected","review":"I guess I was looking for a book with more information about the stories surrounding Tara and the history of her veneration. I commend her attempt but this is really better for the narrower audience of Buddhist-Gelug practitioners. A non-Buddhist, and even a non-Gelug, is likely to only get so much from this book. The bit at the end about 'emptiness' was actually really good (I thought) and I am glad that she discusses the difference aspects of Tara with a reasonable amount of depth but this has a strong Gelug perspective which I could not really relate to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grown Folks Music","review":"After months of hearing \\"So What The Fuss\\" it seemed we'd never get the full CD. But now we can say, \\"please keep them coming Stevie.\\" This is not \\"Inner Visions\\" or \\"Talking Book.\\" And we'll probably never hear anything like \\"Songs In The Key Of Life\\" again, but this is still Stevie going strong. It's been ten years since \\"Conversation Peace\\" so let's be glad for this latest offering. And his latest is hardly settling by far. We just find a more mature Stevie, with new things to say, in a brand new Century. Let's savor the moment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stevie Makes Me Wonder","review":"First and foremost, I have been a Stevie Wonder fan for over thirty-five years and I mean a big fan. If someone had asked me in the late Eighties or early Nineties who my all-around favorite musican was, I'd have said Stevie Wonder. Today, Stevie is still fabulous in concert, but over the last 15 years, I find that his studio material has been sliding deeper and deeper into the abyss. I can't say that there were more than one or two cuts on A Time to Love that made me want to listen again. For some musicians, this level of songwriting and performance would be fairly well-received, but for Wonder, it's a sign that his best music may be behind him. It just doesn't move me and if this album took ten years to produce, something is not right in the House of Wonder. Having said all that, Stevie is still one of the greatest musicans of all time and even if he never writes another song, his place in history is guaranteed. He will always symbolize the true spirit of Innervision."},{"rating":"2","title":"magical","review":"\\"I am only 14 and I juss started listening to stevie wonder.

My favorite song of them all is True Love. True Love speaks from the heart and lingers through the soul...... Stevie is back and his music is awesome...."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the Return To Greatness!!!!","review":"Over the years Stevie Wonder has never let me down; no not once! From my experience I know that when Stevie first releases an album it is good. \\"Moon Blue\\" reminds me of one of his greats \\"Ribbon in the Sky\\"; not because it sounds like it, but the essence. At first it almost brought tears to my eyes, it was that good; and the more I listen to the CD \\"A Time To Love\\", it just gets better and better. From \\"What the Fuss\\" to \\"Tears\\", to \\"Songs of My Father\\", you will not be disappointed. It just adds to the many great collections Stevie Wonder has produced."},{"rating":"2","title":"A TIME 4 BRILLIANCE !","review":"The much-anticipated musical return of Stevie is BRILLIANT. The caliber of the music found on this project is reminiscent of his previous career highlights. This compilation is bursting with musical gems worthy of discovering and cherishing for all time.The main concept behind this project is exploring various aspects of love. Stevie does it with flair, innovation and creativity. The quality of this CD should once again clutter Stevie's shelves with numerous music honors. I predict BLUE MOON will provide Stevie with yet another Grammy as BEST MALE VOCAL PERFORMANCE. His vocal performance on that song is a musical tour de force. Other outstanding tracks are: FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART, SO WHAT THE FUSS and CAN'T IMAGINE LOVE WITHOUT YOU.Anyone who gets pleasure from music that will impact the soul should run out and order this cd. This is a product that will not disappoint. This title was worthy of the wait and the cost!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stevie Drops New Classics!","review":"A TIME TO LOVE features numerous cuts that will become new standards. MOON BLUE and MY LOVE IS ON FIRE take Stevie into real jazz in ways he's never explored before.

His voice isn't what it used to be, although he continues to be a master musician. He tries to cram too many lyrics into each song, and only a few of the cuts have memorable melodies. Still, it's good to have him back in the studio recording new songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great Music","review":"I am an avid Stevie Wonder fan, however this is NOT the Stevie Wonder of the '70s.

Stick to classic Stevie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Downer for Stevie","review":"As long as I waited for this CD to be relaesed, I am thoroughly disappointed. This CD has no substance at all.

I call this CD a \\"one hit Wonder\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"A Time 2 Love\\" Not Full of Wonder","review":"Something happened to Stevie between his groundbreaking triad of Talking Book, Innervisions, and Songs in the Key of Life albums until now. A Time 2 Love has glimpses of the genius, but falls short with poor lyrics, tired arrangements, and hookless writing. The best of the bunch \\"So What the Fuss\\" with Prince on guitar, and \\"Positivity\\" with Aisha Morris are the only two songs with have some life to them. I can't believe this CD was nominated for six Grammy awards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second thoughts","review":"Repeated listenings allow me to moderate the review I posted a while ago. I'm delighed to do it. My original title was \\"A Time to Despair.\\" Make that \\"A TIme to Take Stock.\\"Five of the fifteen cuts are decent -- one or two may even approach greatness -- but whenever the album starts to take flight it crashes back to earth under the weight of songs slow as molasses and twice as syrupy. Ballads have always been the man's undoing. Melodies that are often unmemorable; lyrics so mawkish you can't quite believe your ears. Sure, some have been hits, but still...After all these years, it's way past time for a friend whose opinion he respects to whisper the words the flunkies around him seem afraid to speak: Stevie, ballads just ain't your thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always enjoyable, occassionally thought-provoking","review":"I'm moderately libertarian, so I usually agree with the views expressed in Reason.

Not reasonable at all, in this reviewer's opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"LEFT WING LIBERTARIANS","review":"Please avoid Reason.

Unread issues just kept piling up because the magazine had gotten consistently dull. There was also some sloppy writing here and there.

Unfortunately under the current editor it has taken a sharp turn in the wrong direction. At this point, \\"free minds and free markets\\" is a very misleading tag line and I would have to say the magazine is simply pretending to be something it is not.

I will conceed that it is rather well written, compared to most out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A voice of clarity","review":"Reason cannot be labeled conservative or leftist. Nor is it an extremist libertarian magazine like Liberty, fawning over Ayn Rand. It bases its commentary on the assumption that, if we have some faith, our chaotic culture will lead somewhere good. But if we try to monitor and control it excessively, we will dampen human creativity and end up muddled and conflicted. Reason takes on all aspects of culture and assumes an international perspective. Its arguments are laid out carefully but contain a percolating sense of indignation at our increasingly repressive environment. At the same time, they are more informative than polemical; each report is grounded in specifics - quotes, anecdotes, studies. This is the most intelligent and inquiring \\"political\\" journal available. If only it came out more often!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost Some Luster But Still Important","review":"For those of you with a Libertarian bent, this is a must-read. It has, as some reviewers claimed, lost some luster. It lacks the total Ayn Rand Libetarianism of, for example, \\"Liberty\\", which is a pure delight.But Reason contains some good reading and we do not need a pure diet of left, right or libetarian. We can, after all, think for ourselves. We don't require a magazine to do that.Reason is one of the best for truthful, yet often opinionated reporting.Susanna K.

The book arrived early which was great, and it arrived fast, but as a birthday gift that I had wrapped and rushed to get to her, definitely not cool that it is used.

It's impossible to describe a lot of music (all a matter of taste really) and in reading a lot of reviews what I've discovered is the reviews that help me most are those that advise me of the artists other release's and what is the best album to discover the artist with! Also, the reviewer's tastes in music help greatly. And sometimes you just have to take the leap and try it! So, my other(prog?)taste's are: Genesis, Gentle Giant, King Crimson, Yes, Van Der Graaf Generator(a favorite), Nektar, Camel, PFM, Peter Gabriel, Peter Hammill, XTC, Jethro tull, Talking heads.

Kim Cattrall and Melanie Griffith were laughably bad. Hanks and Willis were horribly miscast. And the \\"message\\" behind the story is treated in such a heavy handed manner as to make the movie unbearable.

The film could have more excessive moments...I didn't get the feel that there was much of a rallying to have this Master of the Universe's head on a platter. Crowd scenes were skimpy and controlled. The DA just did not seem to be oily enough to me. To their credit, Melanie Griffith and Morgan Freeman played their respective roles well, but what was up with Hanks and Willis?

It has enough comedy to keep you entertained while taking a hard look at some very serious yet unpleasant issues.Plus I just have to add that I don't think i've ever seen a Melanie Griffith film that to me would rate less than 4 stars.

Specially the end, when Celie runs to encounter her sister and sons. This pure film art. Mr. Spielberg understand the human intimate emotions, and this movie really reaches to your evey sense. The whole plot of woman being under a man dominated society, and how different character of woman react to that, are the main goal here. Whoopi and Oprah give an outstanding performance, as well as the other actors, specially Glover who you end up kind of hating, but that by all means, meant that his part was really believable...now that's acting....Excellent Movie, Excellent Direction, acting...well everything...a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Movie!","review":"This movie is just the right movie for about everyone to watch again and agin. It seem's like your loving it from the very begainning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Syrupy, awful.","review":"This film is one of the toughest celluloid experiences to sit through. No respect for the (infinately worthier) source material. It is ironic that Spielberg attempts a \\"Griffiths-like\\" approach to this subject as it dessimates any possibility of true insight into the machinations of Walker's more resigned, cerebral literary experiences. Strangely enough, she condoned Spielberg's requisite butchering. Interesting. Spielberg is a technically astute filmmaker, masterful at grabbing an aesthetically appealing image, arranging shots from strict pre-production storyboarding, layering on Quincy Jones' cloying score and hearing the coffers rattle with cinema punters' coins and cash, but this project he should have left to someone else. As one critic put it 'it either grabs you emotionally or leaves you cold'. It left me positively glacial."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful","review":"This film , like the tired book by the same title , is a collection of hateful thoughts by a \\"women\\" who hates men..The men are reduced to mere criminals and the women are the heroic victims..Tell me something ...

There is'nt one male character protrayed here that is a positive human being..Are all Blackmen like this..??? Would you want your brother, father , sons , husband to be anything like the \\"men\\" in this film...??? I did'nt think so...

My husband and I went to a theater to see it. We both felt like walking out but I wanted to stay in hopes that it would get better. It never did! Could have been a great movie if they had kept it more realistic. I remember the black people all being represented as very smart and the white people as very dumb. Also the black people did not appear very poor at all. They were seen folding beautiful sheets in a house that was definitelly not a shack. I grew up in a lower middle class family and we never had clothes or sheets that looked so good as what they had.

However, I'm compelled to try. The Color Purple is at the top of my movie list. Whoopie and Oprah was absolutely phenomenal. With Danny Glover, I loved to hate him and I hated to love him (because he is such a great person but played such a wicked part.) I've watched this movie at least 10 times and still it moves me. I must admit Spielberg's race made me a bit concerned. When I first learned he would be the Director, I wondered how he would capture the images and do justice to Alice Walker's masterpeice. However, he surely stepped up to the plate and hit a homerun. I will continue to recommend it til my very lips fall off.

How could he be so cruel?!?\\" It's funny, I know him as a kind and loving man; very evident of most of my family, but I still have to remind myself that he is only playing a character in the movie. It's not a depiction of the real man. LOL!!That's one of the things I love about Color Purple. The characters seem so real because you can see your own relatives and hear some of their stories in this very movie.

I recently finished the novel on which the movie was based and was disappointed after viewing the film version. The film lacks character development and significant portions of the novel were omitted. The novel's emotional intensity was so much greater than that of the film, I was not moved by the tragedies and successes of many of the characters. The epistolary form with which the novel was written allows the reader to form a greater attachment to the characters and their experiences. Much of this emotional attachment was lost in viewing the film.However, there were bright spots in the movie. Whoopie Goldgerg and Oprah Winfrey's portrayal of Celie and Spohia was outstanding. Costumes fit the time period and I also enjoyed seeing Harpo's jukejoint come to life.If you loved the movie The Color Purple, I highly reccomend the novel by Alice Walker."},{"rating":"1","title":"fake snow","review":"The snow is fake, so is much of the rest of this commercial production.

He compares rhyme-wise (not yet musically) to Jigga and Eminem, don't believe me, just listen to \\"That's Me\\" where he just destorys a dramatic track produced by Self. The other hot songs are The autobiographical title track, \\"Do It Again\\" feat. pre-Bootylicious Destiny's Child, the solemn \\"What I Gotta Live For\\", the one and only Ol' Dirty wilds out on \\"Violence\\", the forgotten first single \\"Let Me Know\\", \\"Double Up\\" and \\"Losin' Weight\\" feat. a sick flowing Prodigy of Mobb Deep round out the hot song list of this unbelievable sophomore effort Roc-a-Fella's newest soldier.

This is the best song on the cd.

It made sense to me...and when I read about reincarnation and how childbirth allows us to nurture and care for souls with whom we might have karma from other lifetimes, that was pretty profound to me, too.

I bought another self-watering planter at a garden store and in stark contrast, they are doing fine (Mesa Round Planter, 12\\" Blue).I think the problem is that the \\"strip\\" at the bottom provides inadequate water to the soil when a plant is growing in it, making it tempting to water from the top, which is not a good idea since there is no drainage at the bottom. The lack of drainage at the bottom makes putting this planter outdoors a disaster and I think results in too little aeration for the roots."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"The hole for water is impossible to get water in, without a funnel or similar.

Valerie was left destitute by a gambling father and brother. Malcolm lost the roll of dice and so was \\"chosen\\" to take care of her. He was only being honorable to marry her. This is not a sugary romance but is about a couple who matures, learns to make the best of it, and eventually realize they are better together then apart. There were no villainess people setting out to shoot, kidnap or compromise our heroine. Only the selfish money grubbing Lady Deidre sets out to spoil a floundering marriage. The central couple, Malcolm and Valerie ran hot and cold throughout the book. I never thought they would end up staying together after hearing the word \\"divorce\\" used so many times! The secondary characters added nice dimension. The only thing lacking was a little blurb from Malcolm about it being the best roll of dice he ever lost-but that would make it the syrupy romance it is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my style","review":"If you consider opening pink bits to be a competitive sport, or if you think object A in orifice B presents a woman at her most alluring, you'll love this.

Maybe because of the desert heat? Whatever, I think that the life span should be measured in years, not in months or even weeks. My previous cooler was still working fine after many years when I got a bigger one. I think they switched to cheaper parts.If you do buy this cooler and your latches also break consider replacing with metal latches. I know Igloo sells them though you may need to go to the Igloo site to find them. That's going to be my next attempt. I've got about as much invested now in latches as I did in the original cooler."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE the cooler, not the latches","review":"Cooler is FANTASTIC. We use it for all of our tailgates (40-160 people). We strap the whole thing down on the back of the truck and make people pull their drinks out through the window. One cooler of ice/beer will keep beer cold from 7 AM until 9 PM, even with continual adding of warm cans (we go through about 20-30 cases per tailgate). GREAT product.The latches on the other hand are terrible. If metal ones can be ordered as replacements, that's definitely the way to go. We've broken two latches already this year.Unfortunately someone stole the cooler off the truck last weekend, so we had to downgrade to the 150 qt.SIDENOTE: Costco sells this during the summertime for about 50% of what you can find it for online."},{"rating":"1","title":"Igloo 165 quart cooler","review":"I bought this cooler 1 year ago. The first time I used it, one of thelatched cracked and broke. I should have called Igloo right away, but I put it off (my fault). We used it again for a Halloween party without incident. The third time we used it for a Memorial Day party, the other latch broke. I checked with Igloo, and they want $3.99 each for each latch, $5.95 shipping, and $4.00 for handling to replace two clearly defective pieces of small plastic. This cooler is good at keeping things cold, but due to the low quality and horrible design of the latches and hinges, and the over the top cost to correct the issue, I am sure I will never purchase another Igloo product. Note that this cooler has never left my house, all use has been at home, so the damage was not caused by transport."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Capacity and Insulation but has some issues with quality","review":"I really like the capacity and insulation characteristic of this cooler. However, I am not crazy about the plastic parts like the hinges and latches. If it were made of metal, it would have been much better.Another issue that I have is the design of the handles. When I attempted to carry the cooler with a full load of ice, the handle broke. The four screws used to secure the handle were stripped out of the cooler. It would have been nice if the cooler was design to carry more weight considering the size of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Gangster Flick","review":"This is a classic movie. I was hooked the very first time I saw it and whenever it comes on TV I watch it when I get the chance. Finally I bought the DVD. The movie has excellent direction and a superb cast.

The direction is superb--the long tracking shot, following Henry Hill from his car, threw the kitchen, and to his table at a nightclub, is amazing.But I wish Scorsese had found a way to pick up the pace o the last 30 minutes. Once Henry goes into the witness protection program, the film flags a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"ferocious realization","review":"Goodfellas what can you say except sit back and enjoy the show!I get gooosebumps just thinking about Henry Hills life story as Martin Scorsese takes you deep into the ruthless world of the mob.Their isn't a dull moment in this edge of your seat thriller.It's the kind of movie you can watch again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential, but where are the extras?","review":"Goodfellas, like Mean Streets before it, is a landmark of American cinema. First-rate acting from an incredible cast, a fine script, and some of Scorsese's most beautiful scenes (think of the freeze-frame of the exploding car, the long tracking shot into the Copa, the discovery of the dead bodies to the tune of \\"Layla\\") make this not one of the best films of the decade but of all time. I must say, however, that I was tempted to give this four stars for the lack of any special features. Widescreen and a movie trailer or two just won't cut it for a film this good. Let's hope there's an anniversary edition released sometime with some goodies attached."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous and big","review":"Such a good movie. One of those movies where you're talking to somebody else about it, going \\"what about the scene when so-and-so happened...\\" Scene after scene gets permanently etched in your memory.

Anyone familiar with this movie already knows how great it is so I am not about to review it. As for the disk itself why is the movie on both sides? Maybe I'm just being picky here buy why do I have to flip the disk over to see side two? My fault for not noticing that when I placed the order but still these days no movies come loaded on both sides of a disk. As for the format it's widescreen only and not the best of image quality.

It just sucks you in and never lets go. If you ask me this film got cheated out of winning best picture from Dances with Wolves which doesn't even come close to this movie.

The movie is also arguably the peak of the careers of Martin Scorsese, Joe Pesci, and Robert Deniro.

I have seen it, literally, about 10 times in the last 9 months. The scenes in this movie are very vivid; they stick with you. It's hard to forget the climactic scenes that show the day Henry Hill is caught selling drugs, for instance.This movie has been accused by some of glorifying the Mafia life. I think the opposite is the case. Although in the beginning of the movie clearly it looks good to be a gangster, that all changes when Hill is caught with drugs and has his life threatened by his best friends.I'm having trouble getting across how wonderful I think this movie is. Let me sum up by saying that if you are interested in the Mafia at all, especially in seeing how a blue collar Mob guy lived, you should check out GoodFellas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatest Movie, Bad DVD!","review":"If you want to watch a one of the greatest Mob Movies of all time get this Movie!

You go to Blockbuster and rent a movie if you want to watch it. You buy the DVD because it has great picture quality and features.So, my review is about the DVD itself.The first and biggest negative is the fact that it is on two sides of the DVD. There is nothing more annoying than having to flip the DVD halfway through the movie. There really isn't much else on there. For me, seeing a grainy theatrical trailer isn't very exciting. It gets a 4 only because the film itself is so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfection","review":"Mistake not, this is not a movie but rather a documentary. Few, if any, movies capture the cultural subtlties and realities of both Italo-American life and small time organized crime activity during the Henry Hill saga.

Can't Warners be bothered to re-master one of the great films so it really looks as good as it COULD on blu-ray?? Stick with whatever copy you have and don't let them profit with this scam! I feel ripped off and I'm PISSED. I mean, I put the disc in and in the first shot of the movie I see \\"ghosts\\" coming off the red tail lights of their car cruising down the highway. Then when they stop to open the trunk and the tail lights are washed over those three greats Liotta, De Niro, and Pesci, the detail to the shot is almost non-existent. The rest of the movie doesn't look any better, like standard video, not high definition. At first I thought I had screwed up and put in a dvd of the movie by mistake, not a blu-ray! Hell, I've seen DVDS far far better looking than this disc.Shame shame shame on you Warners. You guys are the TRUE gangsters."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best mafia film ever!","review":"In Goodfellas, Martin Scorsese brings us, the viewers, another great one.

In hindsight, I wish I'd spent a little more and gotten a decent DVD. This is a double-sided DVD, with the movie split in half over both sides. This means that if you're watching it in your living room, you'll have to get up and flip the disc over in the middle of the movie. In addition, it is not anamorphic widescreen, so on a widescreen tv it shows up as a little box in the center of the screen (though on a fullscreen it should be fine). Finally, it has no special features except for the trailers. If you plan on watching this film more than once, invest the extra bucks and get the newer edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Film Masterpiece, DVD Tragedy","review":"Goodfellas is arguably one of the best movies ever put on film. Unfortunately, Warner Brothers has done a fine job of screwing-up our ability to enjoy this masterpiece at home. The \\"modern\\" DVD version of this movie is primative at best. It is one of the few, single-layered antiques in existence that you must flip midway through the movie. Pathetic. They would've been better-off releasing this on Beta. Sadly, if you are one of the many out there who hold this movie in the high regard that I do, you're obligated to own it - just don't get too comfortable.

I was not so bothered by the lack of extra features as I was by this.

If I may be so bold as to say, I think this film is better than 'The Godfather' (as much as I adore that film). 'GoodFellas' pulls no punches in its depiction of a half-Irish/half-Sicilian kid from \\"the neighborhood\\" who becomes engulfed in the Mafia from age eleven. What Scorsese did with this film is like nothing I have ever seen. He spanned thirty years of Mafia life, and made it compelling and energetic. You get the feeling that this was their time, and it is incredible and intoxicating witnessing the luxurious lifestyle. Then as their downfall appears evident, as people begin getting killed left and right, even from their own crew, it is almost saddening to watch. For any fan of mob movies, or movies in general, this is a sure bet. The best film of the 1990s."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best film of the 90's!!","review":"It's hard to pick what Martin Scorsese movie is the best. As a matter of fact, \\"Taxi Driver\\" and \\"Raging Bull\\" were the best movies of the previous decades. When I first saw this movie, I thought it was brilliant. Now, over 13 years later, this movie still holds up like \\"Citizen Kane\\". Probably the best gangster movie of all time!! And without question the best film of the past decade.UPDATE!! I just purchased the Two disc DVD set of Martin Scorsese's finest work. Scorsese and actors Lorraine Bracco and Ray Liotta gives some great retrospect on the grounbreaking film. There is also a few documentaries on life in the mob. But my personal favorite is the \\"real\\" Henry Hill and the FBI agent who help him turn in Jimmy Conway and Paul Cicero giving their observations on the DVD extras. This is a must-have for fans of the movie.Note: I still get a kick out of many of the actors in this film who would appear later on in \\"The Sopranos\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"These are not men of honor, but ruthless back stabbers who don't hesitate to betray close friends for a few pieces of silver. Ray Liotta splendidly portrays Hill as a man who joins the mob as a teenager for the excitement and fast money. Those like Jimmy Conway (Robert Di Niro) and Tommy De Vito (Joe Pesci) befriend Hill in their own dubious manner.Check out streetbrawls.com for real action Hill looks upon them as brothers, but it seems they merely perceive him as a fellow party animal who aptly carries out his responsibilities to the group. Lorraine Bracco as Karen Hill is a woman who marries her man knowing full well about his dangerous side. Hill introduces his wife to drugs and often places her in harm's way. Their marriage is a never ending dysfunctional disaster. It totally redefines the meaning of family values.This is not a film for someone seeking a romanticized depiction of organized crime. These people are monsters who prey on their fellow citizens."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie .terrible dvd","review":"great great movie.even though the dvd has no extras it does not hinder my thoughts on giving this 5 lovely stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goodfellas DVD","review":"Great movie, not really needed on as DVD format, but if you have some money to burn and don't like VHS get it.

Afterward, my friend and I looked at each other with a mutual surprised expression -- \\"That was a great movie\\" . Scorcese is an incredible storyteller and, 'Goodfellas', like 'The Sopranos', has received such critical acclaim b/c of the believability of the characters and the creative way it is presented. A lot of the dialogue in the film was adlibbed by the actors, more realism. Excellent film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another classic mafia movie.","review":"Pesci, De Niro, and Liotta directed by Scorsese? How can you go wrong?

This is appauling, and a slap in the face to us, and the man who brought us this film, Martin Scorsese.

Splurge and buy the 20th anniversary or Blu-ray version."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE mob movie par excellence","review":"The beauty of Goodfellas is that it elegantly crystallizes all the tropes and themes inherent of the mafia/mob genre. The performances are high octane (Liotta) or elegantly understated (Deniro). As a tale of self-invention turned self-immolation, it is quintessential Scorcese. Along with the Godfather trilogy, I couldn't think of a more comprehensive take on a highly volatile and covert lifestyle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage!","review":"I cannot fathom why Warner made this DVD a single layer.

With out doubt one of the best mob movies ever made. Starring Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Ray Liotta. This movie is the true story of Liotta's character getting into to the mob at a very young age and moving up the ranks. \\"GoodFellas\\" goes through his life until the end were he gets his self into trouble with the law and latter on with the mob. Before it's over tons of wackings and a surprise ending or at least I think so! When Liotta try's to leave the mob and it doesn't work out as he planned. This movie has everything a good mob movie should have Killings, people ripping other people off, killing, cops, jail. Oh, and more killing!

Technically, the transfer is pretty good suffering from only a few artefacts and banding.

The narrator tells the story from his first person perspective as a past time gangster.The acting is great and the soundtrack stays in your head.It's one of those movies that, after seeing it in the theater, you'd want to own asap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flip Over","review":"Yes a classic gangster movie. What's the deal with the flip-over? Half the movie is on one side and the other half is on the other side.

One sequence, probably one of the most memorable in all cinema history, is the \\"Layla\\" scene. For those who have seen it, no explanation is needed.

Robert De Niro plays Jimmy Conway, a guy who will never be \\"made\\" because he is part jewish. Ray Liotta plays Henry Hill who will also never be made because he is half jewish as well. And Joe Pesci plays Tommy DeVito, a full Italian who will some day be the boss in Liotta's well-narrated part. This film focuses the most on Liotta and this is the movie that no joke \\"made\\" all three of these talented actors. This is also from the maker of\\"Casino\\", another great film by Scorcese. But, \\"Goodfellas\\" is the better of the two.

Yet the DVD doesn't do this classic justice. First off, the movie is listed as being enhanced for widescreen televisions. Unfortunately, this only applies to the menus, not the film itself. Another major problem is that the soundtrack of this film seems to be mixed in Dolby ProLogic since there's a lack of surround action. And the biggest problem with this disc: it's dual-sided, not dual-layered. In the middle of the film, the disc stops and you have to get up and flip it. Come on: this isn't laser disc.Memo to Warner Bros.: Remaster this epic anamorphically, in DTS digital surround, and make it a special edition, 2-disc set with the film on a dual-layered disc and extras on the second disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliant Movie...Slipshod DVD","review":"Since I consider Martin Scorcese's \\"Goodfellas\\" the greatest gangster film ever made and one of the all time great motion pictures, it breaks my heart to give the DVD issue only one star (almost feel like Henry Hill ratting on his friends).What could the \\"geniuses\\" at Warner Home Video been thinking?The DVD is two sided, which means it has to be flipped in order to watch the 2nd half and there are NO special features to speak of except for a couple of trailers and a few production notes.For a movie like \\"Goodefellas\\" (a film that boasts absoutely brilliant acting, writing, directing, cinematography, and soundtrack) to get such slipshod DVD treatment is inexcusable.How about it Warners?A \\"Special Edition\\" re-issue including commentary by Scorcese and/or Nick Pileggi; interviews with the stars, deleted scenes, and maybe the ENTIRE movie on ONE side.If it's not in the stores by the end of the Summer, we may have to ask Tommy, Jimmy and Henry to pay you a visit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Sided DVD?","review":"First of all let me start off by saying that the 1 star is not for the movie itself. The single star is for the DVD version because the movie is on 2 sides! That's right! Just like a laser disk. When my friend told me it was on two sides I thought there was a widescreen and full screen version on each side, which is very common on older DVD's. But no, halfway through the movie you have to get up and flip the movie to finish watching it. It this a big deal? YES! It is a DVD, the form of media that was supposed to do away with such nonsense. Completely unacceptable! 1 star!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dirt - Poor DVD","review":"GOODFELLAS itself is worth five stars easily, but this is me complaining about the DVD again. What in God's name is this flipping stuff? The movie actually stops halfway through and you have to flip the thing over to continue watching it! Can it be possible that we've actually REGRESSED to where the VHS version is superior than the DVD? I mean, cripes. It's not like they couldn't have fit the entire movie onto one side. It's a 140 minute movie, whereas the SOPRANOS DVD easily fits four 50-minute episodes on one side. Something is seriously messed up.And what's with the lack of extras? Two trailers is all we get? GOODFELLAS needs to be thrown back on the pile of DVDs that need to be released as a Criterion Edition, toot suite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goodfellas","review":"This is one the best movies I have ever seen in my entire life. If you have never seen this movie you might as well just shoot your self."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the best!!!","review":"This is my all time favorite movie.

AWFUL DVD!!","review":"To keep the review short, I will say that the movie is one of my all-time favorites, BUT the DVD VERSION ...!! Here's why I hate the DVD: the movie is presented in halves on 2 disc sides-YOU HAVE TO FLIP THE DVD HALF WAY THROUGH THE MOVIE!! Also, where are the 'DVD extras' like interviews, bonus footage, and more that is common on other DVD's ?? Wait for a remastered & 'special' version of this DVD!! Don't waste your money!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"He's done better","review":"I was disappointed by this one, which seems to be a recording of a radio broadcast, complete with annoying voice over. Also, I didn't care too much for the arrangements, overly orchestrated. A much, MUCH better recording is Milanes' \\"Boleros Mexicanos\\", which is basically just him and his guitar.

The way in which it was edited (from the very beginning, when it takes nearly five minutes for any of the characters to speak one word or do anything of importance --while a piece of pseudo-mysterious classical music plays in the background) gives it a TV movie feel that lasts through the very end. The sudden and predictable denouement takes place after over an hour and a half of no character development and absolute movie boredom; even Meryl Streep's amazing acting qualities do nothing to rescue this tepid excuse for a film. Not worth buying, only worth watching on a boring Sunday afternoon when there's nothing else on the other 157 channels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Acting","review":"Merle Streep & Liam are good actors in their own right, together they work well. The movie is good, bit of twists & turns, better than I thought it would be, I recommend the movie as good entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it a comedy?","review":"Well, I found myself shaking my head and chuckling a few times and the ridiculous dialogue. But wait, it's not a comedy! As one of the other viewers pointed out, the movie dialogue was so corny and so much like a movie that it reminded me of a skit from Saturday Night Live or something. The parents were both morons, in my opinion. It's very sad that such excellent actors had to play such stupid roles.I give it two stars for the beautiful scenery in the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toothless story","review":"The great shame of this movie is that it veered so terribly from the premise of the novel.Brown's novel was so gripping and emotionally difficult precisely because Jacob did murder his girlfriend in cold blood. We struggle with the family as they come to grips with this hard truth: a seemingly \\"normal\\" family can indeed produce a dysfunctional, disturbed child and educated, thoughtful parents are often powerless to understand why. All of the dramatic power came from the adults struggling to figure out what to do with a son they don't recognize, and a younger sister knowing very well who her brother is but unable to share that information because the adults are interested in hearing it.The movie pulled the teeth from this story when it gave us the eleventh-hour confession of Jacob's crime as *an accident*. Good grief. The movie, which wasn't very good to start with, then collapsed into unbelievable, sentimental pap.My sympathies are with the author, who must have been appalled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Actors in a Terrible Film","review":"How can a movie with Meryl Streep and Liam Neeson fail so miserably? Try a clunky plot, two dimensional characters, and small town full of stereotypes, that's how. Honestly, the characters aren't even attractive and act (especially in the case of the father, played by Neeson) absolutely bizarre. The pacing is way off and the suspense gives way to simple dread as the movie wears on. In a rare move, my wife and I didn't even watch to the very end. Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Before and After rules!!!!","review":"It is my personal opinion that the motion picture entitled \\"Before and After\\", rules!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fan of both these actors.","review":"These 2 great stars do not disappoint.

I planned to go there after travelling in north California because I heard that Oregon has a very beautiful nature. But after watching this video there was no desire to go there. Maybe the state is really beautiful, I don't know, the video does not show it. There was not a single place shown in the film which provoked my nature-loving feelings. It is not a professional filming. Operator(s) mostly did not film places waiting (or coming early) for a nice sunlight, rather shooting nature during peak sun hours which created harsher shadows and very pale colours. The quality of image is mediocre at best, and it looks like this is not because of the quality of DVD, but because of the quality of equipment they used. This is a review of the DVD, not of Oregon state!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a state of wonder","review":"This DVD is aptly subtitled because Oregon truly is a state of wonder! I feel qualified to make such a statement because it is my place of birth, where I grew up and where I have my roots firmly planted. This DVD shows and describes beautifully the many facets of this gorgeous state in a clear, well-organized, succinct manner.It is a beautiful synopsis of a truly magnificent state. I brought this DVD back with me to Germany, where I have been living for many years, in order to be 'home ' at the touch of a finger and I have ordered two more, one for my sister, who also lives in Germany and one for my travel companion."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre at best...","review":"This film manages to show some of the natural wonders of the state of Oregon, but spends way too much camera time on trashy side-of-the-road \\"attractions\\"...and the makers also had a thing for showing intersections in the middle of small towns and the traffic lights therein for some unknown reason, and boy does he have a thing for lava fields too - one or two were quite enough, thank you...not very professionally done at all...and the narration will drive you insane if you listen to it all the way through...my advice - don't.

It has interminable badly shot amateur porn scenes. If Misty Mundae wasn't so delicious, it would have no value at all. I own this title simply to own it. The one time I have watched it will almost certainly be the last. I may trot it out one day to prove to some fan of esoterica how cooler than thou I am."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF","review":"This has got to be the worst movie ever, its barely even a movie. I could make a better movie using my cell phone. The picture quality is crap, it has no plot and the sex scenes are lame. On the bonus disk there is a lost scene, it should have never been found. Why did I waste my money on this? It says on the back cover \\"Its the movie Misty doesn't want you to see\\", well that makes two of us.

The other products I can put a half of a dropper into 64 ounces of water and have a perfect taste.

Marsalis takes some well known material and instills it with incredible feeling. I didn't expect nearly this much from this record, but it has been entirely enjoyable and I highly recommend it.

Besides the very bright and polished finish, this continental-sized flatware feels great in your hand and is perfect whether you're serving on your best china or your everyday dinnerware. And one of the very best parts? It comes with 12 extra teaspoons. If you're like me, sometimes those pesky spoons slip into the disposal and get chewed up and ragged. No problem with this set, you have 12 opportunities to replace the one you lost! The set also comes packaged in a wooden tray that slips into your kitchen drawer and can be used as a silverware holder for your buffets and potlucks.I looked everywhere, both on line and in the brick-and mortars for a set I liked. My biggest concern was whether the set in the picture would look and feel as good in hand. I was more than pleased. This is the best, both in value and quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great set with a big flaw","review":"This is sturdy, strong, quality flatware with a serious flaw: rust keeps breaking through the knives on the serrated edge!

It came packaged very nicely and the caddy was nice, a little large for a typical drawer however. My only concern is that none of the pieces were marked as being 18/10 which is one of the main reasons I purchased this set. I have a Reed & Barton 18/10 set myself and every piece has that clearly marked on the back of it. There was nothing on the box either to indicate that it was in fact 18/10. So I don't know if this was a misrepresentation of the product or if all of their 18/10 is simply not marked(which I seriously doubt). This is the reason I only gave it 2 stars because I feel that they have the discription wrong on this one and I did not get the higher quality set I thought I was ordering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reed and Barton Cresendo II stainless flatware","review":"I sent this flatware back because it was pricey and not as heavy as I would have liked.

Although this is one of their earlier films - WHAT WERE THEY THINKING???? This movie isn't fun, just dumb, from the blase plot to the far-fetched premise of Madonna as a missionary.

I love her movies (not because I think she can act but because they're always so bad they're good). But this movie is an exception to all the others. It's just bad. Words can't describe. I think what made it so painful was the fact that it went on forever. Just when you think it's over something else happens. Once that's over with something ELSE happens. After that, something ELSE happens. And then something else. And then something else. And all that really happens is Madonna and Sean Penn run around like idiots. I'm sure this movie must be really embarassing for them. Madonna's performance is so wooden and if Sean weren't cute he wouldn't be any fun to watch either.I wish I could give this movie 0 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad... but perversely enjoyable","review":"The story is rubbish, the acting is bad, however I did enjoy it in some perverse way! (One of those, its so bad its good films perhaps?)Know-one comes out of this film unscathed. Penn's character is completely annoying; his histrionics really grated on my nerves and Madonna's acting has never been worse (the crying scene has got to be seen to be believed).The scenery is beautiful though, and possibly the only other noteable thing this film has going for it, is that Madonna is absolutely stunning in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprise! This Is A Pretty Good Movie!","review":"Reading most of the reviewers who have a marginal opinion of \\"Shanghai Surprise\\" they give it damning faint praise by saying it's not as bad as its reputation suggests. Man up and admit it's a pretty good movie. The critics in its day made hay of the film saving their worst venom for Madonna. She's not going to win any Oscars for her turn as a missionary in Thirties China but she gives a very sweet account of herself in only her second feature role. Sean Penn as the American opportunist/glow-in-the-dark tie salesman is quite charismatic and dashing. The story is relatively riveting and the film contains stunning exotic period detail. Lastly, producer George Harrison, who also appears in a nightclub scene, contributes some terrific songs to the soundtrack. I give this film my unequivocal recommedation with very few reservations."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO SURPRISE HERE..","review":"JUST WHEN YOU THINK YOU HAVE SEEN YOUR LAST OF SUCKY MOVIES..ONE, LIKE THIS REARS ITS UGLY, BLEACH BLONDE HEAD..WHEN WILL SOME PEOPLE START READING SCRIPTS, BEFORE COMMITING TO DO A MOVIE..I HOPE SOMEONE GOT FIRED OVER THIS FIASCO..IT ACTUALLY MAKES MOVIES LIKE \\"GRAFFITI BRIDGE\\" LOOK LIKE \\"ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE\\"....MADONNA, GO HOME!!!!!!!!

Our culture often villifies the Germans categorically, and this book shows us that they should not be stereotyped or oversimplified. This French-born German infantryman shows us the hell of war on the front lines in Russia from his own point of view, a view that is tragic, vivid, and poignant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seeing the Human Side of a German Soldier","review":"I first read this book while in high school.

But is it true?","review":"This book is very involved and a joy for WW2 history buffs. Unfortunately, after conducting a little side research, I discovered a great deal of skepticism leveled at Guy Sajer and his account of his \\"experiences\\" on the Eastern Front during WW2. His critics provide specific instances of discontinuity, fabrications, or deliberate gray-areas detailed in The Forgotten Solder, and one must take this into account when wieghing it's authenticity. I found these accusations downright troubling and didn't rate the book quite as high as a result. If you can overcome the skepiticism associated with it and consider the book a \\"partial\\" fabrication, you'll probably enjoy the storyline none the less."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Counter-Point to the Non-Believers!

This is because people who do this, like me, are diseased because we have to take note of every important thing which happened on one day. I myself, am able to remember paragraphs of dialogue because one powerful word allows for my brain to remember what the word was being used for, and why it was being used. This allows an author to recount pages of dialogues, easily. He doesn't remember of all of it, but just small bits which allows the brain recollect nearly the entire conversation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately it's a novel","review":"If anybody cares to read into the fine print, then one can tell this Guy Sajer is totally fictitious.I don't think he actually fought in the Gossdeutschland Division of the Heer, one of the few units allowed to wear an armband on the right arm, NOT left as he described it. For reference, please read the mass of books by Helmut Spater on the GD, from its infancy as an infanterieregiment to its end as a panzerkorps"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Decent Read.","review":"I'm not much for the manipulation of words, but, i'll give my quick thoughts on this. It gave pretty good insight into the german soldiers on the eastern front during WW2. Too often we're led to believe that they were all mindless, murdering, nazi zombies. The fact is that they were people like everyone else in the world. Some were good, some were bad. They just happened to be following a madman with some VERY poor ideas to say the least. The only drawback I have is the author seems to remember every word of every conversation he had in the army, but, in some spots can't remember dates. Seems a bit suspect to me. All in all, a good read if you're interested in that side of a historical time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd put SIX stars if I could ******!!!","review":"The best \\"ground\\" WWII book I have ever read.

I've become sort of a student of military history and have read dozens of books, both historical and personal. While this book doesn't provide much of a historical or political overview of the war, it provides the the most in-depth, detailed exposure of a front line soldier's hell I have ever read. It is must read for students and politicians!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book but not \\"The only book on war\\"","review":"First off, yes its an ubelievable book on a horrible war. But it isn't the \\"only real book on the reality of war\\". This was simply one account of a pretty far reaching conflict. To say it is the only book anybody should ever read about for the reality of war is kind of overstating the issue a bit. Not all infantry soldiers had an experience like Guy Sajer but their books can be equally meaningful. I have read a book James Mcpherson's \\"For Cause and Comrades\\" and the diary entries taken from those combat soldiers didnt sound remotely like Guy Sajer at all. Still an excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that will stay with me forever.","review":"From the moment I opened this book, I felt as if I was there. Sajer's ability to convey all the emotions of a man in such terrible circumstances is without compare. It is impossible to find the words to discribe the impact of this book. It held me captive until the very last page and, indeed, holds me still. I cannot recommend this book highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best first person accounts of soldiering, ever!!!","review":"An incredible account of the experiences that were truly a life and death struggle.

The only reason I gave this book a four and not a five; it's almost literally painful to read, especially when Sajer describes fighting in the freezing Russian winter. This is a horrendous book to take on, nothing to be taken lightly. I also read that the actors in the film \\"Saving Pvt. Ryan\\" read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid book!","review":"I am an obsessive world war 2 book reader and this is one, I find very hard to tear myself away from.

I have never written a review for a book before on amazon, but this one deserves it.It just sucks you in to the story. When reading it you feel sad, happy and in love, along with Sajer - you want to cry when he is crying, you want to laugh when he's laughing. The simple language that he uses to describe, delivers a powerful message about what really courage, fear, love and sadness is. To a point where you think he is exaggerating, because anyone else in his shoes would have went insane from the experiences that he went through. I have no idea how Sajer managed to survive the whole thing. Thankfully, he did, and we got this incredible book that should be read and passed on through generations. Incredible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bueno","review":"Un libro muy fácil de leer por lo ameno y ágil de la historia.Es un relato para los interesados en los aspectos humanos de la guerra y los que participaron en ella.muy recomendable para todo tipo de personas que se quieran adentrar enla guerra sin Gloria ni adornos.Una linda historia humana"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Classic and still probably the best.","review":"This is the book to start your collection of German WWII personal experiences.

In chapter 3 Sajer writes that he wasfighting for a \\"good cause\\". Yeah right - if you define agood cause as a murderous racist regime that invades othercountries! It's strange to me that so few readers aredisturbed by Sajer's lack of admission of wrong-doing.Sajer frequently boasts in the book that the German armywould have prevailed if only they didn't face superiornumerical odds in Russia. He has the attitude that a lotof Confederate veterans had in writing about the civil war.Bitter about the suffering he experienced and making excusesfor defeat, while showing almost no contrition for the sufferinghe imposed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Forgotten Soldier - great historyfiction book","review":"It is an excellent book but its category is misplaced - it should be categorized as historyfiction.I am a Jew born in Poland and all my father's family were murdered by Germans, and 90% of my mother's family were murdered by Germans. I heard many stories about how German soldiers behaved in concentration camps, and about how German soldiers murdered all Polish villagers as punishment for partisants activities.

Many believe Sajer either made these events up or gleaned them from stories told by other German veterans. Others truly believe that Sajer's stories are his true experiences. Regardless, I found the book and highly enjoyable read and found myself experiencing the events along with him.Personally, I read the book for the content and story and not with an eye to picking it apart as to its probability realted to its value as fact or fiction. If you read it with my shared mindset, then I dare say you are in for a delightful read. If, however, you read it with a skeptical mind as to it validity, then perhaps it may not be so enjoyable (I don't know).Either way...fact of fiction or a hybrid...I would reccommend this book without reservation as I found it a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is not a historical reference book","review":"If you are looking for specifics - the units involved in particular engagements, or the locality or chronology thereof - this is not a book for you.The soldier looking over the sights of his mauser is not in the best position to know those specifics, or remember them correctly afterwards. What this soldier records is outside of strategy and completely irrelevant to it; yet it addresses the very heart of the condition of war in a way that no general's book ever could. This story puts you eye level to the war and (uniquely) on the German side of the eastern front.Don't listen to the nay-sayers who pick at errors and question the historical veracity of Sajer's account. If every detail were perfectly correct THAT would cast doubt on the authenticity. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I've ever read, I read it over and over ...","review":"A must-read for any student of european history, or any war veteran. Love, adventure, comradeship, anguish, horror. This book covers the full range of human emotion in depth and sincerity. The best book I've ever read.

He lived these experiences."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books ever written on the war.","review":"I have read alot of books on the European Campaign.This book shows a side of the war you very seldom read about.Someone caught up on the German side and going through everything about war in a very short time.We have to many books on wars from the Generals who only try to help their image by telling us what they did and how they did it when it comes to winning or losing a war.

Life fates some people to see it all and this fella saw the Russian front.How strange.A young boy sucked in by exuberance and burnt out in exhaustion 3 years later at the surrender.I have only more admiration for the German people for having gone through this furnace.We in the west only hear about the Jews , endlessly , apparently the only event of ww2 war 'The haulocast'- apparently-endlessly dredged up--perhaps for self interest.Anyway a cracker story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best personal history I've ever read","review":"I read this book about 12 years ago. I've never forgotten it. It immediately springs to mind whenever I think of a book to recommend. It was the best story I've ever read. I search for personal histories from WWI to Vietnam and have not found anything close across all of that time. How it was told and the story being told was incredible. No movie I know of can compete. Personal histories from the German side are rare in the USA. I'm very interested to hear the German point of view, to understand how the soldier felt. But this book goes beyond that and gives you the point of view of a non-German, yet who's inside the German system, starting as a semi-laborer and progressing to be a member of the Waffen SS. Nearly unbelievable if I hadn't read it myself. The vividness of the roar of the charge as the Russians came on from horizon to horizon during the battles in Russia still is fresh in my mind.

Thank God I was born 30 years to late. A great read, the best I have ever had, I have reccomended it to non history friends and they love it. Also, Sajer has been accused of making a lot of this up, dont forget that the original text was in French and was translated so I am sure some details have been lost. I believe Sajer is still alive, in Paris, and as far as I know is an illistrater for a Paris Newspaper.

Hooray Amazon.com! Well written narrative account holds the reader's interest with its dramatic telling. It focuses on the soldiers' point of view. That point of view gives insights to the actual progress of the war and the author gives a framework of the progress on the larger scale. Learning how the greater forces resulting in the outcome of the war affected the everyday soldier on the ground makes those academic conclusions hit home in the vision of the front line given to us by Guy Sajer. I wonder what became of him?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book about war and what its like to serve!","review":"Without a doubt this book exemplifies what it is to be in a military unit under the most extreme conditions. It reminds those who have served their countries what it was like to have friendships forged during those conditions. For those who have never served their countries, it spells out the pain and folly of war - that any veteran can see.

Another heartbreaking storyis the hungry German soldier hung for eatingabandoned food earmarked for the German officercorps.\\"The Forgotten Soldier\\" brilliantly tells the storyof a Frenchman who fought with the Germans.

Since then I have read it three more times. It contains many universal truths, about courage, friendship and love. Not just love of country, but love of fellow man.and woman. There is no better book about war. It is the quintessential book about Barbarossa. When I read about the soldiers celebrating Christmas on the front and singing carols,I can feel the lonliness and isolation of a soldier far from home.

It's one soldiers sad, horrifying and lonely story as seen through the eyes of young Guy Sajer. Only 18 years old and French, he is caught in the insanity of WWII and the fall of the Eastern Front. After watching Spielberg's graphic war movie, 'Saving Private Ryan', I found the images and emotions Sajer writes about all that much more troubling.

Mr. Sajer was just a teenager and was thrust into such a brutal war at such an early age, to be so exposed to all of this death and trajedy, is a crime unto itself. It is so important that books like this need to be printed so future generations can see, and feel, vicariously, the senseless and needless atrocities of war.

Unison melody lines, heavy rock guitar licks and boomy bass peg this one as originating in the early 70's -- a collection of mediocre tracks that someone put together to cash in on the current interest in Buddy's music.If you're just getting started with Buddy's music, try listening to the samples from \\"The New One,\\" \\"Mercy Mercy\\", \\"Wham\\" or just about any other release and see what you think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Lame Movie of the 90's","review":"I can't believe someone told me to watch this movie.

Chris Rock plays a memorable performance. As does Wesley Snipes, though his portrayal of the role of kingpin is not as satisfying.A bonus of viewing the film after more than a decade after its initial release is that it causes you to think about how far we've come with the \\"war on drugs.\\" Have communities changed much since this film was made?Whatever your politics, you can't help but admit that this film is purely entertaining.

In fact the story is essentially exactly the same as The Godfather with the Scarface coke empire thrown in. The only difference is that there is the cops view of the events that go down and of course the fact that all of the main characters save one are black. Despite the fact that this movie is a blatant rip off I did enjoy it mainly because of Wesley Snipes acting.

There are several very funny scenes, as well as great drama. The acting is also very good.The best thing about the DVD is the transfer. It is excellent, and much cleaner than the VHS.

I had just bought a new DVD player, and I had been using a B&W; movie for the hook-up. This was the only movie I had seen on the new player until popping in this version of Rio Bravo, which, as stated previously, had a sickly green tint to it. I discovered only after writing the first review that I of course had an incorrect hook-up. I fixed it and the movie plays great. My apologies to Duke and Stumpy.Saw this movie during its first run as a nine-year-old and loved it. Still do. But the color reproduction on this DVD is scandalous, and bears absolutely no comparison to its original state. The rich, vibrant color of the original has been replaced by a Dr. Seussian green, making every character look as if they are suffering from sea sickness. This makes the movie unwatchable,despite its low cost.Thank God a new version is due out soon.

The plot is simple, the staging straightforward, yet the characterizations from John Wayne, Angie Dickinson, Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson and Walter Brennan (among others) are genuine. Walter Brennan in particular (a three time Oscar winner) is at his curmudgeonly best here as Stumpy - the trusty sidekick. Here was a man of immense talent who, in various snippets throughout the film, shows a capacity for comic and dramatic talent. Dean Martin demonstrates an underappreciated range, while Wayne holds the entire picture together.Most surprising is Ricky Nelson's performance and the young cowboy with maturity and common sense beyond his years. Angie Dickinson also shows fine acting ability not always recognized in her long career.The DVD is well put together and quality is generally very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!!","review":"The Duke and Dino together.

The greatest of movie stars, John Wayne, at his very best. A beautiful Angie Dickenson. The coolest of the cool Dean Martin and a young up and comer Ricky Nelson. A terrific story of honor, duty, courage, redemption and loyalty. Humor, fun and even a couple of good songs. To sum it up, a great western. If you like John Wayne, this is him at his best. Can't recommend it highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real western with a little fun tossed in","review":"This is John Wayne. You can spot the formula and most of his supporting actors for other John Wayne movies. O.K. you can also see that it is a Howard Hawks' movie.Dean Martin plays himself as Dude. And Ricky Nelson as Colorado Ryan really fits in this movie.The story is of Good guys are holding the Daddy in the jail. All his compadres want him out.

The cattle baron wants murderin' brother out of jail. Result? Mayhem ensues!

Both the Duke and Dino were never better. Much of the story in this film was repeated a couple of times later, both times by John Wayne and Howard Hawks, but this is the original and the best.

What else could justify the casting of lightweights Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson? I suppose with the breakup, Jerry Lewis wasn't available to play Colorado. The song near the end of the film didn't help matters either. How could John Wayne criticize High Noon and then make this kind of fluff? This is not The Searchers (perhaps the definitive John Wayne film), but even as a light hearted western, it's about two hours too long. The Duke has the sissy walk down and Angie Dickinson is not hard to look at, but Walter Brennan is the only gem in this clinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"low quality transfer","review":"Out of all the hd dvds I have purchased so far this one is by far the lowest resolution quality.

It is the simple situation of the good-for-nothing brother of an important rancher in Texas. This brother kills someone out of spite and drunkenness and he is put in goal. His rich rancher of a brother sends his troops to get him out. That's the story of the siege of the prison, and the city, and how they are all going to be killed, on the bad guys' side. The touch of romance is nothing but a minuscule touch in a sea of brush strokes. John Wayne and his fellow crooners Dean Martin and company are doing what they can on a rather bad simple story with no plot or nearly no plot. John Wayne walks extremely badly for a sheriff as if he had a double and inverted rotation of the vertebrae. A society has the heroes it deserves.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Cowboy Slock!","review":"Old Wooden Wayne and twenty-something Angie Dickinson with the most uncomfortable hooey dialog ever written.

John Wayne is at his best and yes, Dean Martin can act. Walter Brennan is a hoot and Angie Dickinson? Grrroowrrr! The extras give a great deal of insight into the making of this classic western. As with The Searchers, there's a lot more going on beneath the surface than there appears. Many, for instance, don't realize Rio Bravo is a stern rebuttal to another classic western, High Noon.I give the video quality three stars. The video transfer on Rio Bravo is not as clean and crisp as it is on The Searchers Blu-ray or even The Cowboys. But it's decent enough even if you won't be using it to show off your system.Worth the buy. If you already own the DVD, you can rent the Blu-ray and watch the special features.

But I, for one, welcome the chance to purchase a newly-remastered sight and sound edition of this great Howard Hawks western, with commentary by admirers John Carpenter and Richard Schickel, Schickel's brilliant 1973 documentary, a John Wayne trailer gallery, and especially two brand-new documentaries in appreciation of the movie. RIO BRAVO is a masterpiece that is getting the crown jewels treatment for only $16 from Amazon. It deserves a serious review by you on none at all. And there are also those who are willing to spend even more to get a pressbook, a comic book, and more. I will settle for the $16 two-disk set and am excited about upgrading my old copy. Consider it an inexpensive variation on the car lover who has to have the newest model every five years.Steve Wood"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite movie","review":"I have seen this movie too many times to count. No clue why. Key players gave great performances. Dean Martin was superb, John Wayne pure John Wayne, and Walter Brennan was wonderful. Pretty obvious that Walter Brennan made Dean Martin crack up in their scenes. Rickey Nelson was a kid when this was made and is showed but he was serviceable. Angie Dickenson looks great and gave a decent performance given her age at the time. Supporting cast well chosen and gave excellent performances. Classic good vs evil with some chuckles tossed in.Blu Ray quality on this was good. Sharp video. Audio was also good to a great score. Overall I am very satisfied.

The great individual characters are appreciated much more because the depth of their performance is seen more clearly (facial expressions, etc.). This is a great fun Howard Hawks - John Wayne western with a spectacular cast of supporting players, with the possible exception of Ricky Nelson, who actually does an OK job. Once you know that his part ('Colorado') was considered for Elvis Presley (Elvis had joined the army and was stationed in Germany by the time filming began) and that Montgomery Clift turned down the same role; you're left wondering, \\"What if...\\".

I was only 15 when I caught that. The music numbers are good (Get along home Cindy Cindy) but if it is exciting western action you want this is pretty slow, watered down and restrained stuff. Dickinson does shine in her not-wasted role as another plus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hawks Past His Prime","review":"RIO BRAVO is sad, in that it shows Howard Hawks long past his prime. Hawks had his golden period from TWENTIETH CENTURY through RED RIVER. His later films, including this poorly structured, tritely written and clumsily acted (especially in its degrading treatment of its Mexican characters) western, are cardboard cutouts compared to his earlier films. If it's John Wayne and Dean Martin you want at the top of their games, check out SONS OF KATIE ELDER, one of the best of all westerns. Of course, its director, Henry Hathaway, isn't looked on with favor by the auteurist clique, thus it isn't given its due. But watch RIO BRAVO and SONS OF KATIE ELDER back-to-back, and decide for yourself which film is the better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's mosey on down to the saloon for a dry martini...","review":"Dean Martin? Ricky Nelson? Angie Dickinson? Must be some Vegas caper flick--but no, it's a Western! Well...John Wayne at his most self-righteous, a totally unconvincing supporting cast (although Walter Brennan makes an exemplary grizzled old sidekick, whoda thunkit)--this flick was a nail in the Western's coffin, not one of the great ones.One positive thing: this was remade as the way better \\"El Dorado\\" (try Robert Mitchum and James Caan instead of Dino & Ricky, for starters)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly A Classic","review":"RIO BRAVO has achieved cult status, mostly because of the auteur nonsense attached to anything Howard Hawks did -- as long as it dealt with professionals carrying out their duties!

An excellent debut from a very talented band: musically they come from the same school as Stereolab, but with more of a psychedelic sound -- imagine if, instead of Can and Serge Gainsbourg, the guys in Stereolab had spent a lot of time listening to \\"Ummagumma\\" by Pink Floyd, and maybe the first King Crimson album. Or imagine Lulu (\\"To Sir With Love\\") fronting a very early version of Emerson, Lake and Palmer. Moody, atmospheric music with unexpected chord changes, unusual melodies, and great lyrics.

Like Stereolab circa Mars Audiac Quintet, Broadcast build their songs around mantras. Come on let's go. The wind will blow. You can fall. these are embraceable slogans for the new millennium, delivered with haunting disinterest by Trish Keenan. The highlight here is the drumming. Every song has a distinct, hypnotic rhythm, at once assertive and calm. This drivin! g force dominated a live show at San Francisco's Bottom of the Hill, mesmerizing the crowd for the 90 minute set In an album that laments the mechanization of our daily lives, The Noise Made By People somehow transcends the austerity of its subject matter, offering warmth in the echoes of the blips and beeps. When someone gets around to remaking Fritz Lang's Metropolis, this will be the soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid album","review":"I picked this album up on the advice of a friend and am glad I did. On the surface, you hear a lot of Velvet Underground and stereolab sounds, with a bit more pop hook. What I'm excited about is I know this album will be something I listen to for a long time to come and not just the first few weeks after I bought it. I also recommend one by a group called Dallas which is in this same vein."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snatch the breath before it sings","review":"Comparisons to Stereolab abound, but take no stock in them. Broadcast have a mood and sound all there own. And while I love and adore The Groop, there sound has been a bit repetative as of late. Broadcast have been like a breath of fresh air to the indie scene, and \\"The Noise made by people \\" will be a fine edition to any music lovers collection. I'm going to be seeing them live in Chapel Hill in a few weeks, I hear that they're amazing on stage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Broadcast - The Noise Made By People","review":"The Noise Made By People, Broadcast's first proper album comes on like gangbusters, smoothing out the rough edges of Work and Non Work while still retaining the skewed melodies and instrumentation. The songs verge a little more on the melancholy, from the slow, meditative \\"Unchanging Window\\" to the siren call of \\"You Can Fall.\\" There's also the extraordinary \\"Come On Let's Go,\\" which manages to be both poppy and experimental. \\"Papercuts\\" is similarly catchy -- it's a tune that'll be stuck in your head like a malignant tumor. Again, the lyrics rise above the clichés and triteness that plague pop music. A wonderful album."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing ............. Broadcast has 5-star potential","review":"You'll read a lot of comparisons between Broadcast and may other groups. Regardless, they're their own breed and deserve a listen. I best describe Broadcast's sound as: JAMES BOND GIRL IN A WAX MUSEUM. Apparently, the band's LP work is less risky and more cool-pop than the experimental singlies running about. Early artifact also worth catching: (chilling instrumental) 'Hammer without a Master' on the Warp \\"We Are Reasonable People\\" compilation. I'd love to give \\"The Noise Made by People\\" five stars ... but they DID have a little difficulty with their arrangements. In time. Most often played tracks: Let's Go, Papercuts, Look Outside. Makes Nancy Sinatra sentiments feel smooth, fresh and hip again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting...","review":"This album by the band that sounds like they come from anywhere else but Birmingham (England), finally establishes clear water between themselves and the act that they're too frequently compared to, Stereolab. On The Noise Made By People, Broadcast seem to have moved away from the dreamy european sophistication of the astounding Booklovers EP to an often more dark musical soundscape, with each potential pop hit - Come On Let's Go, Papercuts - sandwiched between slabs of drone-rock. That's not to say the album tracks aren't good, they are certainly interesting, but in a grey,concrete,industrial stylee rather than in a sunny St Etienne europop groove. If you can get hold of the Booklovers EP instead, that's a much easier introduction to Broadcast than this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite album ever!","review":"I cannot stress enough how great this album is, GET IT NOW, you won't regret.R.I.P.

The main characters, Jason & Kianna, were beautifully done. (And yes, I do love her name!) The home they lived in was a mansion like the one in GONE WITH THE WIND, yet it was very cozy. With all his wealth, Jason was down-to-earth, as you'll see in a scene with the farmer who came to Kianna's aid. Jason was also very protective of those he loved.

Jason saves her, brings her to his mansion, and they soon fall in love. But there are people who are jealous and vindictive and do not want to see Jason and Kianna happy. The uncle seeks revenge, Jason's former mistress does the same, AND there's a little weasel named Dale who is so infatuated with Kianna he will do anything to take her away from Jason. So, a lot happens but there is certainly no lack of romance. It's one of the best love stories ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome Sound","review":"If you like the type of techno in your car that pounds a lot of bass, then this is the CD to get.

I got it as a library book and expected to see reasons why lightning won't strike twice if you own a feather bed. Instead, I got a book that most of the items defined (More than half) Referred me to a different page. The book is written so poorly that It could have been reduced to a few pages instead of 259 pages of Refferals to other pages. Beyond that, the reasoning behind many of the supersticions have been left out. Actually, I should say all of the supersticions. Other than that, some of them aren't even supersticions many of them are poems or rhymes with no reasoning.

Now I don't like to get into details about the books that I read because I might just ruin it. But I am going to make an exception. At first I put this book on hold for like 2 months. Now I was wrong for that because this book was really good.Jaylin is the type of man your mother warned you about. He is handsome, great career, and definitely a lovemaker. But he has a weakness for women. He dosen't know what he wants but he makes sure he keeps a woman around. Now all the leading ladies in this novel love them some Jaylin. They are all addicted to him. But Jaylin has a problem. He wants evertyone to himself and no one can stop him. Now, I know I really didin't go into details because I don't want to ruin the storyline but GO GET THIS BOOK.

One reason I couldn't put it down was because Ms. Hampton set the tone by briefly introducing the characters before the story begins.

His beard is scuplted and painted well and he comes with his crazy pointy hat that fits well on his bald head. He is a touch shorter than I'd like and this plus the swelled size of his arms and hands and his funny clothes do make him look dwarf like but once you get used to it it grows on you.

Finally last night I finished it (usually I finish 2 books per week).Also I checked out Judith Lennox' website and found it fascinating that she did so much research on pre WW II Germany. That part of the book was quite well researched and interesting (and that's why I give the book 1 star).Other than that it was the most boring book I ever read, especially the first 250 pages. Then it picks up a little, but not too much. However I will give Lennox two more chances.

Then, the woman is murdered and the evidence points to Ford. The movie raises suspicion about several others with possible motives, and eventually concludes with Ford being found innocent.

Had this role been taken by Meryl Streep, Jessica Lange, Sally Field or numerous other stars, the direction on Bedelia's pivotal speech would have enabled the viewer to see more of her delivery than the reaction of \\"star\\" Harrison Ford. This is truly a shame as Bedelia is riveting in her performance of Ford's wronged wife. Ford himself is competent, but his annoying Elvis-like sneer is a little too forced. Brian Dennehy, Raul Julia and Paul Winfield are very good, too, and the adaptation of Scott Turow's complex novel is well thought out and executed.

Furthermore the screen is terrible outside and the battery life isn't very good. Really the only nice things i found was the small size and the SD port. However, my zire 31 keeps screwing up the songs using RealPlayer and its a pain to transfer them back on. You can't transfer to the card from a multimedia port, you need to hotsync the whole unit and transfer using realplayer. In addition i find the 160x160 annoying.

No amount of soft reset, hard reset, or tech support from someone who was very difficult to understand, could restart it. The battery is bad. It costs almost as much to repair it as to buy a new one.

The only nit I have is that these devices should ship with the original grafeti installed instead of the fake one. To fix this, I installed the Teal script replacement at an additional price of $25USD. If I were picking models over again, I'd get one of the later models with the grapheti product installed.I mostly use this product to take meeting notes at the speed at which I can write printed script on paper. Not quite as fast cursive, and not quite as fast as touch typing, however, it sure beats retyping in all those notes into your computer, not to mention having your laptop hogging all the space in front of you in a meeting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh.....","review":"Ok.... when i got this pda i thought it was soooo cool.

The 200mhz processor is really fast and the 160x160 screen is decent unless you want to view big web pages on Avantgo, view pictures, or work outdoors. It has not died on me yet, but I have taken it apart and saw that it would be very easy to replace the battery if it ever died. I don't see what all the fuss is about with it dying, if your smart you can open it up and replace the battery with minimal skill required but remember you're warranty will be voided then.

It is a good starting point to developing a conversation with a person you are meeting for the first time. Rather than standing there talking about the weather, or saying, \\"so what do you do?\\" You can actually be prepared with a few questions to get the conversation flowing.Sometimes it is just nice to know what to say when you meet a priest, wine connoisseur, cowboy or ship captain...for the first time.

Consistent in all songs are a strong percussion section and a flaunty accordian. Deviating from traditional vallenato are the various guitar sounds and techniques as well as blues scales put to use in this cumbia based music. Throw in occasional flutes, a very modest use of keyboards and simple back up vocals with Carlos at lead and you have one of the greatest CD's I have ever heard. What separates this CD from his others is that even though all the songs have melodies, he never allows it to get too poppy. What's more amazing is how many different groups people I can listen to this CD with...

The publisher should spend a bit more on glue I guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must for every parent and teacher","review":"This is a must read for every parent if you are serious about understanding your child's mind and it's growth. Actually the right time to read this book is after your child is born and as she/he is growing. I started to read it before she was born and never found it too interesting (although I still then thought it as a 5 star book). But now I can't just keep it down. If you are a parent or caregiver or a teacher PLEASE buy this are read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best 'Expecting' Book for mom-to-be!","review":"No rules about what to do during pregnancy, which can be an already overwhelming time, but an explanation of how development occurs and how your baby understands the world at a given point in time in development from conception and into childhood...it includes how science has discovered what babies know and interpret about the world we live in and even references scientific papers in the back-in case you find yourself really intrigued! It also includes real-life examples of how BOTH nature (genetics) and nurture (parental/environmental influences) are involved in the development and growth of your baby. I loved this book, and now as my baby grows (currently 6 mo.) I find myself referencing relevant chapters (ie hearing, sight, taste preferences, etc.) when I notice him achieving new skills. I recommend this book to any new moms or moms-to-be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! What a great book.","review":"Some books should be mandatory for new parents. This would be one of them.

It's mostly about the brains of infants, and that's it.

It may be factually correct but would be better for a student than for a parent or caregiver."},{"rating":"2","title":"buy it before you're due","review":"This book describes what's going on in a child's nervous system from the moment of conception, making it as interesting to read (maybe more) than your favorite pregnancy guide. Eliot has one axe to grind: she argues that it's partly \\"nature\\" but mostly \\"nurture\\" and proceeds to put fine points of distinctions on the components of those buzzwords.There's not much plain advice in this book, other than to learn a lot about neurobiological development. Eliot does a great job of inspiring interest in the field and then breaking it down to an easy level of comprehension. It's an easy read but a long one--I'm having a hard time keeping up while also keeping up with my new daughter. Has it made a difference in her development? Maybe, but Eliot's book has definitely increased my confidence and patience as a parent. That's something that the raft of know-nothing advice books can't claim."},{"rating":"2","title":"So glad I found this book","review":"This book does an excellent job of analyzing the latest scientific data in a readable way. It also makes the assumption that people reading the book can think and encourages parents to draw their own conclusions about how best to translate this information into everyday practice. I have been frustrated with the \\"conventional wisdom\\" put forth by most pregnancy and early years development books, and was very pleased with Eliot's scientific, yet comprehensible, approach. I came away feeling significantly more informed. Also, because the topic of brain development is so broad, this book serves as a very good overall reference for prenatal and infant/toddler development."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-have Resource for Expecting Parents","review":"I found this book to be a great introduction to how a child's mind develops. As an expecting father, it was really interesting to know how the senses play a large role in developing the intelligence of a child and that the best way to develop a healthy mind is to provide a child with lots of stimulation at the proper time. The chapters toward the end of the book were particularly interesting as they covered the development of intelligence, language, and memory. I highly recommend that all expecting parents read this book. One caution though, the author takes a scientific approach, so if you're not prepared to read a book that approaches the developing mind from a scientific perspective, you might want to try other lighter books. However, if you are prepared for it, you'll be glad that you read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reading for the scientifically curious!","review":"This text is presented as an introduction to brain development without speaking down to those unfamiliar with state-of-the-art neurological/molecular vocabulary and research. The writing style is engaging and the presentation style motivates each successive topic in a compelling manner. It is both a page-turner and an excellent reference, and my copy has been rebound and has important passages marked. Specifically interesting to me, as a pregnant mother, are neurochemical sensitivities during fetal development, and language development after birth. It makes for excellent reading for expecting parents who have any curiosity in science at all. Indeed, my friends with engineering and science backgrounds have been enthusiastically passing it around. My sister took my recommendation, and is using it as an undergraduate textbook in molecular neurobiology at Carnegie Mellon U."},{"rating":"2","title":"informative, concise, easy to read","review":"I have an autistic child and was interested in brain development in typical children so I could get a better understanding where my child needed improvement and what areas of the brain were not up to par. I found this book to be very informative and it is proving to be an excellent reference manual that I find myself reaching for again and again. if you have a typical child you will being doing them a great service to read and understand the different developing stages they are going through and it even goes into some what to do's and what not to do's. it doesn't necessarily teach you how to raise your child but it does stress some important developmental skills that nurture more than nature plays a part in. I've read a good amount of books like this and this is my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating!","review":"I read this every night in bed. The information is absolutely fascinating! I'm about 2/3 through the book and I'd say it's more for parents-to-be than anyone else. The title is mis-leading in that sense. Most of the information is about what is happening in utero and how it progresses from there, after birth. There's not much information specific to \\"in the First Five Years of Life\\" part. Some of the sections tend to get a little too scientific for the lay person (and that's coming from an information nerd! I love this stuff!) but it's easy to skip small sections & not feel like you've missed the point of the chapter. It's very well organized like that. I'd recommend this book to anyone who is about to have a baby or has recently had one. One word of caution though - like all of these types of books when you're pregnant - read it & take what you want from it, but don't obsess about what you did or didn't do during pregnancy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Educational","review":"I wanted to read about how my baby's brain changes over his first months and years of development, so I bought this book after reading the reviews.This book is very thorough and I admit I skipped over a lot of the detail on exactly how everything in your brain works, but the case studies and development timeline were wonderful.

This magazine has provided me with a visual buffet of extraordinary homes and landmark buildings from around the world. Four years ago, while planning the interiors of a home I was building, one of the best resources for design came from the pages of Architectural Digest. Despite the magazine's inclusion of expensive, high end interiors, I was able to draw many ideas from the magazine for my limited budget. In the past, I've paid the subscription price directly to the magazine's corporate billing address. However, after having read an article in AARP mentioning that Amazon offers magazine subscriptions at a discounted price, I was able to renew Architectural Digest for two years for less than the usual cost of a one year subscription.

Unlike many others I couldn't care less about how the famous people lives. Veranda, Traditional Homes, Elle Decor & House Beautiful gives more ideas if you are into decorating, and I love these mags.

It might be useful for you if you're looking for decorating ideas - and have an income of a few million bucks a year. Otherwise, it's mostly a collection of advertising, and glimpses into the homes of people who dress them up - rather than live in them. I'd defy you to find one real sign of life (say, a tube of toothpaste in a bathroom) in one single home featured in the zine.If you want to look at things that are out of reach, or you have a tremendous disposable income and want to bask in opulent conspicuous consumption, this might be just the publication for you.I was actually very relieved when the subscription ended, because I felt so bad about disposing of the polyethylene wrapper, and dropping all that high quality coated paper into the recycle bin upon arrival."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magazine for the dead or soon to be","review":"I cannot say enough bad about this magazine.

I can't help but think that only dead or extremely old people would enjoy this magazine. The interiors are dowdy, lifeless, and boring.

Please quit touring the houses of the celebrities, the rich and famous, and instead go back to the days of those who were once like the rest of us.

Reesy was raised by a \\"good family\\". From that point on, the story was about two bickering sisters. Was John King supposed to be the \\"Black King?\\" After he met Connie, he had reoccuring dreams about his upbringing. It drove him back to confront his past. Still no substance.

I found this method to be very useful because it shows that there is more than just one \\"right\\" way to do things. It leaves room for creativity within clearly establishes guidelines.

After hearing and loving earlier CoC, I got this CD for myself.It defeated, maimed, and buried every expectation I had for this band. They've literally gone above and beyond greatness with this cd.From the Sabbathy 'Over Me' and '13 Angels', to the Thrash styled 'Diablo Bvd.' and 'Gittin' it on', and even the slower southern rock 'Stare too long' and 'Sleeping Martyr', this is the best CoC has ever been at. Definitly the best cd I've heard this year so far. A good buy for anyone sick of 'Nu' metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great album from an underappreciated band","review":"After a four year hiatus, Corrosion is back and sounding better than ever. Let's not get caught up in the \\"Who sounds like who\\" debate. COC has their own very distinctive, very heavy sound that many bands have tried to imitate, and failed. Pepper Keenan is one of the most gifted frontmen in rock music today, and has been since he took over COC's reigns for good on Deliverance. This album shows a more melodic side of COC, as evidenced on the brilliant track \\"Stare Too Long.\\" Don't worry COC fans, the bone-shattering metal is still there, as seen on \\"Over Me,\\" and \\"Sleeping Martyr.\\" Though not as instantly likable as Wiseblood and Deliverance, Volume Dealer packs a punch, though it may take a couple of listens to fully appreciate it. The high point is the Skynyrd-ish \\"Stare Too Long,\\" which shows the true range of these great musicians, and (hopefully) might be a sign of what's to come from COC."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best COC album so far","review":"When I heard for the first time Americas Volume Dealer I was surprised of how this guys have improved with time , now they sound very solid and overwhelming , mature and cool check out \\"stare too long\\" and you will realize that they dont need to express anger all time as before, of course that Heavyness however is still present in their music and you can hear that in cuts like \\"Diablo Blvd\\" , \\"whos got the fire\\" and \\"over me\\"they are still in that honey moon with southern rock and sabbath sounds that mixed together with their very american concept gives as a result the unique style of Corrosion Of ConformityI strongly recommend this albumHM"},{"rating":"1","title":"dissappointment","review":"Considering that _Deliverance_ is probably the best heavy album every made, this album is annoyingly feeble.

But as I was setting him up, trying to move his leg it just snapped off at the hip joint. Hence the 2 star durability rating. I have never had this problem with the Legends line before, and was very disappointed, especially since it was the variant figure. Some superglue fixed the problem, but at the cost of some articulation. He is on my shelf now and looks great, but if you're giving the toy to younger children, be cautious.

In Colonial times, people were much closer to the processes and people that produced their consumer goods. In \\"Colonial Craftsmen\\", the noted illustrator Edwin Tunis has produced a beautiful book that explores the techniques used by early American craftsmen. If you were ever curious about how candles were made or shoes sewn in the Eighteenth Century, this is the book for you.Edwin Tunis was one of the great author/illustrators of young adult non-fiction. \\"Colonial Craftsmen\\" is brimming over with beautifully intricate pencil drawings. This is the type of fascinating book, in which a young person can lose themselves. Along the same lines, the other great author/illustrator of American material culture is Eric Sloane. Any book by these two prodigies will be loved by all those with an interest in American history and its material manefestations."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic generational saga","review":"This book was one that I had pick up every night, lest I suffer from withdrawal.

Think of it as a \\"television adaptation\\" of a story in the \\"real world\\" of Piper's Fuzzies, with the stretching and massaging that modern day TV types are genetically unable to avoid. The author tried to make this book their own, and in so doing made it an uncomfortable fit in Piper's world.

I should give The Circle Jerks a rest from my cd player. I put this in and listen to a few of the songs and nearly pissed myself laughing. This band is so overrated it isn't even funny. The lead singer sounds like he's having his..well...his male organ ripped out. The guitarist..wow look Ma! I can play the same 3 chords on my cheap guitar! and I won't even get started on the rest of them. Please if anyone ANYONE is thinking of buying this, think again.

If I want to listen to some good, politically concious and original music I will put in a CD by The Dead Kennedy's, The Clash, Bad Religion, The Adicts or The Velvet Underground to name a few. I don't care if you listen to Good Charlotte, but be warned, listening to this CD will drastically lower your IQ level.

In fact they are probably one of the worst bands that I have ever listened to. All that they care about is making a lot of money and looking like really hardcore punk rockers, while singing crapy songs about how much girls break their hearts. This is posbily the worst combination in music history. It is really sad to see what our society has come to, letting these no talent idiots make millions of dollars off of the brainwashed youth of America.

I saw them in concert twice this past weekend, and I even met the guitarist (Benji) they're very awesome in concert, very enjoyable--My sneakers and my jeans prove it! (my sneakers were white when I went, tan when I left, and my jeans were wet up to the knees because it rained a bit before and near the end of their set.)

For example, in the song \\"Little Things\\", the melody and music is great, but the lyrics need help. Some of the lyrics sound like rap music (In the chorus, the singer quotes from a Nas song). Same thing in \\"WaldorfWorldwide\\".But there are positives. \\"Motivation Proclimation\\" is one of the best songs I've heard this year.I give this CD 2.5 stars (Amazon needs .5 ratings!).

I really do. I think they have hardly any talent, hold no meaning in their songs, and try to rip off GOOD bands(Green Day, even My Chemical Romance on Chronicles of Life And Death, which was probably the worst album of the year). But for some reason, I like this CD.Out of the band's 3 albums, this is probably their best. It combines a pop-slightly punk-emo sound with simple instrumentals. The lyrics are nothing special, but the songs are actually pretty catchy. My personal favorite is \\"Seasons\\".I think Good Charlotte should have stayed this way- pop-rock, non-depressing, and a lot less arrogant than they are now.

They are a mix of modern alternative rock and punk from the 70's like the clash. i don't have a fovrite song, because they all are so great. but the one's i listen to when getting ready for school are little things , east coast anthem, and screamer. i definately recondmend this cd to anybody especially teenagers who feel they don't fit in. and i recondmend everyone goes and sees them on tour. good charlotte, no only are they \\"good\\", they know how to rock !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Moms Apple Pie","review":"There's something touching about Good Charlotte that you really don't realize until you listen more than once. You can hear them on the radio, and think \\"they're not that great, what's everyone yelling about?\\" But to really appreciate the flavor of Good Charlotte, you have to listen, with more than your ears, to their music. It brings a feeling of bittersweet nostalgia that washes over you, until you find yourself missing everything you had as a child. The music vibrates with soul, and only those with souls akin to these Maryland guys can understand the music, the vision, the heart of their songs.

If Good Charlotte is reading this I have something to say to the singer and guitarist... Singer, use something else besides \\"Everything's gonna be alright now, everything's gonna be alright\\" in EVERY one of your choruses.

Mr. Lombardi's work is relatively large by comparison. For this book, his pieces have been shrunk to where it is almost impossible to read what's been written in the nodes of the networks. Each featured piece is instead explained by the authors, with the occasional enlargement of a section for clarification. This seems contrary to the spirit of Mr. Lombardi's work. I was expecting this book to at least have fold-out pages, but no such luck. The artwork is completely subordinate to the authors' verbose text. So if you want to READ about Mark Lombardi and his work, and get a little information design history lesson in too, then this book will do just fine. But if you want to actually LOOK at Mark Lombardi's artwork, look elsewhere. I think I will be reselling this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"find it & read it","review":"This book is part of a trilogy that is no longer in print -- Mind Call and Mind-Find are the others.

Director George Elanjian Jr.'s filmography includes a few TV shows and two volumes of Playboy Video Magazine. It could be worse, after all. Well, I must admit that I watched SYNGENOR until its end only because of the performance of David Gale who plays a drug addicted director becoming completely insane during the course of the movie. He's really very funny in this role.The rest of the movie is not so funny mainly because of the editing; it seems that important scenes have been cut or simply not shot by the director. The syngenors are absolutely ridiculous, lacking the zest of humanity that can transform a monster in a creature worthy of staying in the memory of the movie lover.

My wife was using it when I first met her, and for 32 years, I still know where she is by the distinct scent that for everyone who knows her, (from her life long friends to her Kindergarteners) is my wife.I have tried several times over the years to buy her an expensive designer scent, but she never will wear them, because even she identifies herself with the scent.If they ever stop making this my world will never be the same.This is not a scent that works for everybody, but try it and see if Windsong can make you unforgetable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great classic fragrance","review":"Got this for my Mom at her request.

It's just pretty in the picture. I received the bumblebee with broken antennae, probably due to bad handling, but little ironic anyway, don't you think? There are details that do not appear in the reference image such as the elastic band on the back or the hole in the chest, not good looking at all I must say. I would recommend getting something more expensive, maybe disney stuff, or anything you have already seen for real.

As Iwatched him trying to play with it, I was wishing I had gotten something else. If you want a push type toy, this isn't one for that. He's still into running and pushing bigger vehicles. This one isn't tall enough.Then he tried moving the blade up and down and that proved to be ratherhard and doesn't move much when it does move. Later we took it to thepark so he could play in the sand with it. The rubber tracks keptcoming off. He finally got so frustrated with that, he went to play withsomething else. I kept thinking about how much I had paid for this toythat had turned into such a disappointing experience for him and myself.If I had know about these things before I purchased it, I would have gone with something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"My grandson is happy with this toy!","review":"This toy is of a nice size, seems very durable and my grandson is having fun with it. Others said that the tracks came off easily and since they are made of a stretchy rubber material, I can see the argument. I could easily remove them by hand. I think that this is the only complaint that I have however my grandson played with this dozer several times and the tracks have not come off. I think that if he decides to turn it in a short radius or plays with it too roughly that the tracks might come off. New comment as of August 12, 2011 - We are finding that, with use, the tracks have started coming off if the dozer is turned. The left track comes off away from the dozer and the right track comes off toward the dozer, hangs up against the side of the dozer and stops turning."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 4 y/o loves it","review":"Its a metal tonka so it hold ups......well except for the rubber tracks but those are the first a kids loses"},{"rating":"2","title":"whats going on","review":"i havient got the game yet but lots of people say its not loading not working and people say its a good game but i would say it works fine and it sounds cool with the pets and garden you can have. and im surprised you can have different breeds i like german sheperds and they have it and lots lots more dog breeds and cats i know they have simes and some others im not sure with lizards and turtles i hope i helped you and me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds Great!","review":"Lots of people are looking foward to this expansion pack!

Other reviews will tell you all about the features of this offline Sim expansion. BUT, if you are going to be playing TSO, you will probably not have time to think twice about firing up your old Sim games.

I went out and bought the expansion pack and was truly impressed it. I've tried all the expansion packs now (excluding Vacation) and I am impressed with the imagination Maxis creators have. They have come up with so many new ideas to make the original game so interesting.The most impressive part of the game is that there are now 40 new lots to build on! Compared to 10. That is a great way to enhance your playing experience.The game is somewhat more challenging when it comes to the social meters of your sims. There are so many more options for social interactions that you have to work a little harder to find out which social interactions work the best between different sims.Through and through this is a great game and a must have for any avid sims player like myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"cool but gets old","review":"i play the sims alot, it's one of the greatest games created.i have most of the sim games and all of \\"the sims\\" games. i play them all day for about a month and then they get old. i play them from time to time but it isn't as cool as it was.

The resources that Maxis has devoted to their hottest-selling game has been fruitful, with some excellent results and a continuing customer base.

You can choose from dozens of dog and cat breeds for your lonely Sim. Then, shop for vegetables in Old Town. Sell your vegetables for money. The Sims Unleashed gives you the following: A larger neighborhood, holding Old Town, about 3 sections of houses, downtown, vacation, dogs, cats, fish, and, of course, more items, skins and building designs. This expansion pack also has real spiral staircases! And the final exciting tip is: YOUR PETS CAN HAVE OFFSPRING!

Who would have though Maxis would do that, I mean, after all, they only made FIVE expansions for ONE game. I can't belive they would do this again. The game still has the...sims themselves, the over priced trash cans, 1995 quality graphics, laggy gameplay, and let's not forget the fact that Maxis has been ripping off people like this(30 bucks for one expansion) since 1998.

The new jobs are a plus and the items, yet the friendship factor for advancing is hard. I can get to level 4 and than need more friends, which is always harder since they added this new bar of relationsip below the orginal. ... I must agree with the racoon problem that others have stated, it is annoying. I love cats and dogs, it get's me a little yucky though when a male or female talks cutey to a stray dog having it roll to get a belly rub.Walls, floors and such are better, you can use some of the downtown art obects in your own yard. What Maxis needs to do is add alot more jobs to choose from. Sims need to get older and get other illnesses than the gueina pig one, maybe like cancer or something. Weather should also influence a Sim's life; tornadoes, blizzards and such. All in all the game is good for a few weeks, and soon it just gets tiresome."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's not to love about The Sims?","review":"This was the only expansion I was missing for my The Sims collection (aka Sims1).

All around one of (if not THE) best expansion packs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GOT IT, LOVE IT!","review":"Hey all!,Thank goodness i pre-ordered this game since the shipments to Utah were late! This is the best expansion pack they have come out with. The only problem i see with it is that you cant just buy ONE pet, you will go to Old Town and buy 2 or 3, just because you can and let me tell you something, this is hard! but definatly worth it! So just a word of advice...cats are easier than dogs to start with. And try to get just one until you figure out what your doing. HAVE FUN!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A new way to play","review":"So your sims can get a little bored. A pet is a great way to help them out. Upside... they get social points when interacting with their pet.

As far as the expansion packs go (and I've got each of them) this is probably the best.

I am looking forward to its release. Plus you get shops, neighborhoods, and a lot of other fun stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many expansion packs!","review":"The first two or three Sims games were AMAZING. I totally loved them, playing until all hours of the night. But when they started releasing all these new expansion packs, and I got each one as it came out, my computer had some digestion problems, so to speak. Now, it takes about fifteen minutes to load the game, and at least twenty to go to Vacation Island, Old Town, etc. When I'm in any of those places, my Sims move jerkily, and the screen jumps around. If I try to scroll too fast, the game either crashes or goes in slow motion. It takes my Sims at least three game hours to do anything, so I have to wake them up at 12 midnight if I hope to get them to school. All in all, I'd say to stay small and avoid all these fancy expansion packs! The pets aren't that great, and you could grow vegetables with downloads already!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a winner","review":"If you have the original Simas game, then this expansion pack is required. In this one you get to have pets, enough said. You will like the pets and all the other new stuff you can buy, as well as all the new neighborhood stuff. This expansion is another major plus in the Sims franchise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Bugs & Crashes","review":"The game just came out and like many other buyers I went out and bought it! BIG MISTAKE!!I have found that I am not the only victim of Maxis that many others have experienced the wonderful side affects of putting a game out before it is ready to be out! The first time I tried to install the game it crashed and I got an error message. The second, the third and the fourth time it just crashed. I get sent back out to the desktop every time. Don't bother asking for support or help with your game from the technical support people because they are just plain unhelpful!

I love getting a new expansion pack and seeing new objects and interactions! It gets better each time! The sims Unleashed is real great! They were sort of thinking what I was thinking. I said to myself, \\"What if the sims acually had real pets.\\" The pets you download off the internet are kind of wierd cause they don't move. They are for decorative. But I just love the real pets. It's just like real life!! You get to train the pets also. Please sim creaters don't stop making expansion packs!!!! I love new ideas for the sims! I have some ideas I would like the sims to try! But the sims Unleased is fun. I like every sim expansion pack! They're all fun. Having a dog and a cat and a bird on the sims makes it more exciting than looking at your sim all day. But I really liked the expansion pack. SIM CREATERS DON'T STOP MAKING EXPANSION PACKS!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Go For It!","review":"I definately think this latest installment of The Sims is worth it. It not only adds pets and gardening to your life, but it also increases the number of areas you have to build on, as well as allows you to chose how you use those areas. It combines both Sim City and The Sims, and will be a welcome addition to my Sims library. If you like The Sims, and love Sim City, you will be addicted to this in no time flat. I agree that the Vacation and House Party expansions did not add much to the life of your Sims, but if you follow Sim expansions closely, you will see htat every other version is bigger and better than the one before. I believe that if you want the complete Sims library, but don't want to buy all installments, it is best to invest in 1) The Sims 2) Livin' Large 3)Hot Date, and 4) Unleashed.

Every family needs a pet.. There are only 2 things that I didn't like about it. The first is that potty training a puppy is a total pain. Mine is always peeing all over the house at night, and my sim won't wake up in time to discipline him. The second is that you can't just hug and kiss your pet any old time. They have to really like you first... and don't forget to buy treats for them. It'll make them like you faster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life is Easier","review":"Unleashed has made life for the sims much easier.

At first wanted this game so bad. but now I have it and it is not fun or entertaining! all your pets do is pee on the floor and make your sim MAD! and don't get exited about planting things, cause it only makes them tiered. when your sim is not doing so well you do things to cheer them up and you don't play with the whyning puppy next to you and it will soon die from lack of attention! don't listen to other reviews!!!!!!!! and when you build stores and go to them it just makes your sims worse! and they stink!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!YOU DON'T WANT THIS GAME AS MUCH AS YOU THINK YOU DO!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!","review":"I got this game 4 monthes ago and all of a sudden itsall fuzzy and scratched up.I call this boring!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sims, the scourge of gaming","review":"The Sims was a bad idea to start off with and the fact that they have draged it on says something about the publishers and the people buying it.

This game has all the makings of a very bad game."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOIN' PET MAD!","review":"When I first played on Sims Unleashed I was quite shocked about how much fun it was.You get to choose from 5 types of pets such as Cats,Dogs,Birds,Turtles and Lizards.Also you get to take your Sims down town which includes Cafes,Parks,the market and the shops ,not just that, you can also CREATE THEM YOURSELF!Sims Unleashed is LOADS of FUN.IT'S THE MUST GET GAME OF THIS YEAR!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Asking a lot, giving a lot","review":"Okay, this game is definitely worth it IF your computer is fast enough. It takes up a lot of space, and my Windows '98 runs it very slowly. Still, with the glitches, it's worth it. You can still go to the neighborhood and on vacation, if you bought the previous expansion packs (recommended). You can now have pets, which is so much fun. There is a wide variety of dogs and cats to choose from, and there are also turtles, fish, etc. The price at amazon.com is cheap, so buy it here if anywhere. There are new items, pets, gardening (cool), and huge neighborhoods. There are FORTY LOTS in each neighborhood. Some you can live in, some you can edit and your sims can visit. This game is a good use of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"I think this game is really cool. You get to do things like adopt a pet and train it. Plus, you have a vegetable garden. You have to buy seeds for it and take care of it, but it's cool. The only bad thing about it is that when you're in a community lot, the game tends to slow down a lot. You get used to it, but it can be annoying sometimes.If you have Vacation or Hot Date, you can get onto those from the main neighborhood screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, overall.","review":"This is one of the best versions of the Sims I've played. It's very entertaining, and at the same time, frustrating. It's similar to our lives (especially those who have pets) when it comes to the animals. They make a mess (potty training will do the trick), are quite disobedient, and gets tiring, even if it's on a game. But it only makes it more fun. You have to be careful with your pet, though. Make sure you feed it. I had 2 cats, Amethyst and Cresent who died of starvation because of my laziness. I was pretty bummed. In addition, a good reason to get along with your pets is you can order them to attack people. Sounds fun, huh?On Unleashed, you get more than 125 new items, including a vegetable garden where you can grow *duh* veggies. Best of all, you can sell them in Old Town, a new place to explore. You can decide whether to purchase or sell veggies. You can harvest them in a pantry. There are also objects made exclusively for your pets. I suggest this game to any Sims fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Cool!","review":"I think this expansion will be the best one of all! Mostly the reason I think this is because I absolutely adore pets and have always wanted them in my sims families'. In this expansion you can go to your local pet shop and buy a dog, cat,lizard, turtle, bird, or fish. And you can buy toys, dog houses, treats,and a lot more for you and your pets to enjoy. There are 125 objects in all. But that's not all you get! Also there are new skins. Another addition is gardening! Now your sims can buy seeds at the farmer's market and plant them in their garden. Once the seed has grown into a plant you can store it in your kitchen pantry or sell it at the farmer's market. Your pets will come in handy as they chase away the bunnies, mice, gophers, and other animals that come a callin. This game looks great! I'm buying it the first day it comes out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting","review":"In \\"The Sims Unleashed\\", as you probably already know, you get to have pets. I was very eager to get this game, and when I did, I was a little disapointed. Perhaps my expectations were too high. But anyway, your pet is just like a sim, except you cannot control it. And once you get it the only way to get rid of it is to kill it. Other than the pet items, there are not many new items that your sim can buy for his/her house. Though there are some new stairs, wallpapers, etc. I got tired of this game only after a week or so of buying it, so it was not worth the $... I paid for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What MY Sims Have Always Wanted...","review":"I love Unleashed because I'm an avid animal lover and I always thought MY Sims could use a little TLC from a puppy or kitty. I was pretty much pleased with the purchase of this game. I think the selection of pets is pretty decent and I like the option of going to Old Town. My Sims were getting pretty perturbed with staying home all the time. All in all, I think it was a well-needed expansion pack, just not worth the price. Should have been half the price if you ask me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun stuff","review":"I got the Sims for Christmas 2 years ago, and I really really like it. I was really excited about getting The Sims Unleashed, because I love animals, and thought it was \\"sweet\\" to be able to get animals for the SIms. Its really fun - you can get fish, birds, dogs, cats, and guinea pigs. Also, there's shopping and cafes. The only problem I had with this is that there is so much new information that it made my computer run slower when I'm playing it (my computer's 2 years old)."},{"rating":"1","title":"not helpful","review":"You are not going to learn real C programming in this book.

I thought it was well structured and clearly written. But my question is what is the use of a good book if you can not even run the programs because the extended libraries won't work as advertised. The publisher and the author ought to share the responsibility to lessen the burden on the readers by making sure the down-loaded programs indeed work. The added frustration is: where to turn to if they don't work.

Though a valiant effort at a first novel this is no great novel. I bought it on the strenght of the reviews and was very disappointed. Cole's prose reads like a loosely joined account of actual events in the writers life but fictionalized. His descriptions are nothing more than lists of things and their places and seem to build to no effect or purpose.His charaters are glitchy. Now, I am the sort of person who will read anything, but I couldn't force myself to finish this novel, so I skipped to the end. I can not recoment a novel that attempts to be serious fiction but ends in a kung-fu fight. The whole affair struck me as sophomorish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Book","review":"It's amazing to me that this book is out of print.

While I understand that most readers don't want to achieve dumpy looking homes, I think it would be better to make it more down-to-earth and homey rather than looking like a museum.

I can even see Bruce Willis in the leading role. Actually, it reads more like a screenplay that's been turned into a book.This novel has every Hollywood-detective cliche: Irish cop in Chicago with marital problems; beautiful and sexy doctor who's also a suspect (and whom cop can't keep his mind off of); a suspicious partner who the cop hates; a sordid sex/Satanic cult that is linked to the cop and everyone he knows. And when the cult goes after the cops son (like you knew they would), things get really personal!Another thing that bothered me: everyone, I mean everyone, knows everyone in this story and everything about them. From the doctor on the top of the social ladder to the scum at the bottom, they all know each other intimately. In a city the size of Chicago I find that hard to believe!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't work like that... at all.","review":"I don't know the author's nonfiction, but this book is laughable, in places reading more like a parody of New Age attitudes than a thriller.First, the cliches just pile up. Tough-but-sensitive hero, tough-and-traumatized blonde \\"suspect\\", molested little son, the absurd \\"lookalike\\" plot device, the trendy cult/kiddie porn stuff. Then everybody is mysteriously connected with everything and everybody else - very small town, Chicago. The hero sleepwalks through this scenario, agonizing, studying his own inner life, depending on visions, hunches and mumbo-jumbo and usually doing nothing - this would be a much shorter book if he just did his job. The author's idea of police work is as hilarious as her \\"masculine\\" writing.

I did catch the names a few places to visit in St. Tropez (if they are real), but I couldn't really tell you much of anything about the French Riveria other than it is on the Mediterranean Sea and rich people go there to vacation.Danielle Steel has done much better writing in her former days.

Everytime I give my sister-in-law's taste in fiction the benefit of the doubt, she loans me another lemon. I read one other Steel novel a few years ago, and honestly don't remember the writing being this poor. I think perhaps Steel may be using ghost writers since she is winging it on her bestseller reputation. Nonetheless, I suffered through it so I could explain in detail to my sister-in-law why Steel novels are so cliche, boring, and inundated with cookie-cutter characters.I am not trying to personally offend Steel fans, I just chalk it up to some people really do like this sort of stuff (or fluff).

Having said that, I re-read her older novels over and over which always provide me with great enjoyment despite being read before. Books of Danielle Steel's that I would recommend include 'Remembrance', ' Palomino', 'Changes', 'Thurston House'and 'Wanderlust'.If you are a die-hard fan ... you will probably enjoy this book.

Duany and his colleagues don't condemn the suburbs, per se, but present a well-reasoned alternative to our current way of designing them. Yes, they don't like the car and find McMansion suburbs depressing, but that isn't the thrust of the book. I don't find it particularly leftist either, as one reviewer here has claimed. Indeed, bureaucratic control and subsidy of the current development market is big-government at its most mindless. The current state of sprawl is an accident, according to the authors, often brought about by engineering over-design, which relies more on meeting highway standards and less on human need."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first step in healing is the right diagnosis","review":"It 's reassuring to know that others see the same symptoms and driving forces from a planning-logic that is threatening an ever larger part of our planet.

Anyone interested in reducing traffic congestion, clearing smog, stopping farmland loss, and presevring neighborhoods will find a wealth of knowledge within Suburban Nation. Not only is this book one of the best criques of the past 50 years of sprawl building, but it is also one of the best sources of the solutions. This book is in a class among the great urban liturature of Jane Jacobs and James Howard Kunstler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suburban Nation","review":"I found this book rather lacking and the title very misleading. Origionally I was interested in this book because I like the idea of an America where transportation is less depended upon. Although the authors had some convincing arguments for topics such as: wider roadways that lead to less cautious drivers and more traffic accidents, sidewalks that are not \\"pedestrian\\" friendly and lower resale values of land near highways and freeways; they were limited in their ideas for a more pedestrian friendly America. In my opinion, the last \\"straw\\" was when the authors compared an architechurally interesting single-family home and a plain farmhouse. They claimed that the home with architechure to it wasn't as pleasing to the eye. I think the authors need to look into some other ways of creating communities before they try and write a book. I am glad I didn't purchase this book but instead borrowed it from the library. It would have been a waste of my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"horriable","review":"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. The opinions are so biased and unfair.

The authors provide penetrating new insights on why sprawl is so profoundly unsatisfying and offer prescriptions for change. They buttress their case with concrete examples of good and bad development in America. Even when dealing with well-known phenomena, their descriptions always hit the nail on the head (to the complaint \\"There's never enough parking\\", they respond \\"If pizza were free, would there be enough pizza?\\") They address the public policy choices which have resulted in these undesireable outcomes, and suggest paths to better outcomes. An absolute must for anyone hoping for something better in our neighborhoods."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book about the built environment","review":"New Urbanism is not for everyone - and there is much to critique about it - but this book goes beyond the designs of new urbanism and critically analyzes the built environment from post WWII developments to shining examples seen in so many US cities. You may hate suburbia or you just might love it, but many people often lack the necessary critical eye in assessing the components that go into making suburbia - to which this book gives great insight into.Many will definitely be left thinking about the welfare of our cities well after reading this book. This book does not criticize suburbs, however, it very critical of suburbia which are two different things that are often conflated."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Most Important Books of the 21st Century","review":"This book, written for people, sets the stage for one of the most important movements in American: New Urbanism.

Boston remains a beautiful and low-crime city in spite of the sprawling, hair-brained urban renewal schemes(i.e Rappaport's Charles River Park) and elevated highways that have ruined some of its most interesting neighborhoods and architecture. The reviewer obviously has no grasp of the issues involved, because he mistakes elitism for trying to change outdated development patterns that result in towns and cities that don't work (unless of course you are an automobile). I qualify as not being an elitist since I have lived in one of Boston's poorer neighborhoods my entire life."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book will change your life","review":"Without exaggeration this book is the sole reason I pursued, and ultimately have been successful, in a real estate development career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fix the nation","review":"Suburban Nation is great book to learn about how America's suburban design is choking out time, environment, and pockets.

By the time of his early death this black man had conqured the business world. The book is okay. The author seems star struck and the book is as slick as a celebrity/movie magazine.

That is my feeling about this book. I found the book boring, tedious to read at times and a bit more technical than what I'm used to. Nevertheless, I could not get past the fact that Reginald Lewis and all that he accomplished after starting with nothing was an incredibly inspirational story that needed to be told. His drive and inability to accept \\"no\\" are something that we can all learn from and appreciate, but the writing in the book just didn't hold my attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and undeservedly unknown","review":"This book is a fitting tribute to a great, self-made entrepreneur, whoset his goals on a daily basis, was highly self-disciplined and meticulousin carrying them out and above all, was highly ambitious in the bestsense of the word.Strangely enough, reading through Connie Bruck's Predator's Ball,which chronicles the takeover movement of the 1980s, and containsa considerable segment on TLC Beatrice, one of Drexel's majordeals, there is no mention whatsoever of Reginald F. Lewis. Strange.The writing in this book is not the greatest, and the author (not Lewishimself) has a habit of throwing around dollar words when it'sunnecessary and uninformative.However, this is the only autobiography of a great man, and one thatis also inspiring. Well Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reg was a man of ambition and passion for Corporate America!","review":"Reginald was a man of ambition and passion for Corporate America who believed in surmounting formmidable obstacles with dignity.

Their were many obstacle trying to hold Mr. Lewis back, but he would get back up and try again. I began reading the fascinating book on my way to Italy. I could not put it down. I accidently packed it in my luggage on my return trip to the states. I was in the last few chapters. I couldn't wait to unpack it to finish reading it. All students should be required to read the book. It will truly excite and motivate them. Mr. Lewis prove that you can succeed.I'm just sorry that Mr. Lewises young life was cut short.

The book provides honest insight into Reg as a businessman and a clear glimpse into his private life. I especially appreciated how the book does not sugarcoat his sometimes explosive personality. The results of his extreme drive and his unwillingness to accept defeat are an inspiration to all. Although he was no saint and maybe someone you wouldn't want as a boss, his focus on his goals was unwavering. He showed that there really is no limit to what can be achieved through very hard work.When I finished the book, it left me saying \\"Anything is indeed possible\\".

Just in the first part of the book, he interogates a rider, yet Priest who was driving behind him in another car is nowhere! Sometimes the plot is written with the characters making so illogical decisions and events so improbable as to create near impossible situations. How a headlight dropping causes enough noise to be noticed, but subsequent scrabbling along a gravel railbed does not and why the villian does not pick up the headlamp are but a few examples."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, fast read","review":"In this latest work, Ridley Pearson takes a break from his Lou Boldt series to tell the story of Peter Tyler, a disgraced ex-cop leading an investigation into an apparent hobo killing. Of course, there is more to it than this, and the crime links to a series of train derailings.Pearson keeps things moving quickly and has the requisite number of plot twists. Tyler and supporting character Nell Priest are likeable enough and the problems they face are formidable. There is, in fact, little that is wrong with this book, except that Tyler and Priest are not as interesting as his series characters of Boldt and Matthews.As a light, fast and fun read, this book fits the bill, but for the best of Pearson, you need to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right On Track!","review":"Can't understand the negative reviews. This thriller about the railroads ran just like a train; eases out at first, picks up speed, rushes to an exciting climax, and slows to a satisfying stop. Unlike the opinion of the some reviewers, the characters were given just enough depth. Pearson does a wonderful job of shifting the reader's sympathies from the good guys to the bad guys; in fact one is never quite sure who is wearing the white hat in this very solid read. This novel is absolutely worth the trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent story, keeps your interest","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

He has successfully managed to make me not want to put a book down until I have read it all. Although I am a die hard Boldt/Matthews fan, Ridley creates a new, less likely, hero & heroine in both Tyler & Priest. The action and deception last through the entire storyline and creates an unusual, yet interesting, ending. I began routing for Alverez as I could feel his sense of vigilante justice against the ruthless Corporate world. At first I was a little disappointed in the ending but, after reviewing the book in my mind, I realized I wouldn't want it to end any other way. I anxiously await for Ridley to write again soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Very Good Book","review":"I have been a Ridley Pearson fan for years and have read most if not all of his books. This one however, I fould hard to even complete. The characters simply did not click, and it was hard to form a reader's bond with them. The plot was equivilant to a sub \\"B\\" movie plot, which would probably not even get made. Sorry, but I did not like this one at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Disappointment from a Terrific Writer","review":"Ridley Pearson is among my favorite authors, but \\"Parallel Lies\\" reads like a first draft. Pearson needed to go back and give us a more well drawn ultimate bad guy, explain how his science teacher vigilante transformed himself into the Rogue Warrior, and make the security expert who looks like a \\"supermodel\\" more than a romantic cliche.Hero Peter Tyler, however, is a good creation, and I wouldn't mind seeing him in a better book-- which Pearson's next is likely to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Derailed plot","review":"Borrowing a premise from \\"Trainman\\", Pearson moves away from his usual characters, and gives us a slow boring ride. Trying to make the bad guy good and populating his story with all the pc stereotypes sucks the life out of this one. Don't write a book a year, if its going to be mediocre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than stellar","review":"This is nowhere near Ridley Pearson's best work. Neither Peter Tyler nor Nell Priest were characters that I was able to warm up to. The plot became more improbable with each page. If this is your first Pearson, don't give up hope. Go back and find any book with Lou Boldt and Daphne Matthews. Then you will understand why people wait for these books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing effort from great author","review":"Just finished Parallel Lies and feel cheated - I am a huge fan of Ridley Pearson, having read the entire Lou Boldt series. This book just does not reflect the creativity, energy, plot and character development found in Pearson's other works - seems like it was perhaps an older manuscript buffed up and published. The story plods along, never gels, and the ending is another throw-away, poorly thought out and ill-conceived. I have had similar disappointments with Deaver and Patterson's recent attempts. What happens to these guys? If you like trains you may like this -otherwise leave this one in the station."},{"rating":"2","title":"An original story set at a fast pace","review":"Set in the east, goes from fast to unbelievable. Yet is believable. The mystery is new. The technology is cool. The ease with which a smart detective can follow someone's trail in the modern world is scary. We are not anonymous anymore. Great book Mr. Pearson. Still love Lou and Daphne, but Peter and Nel are wonderful too. Will we ever see Umberto again? I hope so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaden and dim-witted","review":"The only thing moving in this book is the bullet train. And that only happens in the last 40 pages or so. Characters are painted so dimly that they barely enter the reader's consciousness (except for the painfully ludicrous high school science teacher who apparently trained at the feet of James Bond). Nothing surprises save one majorly untidy loose end at the conclusion who's name is ...The prose is Cro-Magnon, the plotting Neanderthal. Save your pennies--life is way too short for dreck like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is It Over Yet; Why Can't I read faster","review":"Terribly disappointing. Wish I could stop reading a book once I start it, because this would be one that would qualify. Story seemed convulted, boring, and way too technical that made it implausible. It was very hard to picture the final train scene. I did like the ending though (maybe because I couldn't wait to get there). Nowhere near as good as \\"Middle of Nowhere\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Run over by a train","review":"OK, I'm an audiobook guy, I admit it. This one was not a keeper or a passer-alonger to my audiobook gang. Right to the give-it-to-the-library pile or hope to get 2 cents for used. There are so many good mystery/thriller writers out there doing much better stuff than this I feel I wasted my time. When I lunge for the eject button numerous times it's time to hang it up. Colorful packaging however made me snag it. Don't bite or that light you see in the tunnel.......!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitterly Disappointing...","review":"I have enjoyed Pearson's other novels, primarily the Lou boldt series set in Seattle, but this diversion is a dead end. The plot is improbable, and the details impossible. All of the characters are poorly drawn with highly implausable motivations.Let's see: how about a downtrodden white guy, a beautiful black woman with no life of her own (and Pearson doesn't provide a clue!), and let's make the bad guy a Hispanic, who has been terribly wronged by a rich white guy and his successful though shallow corporation. This poorly plotted and predictable novel will cause me to forego any future novels by this author!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plodding along","review":"Pearson is a very good writer. If you are really into the Boldt/Matthews books (as I am) then this one is very different. Sure there is a relationship.

I struggled to keep my interest alive on this case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Even Finish This Boring Tale!","review":"If you're a Ridley Pearson fan, this one is a big disappointment. It just does not grab you from the beginning like many of his former works do. First of all, I found the major premise of a railroad being sabotaged by a man whose wife and child were killed by a train to be trite. From this point on, it's all downhill as the investigation begins. Sorry, I just couldn't continue with this dull tale.

My health vastly improved going gluten free. Mummies of the ancient Egyptians prove they had Diseases of Civilization - cancer, tooth decay, heart disease. Earlier hunter-gatherers did not have these diseases. Wheat and its near relatives, in the form of beer and bread, made up a large part of the ancient Egyptian diet. Meat and honey were available to hunter-gatherers, so the deterioration of human health, including reduced lifespan and stature, likely resulted from the introduction of these grains to the human diet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not At All Pleased","review":"I bought this book as per my cousin's suggestion because Braly's theory sounded interesting. I absolutely agree with the Foreword when it says: It's undeniable that whole grains are good nutrition for some of us. The problem is that the author spends the next 180 or so pages talking himself out of it. There is NO DOUBT that celiac disease and gluten sensitivity are real and can be life-threatening--this book is for such sufferers. But to suggest, over and over again, that the huddled masses should go gluten-free, even though asymptomatic, is sliding down a slippery slope.

I appreciated all the information in this book and only didn't agree with the hunter gatherer stuff they kept throwing in as a reason we should eat differently. I am new to the celiac desease information and currently eat a gluten free diet because of wheat sensitivities, this book helped reinforce my goals to stay off of gluten. I liked the many references to articles and studies done by other doctors. I also appreciated all the links to other deseases and problems that were shared.

My adult daughter and I were in good health; so I thought - although we were both continually dieting (I had receently lost 20 lbs.). I was on several meds (bp, cholesterol, acid reflux).After one month of no grains, my daughter lost lbs., I started to sleep 7-8 hours (had not slept well in yrs!), and I was able to quit the acid reflux pills! Even WITH those pills, I still had indigestion!!! Have energy, clearer thinking, less problems with balance. My weight distribution has also started to change even though my actual weight has not.So, I bought the book and lend it to anyone who will listen - especially those with diabetes or other weight and health problems.I have since read 'Wheat Belly' and am convinced to stay grain free.This book is easy to read and understand - 'Wheat Belly' is more technical, but humorous - also worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read book!","review":"Dangerous Grains is a must read for anyone interested in nutrition and health.

For those of us who are new to this kind of thing, James Braly's groundbreaking work comes as a welcome foundation to place under the whirlwind of incongruous information available in print and other media.Though the general public is better informed than it was when the book was originally published, and thus, some of the information may seem redundant in comparison to what has now become \\"common sense\\" to many, this book is worth a read for the reasons I mention above.

When I was first diagnosed with gluten sensitivity, I searched my local library for solid information to help me improve my health. To my utter disappointment, all I could find at my local library was a couple gluten free cookbooks. I needed information on how to get well, not brownie recipes.

Still, the characters themselves are very real, and the story is too compelling to rip yourself away from.Both Bret Harrison and Laura Prepon give remarkable performances that show their range as actors.

Turning through the pages you find yourself feeling as a friend of Ronald Reagan and he's letting you in on his life. a must read- Larry Hobson-Author-\\"The Day Of The Rose\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Amiable autobiography","review":"By far the most insightful and readable of all the Reagan biographies is this, the only one written by the Gipper himself. The account of his childhood is charming; the account of his Hollywood years, fascinating; the account of his Presidency, revealing. Unlike the scowling bios from reporters and scholars (Lou Cannon, Garry Wills) this one wasn't written by someone with an ax to grind. It's refreshing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is an easy to read informative book. It gives insight to the life of Ronald Reagan that was not routinely broadcast in any of his interviews or articles written about him. This is a long book but it covers the long and varied life of one of America's gentlest, humorous, knowledgeable, strong, and a true patriot of our Country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great autobiography","review":"He presents his life and its nuances extremely well . There is little that is left unconvered in the book. Unfortunently many will not read this triumph of the American spirit and possibilities only due to the fact that it is Ronald Reagan, a Consersavite"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Awesome Book!","review":"Yes it is a biography but it is also a tale of the American dream. He goes from growing up poor in a small town to becoming the Leader of the Free World. Ronald Reagan was not born wealthy by any means. You see how his early childhood was filled with poverty (the hamburger soup story) and understand how his father's drinking affected him later in life. A wonderful story about an equally wonderful man!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought as gift, and he loved it.","review":"I purchased this item as a Christmas gift for my husband. Ronald Reagan is his favorite president, so I thought he would enjoy listening to this during his drives to and from work. It was a success....he absolutely loved it. It is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Great book, read by the author (reagan himself) so nice to hear his voice after all these years. Good to learn how he thought and why we need another Reagan as president. Never had time time read the hardcover, this was a nice lsten in the car over the enbalanced news we are stuck with now days"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable & Informative","review":"What a pleasant read. I was born in 1978, and was just a child during the Reagan Years. I'm really enjoying this \\"primer\\" on recent American and Global history, as taught by someone who is quickly becoming a hero of mine. I beleive history is repeating itself in America, and another american conservative \\"prairy fire\\" like the one that swept Carter out of office after 1 term and returned us to prosperity under Reagan conservatism has already begun. I only wish there was someone as bold and correct as Reagan in our day to unify the republican party, and promise, then accomplish what he did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic book","review":"This book was brand new for a great price. I recieved it in only a few days. It is an excellent book. Thank You!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Discover a segment of US history straight from one if its great history makers","review":"Reagan's autobiography presents a dual account into the mind of one of the most charismatic leaders of the 20th century as well as a deep view into the extraordinary political events that shaped the world in the 1980s.Regardless of where your political views lie, if you have a sincere interest in events and decisions shaping both fiscal and foreign policy, An American Life will deliver. From his near fatal shooting, his correspondence with Gorbachev, to events leading to the Iran Contra scandal, Reagan lays it all on the line. The basis of his positions via his own words provides you the full scope of his reasoning, which is fascinating insight no matter what your persuasion.A historical account written straight from a man in one of the worlds most prominent positions should be of interest to anyone with an attraction to historical accounts. Having it come from one of our most enigmatic presidents only raises the bar."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest President of the 20th Century","review":"This is the definitive book by and about a truly great leader, and a great man. Ronald Reagan came to office at a time when America desperately need a man of his strength and character. After a decade of downturn - particularly the Carter malaise years, Reagan renewed our faith in ourselves and our nation. Today's conservatives - especially our so-called \\"leaders\\" - need to read this book.Ronald Wilson Reagan - Ronaldus Magnus - will be missed, and we may never see his like again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Integrity and Honor shouted from it's pages!!!","review":"Reagan was more than a great man, he was a LEADER! Leading out in being honest and true to your word is no easy thing, but his leadership was felt to all the people of this nation. This book is refreshing and honest! It is so upbeat (just like he was); he has such an optimism within him that reaches out to those who want solutions and peace and this book made me want to live a better life, with better reasons to live and more gratitude for the principles of truth that my country was founded upon! Ronald you rock!! Thank you!--for living the life you did and for having the courage to write about it. I was only 17 when he left office, but the eighties were the years that shaped who and what I am--Ronald Reagan inspired me then and through these pages has inpired me anew."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gift!","review":"I gave this to my husband for his birthday and he really enjoyed it, especially since it is read by Ronald Reagan."},{"rating":"2","title":"why can't more Presidents be like this?","review":"What a great American and just wish he was still around to give Obama some much needed guidance. Maybe he was one of a kind and we will never see another like him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never a Fan","review":"I was never a supporter of Ronald Reagan, but I found that this autobiography gave me a glimpse of a different man than I imagined. The first section was an easy read and showed how much the President needs to work with Congress. Made me feel that the House of Representatives is the most important vote a citizen can make. I might add that for several years I have been reading biographies of the Presidents from George Washington on. It's been an interesting project. I would rank this book among the top ten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Reagan write a word of this?","review":"A book obviously ghostwritten to such an extent it is difficult to imagine Reagan wrote a word of it. (Especially with the senility and Alzheimers he was obviously suffering from at this period in his life). As a political memoir it is vague and lacks detail (any military action the US takes is simply to \\"save them from communism\\").This is more interesting as autobiography but seeing as it is so heavily ghostwritten it cannot even be judged as reliable or honest even on that level."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Craft, No Style, No Pop","review":"This book of what they call \\"poetry\\" nowadays is rife with loose limping lines of free verse at its worst. \\"Can poetry matter?\\" as the venerable Dana Gioia once asked the literary intelligentsia of America. With this book full of inchoate imagination, the reading public can be certain that the author's work will not matter in the short and long-term of American poetry. For the true guts of Hip Hop Poetry, one must turn to the masters of the craft like Roger Bonair-Agard, Regie Cabico, or Khalil Amani."},{"rating":"2","title":"works well in a therapeutic setting","review":"This toy is well designed for both fun and teaching.

I was a fan from the beginning, relishing their first two albums and telling all my friends about them. Then their 3rd project (\\"God's Got It\\") was a disappointment to me, being weak compared to those first two exceptionally strong offerings.THEN, even though I was a couple years late, I heard \\"So Glad About It!\\". I was really impressed! Even though it's a different flava than what I was accustomed to from CMC, I thoroughly enjoyed this album upon first listen, and I still do. It's energetic and focused, has awesome singing, great production and material...and The Message is delivered on each cut in a way that's sure to stick with you.Great stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice to be reminded","review":"Once upon a time, there was such a thing as courage. It was at the center of all our stories. Now there are no more stories worth telling and all human beings are weak. At least we still have the stories and this book has some great ones, and true. For example, there's the one about the American GI on the Italian front who \\"charged\\" an enemy position on one knee and the stump of his other leg, shot off at the knee."},{"rating":"1","title":"DULL","review":"Yes, we've all heard what hard work (no pun intended) making porn films is---that is a difficult job to remain excited and involved while the cameras are rolling. We've also heard about, and seen the evidence of, drugs in the world of porn. But who would have thought that the porn industry would prove as dull as work on a conveyer belt? Probst's book shows us this boredom in his, otherwise, excellent photographs. The story by A. M. Homes which serves as the book's introduction is merely pretentious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy only if you're not offended by gay porno film","review":"I bought this book thinking that it would give a behind-the-scene look at the pornographic film industry. I did not expect it to be about a GAY porno film set.Many of the photos are fairly well taken in a documentary style and a few even managed to inject a bit of humour into the work of the cast and supporting crew, like a \\"gay\\" actor jerking off with a copy of Penthouse. Another \\"funny\\" photo shows a crew member looking away as two naked male actors hugged and French-kiss passionately off the camera. However most of the photos show how seriously the crew treat their work.But be warned, buy this book only if male homosexual pornography does not offend you. Otherwise, stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great book!","review":"I've started enameling my Art Clay Silver pieces and needed an easy to follow guide, since my one enameling class gave me the basics but not enough to comfortably work on things in my studio without having a good reference book. \\"The Art of Enameling\\" has been great. It has sections on working with fine silver, which is a big help. The author writes well and the accompanying photos and tips are great. After reading through it, I feel a lot more comfortable and ready to tackle some projects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Resource","review":"Considering the difficulty of obtaining a good resource for enameling...I must say this book is the best you are going to find outside of one on one instruction. If you can find any video tutorials online like on youtube that actually SHOWS you someone performing said technique you will be much better off. Enameling takes a sort of finesse you can only obtain by actually watching the wrist flicks and etc. You can and will learn a lot from this book. Plenty of photos and good advice BUT do supplement it with youtube videos or an in person class and you will be enameling beautiful pieces in no time. Definitely recommended above any other book on enameling out right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring Enameling Book - Highly Recommended","review":"\\"The Art of Enameling\\" is a great resource of those wanting to learn about the enameling process. We have been thinking about expanding our small business to include custom made jewelery and higher-end crafts, so an artist friend of ours recommended this book to use as a starting point in enameling.The book covers all aspects of enameling, include equipment, supplies, techniques, and projects. Each section contains useful and beautiful pictures of enameled pieces to illustrate the techniques being highlighted.My only minor issue is that the book does not contain a supplier list, however the publisher maintains an excellent list on it's web page and includes the address on page 175 of the book.This is one of the best \\"craft\\" books I have ever seen on any subject, so if you have any interest in enameling this is the book to get!Highly Recommended!CFH"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Art of Enameling","review":"This is a fabulous guide to enameling.

Too Bad! I wish I had my old collection from 18 years ago. Reading current issue's is like reading Ranger Rick! I havent found anything really usefull and I could read the whole mag in 5 minutes. It was a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you and your bird are both grown-ups, don't bother...","review":"As another reviewer pointed out, everything is about baby birds. If you acquire a bird as an adult, this magazine will only frustrate you.They offer basic information to get the beginner started, assuming they are buying a baby, but a serious bird owner will outgrow this magazine in about a year.If you and your bird have made it through adolescence, and you feed pellets/fresh fruits/veggies/fresh water daily, keep a clean environment and don't use non-stick cookware/aerosols/etc. you've probably already outgrown it.And Bird Talk is geared toward inexperienced pet bird owners, not breeders.

It is styled just like my old worn outand now discarded bag. This bag is going to be our new workhorse, it is well thought out, and quality-sewn like every otherbaggalini purse in my stash. A couple of suggestions: We wanted a black one which unfortunately is without the velcro wrap to holdhandles together and it should really have a two zipper approach to the main section of the bag. Other than these two items it's goingto serve us well. I see the colored models all have those amenities. I would have given it 5 stars if these items above were included."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bagallini Cosmetic Bag Review","review":"Baggallini Complete Cosmetic Bagg- The Bagallini cosmetic bag is not as well made as I would expect from them! I have three of their other style bags and love them! This bag's material is thin and translucent (not their usual), and offers no padding or protection for your contents, which may be fragile. The compartments are not well thought out (too large) and are impractical or impossible to access without other items cascading elsewhere out of the bag. Access to some compartments require you to twist sections of the bag upside down while hanging (very awkward). The most annoying aspect of this bag is the single zipper tab, where two would have made more sense. It is difficult to locate and access contents quickly. The hanger is flimsy.

Tracks here that make the grade are the catchy opener \\"Pretty Girls Go Insane\\" (good point!), the rocking \\"Detroit Blackout\\", \\"Trouble Girl\\" and \\"What Have You Invented Today?\\".

This issue features \\"starlets\\" that you've never heard of naked! This issue has our worthless best of lists crammed with products from the brands that gave our editors the most free loot! Don't even get me started on the fluffy features with celebrities who I don't care about or the annoying how-to section. In a world of independant beauty blogs that aren't afraid to trash a product, Youtube channels owned by pro-makeup artists, and skincare sites run by practicing dermatologists, Allure seems like a waste of paper and good money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm, Disappointing","review":"I am almost up with my subscription of Allure and overall was not impressed with the magazine. I think the best thing about the magazine were the coupons and samples you sometimes find inside. I prefer Cosmopolitan a lot more (as it is more well rounded). Most of the stuff they focus on in the magazine is brand named and too pricey, and it just seems a bit shallow (the last two have had articles on plastic surgery). I bought the magazine for the makeup tips and it's just disappointing (youtube has better stuff than this did)! I will not be missing this magazine when the subscription ends!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!!! Who prints this drivel?!","review":"For a magazine that prints \\"the beauty expert\\" on every cover,Allure is quite ambitious. With every issue (I got the subscription as a gift) I am more sure of the fact that this is one of the worst fashion magazines out there, as far as looks go. The layouts are so hideous, that alone makes me wary of taking any of their beauty advice. Try flipping through an issue and you'll understand why I find this magazine difficult to read or follow. With a plethora of messy crayon-style arrows, crowded pages, and clashing colors, I never fail to be astounded that some ppl actually find the magazine stylish.

The first 5 years it contained really intelligent and in depth articles as well as all the trends on beauty, skin care, some fashion but mainly focussed on makeup. Since then I've noticed a steady change in the wrong direction. Its main focus seems to be more on the Hollywood crowd and the articles have little or no substance. It has become so predictable I can breeze thru the latest issue in less than 30 minutes and then I toss it.

This is a book where you will find accurate, up-to-date information on tea, its properties and health benefits.

Lacking real research and knowledge.","review":"This book has some interesting sections, but lacks any depth of information. The section on the history of tea does not discuss the British efforts, and significant problems, in developing tea estates in India in any detail, which is a very interesting story. The information about \\"fermentation\\" of black teas is extremely poor. Black teas are oxidized via an enzyme process that I was hoping to learn more about. Reading this book you would think they are adding yeast to \\"ferment\\" the tea. The limited sections on Pu-erh teas is inaccurate and incomplete and does not even acknowledge the Pur tea trees that are hundreds of years old in china."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Decent Overview","review":"Jane Pettigrew covers just about everything in the tea world in this book, from a little history to a taste of the different kinds of tea from their own regions.I was a bit disappointed that Puerh tea was not given more attention in the book, but this is also the older version and when it was published there wasn't much availability of Puerh in the US yet.There are a lot of pretty pictures in this book, and it's this imagery that wins the reader over.

Later in the book someone steals Ginger, and Jerry and his little sister can not find Ginger at all. Later strange things happen to them like they remember that the person who stole Ginger had a yellow hat on and later they see Jerry's friend wearing what looked like the same hat. This book is charactor driven because the charactors feelings change throught out the book. For example, Jerry feels great when he gets Ginger, but feels really sad when Ginger gets stolen. There are also many charactors that you get to know. After awhile you know evaryone in the story and you don't want to put the book down. This story is fun and exciting in the beginning, but in the middle it gets sad because Ginger gets stolen and all the Pyes are sad that Ginger wont be home for Christmas. After awhile things start to turn around at the Pyes house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ginger Pye (great book)","review":"This great book is about a boy named Jerry and his sister Rachel who wants to buy a dog.There also is another person who wants to buy the same dog.

On Thanksgiving Day something horrible happens. The puppy, Ginger Pye, gets stolen. When they find the person who wears a yellow mustard hat, then they will get Ginger Pye.I gave this book 4 out of 5 stars because it was a little confusing at the beginning.

They want to buy a puppy and this book is about the adventures they had with the puppy. Unfortunately, the puppy gets stolen. This book was O.K. until it got to the part where the dog was stolen. The kids obviously aren't very intelligent, because they can't put the simplest ideas together and they are very stubborn. Another thing is that everything is so perfect and they have no challenges. For example, When Jerry wants to earn a dollar, IT JUST SO HAPPENS that the next day, Sam Doody wants to buy a suit and can't dust the pews.

They may have become the band on this album but for almost 15 years they were a much better and more complete band. Success came after ...the horse they rode in on and Hang Time, but for me their peak was much earlier with Made To Be Broken and While You Were Out, both of which albums were left out.Never forget that Soul Aslyum started in 1979 as Loud Fast Rules and then changed their name to Soul Aslyum because they didnt want to be seen as a HC band.And where are the Time's Incinerator songs?

They made several fine albums on the Twin Tone label and you won't find any of that material on here, only the later major label recordings. And those are very, very good. And this compilation does a good job of giving listeners a balanced overview of that period.

But there must be some reason it is still around, despite the competition. ARTnews is a quick read, lots of things happemn between its coevers, and it seems to be of more interest to working artsts than to the big gun collectors and museums.

Unfortunately, the player is pursued by police, who come equipped with rocket-charged helicopters capable of firing on and destroying the vehicles they are chasing. The end result, far from being a simple race, is often a fireball.I do not understand how a manufacture can peddle something like this with such a benign rating. This game is not benign, constructive or even fun. The sound track is grating, and the action is worse. It is unsuitable in any case for children under age 16, and in my humble opinion, it isn't really suitable for anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Handling.

I think that physics simulation is the most important thing that a game of this type should care most.If you are just a kid, I think that there is a very good chance that you would like the game.

If you haven't heard her before, to me, she's a cross between Sarah Vaughan and the wonderful Frances Wayne (who sang with Woody Herman's First Herd of the middle-'40s).

When I called again to tell them our seat isn't safe and needs to be replaced, they told me they couldn't do anything for me. After spending $200 on a car seat to keep our precious cargo safe, you'd think they'd be willing to replace it. Do not buy from Britax -- they won't help you if you have a problem with your seat.

The straps are so easy to adjust and never get tangeled like the other brands do. Our daughter is safe and secure.

Although pricier than others, the quality of the materials is great. The straps NEVER twist and the buckle and belts are easy to manage. It's fairly big, and very sturdy. So far no complaints from our baby daughter who has no problem falling asleep in this seat! It has been very comfortable and safe in both the rear- and front-facing positions. We're sure this car seat will last for more than one child. We highly recommend it, it's a keeper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This Carseat","review":"We first purchased the Marathon and it was really large! We have a Tahoe and we found when it was in a rear position, my 6-4 husband could not put his seat all the way back with it on the drivers side or in the middle. We purchased the Roundabout and love it!! It is worth the money over buying the Evenflo Triumph as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hitting the road with my granddaughter","review":"My granddaughter loves to be in her seat. It was easy to install, fits perfect in the car and easy to get McKayla in and out of. My friends at work recommended it. It has been 25 years since I had a child and I was not up to speed. This works out perfect for the two of us when we are off to a new adventure. I highly recommend this to parents as well as grandparents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Carseat EVER!!!","review":"I got the britax roundabout used from ebay in the light colonial blue color, but it is basically the same.Mine is also a little older, made in 2001, so the buckle is the puzzle peice kind (its funny to watch people who have never used it before figure out how it works:). I love this carseat because the fabric is so soft, it's well cushioned, the belly pad and the velcro are wonderful, and unlike my son's booster seat, the straps rarely get tangled. It also has a great system to keep the seatbelt nice and tight and in the right place. My daughter loves this carseat, and that alone is worth the money. In this case, you definatly get what you pay for!!! Totally worth it!!

I bought this one because of the safety rating and all of the positive reviews. I could not be more pleased. It was easy to install, the seat is very comfy for her - nice and padded. (check this before you buy because some brands have no padding at all in the seat). The denim is breathable because it is 100% cotton and it is very soft on her skin. It may cost a little more than some of the other car seats out there but it is well worth it.

I ran to Home Depot where the salesman assured me this was the latest and greatest. I went against my better judgement and went for it. Well, I've had it 28 days and have called for service 2 times. When washing anything heavier than a few t-shirts, it makes the most horrible racket that vibrates through the whole house.

I have been without a washer for 5 weeks the repair man has come 4 times (can't wait to get that bill). I had my last washer for 30 years finally the drum rusted out. I know things are made more cheaply today but I paid a ton of money and hoped to get more than 2 years out of it before I have to spend time and money on this device.

Even though I did all the cumbersome routine maintenence (accurate amount of HE detergent, frequently ran the tub clean cycle, wiped it down, drained the pump filter, cleaned the dispensers, used affresh and tide washer cleaner), it still smells musty and moldy. People can smell it from several feet away. LG customer service was useless.

I've never seen anything like it. It must be something with the tumbling action combined with the raised knobs inside the drum. I typically do a mixed load about three-quarters full (jeans, t-shirts, sox, underwear, shirts), and every single time, the long sleeve shirts and the jeans all get together and play Twister. On top of that, if you ever leave the door closed, the washer smells like a dead skunk, and puts the odor into your clothes. It does get the clothes clean, what's left of them anyway, as long as you leave the door open all the time. I know this product has been discontinued, but if you're thinking about getting a used one, run away.

Not so. This is a nice, rounded introduction to off-road running for everyone. Barrios gives useful advice on gear, technique, etiquette, health maintenance and first-aid. Even more enjoyable to me is her encouragement to see trail running as belonging to a much wider population than just the ultra adventurists. Trail running doesn't have to be only a competitive endeavour -- it can also be a fun way to bring some activity and connection to nature into our lives. It can even be meditative, a nice break from an otherwise frenetic life.Well worth the investment, especially if you are tentatively considering starting in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely dangerous.

However, when translating that into how many issues existing subscribers will receive in the 'new' format and price, they base the value on actual cover price, vice being consistent and valuing it on the same reduced price for a subscription.Bottom line is that existing subscribers will receive only 1 issue in the new 14 issues/year format for every YEAR they have remaining on their subscriptions.I feel strongly that SN is not treating its existing customers fairly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great New Format","review":"You need to give the new format and 28 issues a year a look over.

Some hard hitting and some soft material. Then Fab collabed with P. Diddy for \\" Trade it all ( remix ) \\" which started his downfall. STREET DREAMS is a poor attempt to go soft and boost up his sales. Tracks such as \\" Call me \\",\\" Into you \\" and \\" My life \\" are just attempts to go pop ( as if he wasn't pop enough ).But the track that is completely garbage is \\" Can't let you go \\", where Fabolous is basically saying he can't let go of his girlfriend even though he has another.

How does one go from being a hardcore ..., to a pu**y whipped ladies man? Beats: They're alright, but his collaborations with bad artists ruin anything that can save this album. Then, to top it all off, the track \\"Wake Up\\" decides to not appear on the album. Why not? We'll never know. The only songs worth hearing are \\"I Don't Give a F**k\\" and \\"Damn\\" - Otherwise the whole album is a reincarnation of another Ja Rule wanna be. And Ja Rule already tends to be a wanna be.

This is how I discovered Bruce Robison, Kelly's husband and master song-writer. Then I saw a used copy of Charlie Robison's \\"life of the party\\" album. I had just read a good review of it. When I took it home, I put it on while doing some work on the computer. I stopped to immediately replay \\"Barlight,\\" then just layed on the bed and listened to the rest of the album. Then I read that Kelly had sung at the wedding of her brother-in-law Charlie, to Dixie Chick Emily Robison, nee Erwin. Then I discovered the Dixie Chicks. This live album is delicious!

Imagine yourself an actor in an alternate version of the movie. It places you in a very good story with some interesting maps and missions.Most of the game is fairly easy; however there were a few scripted encounters that caused me trouble. As usual, save and save often as you never know when an RPG is going to be shot down upon you from atop a building.Pros:A quick fun action gameBeautiful graphics in a desert urban environmentCons:Very short gameHorrid multiplayerScripted AIAll in all this game makes for a fun afternoon or weekend especially if you liked the movie.

I resently got the demo game(and evan that I would have givern 5 star!!!)that convinced me to buy it. I think the best thing is that the missions are all as good as each other and u controll a team yourself, unfortunately it dosen't come out in the UK till March 24 2003 but it is hard to get in the US because it is sooooo popular so pre-order it NOW.It is similar to Delta Force Land Warrior in a way because of the settings.If u are a Delta Force fan then check out gamespot.com to see all the latest: reviews,downloads,screensavers and more!! Hope this review was helpful !!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this game is a joke","review":"This game blows- pure and simple. First off the AI is the worst i have ever seen in a game. Militia will take cover from your fire, ducking and putting thier heads down. as they do this they will wander into your line of fire and be cut down. Clipping errors are rampant, when you get close to an allied unit your point of view shakes wildly- you get stuck on walls alot too. The graphics are artrocious, and its not my computer- I have a 2.8 ghz p4, 512 RAM and a radeon 9700. when they are at max, faces look cartoony, the animations look stilted and the textures are horrible. The levels are also horribly designed, like they only have two types of levels to play in this game: the first involves you going into a building, killing everyone in it then leaving. The second is where you sit in a building killing everyone that tries to attack..."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE: NO CD KEY","review":"BEWARE: Novalogic is shipping copies of Black Hawk Down without the CD KEY. If you get a copy without the CD Key you can't play the game. If you bought the game online, you can't just take a quick trip to the store to have it replaced either. because of this, I do not recomend this game, and I especialy don't recomend buying it online. Novalogic will make you send in the CD case via snail mail, and then you need to wait for them to send you a key. I am a big fan of Amazon, but not a fan of Novalogic. Amazon is as much a victim here as the buyer. Nonetheless, think twice before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Based on the demo","review":"I'm really not impressed. Yeah, the graphics are good (if you have the computer to support it) but the overall fun value is very low for the single player mission. It's just a bit too easy to kill the enemy (almost like using auto-aim). How can one shot to the abdomen take a man down so easily? Plus, you can't control how far grenades are thrown. There's way too many scripted elements in the game... for instance, if you don't kill this guy first with the RPG, then you die. If you don't kill this guy that runs around the corner, then the hostages die. It's just too scripted and not a very customizable pre-mission setup."},{"rating":"2","title":"a thing to think about","review":"I think it should cost less, like $20.00 or at least $24.00.target is making it so that only people that have 30 bucks can buy it so please!!!!!!!!!!!

Aside from the atrocious teammate and enemy AI in the demo and the hideous performance when the players enter buildings, the memory of every fighting man that died in Somalia is DISGRACED by turning that abattoir into a traditional first-person shooter.I bet anybody who was there or had ever served in the military would be stunned that this game allows you to get shot multiple times and then run over \\"health packs\\" to regain your health. Just like real war, right folks?This is so abominable every copy should come with an apology. Even though NovaLogic is based in California, I doubt many Americans work there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boycott (plus it sucks)","review":"For an event that didn't happen so long ago, this game is cruel. Not only is it unethical, but it's not entertaining either. Although I've only played the demo, I felt extremely let down. This game isn't even original. It's like every other first person shooter out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this game","review":"I can't believe they are doing a game after those Special Forces soldiers who were killed on that horrible day in Mogadishu(spelling?).These people who designed the game couldn't have picked another country in the world. North Korea? Afghanistan? How about Iraq?This is strictly a respect issue and to make a game off of a terrible incident for this country especially in these times is extremely insensitive and greedy.To those who think, \\"well its only a video game\\" try selling the game to the families of the soldiers who were killed or maimed."},{"rating":"1","title":"AI - What is that?","review":"I don't know what game the other reviewers have been playing, but the AI of the Black Hawk Down that I have been playing is just aweful. Your squad consists of you and the three stoogies; your squad mates can't hit the broad side of the barn when it comes to the bad guys even if the bad guy is standing right next to them so you will have to spearhead to do almost all of the shooting; however, the the three stoogies will take this opportunity to shoot you in the back or from the side or they will run in front of you and block your shoots. You cannot give the three stoogies command so they just basically do whatever. The civilian will run between you and the bad guys, but don't worry because the three stoogies are good at shooting the civilians. The AI of the enemies are just as bad. They shoot all over the place and wander around like idiots most of the times. This game is nowhere near the sophistication of Ghost Recon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"This game blows.

Of cousre novalogic makes it so that explains the reason it's (bad). There detail is not good the charecters dont even look as good as soilder of fortune 2. The controls (are bad), can cant adjust the mouse sensitivity. The guns are weak. The only cool things about the game are that it has a big levels, and you can fly in the black hawks shooting the gatling gun. Other than that the game is poor and if you want a good game save it for counter strike condition zero."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont buy","review":"This game is notjust a shooting delta force game. It portrays real men who were there and it is a complete dishonor to them. Also this is different from medal of honor. the troops that landed on Normandy numbered in the the hundreds of thousands while the troops in Somalia numbered far fewer. The delta and Rangers numbered in the hundreds and when you are in a chalk of 10 guys yyou could be portraying one of the men who died. This is DISGRACE and DISHONOR to the men who were there."},{"rating":"2","title":"a truly great collection","review":"I'm really surprised to see complaints about a collection of hits (16 songs) so nicely priced.

PLUS a live version of \\"The Flame\\" and the theme song from \\"That 70's Show\\". Even though others don't like \\"Mandocello\\", I really like it. Being a child of the 80's, I would have liked \\"Ghost Town\\" on here, but at least it doesn't have \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" like the other collection does. Overall a great cd, and not getting it right now would be \\"cheap\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Authorized Greatest Hits","review":"Cheap Trick's Authorized Greatest Hits is an improvement over the earlier greatest hits album from the 90s. First of all the Authorized Greatest Hits contains more songs than the earlier hits complation. Second, Cheap Trick themselves, were involved in the compling of this collection.If a single disc, is all the Cheap Trick that you are looking for I recommend this over the other greatest hits. Really, Authorized Greatest Hits will probably please fans, who do not want to buy the individual albums, but like all hits collections there are always a couple of personal favorites missing. I think \\"Hot Love\\" from their first album should've been on here. Also, there is a live version of \\"The Flame\\" in place of the studio version, but still if you're looking for a single disc of Cheap Trick to add to your collection this is a good choice.Hits include: Southern Girls, I Want You to Want Me, Surrender, The 70's Song, etc, very good stuff. A good cd to listen to in the car."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a book for serious operators","review":"Given the impressive records of the authors I would have thought they'd be able to put together a much more comprehensive book, which btw I wouldn't have minded paying a lot more for - provided it had current info and not stuff from a 1970's SF manual.

My husband likes them even!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not This Time","review":"I'm a big Seidel fan. I think she's one of the unknown treasures of romance fiction. That said, this book really didn't work for me. It felt like rehash of a lot of the themes and dynamics which she explored so brilliantly in Til the Stars Fall.

It will help you brush up on math and grammar a bit, and get a feel for the questions on the exam.

This book may be a good read for young teenage girls seeking guidance, or for women who consider themselves victims of the 'physical repression of American education'. An 'intro to basic psychology' book would be less biased and do more good.She does a good job of covering many types of massage, altho some very lightly (e.g. lymphatic massage in 2 pages) and some with less competence (e.g. distorted view of holistic healing). Do not expect to learn any of the techniques here; it is just an overview.

FYI, the publication date is 2005. To give you an idea of how outdated it is, it talks about floppy disks as the way to get the designs from the internet. The glossary is also a total joke. It gives definitions to the most basic things. It seems this was written more for a 4 year old or a person who had never even looked at a sewing or embroidery machine. I definitely would not recommend buying this.

I use the book extensively for review, although I have learned enough that my level of knowledge is beyond the level of the book.

The most current edition is very close to the original , the revision being in monetary values and dates. There could have been some other revisions giving a more current touch to the story. Also, there are printing mistakes in the pronunciation keys that are very disconcerting to the beginner.Having said that, it's still a much better book for beginners than the Spanish for Gringos, and a good book to brush up on what you may have forgotten !I would recommend this to anyone wanting to learn sentence structure, not just theone liners in the Gringo books."},{"rating":"2","title":"just what I was looking for","review":"This was the exact title and book I was looking for and was in the exact condition I expected it to be in.

After seeing the finished MGM product, it's understandable that Groucho, Harpo and Chico would reconsider and bow out on a stronger note with \\"A Night in Casablanca.\\" Though \\"The Big Store\\" has the brothers in good form, it suffers from a weak script and an overabundance of bad musical numbers. Groucho has some great moments as detective Wolf J. Flywheel and his final pairing with Margaret Dumont is memorable.

Every match, no matter if it's between two submission fighters or two sluggers, they all go the same way. Maybe a few punches thrown, nothing noteworthy landing, and then they fall on the ground and wiggle around for 3 rounds. Atrocious. Two fights on this card end inside the distance, and the rest go just like I described above. Do not, under any circumstances, be fooled by all the big names like I was. This event is boring and not worth your time and money. Although I know the Japanese crowds are always quiet during fights, it only makes the boredom of what's going on inside the ring that much worse. I've heard that Pride may be on its last legs.

The song list is better and more varied.The only advantage this album has is the presence of \\"Anything But Lonely\\". Brightman's performance of this role (Rose in Aspects of Love) was a critical success and her recording is brilliant. However, this same recording can be found on \\"The Premiere Collection Encore\\" anthology along with Striesand's recording of \\"Memory\\".My advice: buy \\"Surrender: The Unexpected Songs\\" and also buy \\"The Premiere Collection Encore\\".

I prefer Brightman's more recent works, \\"Time To Say Goodbye\\" and \\"Eden\\". \\"La Luna\\" wasn't too bad, but some of the song selections were rather dull.

Brightman gets to display her considerable range in these selections. There are several selections from \\"The Phantom of the Opera.\\" Of these selections \\"The Music of the Night\\" is especially well done. I was not familiar with \\"Love Changes Everything\\" but found this to be one of the strongest selections on the CD. I realize this sound odd, but her version of \\"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\\" was probably the weakest selection on the CD. However another selection from Evita, \\"Another Suitcase in Another Hall,\\" was very well presented. Only on a few selections, such as \\"Memory\\" does a slight screech begins to emerge from her usually warm voice.

I do, however, immensely enjoy the \\"Anything But Lonely\\" track which is a 1992 recording and not found on the 1995 Surrender CD.

The mystical element in the story is unnecessary and seems to be an all-too-popular device in modern Afrikaans fiction. Why not just give us a well-written, plain story (such as Remains of the Day), and spare us the spirits?To me the best thing about the book was the descriptions of the town where it is set, which seems to be an amalgam of my beloved East London and Port Elizabeth, the two major cities of the Eastern Cape (where Van Heerden lectured for a number of years).

Like all higher primates and many mammals, our babies grow and thrive best with an abundance of hands on parenting and \\"in arms\\" care during infancy. Baby sleep patterns are different from adults' for a good reason: growth and safety. Babies need to nurse at night and their infantile sleep-wake cycles appear to be protective against SIDS. This idea that we should \\"teach\\" our babies independence is a recent western cultural construct. It opposes all previous human history and most other world cultural care-giving patterns.Also, as a mother of three young children, I encourage mothers of infants to *enjoy* and treasure the fun of rocking, snuggling, nursing, and sleeping with that sweet-smelling baby.

Also - the sound track is not very high quality - it has scratchy moments, and some sounds don't play at all.Second - the game just isn't as good as other childrens games out there. It isn't as educational as Winnie the Pooh's ABC's or 123's.

This is essentially a less-slick variation on 'LifeForms', in that it combines overproduced mid-tempo breakbeats with a surface sheen of 'high art', one which is demolished by the smug inlay notes. It's as if the group were ashamed to be producing dance music, but weren't smart enough to do anything else. 'Accelerator', for example, was more vital and alive, whilst this and 'LifeForms' seem to be the sound of two people showing off their in-depth knowledge of an Akai S1100.

Don't miss him singing the \\"Rub-a-Dub\\" song! (Which is usually cut from TV broadcasts of this film.) \\"Jack Frost\\" is another extraordinary film by Romeo Muller, who also wrote the classic Animagic, Rankin/Bass Christmas films, \\"Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer\\" and \\"Frosty the Snowman,\\" among many other enchanting tales."},{"rating":"2","title":"cherish it!","review":"if you apprecaite classics and want something to enjoy every christmas season, then buy this! i have been watching this movie every christmas for the last 5 years. its a good movie with a kinda sad ending, but totally worth it! you just gotta love the animation style, and the story isn't fluffy like some movies tend to be.its just a great christams movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Classic!","review":"This was a movie I hadn't seen in years so to finally watch it again brought back fond memories and after all of this time it still provides joy and good wholesome family entertainment.

I don't like the fact that the girl didn't marry Jack Frost. Jack Frost is the main character. I like stories where the main character usually gets the girl or guy. But that's not the way this one was written. In the end she marries someone else and then Jack transforms back to his spirit. So what if he was originally an angel for Father winter! If i wrote it, that other guy that the girl married wouldn't even exist, and she would marry Jack Frost and he would stay human until he would pass. And as for Father winter, i would just give him a grip. I sold it to 2nd Time Around later. The storyline is disappointing, and i just would have written it better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has this movie got what it takes too beat the the other ones","review":"Everyone is nuts this movie stinks I like Jack Frost the oringal film not this one it's to dinky!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did we need another version of this crap?","review":"Who buys this stuff?This is another example of total crap getting the special treatment, CLUB DREAD UNRATED VERSION, anyone?B."},{"rating":"2","title":"good movie","review":"Bought as a Christmas gift for my oldest Daughter.

Jack Frost falls in love and is willing to give up his immortality to win the girl he secretly loves. Will winter last forever? This plodding, overly long story misses the mark in creating a magical, mystical personification of winter. My own kids left in the middle to find other things to do. Perhaps if the characters had been more lovable and less self-absorbed this would have been more fun. Oh, well. Can't win 'em all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it....","review":"After seeing the \\"Rise of the Guardians\\" movie, my daughter said Jack Frost was her favorite character AND her favorite movie too!

They are really not much smaller than the square risers and I found that my bed has two supports under the middle for a total of 6 legs, and I needed to buy two sets.

They were very expensive and looked nice at first but soon the bronze plating begin to wear off around the aerator and the drain. The aerator is difficult to remove for cleaning and needs to be cleaned almost daily to keep water from spraying in all directions when the water is turned on. This week the faucet, not the plumbing under the sink, began to leak copiously. When trying to troubleshoot the problem on the telephone with the tech. rep. it was clear that although he bragged that he had been working at the job for 5 years, he didn't know anything about the construction of the faucet. He even insisted that the aerator and the piece that holds it into the faucet were 1 piece, even though it was clear that I was holding 2 pieces in my hand.

I don't need to read yet another article on how to take care of guppies or explaining what a barb is.Also, as with most hobby magazines, there isn't much copy editing or fact-checking.Another beef I have about this and most other aquarium mags is that a large proportion of the articles are about tropical reef organisms and reef aquarium issues, when keepers of reef or other marine tanks are only a small percentage of aquarists. They, and we, would be better served by moving this material to specialized salt-water publications.On the other hand, Aquarium Fish does still have some good writers on certain topics. You just have to wade through a lot of repetition of basic information to find them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Geared for kids","review":"My biggest problem with the publication is that it is overly focused on kids. Letters often include 10 year olds proclaiming their 5+ year fish keeping careers asking questions that are stricly beginner fodder. Aside from the occasional article on a newly identified species, the rest is info you can just get on line. Let me save you some money....In a year the magazine largely covered the following: make sure you know about the fish you are buying before you buy them, make sure you have the right parameters in the tank, and make sure you have compatible tankmates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Christmas project!","review":"This little tree was so much fun!

His voice, quite frankly, pisses me off as it hasn't broken yet and he sounds like he's whining, and the tracks seem to have been made to appeal to 13-year old girls and not the main hip hop goers that he should be aiming at. He has got potential, but he should have started when he matures a bit and can be ebven deemed hardcore by listeners and not some...kid. The best song, obviously, is 'Bow Wow (That's My Name)' with Snoop. That song shows he can make a song with Snoop and sound hardcore enough, there should have been more songs like that and not like 'Puppy Love' & 'Ghetto Girls'. And whats up with blotting out all the language? You can hear the swearing has all been taken off, particularly in 'Bow Wow (Thats My Name)'. Probably because the target audience would be 'offended'. Bow Wow needs more production and imptroved lyrics and he may be fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh??","review":"Aiight, first off, I don't really respect rappers who don't write their own lyrics (that's what makes rappers like 2pac and dr dre stand out in the first place.)

Truthfully, I've only heard like three tracks of his, and they all sound pretty funny actually. A 13 yr. old kid talking about how he's all the stuff and all that. Is it worth listening to?

I think that maybe, hopefully, Bow Wow can improve as he's much older now, but even with me 2 years younger than him I realize that this is complete garbage. He's rapping about being a pimp when he's not even 5'0 or reached puberty. Bow Wow is not a pimp now or then. His songs make no sense and they make him seem extremely self-centered.

What ever happened to talent?

It takes forever for the book to load when I open it, then it takes forever for the pages to turn. I thought it was my Kindle. When I first got this book I had a 2nd gen Kindle that I had been using for about 2 years. Then my husband bought me a new one and I gave him the old one. I felt bad and told him it might be going out because I was having trouble with a book. Turns out the Kindle was fine and is still working great.

Heavens, but some people have a gift for flogging a dead whore. His musings on the nature of time, though, were interesting, as were the observations on the nature of physical world.

His attempts to solve the problem of evil also do more to confuse the issue than to clarify it, but that is to be expected.But it is definitely far better in terms of both literary style and quality of thought than the efforts of today's believers, and it is worth reading for anyone interested in intellectual or religious history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I ordered and paid for this book but NEVER received it!

This is a good book, but Amazon.com should be ashamed at the crummy editing. All the capital H's in this work are actually two capital I's with a dash in the middle (I presume this is a 'smart' scanner error). Sometimes this means that an H is actually split onto two separate lines. Punctuation is missing in scripture references, some words are misspelled, and some of the footnotes are incorrectly ordered. This is the kind of garbage that will cause Kindle to fall into disrepute over those who actually want clean and correct editions of a text. A massive failure, Amazon.

An articulated sculpture! The Sasquach comes with a massively muscled arm of Apocalypse and an arm tube. The tube goes from Apocalypse's waist to his elbow and looks cool but I guess it transports elbow grease or something.Sasquach comes with one of the more detailed sculpts but his color scheme is a little less exciting as he is mostly brown (or white if you get the variant). However, this is a huge guy who towers over the other regular figures and the sculpt and articulation are excellent. Some of the articulation is even hidden in the scuplt (such as cut wrists and ankles) which is always cool. Very fun and he always looks ready to beat the crud out of someone.

Many statements are repeated over and over, and it is simplified to the point that I have to skip pages at some points. It does provide a very simplistic look at Kabbalah, but I can't help but think that a different book would have served me better. The author attributes the Kabbalah as being totally Jewish. I am new to the subject, but from what I have gathered from other sources, the Jews adopted the Kabbalah...they did not create it.

I feel like that sometimes, and it's wonderful to find a song that expresses your own thoughts. I first heard Rachel in Concert, I wasn't expecting this album to be a new favorite for me.

And I am safe!!!So, see, thats why BODGE should sing the song SUPERMAN. Maybe if he reads this, and Everyone reads Amazon.com PEO-PLE!!! HE will se it is a good idea and sing Superman on his next cd?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave Matthews reborn!","review":"This album is SO great! I am a huge fan of the Dave Matthews Band and to me, Five For Fighting is just about up to par! Great sound, great lyrics, great tunes! If you're mellow and like to jam, this CD is for you! Within the next few months, you'll see these guys climb the charts...."},{"rating":"2","title":"superman","review":"I bought this CD for the song SUPERMAN (IT'S NOT EASY TO BE ME). Great song. You just gotta throw your heart out to the guy in this song. John Ondrasik's (I think that's his name) voice reminds me of Dave Matthews Band, Counting Crows, Creed, Matchbox 20... etc.There are other good songs on this CD. But I dunno about that Michael Jordon song... kinda wierd. Well it's not a waste of money to buy the CD that's for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Found something new","review":"I don't know about you, but I've been really bored with new music lately. After hearing Superman, I listened to samples of the other songs and thought it was worth a try - and I'm so glad I did. This CD is addictive. I like Something About You and Love Song - actually I like all the songs. How often does that happen? You know how sometimes all the songs on a CD sound the same? Not at all true with this one - many different styles and tempos. A past reviewer told you to avoid this 'trite, boring garbage.' So, you're 'not a jerk?' Ok, how about a snob? I like Third Eye Blind, Lifehouse, Wallflowers, Matchbox 20 - and now FFF. If you're a 'garbage' lover too, give this a try. Your uncultured ear will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poorest Marketing I've Ever Seen For Such Talent","review":"The marketing gurus for this album should be fired. Every song is great and you find yourself playing this over and over. First album with more than one \\"one hit wonder\\" in a very long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible album","review":"This is one of my favorite albums and I've only had it for a couple of weeks. Every song on here just grabs you and pulls you in with it's catchy lyrics and with John Ondrasik's style of singing. As everyone else has mentioned, John sounds a lot like Dave Matthews, but the theme of these songs is much different that those themes of DMB. America Town's lyrics often are depressing while the lyrics of DMB usually preach carpe diem and the good life. Something about Five for Fighting's songs tell you that they are not just catchy tunes drummed up by Ondrasik, but extensions of his life and references to situations of his past.One song that is particularly great is Superman. Of all the songs about Superman, I place this one right up there with Crash Test Dummies' Superman. Great song. Great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dropping the gloves","review":"Thank God I'm a hockey fan. I was browsing CDs in a bookstore and had just passed a listening station when Five for Fighting caught my eye. So I picked up the headphones and pressed play. I've been pressing play ever since. \\"America Town\\" is the first album I've ever bought with no prior knowledge of who the band is or without hearing at least one or two songs on the radio. The lyrics are deep but inviting. John's voice is powerful and emotional. He conveys so many different moods from desperation to humor to resignation sometimes all within the same song. I've now seen FFF live and they put on one hell of a show. They're definitely not just a studio creation. The energy and feelings that come across so vividly on CD are amplified on stage. Hopefully, we'll be hearing John's take on many topics relating to this America Town for a long time to come. This album is irresistible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.","review":"I really debated whether or not to buy this cd. I spent a good half hour at Borders listening to the music selections, and I had a couple of bucks so...I bought it. See, I am an impulse buyer, I buy anything that appeals to me without much deep thought. But enough about me, besides the fact that I am estatic about this cd. My day is not complete without hearing \\"Jainy\\" before I go to bed. This is, in my opinion, the best track on the cd. But that is definately not all the cd is made of. Let me list my favorite songs: 1 through 12, maybe skipping number 8. They really surpassed my expectations when I impulsed bought it(sorta, I did liten to about five of the tracks and LOVED \\"Superman\\" already). All the songs are so emotional and so well written and so well sung and I love the piano peices. This cd is powerful. And now I am just about to go and buy \\"Message for Albert\\", their debut album that took a while until release, out of an impulse. A strong one, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"America Town","review":"I was lucky enough to see Five for Fighting (at least two of the five) at the Show Box in Seattle last weekend. They opened for Shawn Mullins and stole the show. Awesome!! They were so much fun to listen to and watch. The CD is great and I can't wait until they come into town again. I'll be there for sure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh","review":"Even before hearing it 4833552146 times, I found \\"Superman\\" intensely annoying. \\"It's not easy... to beeeeee meeeeee....\\" Please.But, I gave in to the hype, and got the CD anyway. The piano is nice, but nothing special, and lyrics ok when not grating. He has one of those voices you either love or hate. It's definitely true that the rest of the disk is similar to what's gotten radio play. If you like that, you'll like \\"Americatown\\". If not, stay away--no happy surprises here."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE HIT WONDER","review":"THE RETURN OF SINGER-SONGWRITERS?Well,kinda.David Gray may be exceptional as a singer/songwriter,so are Ryan Adams,Pete Yorn,and Rufus Wainwright.But how aboutJohn Ondrasik a.k.a Five For Fighting(it's like a Nine Inch Nails suitation,folks)? Well,kinda...\\"America Town\\",Ondrasik's major-label debut,went to #54on the pop charts and went gold due to the lush lullaby \\"Superman(It's Not Easy)\\"-a top 15 hit as of this writing.But after listening to \\"America Town\\",I wonder if \\"Superman\\"is the only quality song he can come up with.This album isextremely underdelovoped.It's needs more stucure.With the exception of \\"Jainy\\",there's no other song on this album thatreally soars.So it's sad to say but it looks like after \\"Superman\\" runs its course,Ondsarik will be a well,one-hit-wonder.But that may change if he comes up with a better album,next time round.For the meantime,I recommend:David Gray's \\"White Ladder\\",RyanAdams' \\"Gold\\",and Pete Yorn's \\"Songsforthemorningafter\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty poor","review":"I have only heard the singles off this album so maybe I shouldn't be talking, but I just had to get a word in. To me it seems that FfF is just a poignant acoustic pop band, trying to emulate their betters such as Jars of Clay or even Dave Matthews. Their chord progressions and arrangements are about as run-of-the-mill as it is possible to be, and their lyrics are just plain dumb (\\"you were wrong, you were right\\"- huh?) Spend your money supporting a less-hyped artist who deserves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's been done before, and much better too.","review":"What a boring album. The lyrics are trying too hard to be smart, and are filled with tired cliches that nearly everyone has heard and have also grown out of years ago. I have a hard time believing that this singer even believes what he's saying. The guitars are just backround, minimal, monotonous, and quite awful too. Save your money, and if soft songs dealing with relationship is what you're looking for, look somewhere else, it's not hard this day in age.This album is just a prime example of filler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best used as a coaster","review":"I'm so sick of these boring, LL Bean poster children bands that think because they have an acoustic guitar, enjoy sports, and once loved and lost (how deep) that they now have something important and meaningful to say. Music like this isn't created, it's copied and re-done time and time again. And not in a good way, if that's what you're thinking. I had the \\"opportunity\\" to catch this group open up for David Gray (another spokesperson for the Palm Pilot generation) and I couldn't get over how plain and boring they sounded. At least Gray bobbed his head a bit, perhaps suffering from mild epilepsy...I don't know. Anyways, save your cash for something better, you'll be a better person, Chachi."},{"rating":"1","title":"MY GRANDPARENTS WOULD LIKE THIS","review":"this cd is SO boring. all the songs sounds the same. the best song on the cd is probably \\"Micheal Jordan\\" just because it doesn't sound like all the other songs. like as soon as i get a cd i listen to the whole thing. when i got this cd i could barely handle the first 3 songs. if you like boring-put-you-to-sleep music then this is the cd for you. and if you don't then i definately don't recomend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.","review":"I bought this album on a whim, after hearing \\"Superman\\" while half asleep, and it was one of my best impulse-buys ever. John Ondrasik has a beautiful, sweet voice and knows how to write songs that take advantage of it. While his voice is often compared to Dave Matthews, I think the sound is a lot closer to a cross between old Counting Crows (back when Adam Duritz could still write good songs) and David Gray. But if you like any of the above, there is a good chance you'll love this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"America Town Five for Fighting","review":"Good. Different from the first cd. Songs are good.

Every song has a special meaning, a different meaning, to everyone who listens to it. This CD is wonderful. The vocals are amazing. The band writes all of their own songs. This CD should be given far more recognition than it is getting. It doesn't compare to Justin Timberlake or Xtina because its far more phenomenal. This album will touch the hearts of all of its listeners. I strongly recommend if you like Counting Crows that you purchase this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So Much More Than Superman...","review":"Long before \\"Superman (It's Not Easy)\\" had saturated the airwaves in the waning months of 2001, this album had sneakily become one of the freshest and most engaging pop albums of the year. I bought this after hearing the last strains of the video fade while popping through VH1 last summer, and still return to this album almost weekly for a tuneful reminder that new pop artists are still making great music. From the opening cut to the last, this is a terrific find, easy to listen to and hard to forget. My personal favorite: \\"Love Song\\" which features one of the best lyric/music marriages on any pop album this year. Strange, sad, hopeful and wonderful, it is a great example of the songwriting skill that John Ondrasik displays on this wonderful album. \\"Here in the borders of America Town\\" he sings on an earlier cut . . . I hope he is here in the borders of America Town for a long time to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"A huge discovery!!!","review":"A couple of weeks before this cd was released, I got my hands on a two-track sampler of it and was blown away. Great music -- great lyrics... this album has depth. Superficial comparisons can be made to Dave Matthews and Ben Folds... but the truth is that John Ondrasik (singer/songwriter) has produced a unique album of thoughtful songs that you'll want to share... It's mellow at moments and passionate at others. Easy tonight, something about you, love song, out of love and last great american are my initial faves... I love his falsetto. I listen to and review new music all the time -- this album stands out prominently. Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"catchy from the get-go","review":"I bought this becuase I saw the singer doing a live concert on Comcast Live. The song I heard was \\"Love Song,\\" which I could NOT get out of my head for hours. I sampled other songs, and found myself humming many songs right afterwards.If you like catchy pop tunes (my favs are Barenaked Ladies, Crowded House, Joe Jackson, Elvis Costello, Ben Folds) and interesting vocal stylings--this guy has an interesting use of falsetto--get it; you'll like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"an acomplishment","review":"Recently, art has found it's way out of popular music. I don't know why it has; perhaps, people are tired of sentimentality; perhaps, they want escape. Music is art and art is not about running from problems but rather about facing and, ultimately, conquering them. And even though \\"America Town\\" is wrapped up in a tidy pop-rock suit, it touches on such biting topics as suicide and the plasticity of modern politics; even apathy makes an appearance among the themes. Lead man, and thus far, only man, John Ondrasik weaves standard love songs through politicaly satirical songs and the album comes out as something that very seldom emerges in the shelves of the record stores; it is a record that displays both accessibility and literary merit. It will be interesting to see what comes in the future from this gifted man who seems to be the only one who cares about the fate of pop music."},{"rating":"1","title":"one more review","review":"it's ok. if you have an extra ten dollars to spare and like receiving mail in the mail box go ahead and get it. it's interesting bathroom material. don't really know what the last review was all about. the dude didn't like the magazine. why waste time doggin' someone else for their thoughts. looks like a little moral superiority on your part.anyway, get this if you can't spare the extra change for sports illustrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark!","review":"This mag seems very dark and I cannot figure out where they are trying to go.

The writers at Details seems to have the same marching orders. In these hectic times, maybe that's not so bad. The articles I have read are well researched and nicely bite-sized. I actually finished the entire magazine between PM mail delivery and breakfast the next day. The topics they covered in my first issue ranged from fashion to health concerns. And, again, they cover the topics in very few, well-written pages.

Billboard Dad has a great plot.It's kinda neat the way it ends up. If you like diving then you should really enjoy this movie. Passport to Paris was in my opion better. Espeailay if you are going to Paris it really shows you a lot of things that you might want to look at. overall i think that they are both great movies!! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the SMARTEST SEXIEST EROTIC I've ever read...","review":"This is a smart, funny, very nasty book, involving every kind of kinky fantasy. We love reading this, and I got one for my friends. These are smart erotic novelistic stories with a small moral and always a great twist. Hurray Mickey Skee, this is a great find, and you're a great writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't judge this book by its cover!","review":"This monumental flop begins with a six page dissertation during which the author describes various methods he's used to measure the size of his own perfectly average penis. Sadly, the rest of the collection is even less interesting. If Mickey Skee is, as the last section of the books would seem to suggest, a leading authority on gay porn, he should stick to reviewing the work of others. In short, dear readers, unless Mr. Skee has posed for the cover of this anthology and is willing to deliver it to your home in person, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot hot sex, for anyone who likes both!","review":"Are you bisexual? You'll like the homoeroticism in this as well as the way he's not just interested in one type of person, he likes women, too, but it's mostly how his expertise is in his oral techniques, and it's described in great detail. what a book, I love it, I hope there's a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"shocked by richburg","review":"Iam shocked and confused when I read on the internet about richburg's comment when he says he is American but not African American.Iam a young african who is very proud of my continent,though Iam greatly pained by the betrayals by our leaders.I haven't read the copy of \\"out of america\\" yet but I think richburg forgets that colonialists must be blamed for many atrocities on his Beautifull\\"ANCESTOR'S LAND \\". The recent genocide in Rwanda can happen anywhere ,besides the genociders had support from some \\"civilised nations\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT FOR THE POLITICALLY CORRECT","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read. It is well researched, well-documented, and well written. Frankly, Richburg exposes many ugly truths about Africa that need to be said. In a time when the media is rife with political correctness and an obvious liberal bias, Richburg's book is a breath of fresh air.The brainwashed PC masses may not be thrilled by this book, but they WILL learn from it. Richburg peels away at the many layers of ugliness that exist within African society: tribalism, racism towards blacks from themselves, and seething resentment (albeit understandable resentment) toward their imperialist masters that manifests itself through an unwillingness to see post-colonial realities. Richburg is brilliant. He takes you on a journey to hell and back again, and you enjoy the ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"A courageous look at today's Africa","review":"Keith B. Tichburg, author of this book, is a journalist who has spent most of his professional life on other continents. When he got the assignment to move to Africa from Asia, he thought he was in many ways going home.What he found was graft, terror, and cruelty. In a straight forward honest way, Mr. Tichburg tells the reader about what he saw, and his reaction to it. His narrative is powerful and moving and informative. In the end, he left Africa with the sense of his Americaness. One gets the feeling that was the real trip home.There has been burning criticism of this work, most of which expected something more than Mr. Tichburg intended. In his own words, this was written as a journilist's record of what he saw in the 3 years he was there and his reaction to it, as a black man, in the end as an American.This book should be read by anyone interested in modern Africa, or in the experience of a journalist who saw 21 sub-Saharan countries up close and personal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ashamed","review":"This book made me ashamed. As a black man, I had often found myself bitter at the thought that it was white Europeans who were responsible for the state of Africa. This book makes it clear that such is not the case. What is it that we lack that makes us incapable of reaching cultural and intellectual heights on par with Europe and America? I don't know but the fault surely lies within us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of America","review":"This book is absolutely outstanding in several ways. It is fascinating reading and there is profound wisdom in it and goodwill. One main thread is the hands-on knowledge of the brutal reality of life in Africa. An attempt at explaining what went wrong with Africa, why its countries could not make it, like South-East Asian countries did. Another is a Black American's look at race, the feeling of race, and the place of racial difference outside Western civilization. For a white man it was a revelation. Pity my English is not good enough to sing the praise of \\"Out of America\\" as loud as I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deeply disturbing","review":"Richburg's account of his tour in Africa was extemely unsettling. Because he chose to focus his venemous penon the dictators and parasites raping and pillaging three countries in Africa he failed to see the majority of Africans that are fighting for a new day. He forgot to look beyond the his journalistic interests and see the real people of Africa.His prayer of thanks that his ancestor made it out of Africa and survived the demonic middle passage is pathetic and sad.Perhaps if his ancestors had not been kidnapped from Africa they could had helped to build up the continent. Instead hedisgraces their memory by tearing it down in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Surprised by Responses","review":"It's interesting that all Whites love this book, and most of the Black posters hate it. It seems that Mr. Richburg achieved what he wanted to -- contention and racial hostility.Congrats Mr. Richburg! Your book showcases ignorance and hatred that would be called racist if it were written by a White person. You did what Whites would be afraid to do -- slander an entire continent based on a jaded view of Africa.Like many posters have already said -- Africa, like all other continents has its problems, but these problems are not unique to Africa. Remember Pol Pot in Asia and look at the current situation in Bosnia in Europe. No continent is perfect. Africa will have to get its act together for the sake of its people. But derogatory books such as this do nothing for anyone, except give White people another reason to justify their racism."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Journalism","review":"It is not simply a narrative of what he saw. The controversy arises when the writer constantly speaks in absolutes about Africa being hopeless. I also challenge everyone to think about the American Revolution and how bloody it was trying to break the shackles of British oppression, now compare that event with Africans trying to break the oppression of World funded Militia's and Dictators. A true unbiased journalist would have thought about the history of developed nations: American Revolution, Civil War, French Revolutions, the Two world Wars, Haitian Revolution etc. The writer's work clearly shows his bias."},{"rating":"1","title":"I threw this book in the GARBAGE, where it belongs","review":"I have always been one who is strongly against throwing away a book, but I had to -- for my ancestors sake. Horrible to see a black (or not so black in this case) man who can see to be so blind."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unvarnished view","review":"This is my second time reading Out of America..., and this second reading was as powerful as the first. Richburg tells an unvarnished truth about Africa, its corruption, tribalisms, and unflinching barbarism from one country to the next. As tourists, we tend to be ushered to the breathtaking beauty spots where we don't see what's behind the veil. This book lifts that veil and begs the question of how humans can treat their fellow man with such hopeless disregard?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A mind blowing story","review":"This ia book that should be read by all. It is a modern story about a black reporter being sent to Africa to cover stories there.He gives, often, horrible stories about how the violence, which is a common, every day event in country after country.How, he, as a black man was treated in terrible way. He was brutalized, threatened almost ending his life in many occasions, only to be saved by some small freak way. in fact, his race was of no use to him as a black in a country full of and controlled by blacks. He barely survived.It is a story that is hard to write about , even for me to describe the horrors of living there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book of the Black Perspective","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Because I travel a great deal in third world countries with Black majorities, it gave me some good perspective to take with me. It also just emphasized my experience that despite its many shortcomings and how we got here America has a lot to recommend itself. I am choosing stable third world countries for the human experience and America for the economic and developed infrastructure experience. I'm splitting my time about equally in both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Color-blindness isn't the answer","review":"My only disagreement with Mr Richberg is that I think racial harmony can only come when we celebrate our diversity--to be \\"color blind\\" is to devalue individuals. I think we should recognize ethnicity and be grateful for our diversity. I found this book to be heart-breaking in its description of the seemingly hopeless political/ethnic/spiritual situations destroying the African continent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent account of victimology in Black culture...","review":"This is a well written account of how ingrained victimology is in contemporary black culture. It also demonstrates almost painfully how important it is for so-called black leaders to stop perpetuating racism by making everything into a black/white issue. I learned so much from this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"This is the first book on Eichler, and it does an admirable job of getting the topic out there. The good part is that there are plenty of color photos and the book is very well desgined. The not-so-good part is that many of the homes pictured are remodeled and don't truly represent the original designs. The text is by 4 different authors and doesn't hold together well as a complete narrative. Still, if you are relatively new to Eichler this is a nice browsing book that will give you plenty of visual stimulation. For the definitive historical tome on the Eichler story, get \\"Eichler: Modernism Rebuilds the American Dream\\" by Adamson which is more complete and scholarly but not as visual and colorful. The two books actually make a good set and give you both sides of the story. In all, this is a very good book about beautiful and innovative homes by an important midcentury homebuilder and businessman."},{"rating":"2","title":"I never get tired of this book.","review":"I agree with the other reviewers' comments about the excellence of the Eichler homes and this book. I have many design books, but I keep coming back to this one and never tire of the clean, modern--but not cold--design. I wish Ditto, et al. would produce a video on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nostalgia at my Fingertips","review":"For nine years our family lived in California (near San Jose) in an Eichler house. It's hard to describe the architecture to someone who's never seen one, and I was delighted to have this table-top book to show people the architectural points of interest - flat roof, glass walls, atrium behind the front door. What wonderful years we had in that house. One almost must live in California to live in an Eichler, though I've seen the occasional similar architecture a couple of times in Tyler, TX."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXHILERATING","review":"A VIBRANT, BEAUTIFUL RECORDING THAT COMBINES EVERYTHING THAT IS WONDERFUL ABOUT BRAZIL AND IT'S MUISIC- THE RYTHYM, THE JOY, AND THE SENSUALITY"},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative","review":"Helpful magazine that spots trends and gives advice on when & what to upgrade - essentially what you want a tech magazine to do.

My subscription was transferred to MaximumPC (no, I wasn't asked if this is what I wanted).I found MaximumPC to be a fairly decent magazine. More for gamers than for us regular folk.I recently read a letter to the editor about their CD, and wondered why I wasn't receiving one when my subscription to Yahoo Internet Life was paid up until Feb 04.I emailed them asking about this, and was told my subscription was for the magazine only. I was never given the choice of which I wanted - the magazine only or the magazine with the CD.They also told me that if I wanted the CD, I would have to send them another [dollar amount] on top of my paid supscription.I asked for a refund on my remaining 10-month subscription and received it today - all ... of it...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maximum Bozo","review":"This is a magazine made of clowns!

The description claims 6-10 weeks, but it could take several months longer.Falsely advertised; buy directly through Maximum PC or a more reliable source where you'll actually get all 12 months with all 12 software discs, rather than 6-10 issues with no discs.This product is NOT the product described.

Much discussion on hardware, with some software thrown in.

A step up from Wired without going over the edge."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hot Rod Magazine For Computers","review":"Like a hot rod magazine is not for every car owner, this magazine is mainly for people on the cutting-edge of PC computer performance, or who enjoy being a spectator to it (essentially, computer drag races - I'm in this latter class.)

I find that this magazine is way too technical for the average user and that most articles are slanted to encourage buying, not using a computer. When I subscribed, I was hoping it would be as helpful as the old \\"Smart Computing\\" magazines were. There's not very many people I would give this to as a gift, or even give my old issues.

As with most of the Sesame Street videos, there are one or two really good bits and then a lot of filler. My 4 1/2 year old enjoys the rock and roll music that is all about things he's learning about in school right now. Adults will also enjoy the Mick Jagger-like muppet from the \\"Cobble Stones\\".

Probably 50% of the S404's we sell are returned because people can't use them for a normal period of time without the batteries going dead.I suggest you look at the Nikon 4300 or Canon S40/S45. You'll thank me later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Late Shipment almost 3 weeks to arrive & doesnt work","review":"Seller didn't want to me to return item for a refund since he has no return policy list \\"BEWARE\\" and suggested I send the defective item to the Manufacturer. I would do this if the camera ever worked but it shuts off when changing the selector dial...have to remove the batteries to get it to come back on. Won't suggest buying from this seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"buy something else","review":"This camera is a waste of money. It may have been good when it came out buy in 2011 those that are left on the market aren't worth it in the 4MP class. I've had two of them and they both malfunctioned.While they were working I found they were slow, clunky, average image quality, and battery eaters.. If you want a 4MP camera look at the Olympus Stylus 410D and the Konica Minolta DiMage Z2. Both of those cameras are far superior to this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"good deal @ Target","review":"I began looking for digital cameras 2 weeks ago and the s404 was one of the first cameras I liked. Target had it for .... After numerous trips to other stores looking for something better and reading these helpful comments I decided the s404 was for me. I just got back from Target where they no longer had it on display but when I asked for it they still had it and it came up at $.... I bought it quick without asking a lot of questions. Much cheaper than anywhere online (other than ebay). So thanks to all, I have not used it yet but by the way these reviews sound I think I will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice - But Not nice enough","review":"This is (was) my second digital camera. After much research for an upcoming trip I decided on the Minolta. Long story short... I took it back 3 days later. Here's why: Battery Drainer! Even with 1800 Mah NiMH batteries, it does not last long. Although it has nice features and takes nice photos, it isn't worth much to me if you have to carry around a boat-load of batteries...especially on a vacation. Another thing to remember, 2,272 x 1,704 pixel images is large, but will never be as large as 35mm film. I am getting a very nice compact film camera, having the film scanned to CD, and calling it a digital camera for a fourth of the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Camera!!","review":"We wanted to upgrade from our 1 MP camera and have been looking at the Minolta Dimage series for several months. We finally bought a Kodak DX3900 and it was an awful camera! We were able to get our money back and we immediately ordered the Minolta Dimage S404. We got it just in time for our Colorado vacation and the pictures are awesome! We now have beautiful mountain pictures that we can enlarge and print. I've already done some printing and the pictures look like 35mm photos. I have read that some people complain about having to process the pictures through special software. We tried this processing, but didn't see a difference. We have very vivid color just using our regular photo editor. It isn't time consuming to use the Minolta software though. I would highly recommend this camera to anyone. It's great for point and shoot and gives you more professional settings if you want to use them. We've had great luck with the auto settings so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this camera","review":"We bought this camera about a month and a half ago, and it has been nothing but trouble since the day that we bought it. We can only take a few pictures before it turns itself off, and says that the batteries are gone. Or it will not turn itself off, but will not take pictures. The pictures have been mediocre, and it takes forever to turn on and be ready to take a picture. We went into the store wanting a Canon S45, and let ourselves be talked into this piece of junk. What a big mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but I have had problems","review":"First off I really like the camera. I takes great pictures with excellent color quality. I have used the Sonys and I think the Minolta's colors are far superior. The time between shots is minimal with the 32 MB buffer. Unfortunately, this thing sucks down batteries like there is no tomorrow. I bought the 1800 mA PowerEx batts (which I'd recommend) and it even drains those fast. Not only that but it just died completely on me-- the lens stuck out and flashed \\"err\\"-- just dead. Minolta is fixing under warranty, but I'm still out of a camera for my vacation. Anyway, I still think this is the best deal around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy use, powerful, but a little clumsy.","review":"Generally this is a great camera, easy to use, nice pictures. Variety of resolutions to adjust your storage volume, and a nice zoom and scroll feature when viewing stored images. Makes nice movies too, max 60sec. each. Full auto or full manual settings if ya want. A little awkward at times- your R. thumb unwittingly opens the side access pannel. And it dosn't like high contrast shots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Camera","review":"After using a digital camera at work for a couple of years and searching for my own I landed on the Dimage S404. It is a lot of camera for the price. Easy to use, easy downloading of the images to a computer. It doesn't use a proprietery battery so that is handy. I would suggest the purchase of rechargeble batteries if you go with this camera however.This is really all the camera I need. If it has a downside... I don't believe the macro works as well as other cameras I have used. It doesn't have quite the detail of several Sonys I had used. That said the macro still works well.Other than that I don't think you can do better dollar for dollar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't bear to listen to it again","review":"I've listened to this recording twice but I probably won't listen to it again, for the singing gives me little pleasure. Russell Watson's voice and technique are both unsatisfactory and his performances are hard on the ears.I will only give this recording a single star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bocelli is infinitely better","review":"Having listsened to both Russell Watson and Andrea Bocelli, I must say that the latter is infintely preferable to the former, as Watson's performances are really not up to standard. In fact, Watson compares unfavourably to Bocelli both in terms of quality of voice and vocal technique. COnsequently, this album has little to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inadequate voice for the music","review":"Russell Watson does not have an adequate voice for much of the music that he attempts in this album. As a result, his performances are farcical, mere parodies of real interpretations of the music.An album to be avoided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-praised","review":"This recording is definitely the subject of hype. Having heard this recording in its entirety, I can categorically say that the singing here is bad. Very bad, actually. The singer cheats with the music and does not offer anything special. One of the worst, if not actually the worst, discs that I've ever heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"An over-hyped entertainer","review":"Having listened to this recording, I'm now firmly of the view that Russell Watson is no more than an over-hyped entertainer. He isn't really a professional singer, let alone a classical tenor, for his substandard, and at times even woeful, performances are far below to level of performance that people generally expect from professional of classical singers. Mr Watson's abrasive voice and strident delivery give no pleasure at all, and this kind of singing cannot even past muster in school choirs. This is one of the worst recordings I've ever heard, and I don't think such projects can do any justice to music or will succeed in converting more people to classical music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ludicrous singing","review":"The singer I heard on this recording is simply ludicrous!It's a parady of classical vocalism and the operatic style. Russell Watson can't even sing one phrase in a proper and musical manner. His voice is coarse and his mannerisms often most annoying. He doesn't even have the little talent to make the music come alive.A most unsatisfactory release!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plain bad singing","review":"This CD contains some very bad singing. The singer, Russell Watson, obviously has an untrained voice. He also is a very inexperienced performer. The performances on this CD is techically flawed and his no charm whatsoever.A bad recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"From bad to worse","review":"In the ordinary course of things, a singer, especially as young singer, would improve with each recording that s/he makes.Unfortunately, this does not seem to happen with Russell Watson, whose 2nd album marks a dramatic deterioration from the first.Maybe Watson is so blinded by the commercial success of his 1st album that he just want to cash on with another release without caring to hone his vocal skills.But even that, it is still disappointing to find Watson's singing to have declined like that. His first album, The Voice, is bad enough. This 2nd album, Encore, manages to be much worse, which is quite a feat!The singing, interpretation and even the orchestral playing and engineering are all worse than the 1st album. Quite terrible in fact.I would never recommend such substandard stuff to people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor performances of great music","review":"The music here is good and interesting. Unfortunately, everything is ruined by the amateurish singing of Russell Watson, who literally croads his way through the recording. Not only has Watson failed to do any justice to the music, he has, in my view, succeeded in making such sublime music sound mundane and unpleasant.Fortunately, there're many better singers around these days. Compared to them, Watson's recordings are uncompetitive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninteresting CD","review":"This CD is so uninteresting! I nearly fell asleep when listening to it! The reason? The choice of music is uninspiring. The singing is haphazard and uncommunicative. There's just no life in the performances! A bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"A singer without much voice","review":"It is strange to hear a singer who hasn't got much of a voice singing the kind of music on this recording. Needless to say, he is unable to perform the taxing music competently. Indeed, his performances are almost a farce. One star only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hilarious singing","review":"Well, perhaps there just aren't standards anymore these days, for I'm utterly astonished that people can claim that Russell Watson is an 'opera singer'. Well, just ask Mr Watson to sing in unamplified opera on the stage and see how he cope. I'm sure his smallish voice, limited range and non-existent technique will lead him to be hissed off the stage within the first 5 minutes.What a great pretender he is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is already too many","review":"The singing on this recording is so bad that, honestly, the reward of just one star is already too many. Russell Watson may have found himself a few admirers amongst those who listen to very few vocal recordings. But he has actually embarrassed himself musical by producing such a substandard album which exposes his many vocal and interpretative inadequacies. There is, also, little joy in the singing per se. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgraceful release","review":"Shame to the record company who releases such a substandard recording. It's so very disgraceful! Russell Watson at present just doesn't have the voice, technique and interpretative talent to perform such kind of music. No wonder that his performances here are so bad.I won't recommend it to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much worse than the 1st album","review":"I'm gravely disappointed with this cd. It is much worse than the singer's first album. Here, both the voice and the singing has declined in standard. I'll give it one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an encore!","review":"What an encore this is! The singing on this cd is so bad that one wonder why Mr Watson and his record company are so keen to release a 2nd album. Neither the voice nor the interpretations give any pleasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nasty Encore","review":"Russell Watson should never have done this disc, for his voice and talent (or the lack of it) cannot do the music any justice. In fact, it amounts to a virtual destruction of the music. The only thing worth praising in the album's cover, but it hardly counts much."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad encore","review":"This is not an album that I can recommend to others. The singing is just too bad. One would expect better singing from even an amateur who cares to release a recording to the public. Nothing satisfies here. As bad a vocal album that one can get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst cross-over album ever!","review":"This can't do! The singing is technically so deficient, and the interpretation so charmless that this must be, by far, the worst cross-over album ever released. No marks can be awarded to this abysmal attempt."},{"rating":"1","title":"A party recording","review":"This kind of album may make a good party recording, when friends gather around of have a good laugh at how ludicrously bad singing can be. Otherwise, such a poorly produced album has little or no artistic value at all. I'll give it just one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninteresting CD","review":"This CD is totally uninteresting. The music selection is uninspired and predictable, and the standard of performance is below professional standard. It's simply not worth the price of the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pop voice over-stretched by the music demands","review":"From what I hear on this album, this is essentially a document of a pop voice over-stretched by the music. I don't think Russell Watson should proceed on with this kind of repertoire, for his voice and singing technique just can't cope. He should be more honest to acknowledge his considerable vocal limits than attempting things that he can't manage properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exceedingly bad in quality","review":"This cd is of exceedingly bad quality. Russell Watson is unable to singing any music properly, and as a result, his performances on this terrible cd leaves a lot to be desired whether in terms of technique or interpretation. In fact, this cd gives me no pleasure at all. I'll be disposing of it shortly."},{"rating":"1","title":"A laughable effort","review":"This recording of Russell Watson just makes me laugh. The actual singing is unimaginably bad, and there is almost an entire absence of musicianship in the performance. One can understands that Russell Watson, with his ill-equipped vocal instrument, is unable to perform the music as written. Yet, he doesn't even manage to invest the music with any sense of charm.This recording can only be termed a failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't think of a worse album","review":"I don't think I've come across a vocal album that is worse than this one.Russell Watson performs extraordinarily badly here. Not only is his voice of unappealling quality, he pays scant attention to note values and dynamic subtleties.As a result, his performances are musically grotesque, and fail to reveal the splendour of the music.Such a kind of singing, which probably isn't even good enough for karaoke bars, shouldn't have been issued to the general public.This is a thoroughly disappointing release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't compare with Bocelli","review":"Russell Watson can in no way be compared with Andrea Bocelli, who possess a genuine tenor voice. Just compare the recordings of the two and one will immediately notice that Bocelli has a better voice and technique than Watson, which is still a very inexperienced singer. Given that both singers are doing more or less the same thing, the choice is easy to make."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good","review":"I don't like this recording at all. The singing is no good. Russell Watson must be the one of the least talented singer ever have the chance to record an album. His performances are all disappointing. Nothing interesting to speak of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incompetent singing","review":"If one compares what Russell Watson sings on this recording with the score of the music, one will immediately note that the singer has made a lot of simplifications. The reason is simple and evident: Russell Watson doesn't have the voice, technique and musical knowledge to execute the music as written. As a result, his performances are mis-representations of the music.Those who wish to hear the music in all its glory as the composers intended are advised to avoid this recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor imitation of a classical crossover singer.","review":"Buying a CD for the first time of RW (as they call him in my work), is not encouraging at all. His voice is nothing extraordinary, too strong and without emotion, the rendition of E Lucevan Le Stelle is, what i describe as, below par. Unfortunately, he made the mistake of including this piece in the album. It is this song that gained Placido Domingo numerous standing ovations, even Pavarotti, Carreras and the likes of Jose Cura and Mario Lanza. His style did not do justice to the beautiful classic opera song. The rest of his songs are, again, too loud, too common. He copies other pop singer's style. He does not have originality. I am disappointed with my first purchase of his CD. I do not recommend this CD to people who resort to music to unwind after a long and hard day. Not!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the lot","review":"I know nothing about classical music, and therefore cannot comment on those opera arias in this disc.However, I've listened to a lot of cross-over, and I must say that this cd is probably the worst of the lot.As some others have pointed out, Russell Watson's singing is not competitive enough when faced with the challenges of Groban, Bocelli, Safina, Frangoulis and Church etc.Moreover, Watson doesn't sing with a heart and we listeners do know whether or not a singer has put in his heart when making the recording.Thumbs down to this bad release."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRID!","review":"As an operalover I'm disgusted by this \\"crossover\\"... I heard Watson BUTCHERING \\"Nessun Dorma\\" on the American TV Show \\"The Nanny\\"... This CD is even worse! He has NO BUSINESS singing opera! Simply disgusting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A musical embarrassment","review":"This cd must be quite an embarrassment to both the singer and his fans, for the singing is so bad that there're a few moments in each of the tracks that Russell Watson makes a musical fool of himself. Needless to say, this kind of recording won't appeal to any serious music lover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible singing","review":"The singing on this album is just terrible! Russell Watson can't even sustain a phrase to its proper length. How can one expect him to perform entire arias or music of any great difficulty?A total disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossibly bad","review":"Much as I welcome the notion of \\"cross-over\\", I must say that this album by Russell Watson will only serve to scare people away from the genre. This album is really of very low quality. The singing, in particular, is impossibly bad. None of the songs here are performed up to standard.In fact, Mr Watson cannot even hold a note properly - his voice lose quality rapidly whenever he is required to sustain a note. His voice also wavers precariously whenever he puts pressure on the voice. No wonder it leaves little room for him to actually interpret the songs. As a result, the singing comes across as unvaried and generalized.This certainly is not the best way to start any collection on cross-over music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Much worse than \\"The Voice\\"","review":"I'm thoroughly disappointed with this album, which is much worse than the singer's first album, \\"The Voice\\".There has been a marked deterioration of the vocal quality of Russell Watson. Besides, the singers seems to have given much less attention to expression, making the performances on this new album all the lot less communicative.Watson's future looks very much in doubt unless he brushes up his singing and give us something better in quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can only bear it once","review":"I bought this cd recently, but I could only bear to listen to it once. It is a grave disappointment for the singing on this cd is extremely bad.Russell Watson clearly is not up to the task in a project of this type. His voice, unpleasant in timbre and restricted in both size and range, just can't cope with much of the music.His generalised interpretations also betrays his lack of experience in vocal performance as well as his ignorance of different music styles.Such under-nourished performances aren't helped by an overly vibrant contribution from the orchestra.Frankly, I derive so little enjoyment from this cd that I haven't the slightest urge to listen to it again. The money that I spent on it is considered wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad recording","review":"What a bad recording this is!The singer on this recording cannot sing. He bawls his way through the music, glossing over all those small details which make those pieces so interesting. As a result, Russell Watson is here performing only simplified versions of the music. That he performs them so badly even so is clear indication of his many failings and inadequacies.One star only."},{"rating":"1","title":"A worthless release","review":"I don't see any worth in this kind of release. The singing is bad, the repertoire has been covered by many better singers, and there is nothing special that it has in offer.It also misleads people in respect of classical singing. Really bad! And irresponsible, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to this CD, and you'll be hooked to Watson","review":"Briefly, just listen to this CD for yourself. You will be amazed with this talented singer who will open the doors of classical music to you. And, he sings rock in a rock voice.Never mind our reviews. Listen and you too will be hooked on Watson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something great to listen to","review":"Russell Watson comes across as one of the greatest voices in classical music. His ability to switch tones and languages is enchanting. This is great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic!","review":"Russell Watson has the unique ability to capture his audience, no matter how old or young they are, or what their taste in music. The unordinary mixture of pop ballads and classical opera makes this album perfect for grandparents and grandchildren alike!Of course, it's nearly impossible to judge an artist based on a studio recording, but this album certainly gives you a good indication to this guy's range. If you do get the chance to hear or see a live performance, don't pass it up! The album is brilliant but not as good as the real thing!The track that sticks out in my mind most is \\"Is Nothing Sacred\\" - it makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up! If you liked \`The Voice', then you'll love this latest edition from Russell Watson.Encore, Russell, Encore!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth waiting for!","review":"I nearly wore out my Encore cd that came from New Zealand, so when I got my new US Encore cd this week, I was ecstatic. The music is fantastic! The new cuts are well done, and I enjoy it more every time I listen to this cd. It is a wonderful addition to anyone's Russell Watson library of music. The new music just continues to prove how versatile Russell's voice is, and how much of a pleasure it is to listen to this man who can sing pop and classical arias with equal ease and proficiency. A definite thumbs-up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally unique sound, undeniable talent - CD a must-buy","review":"The greatest achievement in this CD is Russell Watson's ability to make each standard or song feel fresh again, thanks to his peerless voice and easy phrasing, the exceptional arrangements and wondrous sounds.\\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" takes a step away from his previous CD delivering a new rock-type singer. His classical voice continues to improve stronger, mellower, and becoming more and more reminiscent of the great Mario Lanza.It must be said that when Russell closes with \\"Where My Heart Will Take Me\\", he sounds just as good as any pop-rock singer today. His voice is pure unadulterated Watson, a totally unique sound.Overall, I must admit I prefer his classical voice since that is the music I prefer but his upbeat and happening style of \\"I Just Don't Know How I Got By\\" and his undeniable talent and palpable charm makes \\"Encore\\" simply irresistible, and a must-buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unremarkable","review":"I just can't understand all that fuss surrounding Russell Watson. As heard from this recording, Watson's voice, technique and emotional range are all unremarkable. There's really nothing special about him or his singing. If there's anything of note, it's his effortful vocal production.Clearly a case of over-hyping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't be recommended","review":"I just can't recommend this cd to any people who has any musical taste for the singing here is extremely bad.Whether in rock, pop or classical songs, Russell Watson's voice and technique is simply not up to the challenge. He belts, screams and croaks in order to reach the notes and sustain the phrases. The result is a very labored and unsteady kind of singing that is definitely not appealing.What an off-putting recording this is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossibly bad","review":"I would apologise to fans of Russell Watson for what I'm going to write, but I do find the album to be really bad after listening to it for a few times.The voice of Russell Watson is pleasant enough. Yet, he has failed to put it to better use. Instead, he tries to attempt something that his voice cannot cope, whether in terms of range, amplitude or style. The result is bad singing that is painful to hear.Also, Russell Watson seems not to have studied the music at much depth for his interpretation is superficial, I even find them emotionall glacial.That some people may like this album may be the reason of the music's intrinsic worth. However, as heard from this album, Russell Watson is far from their ideal interpretater."},{"rating":"1","title":"All hype, no skill","review":"I've read many good words about Rusell Watson. No harm to try out his cds, I think. Bought this cd, listened twice, and found that there's nothing but hype - the singing is bad, obviously not the work of a skilled singer.Never mind. I can afford the money, but it's disappointing. I think I'll be suspicious of any singer that relies so much on the publicity machinery in the future. After all, if you think about it, if the singer is good, why would he need the help of it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"An abyss in muscianship","review":"This cd is really bad as I can observe almost not sense of musicianship in the singing. The voice of Russell Watson is also very dry and constricted in the higher reaches. That makes this cd a very unenjoyable one. Frankly, I have no interest to listen to it again after going through it once. After all, such bad singing will never grow on you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Singer in dire straits","review":"Russell Watson is being overly ambitious in choosing a program which he can't deliver. He's in dire straits throughout, and in particular when he has to reach for those high notes or the more demanding passages. He unintentionally makes quite an amount of comical effect when struggling (often without success) to achieve what is actually beyond his singing technique. In a way, this can be quite a moving experience for the listener, but for all the wrong reasons..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Substandard recording","review":"I'm disappointed with this cd. The singing is substandard. Russell Watson, a greatly hyped singing, obviously has not yet acquired the basics of good singing. He can thus only brawls his way through the music, destroying any sense of grace in the songs.It is absolutely outrageous that Russell Watson's record company can produce such a substadnard recording and then have it sold at full price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A wretched sound","review":"Russell Watson makes a wretched sound on this cd. His voice can't cope with the music, and he sounds uncomfortable with many of the notes.Definitely one of the worst sung recordings that I've heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"I regret buying it","review":"I regret buying this CD very much!Not only is the selection of music uninteresting, the performance of the singer leaves much to be desired. It appears that the singer knows little or nothing about the different performance/musical styles and that his technique is an embarrassment, whether to the singer or the listener.Even my kids can't stand such poor singing and they beg me to stop playing the recording and give them some peace! Even they, who aren't exactly musically gifted, realise that the singing on this CD is of exceptionally low quality.I must therefore reiterate that I regret having purchased this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the great singers of our generation","review":"Indeed this is a wonderful CD. Over the past few years Watson has shocked the world with his talent and this cd brings out what the true beauty of music is and of how much talent he has. Watson will be one of the great singers of our generation. We have so much too look forward to in the coming years."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's a cross-over but he's great","review":"Okay, so Russell Watson is a cross-over singer or whatever you call these singers. But people, if there was ever an album that grabbed you by the lapels and said, \\"look pal, this is classical music and this is how good it can sound\\". Well this was it. It never sounded so good.I'm only 29 and this is the first time I've heard Russell Watson sing on a cd, but I've seen him whenever he made some tv appearances. I think, that although he never had formal training in his early years, had he done so, he would have had no rivals. Vocally, Watson is among the best we've EVER heard. End Of Story.Listen to this fine compilation and be thankful that you have heard Russell Watson. If this doesn't introduce you to the passion and excitement of Opera/classical music then nothing will. Take Care."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great recording this is","review":"I've heard this CD several times from beginning to end and I never get tired of it. I don't think I can listen to anyone elses substandard fare again.This is one of the best CDs that I've ever come across irrespective of category. The singer featured here has a tremendous voice and an absolutely terrific technique. Musicianship is perfect. What a great recording this is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it, you'll enjoy it","review":"Being a Watson \\"fan\\" is a bit like being an Elvis Presley Fan. You've got \\"new\\" albums each time, but most of the songs you already own, and there's a few new ones to add.But, then again, you say to yourself: \\"What the heck, perhaps it has better sound, or, well, if not, I'm having a different set of songs this time\\" and you buy it and enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the great artists!","review":"I can think of no album of classical or popular music that approaches let alone accomplishes what this one does. This time out, Watson does his usual mix of classical and pop \\"theme\\" albums but introduces new \\"pop\\" voices. Again, this mix of popular and classical songs, makes it easier for the general public to listen and understand classical music.Incredibly, popular music enters the aesthetic realm of the tragic and elegaic, expressing mature emotions usually associated with poets such as Shakespeare, Keats, etc. The album stands both as a testimony to the power and depth of the common popular song as well as another crowning achievement of introducing classical songs by one the greatest artists of our lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommend this CD all the time","review":"If you want the best of the cross-over singers, Russell is it. This is the one to get. I work at a music store and I recommend this all the time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Watson is captivating","review":"There is just something so, well, captivating about Russell. This collection shows that powerful voice to its best as he belts out a number of classical and pop songs. His concerts also indicate why he is such a top star. The hand gestures, the distinctive way he moves on stage, his rapport with audience has made him a big star in England and Australia. This is one of those motivational collections that shows Britain's most unconventional classical singer in his tantalizing prime!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Russell Stole My Heart / US Encore Release Review","review":"My goodness, I cannot believe the beauty of this cd. Russell brings tears to my eyes with his delivery of Is Nothing Sacred,you can believe it's being sung by a loved one to you. Bohemian Rhapsody, the emotion Russell displays is captivating and draws you in, you can feel the sadness and frustraion of the hopeless young man Russell sings about, another tear jerker.The classic Volare is enchanting, Va. pensiero offers Russell's versatility in popular and operatic styles. So much to enjoy in this CD..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this CD, that's all I can say","review":"I love this CD, that's all I can say. After a listen, you will too. Sheer perfection from the most talented Russell! The price of this CD is very modest, and you will listen to it forever. His voice has an incredible range, which is displayed incredibly and with great taste. You will love every track on this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and unmusical album","review":"I've read through many of the recent reviews, much of them very positive indeed. However, it seems that they're written by the same one or two persons, as the contents are virtually the same!Anyway, I would just give my own views here. I think this is a very boring and unmusical album. Boring because the selection of music is of little interest and that they singing is unvaried.Unmusical because Russell Watson is no singer and he ruins many of the tracks with his rough singing.Whatever fans of Watson may wish to say, I honestly think that this album is an extremely substandard one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete disappointment","review":"When one have read so many positive words about an album, one naturally will have some expectations. Unfortunately, this album proves to be a complete disappointment, which may perhaps suggest that many of those positive reviews here are in fact written by fans of the singer instead of people who really know how to appreciate music.As I said, this album is totally disappointing. The singing is sorely substandard in terms of technique. The performances are also as bland as can be, for the singer does not appear to have any emotional identification with any of the songs here. The singer also seems to have little sense of different musical styles and he merely tackles each and every of the songs in the same boring manner.I'd have given this album zero stars if it had been possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unacceptable","review":"Even after making allowances for the decline in music standards in recent years, this recording is still far from acceptable.The standard of the singing is just so bad that the music has been utterly spoilt. It is even more maddening that the singer and his record company are promoting such a kind of singing and calling it good! That's certainly going too far!I'm terribly disappointed after listening to this album, which shouldn't have been passed for release in the first place. I'd really want to have my money back if that's at all possible.Nevertheless, I've learnt to be more clever next time. I've also learnt to be more skeptical of all those exaggerated words of praise that I've heard, whatever they're about..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfactory","review":"This cd is so unsatisfactory that I have little urge to listen to it again. The singing is very bad and the singer has lots of strange mannerisms that makes his performance sound awkward and contrived. The recording is too close-up, which magnifies every flaw in the singer's voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Singing that appalls","review":"The singing here is simply appalling.Honestly, I don't think I've ever come across singing of such low standard. There're problems in pitch, intonation, breath control, phrasing, style.... Whatever technical shortcomings that you can imagine can be found on this recording.Of course, such a recording can help to demonstrate to students how NOT to sing. However, I don't think this recording can earn any marks as I can give little pleasure to the listener."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't like it at all","review":"As this cd is given to me by a friend, it seems rather ungrateful to write about it in a negative way.However, I have to be honest, because I found this cd to be totally unenjoyable. The choice of music is uninteresting and the performances by Russell Watson leaves me absolutely cold.I'm sorry for my friend to have wasted her money buying me this cd, which I won't get even if it's to be sold for one dollar...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't compare to Bocelli and Frangoulis","review":"Despite the obvious fact that a couple of fans of Russell Watson keeps heaping over-sized praise on Russell Watson by posting the same few posts through different alias here, I think it is already quite evident that Russell Watson's many shortcomings as a singer have been noted by most.Frankly, I don't think Watson is in the league of, say, Bocelli and Frangoulis, both of whom have much better voices and technique. They're real artists whereas Watson, as seen from his embarrassing performances on this album, is merely a farce.Can anyone really think Watson's singing is \\"beautiful\\" or \\"excellent\\"? Oh, come on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Encore!","review":"Can Russell carry a tune? Sure. Is he a competant performer? His record sales prove that. In the end, is he really just spectacularly mediocre? You bet. Could it be magic? YES!!! For all of those Watson fans who want to have one CD to keep handy that contains his best work so far -- this is for you. I would give it 10 and I'm sure any true Watson fan out there whatever country would rate this the same. The title says it all, every song that Russell sings, we want to hear it again and just shout \\"Encore!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"He is the greatest","review":"I have just been introduced to Russell Watson and have just purchased this CD!!It is wonderful as far as I am concerned. A personal choice.I want to buy all his CD'S!! When will he come to CANADA? The English have had him too long!This CD covers the gamut of music - opera to pop. He is the THE GREATEST!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Watson's voice surpasses the songs he sings","review":"For me a good CD has to have at least 75% good songs and has to have longevity. Watson's Encore met my expectations and surpassed them. What I can't get enough of is just the sound of his voice. I don't know anything about \\"classically trained\\" or anything technical about singing, I just know that I like what sounds good. And Watson's voice is just amazing to me. Even if the song itself isn't sensational his voice is so crystalline and beautiful you'll love listening to it. I encourage you people to check it out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like this CD","review":"How can one enjoy a vocal CD if the singer cannot even sing a single phrase correctly? Furthermore, I don't find the singer's voice to be of any great quality. On the contrary, his timbre is dry and his voice becomes constricted from the middle register up.I think this CD can be good demonstration on how NOT to sing. As such, it will be of great help to students of the voice. However, to the general music lover, this recording can bring little pleasure for the singing is substandard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mere shouting","review":"I've never heard a singer who shouts that much on a recording. Clearly, Russell Watson has little vocal finesse, and he has to resort to shouting, and even screaming, in order to reach the notes.Another big reservation is in the recording. There is too much reverberation, making the sound rather artificial. Maybe there's indeed quite a lot of artificiality in this recording as Russell Watson is plainly unable to sing many of the songs here, such impression being reinforced by his live appearances where he croaks, struggles and bulldoze his way through the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"L:eaves me cold","review":"This kind of singing can only leave me cold.Russell Watson has neither a good voice nor a secure singing technique. His singing is a travesty in most cases. He cannot deliver the notes, and he cannot communicate the emotion behind the music.What a lifeless album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Abysmal singing","review":"The singing here is amongst the worst that I've ever heard. It definitely is the worst amongst all commerical recordings that I have (and I have over 4,000 of them).The singer on this recording cannot reach high notes, cannot sustain phrases, cannot execute ornaments, cannot color his voice, cannot sing rapid notes, cannot invest the words with much meaning, cannot sing without amplification etc.In short, the singing on this recording is abysmal. If anyone considers this to be good singing, it merely shows how detrimental such a kind of recording is, for it can only mislead people into thinking that the singing here is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far from great encore","review":"I'd compare Russell Watson's producing this \\"encore\\" album to a performer who has given a bad performance but insists on given an encore despite the boos that he receives.In his first album, Russell Watson has already revealed to us his many inadequacies. Unfortunately, not only has he not realise this (which by itself already renders him not a genuine musician), his voice, singing skills and mannerism suffer a decline in this album, making it an even worse document of bad singing that the first one.Extremely disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring singer with little versatility","review":"What I heard on this album is the work of a boring singer with little versatility. Not only has Russell Watson failed to manage the notes, he is unable to deliver the songs in accordance with the distinctive style of each piece of music. In my view, this certainly reflects the lack of versatility of Russell Watson. The mere fact that he chooses to sing different types of music (not to say that he sings them badly) is not a mark of versatility. Only those who can sing well in different kinds of music truly deserves such a descrption.In my view, Russell Watson has failed miserably in a project that he cannot cope with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Near the bottom of the heap","review":"I couldn't imagine how bad this recording is until I had the opportunity to listen to it. It is indeed extremely bad, with the singer over-stretching himself in most of the tracks and thereby producing sounds that are plainly ugly and unmusical.It is so bad that I can't bear listening to it another time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree with the critics","review":"The amount of revews written on this relatively new recording is astounding. As many experts have already given their views, I don't think I can contribute much. I would only say that I mostly agree with the critics of Watson - his singing is substandard and uninteresting. The album surely doesn't worth its price."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll listen to Watson all day long","review":"The reviewers are right, you will never get tired listening t this CD. This is Russell Watson in top flight, every track is great. Included on this Cd is a selection from the full Watson repertoire, opera, operetta, musical comedy and popular songs of the day all sung to perfection as only Russell could sing them. For anyone who is a Watson fan or for anyone who has only just heard of the Russell Watson name, this is the Cd for you, but beware once you listen to this you won't get anything done."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great new tenor voice","review":"Russell Watson is spot on. This is another fine cd from Watson. The finest orchestral sound quality and boy what singing. Try if you dare, not to find \\"E lucevan le stelle\\" spine tingling and what about the sheer sensational neapolitan beauties. Let's not forget the wonderful arias on the album. Watson's voice gets better each time around. Listen to the disc, just once maybe and you will feel the same as many other fans of one the great new tenor voices EVER."},{"rating":"2","title":"Versatility in his voice is wonderful","review":"Russell Watson is an amazingly talented young man with a beautiful and marvelous voice. He has a stunning depth to his voice that shows off wonderful warmth and color.There are individuals who are upset by his singing both classical and modern pieces but I think the versatility in his voice is wonderful. This is truly a lovely CD....an excellent buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great singer he is","review":"And what a great singer he is! Watson sustains every note so securely to its full measure. Much of the singing here amounts to a form of musical enchantment. Listeners are thus able to appreciate the full beauty of the music, which, in Watson's delivery, is pure magic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inferior performances","review":"I found the performances in this album to be inferior than most recordings of the same music that I can find in record stores.Russell Watson is plainly inadequate as a singer. His voice, vocal technical and interpretative abilities are all called into question. I won't waste my time commenting on the numerous defects of the performances here. I would only say that it's plainly bad with little redeeming qualities.I will give this album one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't compete with Bocelli and others","review":"The substandard singing of Russell Watson certainly cannot compete with the glorious singing of Andrea Bocelli, who has a better voice as well as a complete mastery of vocal technique.Watson also cannot compete with Safina or Frangoulis as both these artists also sing with more skill have more powerful voices.Watson can't compare with Groban as Groban is a much more communicative singer.Why should one buy this album if there're much better things on offer in record stores?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It can only be a joke","review":"I can't believe my ears when I heard the singing of Russell Watson on this recording. How can a person who sings so badly and unmusically be given a recording contract to produce a recording for the mass market?This either reveals the low standard of appreciation of the average music lover in today's world, or that the recording is merely meant to be a joke. I tend to think it's the latter."},{"rating":"1","title":"No rival to Frangoulis","review":"Russell Watson's singing very badly here. No matter in terms of voice, singing technique, style, feeling and even looks, Watson can't match the wonderful Frangoulis. Listen more to Frangoulis and you'll see what you've missed by listening just to Watson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who likes this stuff?","review":"I don't understand why people would buy this over the gorgeous recordings made by legendary tenors such as Domingo or Pavarotti. Watson clearly has no voice for opera. His tone is too nasal. I can't enjoy this stuff. He just flashes a big voice and tries hard to impress people by showing some flexibility. I think that is a bunch of crap. He will ruin his ugly voice if he continues on with this genre switching. Plus, his rendition of the Prayer is the worst version I've heard in years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good enough","review":"Having listened to Bocelli, I find Russell Watson's singing to be not good enough. Bocelli is the superior artist in every respect over the same field. I hope Russell Watson can learn something from Bocelli first before exposing his own severe limitations through such ill-considered recording projects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unacceptable singing","review":"Can't imagine there being a worst-sung vocal album than this one. Russell Watson's vocalism is quite appalling and neither his voice nor his sorely substandard singing skills are suitable for a commercial recording. He is also no match for other cross-over artists like Bocelli and Frangoulis in terms of style and charm.This is a far from respectable release that should be avoided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably as bad as one can get","review":"After listening to this album, I can help thinking that this is probably as bad as one can get in terms of singing on a commercial recording.The voice of Russell Watson is unattractive and his technique is fallible. His interpretative powers are next to zero and his emotional response is virtually non-existent. No wonder that his performances on this album is so unacceptable.Certainly to worst vocal album I'v heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"From bad to worse","review":"Russell Watson's first album is already quite a bad recording. However, his 2nd album is much worse, for both his voice and his singing have deteriorated markedly. The choice of music is also less good that the first album. I can only give it one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"An example of bad singing","review":"I can't see what purpose such a recording can serve besides providing a vivid example of bad singing. There's no musical worth in the performances, which range from bad to atrocious. I can only show others how not to sing. For this purpose, I can give it one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad singing","review":"What bad singing! I don't think I've ever heard any singing that is as bad as what I hear on this wretched recording by Russell Watson, a singer who has little voice and talent. It is outragoues for such a kind recording to be sold at full price."},{"rating":"1","title":"A shameful recording","review":"What a shameful recording this is! The performances are of such a low standard that the tracks here shouldn't have been released. In fact, Russell Watson shouldn't be singing publicly, except in his bathroom. A complete waste of money. I'll be dispensing with my copy shortly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst possible singing ever committed on disc","review":"Other than the ludricrous recordings of Florence Foster Jenkins, this album must have captured the worst possible singing on disc. None of the tracks give pleasure. The singing is totally bad and the interpretations are contrived and absurd. I really can't stand it."},{"rating":"1","title":"My kids don't like it","review":"I bought this recording for my kids. Unfortunately, they don't like it. They even say that such a kind of singing cannot be tolerated in their high school choir! Well, I initially thought that children would warm to the \\"hip\\" image of Russell Watson and would take less notice of his performance standard. It seems that I was wrong - the singing here seems to be so bad that anyone who has any ear for good music will notice. I must say that I've may a wrong investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watson is too ambitious","review":"With a voice of modest proportions and an elementary singing technique, Russell Watson is definitely too ambitious in tackling such a demanding program. It's small wonder that this album is almost a disaster in artistic terms. Most of the tracks aren't even listenable. I don't think this kind of album is the right sort of recording vehicle for this singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"An album of poor quality","review":"This is plainly an album of poor quality. Not only has Russell Watson a course and untrained voice, his performances are non-stylish, unsubtle and unidiomatic. The orchestral support is mediocre and the recording acoustics is far too overblown. I don't think this is a good recording at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Russell Watson is not","review":"Russell Watson is not a opera singer as he has never sung an opera on the stage and he needs amplification even when performing in small venues.Russell Watson is not a tenor as he needs to transpose his music down.Russell Watson is not a musician as his performance lacks any sense of musicianship.Russell Watson is not even a cross-over artist as he is unable to bring any charm to the music.All of the above can be plainly heard on this recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfactory singing","review":"The singing on this recording is unsatisfactory. It is extremely amateurish and charmless. I just wonder why the recording company saw fit to release it to the public."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deterioration in Waton's singing","review":"This is little doubt that Watson's singing has deteriorated since the release of his first album. Here, the voice has already lost its former quality, and the singing is rough and insensitive. Some of his interpretations are even ludricrous.Not an enjoyable recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"A musical failure","review":"Russell Watson's got a bad voice. Nothing more than that, for his singing skills are rudimentary. A musical failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad singing","review":"I can hear only bad singing on this album. It gives me no pleasure at all. In fact, I'm irritated by the abrasive sounds made by the singer. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"A vocal farce","review":"I have listened to this recording and I consider it to be nothing more than a vocal farce. It is sad to learn that there're no longer any standards in the making of vocal recordings. In the past, such poor singing as one can hear on this album will never pass for public release. Shame to the recording company in allowing such substandard stuff to reach the record store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just what kind of cd is this?","review":"Just what kind of cd is this? The singing is so terrible that it sent shivers down my spine!To put it simply and honestly, Russell Watson is no singer. He can't manage the notes, doesn't have much expression, and is no musician.How can such a novice be called on to perform such demanding music? The result, as can clearly be heard here, is a catastrophe!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a voice!","review":"What a voice Russell Watson has!It is a voice that is narrow in range, limited in vocal colors, inflexible and inexpressive. No wonder that the performances are are so bad. In fact, much of the singing here represents a gross distortion of the music as written.What a terrible voice this singer has!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good at all","review":"I am disappointed by what I hear on this cd. The performances are no good at all. The raspy voice of the singing, and his appalling technique render each track a vocal farce. There're many things which should have been corrected and improved on before the cd is released. This cd is too flawed to be recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"So this is Russell Watson","review":"After all the hype, the only thing I hear on this cd is Russell Watson's hoarse and unmusical performances. How come he has been marketed as the people's tenor? I don't think he would even make it into a decent school choir."},{"rating":"1","title":"From bad to worse","review":"Russell Watson's singing has travelled from bad to worse. At least his first album has some interesting music. Here, nothing is good. The performances are often very bad. I regret buying this recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfactory performances","review":"Russell Watson doesn't have the voice, range, and style for such a kind of music. As a result, he stumbles and falls along the way. Such amateurish singing is pretty shameful when released on a recording sold at full price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Demonstration on how not to sing","review":"The singing on this cd is so bad that the one use I can think of for this cd is to demonstrate to people how not to sing!Russell Watson's narrow and weak voice fail to bring the music to life. On the contrary, it makes painful listening as Watson struggles so often with notes that he can't reach comfortably.I will only give this cd half a star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shouldn't have encored","review":"With the artistic failure of his first recording, The Voice, Russell Watson shouldn't have made this 2nd recording, which is actually worse. There is no improvement in Watson's singing whatsoever, and the performances are even more perfunctory. The music selection is even more uninspired. This is a complete failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a classical singer","review":"Russell Watson is not a classical singer. He needs amplification and all sorts of technology in order to make himself heard, even in small venues. Such a small voice is really not interesting at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"The singing her is gross","review":"The singing here is gross! I can't imagine anything that can be worse. The voice of Russell Watson is not beautiful. He has no technique and he obviously understands nothing about musical style.His performances are boring, uncommunicative and musically hollow. In fact, much of the singing offends the ear! I won't recommend it to anyone.It's just a waste of money that I've bought that worthless album."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad voice","review":"What a bad voice on parade! I am afraid that Mr Watson hasn't even mastered the basics of singing. His voice, of limited range and volume, sounds ill at ease when singing, and he comes to grief in the more strenuous passages. Horrid performances!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Russell Watson sings","review":"And what a terrible singer he is! Watson can't even sustain a note securely to its full measure. Much of the singing her amounts of a form of musical cheating. Listeners are thus unable to appreciate the full beauty of the music, which, in Watson's haphazard delivery, resembles mere tunes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant and versatile","review":"There is plenty of musical substance in this album. I can only see a bright future for this talented man. The singing is brilliant and versatile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed this CD immensely","review":"This recording is excellently produced. The selection of music is imaginative and the performance itself is unbelievable. I enjoy this CD immensely"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstandingly Beautiful","review":"I found this CD to be even better than \\"The Voice\\", if such is possible. The mix of classical/operatic and pop is similar and Watson's amazing voice (or should I say voices?) makes every selection a winner, although I particularly like \\"Va pensiero\\", \\"Che gelida manina\\", the two duets (one with Lulu and one with Lionel Richie)and \\"Ave Maria\\". I gave this CD to two people for Christmas gifts and both of them told me that people who heard them playing it were transfixed and wanted to know who the singer was and where the CD could be purchased. I think this is a good indication of the appeal of this exceptional singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Discovered Watson, other Cds gathering dust","review":"Not only can Russell Watson sing with a strong and wonderful voice but also he can move you to tears. We heard him for the first time many months ago on the old Rosie Show but he was on so briefly we didn't know who he was. It moved us so much that we searched for his CD for a long time not knowing he was from England.As luck would have it, we were watching the Carolyn Rhea show and Russell Watson appeared singing Va pensiero, the same song that we remembered so well. This time we wrote his name down and we found his CD.Much to our surprise, Watson can sing opera, pop tunes, broadway music, rock, everything. We are just thrilled that we have discovered Russell Watson. Unfortunately, we are letting our other favorite Cds gather dust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watson at his best","review":"If you have ever had the privilege of seeing Russell Watson in a concert live you will imagine his facial expressions and movements as only Russell can perform. He is truly one of the best of any male performers in concert.A lot of people forget that he was a live performer long before he became popular with his Voice album. This cd has it all, classical, pop, pop rock, tender and innovative. It is Russell Watson at his best"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great entertainer","review":"Russell will be one of the greatest entertainers to date. His voice is strong and can be used in almost any type of music. Whether breaking your heart with a slow song (\\"You Are So Beautiful\\") or roaring through his version of \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\", Russell is the consummate performer. With his powerful voice singing \\"O sole mio\\" or \\"E lucevan le stelle\\", this CD certainly belongs in any operatic collection. A must for the classical or pop fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Singer of Our Time","review":"This album reflects the adult contemporary music of this time.Russell Watson gives a new interpretation to hits made popular by others such as \\"The Prayer\\" and \\"Volare.\\" The pop voice then takes listeners on a soft-rockstyle tour with \\"Is Nothing Sacred\\" and \\"I Just Don't Know How I Got By.\\" He then crosses over to almost hard-rock with \\"Bohemian Rhapsody.\\"None of these song will likely appeal to the more traditional Watson fans, but again demonstrates that he can do justice to a variety of tunes.Russell Watson is the singer of our time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful CD to have in your collection","review":"A wonderful mix of classical and pop! From the rock-type voice in I Just Don't Know How I Got By to the frolicking Volare and on to the powerful O sole mio.I love the version of Bohemian Rhapsody where Russell Watson's voice goes from a hoarse sounding voice to a real rock-type voice. Then there are the wonderfully sung - Va. Pensiero, Ave Maria, Celeste Aida and much, much more.This is a CD I am delighted to have in my collection. I give it 5-Stars easily!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album anywhere you listen","review":"Whether you listen to this cd in the car, by candlelight, houseworking, or the light of the setting sun, Russell Watson's 16 tracks will delight your ears and warm your heart. This is an album not to be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"My kids don't like it","review":"I played this cd to my kids, hoping to convert them to classical or more serious music. Unfortunately, they don't like it, saying that it's bland and poorly sung! In their view, many of their friends who sing in the choir have a better voice and surer singing skills than Mr Russell Watson. They have no interest to listen to this cd again.If my kids are able to distinguish what's good and bad, I believe that this cd is indeed very bad. In fact, that's my own view, too. However, I thought that Watson's image and approach may do the trick and that kids won't be able to mind those defects in singing.How wrong I've been!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing encore","review":"Compared with Russell Watson's 1st album, this new release has shown a lack of imagination in planning as well as a deterioration in the performance.The choice of music here is much less interesting than in 'The Voice'. The singer appears to be not on top form when recording this cd, for his voice often loses its firmness, especially at the top.In all, a disappointing encore."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dry voice","review":"What a dry voice this singer has! His approach to high notes is so effortful that I find myself feeling quite uncomfortable when listening to this cd.Some people tells me that Russell Watson has a great voice. I haven't listened to his 1st cd. But on this cd \\"Encore\\", I don't find the voice to be any beautiful at all. In any case, the effortful and graceless singing is off-putting."},{"rating":"1","title":"More unsatisfactory that the first album","review":"This \\"Encore\\", which is intended as a real encore to the singer's first album \\"The Voice\\" is quite unsatisfactory. In fact, it's much more unsatisfactory than the earlier album.In the 1st album, the music selection is at least interesting, notwithstanding the substandard performances that they receive from Mr Watson.However, in this 2nd album, the music selection is perfunctory, and the singer's performance has managed to become even worse. I can't imagine a more unsteady voice, a more approximate technique and a more bland delivery than what I heard on this recording.I'm not concerned with how popular this recording may be. I'm only here commented on the performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Singing that is simply bad","review":"It is easy to give a verdict on this CD: The singing is simply bad. Whether the singer, through his image or publicity, is able to attract some fans is not relevant. The singing is simply bad.I don't think any singer who respects his own art and also his listeners would approve such a poorly-sung album for release."},{"rating":"1","title":"an unworthy encore","review":"This album is not worth the wait. It's an unworthy encore as the music is so uninspiringly performed, both by the singer and the orchestra. A very disappointing album in many respects."},{"rating":"1","title":"No match for Bocelli and Safina","review":"Watson is no match for Bocelli and Safina. Beides these 2 real artists, Watson's voice sounds wiry and his singing is almost a caricature. His singing skills are also unformed.Do listen to the most enjoyble albums of Bocelli and Safina and you'll at once notice what things Watson has missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to offer","review":"I found this album having little to offer. In the area of cross-over Josh Groban is a much more honest artist, Bocelli has the better technique, Safina has a stronger voice and Frangoulis is more versatile and has better looks. Russell Watson is no match for these true artists."},{"rating":"2","title":"A glorious voice","review":"This is a great album. Russell Watson has a seamless transition from bottom to middle to top register, shown off to great advantage in all of his operatic selections. Watson's performance of E lucevan le stelle on this CD is second to none. One could almost say the same for his Mattinata recording. And was there ever singing more lush than Russell's You Are So Beautiful or Somewhere? Listen to O sole mio and Che gelida manina, where Russell both descends & ascends with a facility & passion that reveal the moderns - the Three Tenors included. It is wonderful to have a renaissance of classical music so that we may be reminded of what glorious singing is really about, & once was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watson is not just another cross-over singer","review":"This is the album for those of you who thought Russell Watson was just another cross-over artist. He's nothing of the sort, and after hearing this beautiful album, it may cause you to seriously evaluate how good a singer Watson is.Although Watson is a top star in England, he has always been very low-keyed in advertising his cds in the USA, for some unknown reason and it's a shame since he has so much to offer the American public. This album showcases Watson's many wonderful voices and should earn him the respect he has long deserved.It is an album you will listen to over and over again. It is Watson at his best -- singing his heart out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great classical voice, great pop voice","review":"I'm not a particular fan of any of the cross-over singers whoever they may be. Watson, however, has a classical voice that most singers would kill for! If Watson is considered as a cross-over artist, I think he should be re-categorized as his tenor voice is truly in a class with the classical greats and his pop voice belongs with the pop singers unlike the crossover group whose voices tend to be semiclassical.Whatever you call Watson, I was just bowled over by a television performance of his singing \\"Va, pensiero\\", the first track on this album. This song is alone worth the price of the CD. He is singing in his pop voice then suddenly switches to a powerful tenor voice that just stunned me. What follows in the album is just a superb collection of songs and arias sung by a man with the \\"voice\\".If there's room for one Watson album in your collection, try this one. Don't hesitate."},{"rating":"2","title":"CD is worth buying","review":"Everyone loves an underdog and an individual that fights the establishment, and this CD clearly represents Watson's independence from the opera elite.There are some nice performances here, including the first track and especially \\"You Are So Beautiful\\", \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\", and \\"E lucevan le stelle\\", the latter with emotion and power seldom heard.On the strength of his hit single,\\"Is Nothing Sacred\\", alone, this album is is worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watson at his peak, a must have CD","review":"This CD is incredible, the songs are wonderful, and Russell's voice is at its peak. I especially love \\"You Are So Beaufiful\\". It just breaks my heart.I love all of the tracks on this Cd as well, but being an opera buff, prefer the classical songs although Watson's \\"Is Nothing Sacred\\" is a hit single.Consensus, Buy it! A must have CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rap fan loves this CD","review":"This album was a delightful surprise. I'm usually into rap and rhythm and blues music. But, on this CD, Classical, Opera music and pop tunes with wonderful arrangements are done to perfection.Will be enjoyed by anyone who loves pop AND classical standards delivered with spirit.Don't miss it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better listen to Bocelli","review":"Anyone who thinks that this is a good recording should listen to Bocelli, who is far superior as a vocalist. The music is all dead when performed by Watson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all good","review":"Much has been said about Russell Watson. I've now listened to this recording. I have to say I don't like it. The singing is unimaginative and musically vulgar. These are charmless renditions and technically defective performances. One star only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Croaking voices","review":"Russell Watson literally croaks his way through the music. As such, he is unable to do justice to any of the pieces here, be it a classical operatic aria or a pop number. The voice of Russell Watson has shown unmistakable signs of deterioration, and his singing is, as ever, generalised in emotion and unvaried in tone. Listening to this recording is tantamount to having a person screaming at you for an hour at close range. Certainly not a very pleasurable experience, I must say! Russell Watson doesn't know how to interpret music. As a result, this album has little artistic value. I'll give it one star, which is already a very charitable verdict on such a poorly-made album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this recording a joke?","review":"Is this recording a joke?I can't imagine that any serious recording would feature singing that is that bad. In fact, the performances are musically atrocious. It is quite clear, to me at least, that Russell Watson has only got a face but little talent (except in marketing himself through the media). His renditions of the famous songs included here are seriously flawed and grossly sub-standard.Not a recording that one would want to listen to twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"A singer who croaks his way through the music","review":"I have nothing against cross-over recordings. In fact, many of such recordings have given me and my family much pleasure in the past.Unfortunately, this does not apply to this album by Russell Watson. My chief objection is in the singing, which is inadequate. Watson virtually croaks his way through the music, destroying the musical phrase and glossing over things that make such music great. As a result, he destroys the pieces that he sings, presenting them in a way that is only fit for consumption in the karaoke lounge.I don't think I can recommend this album to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak singing and uncommunicative performance","review":"There should be no doubt that the singing on this album is weak. Russell Watson simply doesn't possess the requisite technique to do the music justice. He resorts of simplifications that virtually destroys the music. Even then, his performance is often rough and unmusical.His performance style is, in addition, most uncommunicative. Frankly, I don't recall having hear a more boring singer. Every track here is done almost in the same all-purpose style. Which perhaps shows that the singer, besides having little voice, also has little by way of talent.A most disappointing release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated","review":"This album has been much too over-rated. If we concentrate on the singing, there is practically nothing that Russell Watson can boast about. The voice is of an ordinary quality, the range and volume are small, and it is not flexible enough. There is also no style in the singing - Watson marches through every song in the same unvaried manner. Unless you're a fan of the more boring performance style, I'm sure that such a kind of album can only be viewed as totally unsatisfactory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatly disappointing","review":"I've bought this album and I found it very disappointing indeed. The singing is bad, the choice of music is unimaginative. Other than the packing, this album has little or no artistic merits.A waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this CD","review":"I always thought of Russell Watson as \\"my mom's music\\". I was at my sister's house and she was playing one of Russell's pop songs. I remember after about the 3rd or 4th song I realized I really liked the music, including the classical ones.I went out and bought that CD right away and knew I wanted more. At the recommendation from a very young sale person I purchased \\"Encore\\".I LOVE THIS CD. And now my teenage daughter likes him. I recommend this CD to anyone who is already a fan or is \\"Russell curious\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unlovable album","review":"The singing in this album is so bad and the interpretation of the songs so uninteresting and boring that I can't find anything lovable in this release.I hope record companies can do more to raise the standard of music appreciation. To produce such badly sung album only does music and its listeners a great disservice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Throaty singing gives no pleasure","review":"The standard of singing here is unacceptable. In fact, if anyone in my school choir sings that badly, he or she will certainbly be booted out.The singing of Russell Watson has a very throaty quality which makes in voice production to be extremely rough. Unless one enjoys the perverse, this cd gives no pleasure as a sound document. besides, Russell Watson's interpretation are invariably bad, often worse than bad. In my view, this is quite a terrible album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the 1st one","review":"I don't think this latest release by Russell Watson is as good as the 1st one. The music selection here is less adventurous and I seem to note that Russell Watson's voice has become a bit more strained than before. The singing is also blander. A disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"What amazes is the poor quality of this recording","review":"This recording is exceedingly bad - the singing is just lousy and plain ugly! I have heard a lot of amateur singers singing different kinds of songs. However, I've never heard anyone performing as badly as what I've heard on this recording. The singer, Russell Watson, is plainly unsuitable for the music entrusted to him, and he often makes a mess out of the notes.It is amazing that this kind of poor quality singing can make it to record stores. I don't think I can give it anymore than one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't think of a worst recording","review":"This recording is the worst that I've heard.The singer, Russell Watson, croaks his way through the music. Not only has he failed to respect the score and bring out the many subtleties of the music, he cannot even deliver the notes properly.I'm really put off by such a terrible promotion of bad singing."},{"rating":"1","title":"immature singing","review":"I don't understand why the record company is willing to release such a cd by an immature singer. The singing here is terribly substandard and also unmusical. I am afraid the singer has to learn a few years to singing before he can produce something that is nearer to a decent performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little joy in the singing","review":"Putting aside matters relating to technique, I really don't like Russell Watson's joyless singing. No emotions at all, as if the singer were bored by the music. I don't know if this is the result of a geniune disinterest in the music or that the singer's (lack of) technique and experience have let him down. Anyway, as a consumer, I don't like this recording at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing album","review":"I find this album disappointing, such feeling being aggravated by the many good words that I've read about the singer. I know now that most of them are just hype and have no bearing on the truth.The truth that can be heard on this album is a voice is poor shape and a singer who doesn't even know the basics of good singing. His performances are rough, unformed and lacking in feeling. The standard of the singing is such that listening becomes almost a painful experience for me.If this kind of singing can be termed \\"good\\", I\\"m afraid this world must have already become a very dark place indeed......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleh","review":"The sap evident in the positive reviews of this CD shows that those who enjoy this CD are likely tone-deaf.He is OK. He sings OK. He has OK skill.He is a one-man karaoke wonder.He is sometimes flat.You want to pay your good money for flat cover songs???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grading each component","review":"I'll just grade the various components of this recording:Vocal quality: DSinging Skills: EInterpretation: EMusic selection: DOrchestra: CEngineering: DPresentation: BMarketing: A"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incompetent singing","review":"Many of the songs on this recording is good music. Unfortunately, everything is spoilt by the bad singing of Russell Watson. His clumsy and technically defective performances ruin each and every track. I don't find anything enjoyable here."},{"rating":"1","title":"A musical failure","review":"I'm afraid this album is a failure. None of the tracks is very successful both in terms of singing and interpretation. In many cases, Watson's singing is merely a musical caricature or classical tenor singing. His coarse voice and untrained technique certainly fail to do justice to the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"A one-star recording","review":"Can't reward this recording with more than one star. The singing is absolutely 9th rate. Watson fails to bring any of the songs to life. His performances are boring to the extreme and his vocalism is clumsy and unidiomatic.Poor value for money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete failure","review":"I hope those who enjoy this cd won't be too angry if I say that I consider this cd a complete failure. Of course, different people will have different views on any given thing. However, after listening to this cd a few times, not only do I find it not enjoyable at all, I can also hear lots of flaws in the singing. For example, there are the tremulous tone, the over strident note, the shortness in breath, the colorless voice, the inability to sustain a phrase to its end, the sloppiness in articulation and the failure to respond to words. These are all serious defects which cannot be overlooked. I therefore regard this cd as a complete failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful listening","review":"This really is an album that one should avoid. It makes painful listening as the amateurish singer featured here sings with such a bad technique that every track is a pain to the listener. I derive no enjoyment from this recording whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds too bad for these ears","review":"I must say I'm terribly disappointed by what I heard on this recording. Despite what some others may say, the singing on this recording is, as I found it, very bad. Russell Watson just doesn't have the requisite technique for many of the numbers here and this lack of vocal finesse is not compensated by any interesting interpretation or a deep emotional identification with the songs.Of course, each of us has our own taste and background of music appreciation. Some may indeed consider Russell Watson's voice and singing to be \\"amazing\\". But to my ears, neither voice nor performance is up to standard. You can easily find thousands of recordings in whatever category of music and singing that surpasses what one hears on this recording, whether in terms of beauty of vocal timbre or interpretative insight.It'll only be our own loss if we just cling onto just one recording and singer and say that it/he is the best in the world. How irrational our world will become, then?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bocelli is much better!","review":"As the singing is so substandard in Encore, I think Russell Watson is far less good that Andrea Bocelli, who is a much greater artist.Just listen to Watson's singing. He can't even sing in the correct pitch. How can he be called a tenor if he has to transpose? Bocelli need not do that, and he has sung opera in an opera house without amplification. Watson will never be able to do that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My heart didn't take me here!","review":"I bought this CD for the song \\"Where My Heart Will Take Me\\" and even that was bad! Oh, man! EVERY song on this CD stinks. The only use for this stinker as a chew-toy for a deaf puppy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"karaoke standard","review":"I've bought this CD and am disappointed by it.Much of the singing here is just of karaoke standard. I think many in the karaoke can sing better than the singer featured here, who cannot even hold a note to proper length. He certainly cannot (and does not) do justice to the ambitious program assembled for him by the producer.Not worth getting at full price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bottom of the pile","review":"Of all cross over recording that I've heard, this must be placed at the very bottom of the pile. The singing of here is technically unruly and also charmless. A total disappointment. How come the record company can release such a recording when they're already so much better stuff available in the stores?"},{"rating":"1","title":"No match for Frangoulis","review":"I agree with those who say that Russell Watson is less good than Mario Frangoulis.Frangoulis does have a more beautiful and strong voice than Watson, and his singing skills are much better, too. He is also more handsome and hunky than Watson.Frangoulis, instead of Watson, is the real people's tenor."},{"rating":"1","title":"An affront to the listener's intellect","review":"I find it quite appalling that a record company can give such high profile marketing to such a poorly produced recording! If Mr Watson and his recording company think that ordinary listeners (and especially those who're not well versed with classical music) can make do with such a kind of singing. They're being absolutely wrong!In my view, if one sincerely wishes to convert other people to classical music, one should try to display the best attributes and characteristics of such music such that listeners can be convinced of its merits. Unfortunately, Mr Watson does such a nasty job here that I can either imagine that people be scared away or that they'll be misled into thinking that classical music is like that.The whole project is an affront to the listener's intellect, especially when it is executed in such a bad way. It deserves no mark at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money and effort","review":"I'm afraid that this album isn't worth its value at full price. The singing is just very substandard. In fact, it doesn't even worth to be put on the CD player. Just a waste of time.However, I think it's a mandatory acquisition for anyone who wants to know what bad singing is. Also, it can demonstrate the length that modern studio engineers and producers can go in order to patch up a voice in shreds.Otherwise, buy at your peril."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly sung recording","review":"The singing in this cd is amongst the worst that I've ever encountered. Besides the appalling singing skills, the renditions just do not communicate with the listening. There's no variety in tone and emotions for most of the songs. That makes this cd a very bland and forgettable one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watson loves what he does, SING","review":"This CD truly has Russell Watson at his very best. Hardly a week goes by that I don't listen to it at least once!!! You can tell in his voice that he loves what he does. If you don't already have all these songs, then I strongly recommend that you get this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning! Easily 5 Stars!","review":"A Best seller in England and Australia but often lightly regarded Watson offering in the USA, it is in fact is one of his best. Perhaps Encore never got the publicity it deserves here in the States, which is really unfortunate.I had never been a great fan of classical music until I heard Watson's breathtaking versions. He breaks away from the typical classical singers and crossover singers by have many voices for each particular song. He sings O sole mio in his fine tenor voice, then you hear a rock-style singer singin I Just Don't Know How I Got By, then his beautiful braodway style voice in You Are So Beautiful and Somewhere, then that sensational rock voice in Bohemian Rhapsody.Absolutely stunning!!! A stunning CD by a stunning singer. Easily 5 Stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Russell Watson provides excitement again!","review":"Once again Russell Watson shows us what a fine and versatile performer he is. From the dramatic and emotive strains of 'E lucevan le stelle' to the exuberant rhythm of 'Volare' this CD will appeal to music lovers of any genre. The track entitled 'You Are So Beautiful' is absolutely enchanting.This collection of wide ranging music transports this listener from a rainy day in Portland to a sunny Italy. Wonderful. Not since the Beattles have I been so excited and moved by a singer such as Russell Watson."},{"rating":"2","title":"CD has to be part of your collection","review":"If you're an avid Russell Watson fan or just someone who heard of him, this CD has to be part of your collection. The songs are terrific. The collection of songs showcases Russell Watson's many talents. His sense of direction and energy not only builds to explosive levels but takes you completely away from reality into the world of Russell Watson!You will hear opera, pop, and rock sung by what you would think are 3-4 different singers. As others have said \\"You Are So Beautiful\\" is a heartbreaker, and Russell Watson's version of \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" is incredible. Of course, he sings opera now and then with power and gusto.All in all, a wonderful CD. Can't wait for his next CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Update to my last review","review":"I feel a need to add this bit of information to my review of October 6th. When reading some of other reviews there's no indication of any particular songs they mention listening to. I felt a need to add a statement, if I may.After listening to this fine voice I realize why he had been invited to sing for the three most powerful heads of the world such as: The Queen, President of the United States and the Pope. When practicing to sing for the Pope, Archbishop, John Foley a Vatican official puts it quite clearly, \\"He sings so beautifully, so well, that he here in Italy will probably out do the Italian tenors in what he is able to do, and I really look forward to hearing him this evening.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly produced recording","review":"This recording is poorly produced. The selection of music is unimaginative and the performance itself is far from satisfactory. I don't enjoy it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"No match for Frangoulis and Safina","review":"In the world of cross-over, Russell Watson just can't be compared to those really talented performers like Frangoulis and Safina. Watson's fame is the result of hype. He simply can't sing well. Listen to the recordings of Frangoulis and Safina and you'll at once notice what is lacking in Watson's singing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad singing all the way","review":"I can't understand why some people keep saying that this album is good. In my view, that's probably one of the worst vocal album ever released! The singing is bad all the way. Russell Watson's limited vocal abilities are put to a hard test by the music, and he almost invariably fails every time he is faced with any vocal challenge. I can derive no pleasure at all from listening to this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, No, No","review":"Please, Russell, go back to welding. Or get a teacher and pick songs that fit your strange, pinched voice. I bought this CD since the label on the cover said, \\"This is the CD you've been waiting for!\\" and after one time through it I chucked it out the window of my car. I pity the person who finds it and listens to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly produced album","review":"How come a CD of such poor quality can be released commercially to the general public at such an outrageous price?It should be plainly evident to all that the singing on this album is of unacceptably low quality. None of the tracks here appeals. I cannot think of another album that is as bad as this one.An entirely worthless recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watson can't sing those classical arias","review":"I think Russell Watson and his producers are very foolish to have included operatic arias in this recording project, as Mr. Watson simply does not have the requisite technique and knowledge in performing style to do the music justice. What one can hear on this recording are mere caricatures. This kind of poorly conceived recording projects can do no service to music or record purchasers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worthy of the price","review":"This product is disappointing, and is not worthy of the price.The reason is simple - Russell Watson can't sing. With his coarse voice, limited range and haphazard technique, his performances are bound to be substandard. He is also an unimaginative and uncommunicative singer, too.There is nothing good in this album, which should be sold more fairly be sold at a tenth of its present asking price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor singing","review":"The singing on this cd is poor to the point that I can't help listening to it again. I also can't recommend it to anyone, even for those who have little experience in music appreciation.Russell Watson, on this cd, croaks his way throug the music, often simplified to cater for the low level technique of the singer. It's almost a parody of how the music should ideally be sung."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfy your musical needs with Watson","review":"Think you might like to try some opera? The arias on this disc are fabulous!Watson has a voice similar to Mario Lanza, strong and powerful. A must have for a beginning opera collection for those who want to ease into this unapproachable music. Watson will give you goose-bumps from head to toe, pierce your life's stress-tempered armor, and home straight into your heart with the beautiful arias.He will help you discover how beautiful this music can be. And if it's too much for you in one sitting, he will surely sweep you off your feet with the pop tunes \\"Is Nothing Sacred\\" and \\"You Are So Beautiful\\".Watson will satisfy your musical needs with any kind of song. He is magical!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Russell's voice absolute best, so is the person","review":"I purchased Encore and loved it.I didn't know anything about Russell Watson's generosity in donating proceeds of a single \\"Is Nothing Sacred\\" to Francis House Hospice. I checked Amazon.com to buy the single to make a contribution but couldn't find it so I guess it's being sold only in England.One hears only the scandals about entertainers so it's really nice to know some good things about the stars. Not only is Russell a great singer, but like one reviewer said, a beautiful person. I wholeheartedly agree, except, I thing Russell's voice is the absolute best and so is this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Singing too flawed","review":"The singing on this cd is far too flawed for it to be enjoyable.Russell Watson's voice is of mediocre quality. The dryish timbre is particularly annoying. Unfortunately, his singing technique is even worse, making his performances a trial to the ear.One star."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointed consumer","review":"I've bought this album, and I'm greatly disappointed with it.The singing is simply bad. Not worthy of being released commercially, I think. The performances are boring and unstylish.I regret having bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely unsatisfactory performance","review":"This performances on this cd is extremely unsatisfactory. Russell Watson just can't sing properly. His technique is seriously flawed and his interpretations are uncommunicative. The performances, as a result, are unmusical and boring.This is a cd that will only appeal to []fans of the singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst singing I've ever heard","review":"This cd is quite terrible. The singing here is the worst I've ever heard on a commercial release. Not only is Russell Watson not a classical singer - he is far from able to do justice to the music - his dryish tonal quality and his abysmal singing technique make this recording very unpleasant to the ear.How can such a bad recording can be sold in the market at full price?"},{"rating":"1","title":"An unmitigated disaster","review":"This cd is an unmitigated disaster. A total catastrophe in terms of music performance.The singer, Russell Watson, sings every track badly, and often worse than that. He cannot even shape a phrase properly and his voice frequently turns ugly under pressure. Russell Watson also fails to interpret the songs - he merely sings (or shouts) the notes.I don't think this can be called \\"singing\\" at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unenjoyable singing by amateur singing","review":"There can be no doubt that Russell Watson is an amateur as far as singing is concerned. He cannot yet fully control his voice. As a result, his singing is shaky and he sings without much subtlety.Such a kind of singing naturally gives little joy. I hope the singer can try harder to improve his singing skills before embarking on any new recording projects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassing encore","review":"Russell Watson did create a little stir when he released his first album, The Voice. Quite an amount of people are taken to Watson's easy-going style and glossy image that they've failed to note the many defects in his singing.Now, Watson is releasing his 2nd album, Encore, and we have the chance to focus more on Watson's performance than his image. What one can plainly hear in this recording is very inadequate singing and bland interpretations. I will not add to the embarrassment of the singer and his fans by listing out the many flaws in his vocal utterances. Suffice to say that he cannot even hold a note steadily, and that perhaps already indicates the level of singing one can hear on this recording.Unfortunately, Watson's interpretation is lifeless and without musical interest. While listening to this recording, I can't help wondering if Watson knew what he's actually singing in the studio. All the songs sound the same through his mouth.What an embarrassment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"That's really bad!","review":"I'm terribly disappointed by this cd, which I bought a couple of weeks ago.In my opinion, Russell Watson is a clumsy singer of limited talent. He fails to get the music right. He sings without much differentiation in style and emotion.I also object to the work of the studio engineers. The ambience for this recording is unnatural, with the sound of the orchestra often overblown. I also have a suspicion that the voice of the singer has been artificially bolstered or doctored to make it sound more impressive.This is really a bad recording. I almost want to demand my money back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a geniune singer","review":"Russell Watson has been billed as a tenor or a classical singer. The fact is that he is neither. His restricted top range makes his singing distinctly untenorish and his sloppy singing ( asll well as the lack in amplitude and finesse in vocal emission) proves that he isn't a classical singer in any sense of the word.Much of the singing on this cd is substandard to bad. It's just a waste of money to buy something which can give you almost no pleasure at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Letdown from the first album","review":"Russell Watson needs to stay within his means and not sing more delicate songs like the Ave Maria and O Sole Mio. He lacks the style and nuance to pull these off effectively. His harsh treatment of diction in the delicate moments seriously detracts from the musical integrity. His first album was MUCH better and highly recommended. Not this one"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clumsy singing","review":"Russell Watson just cannot deliver those classical arias at all. For example, his singing of the Verdi arias are so clumsy and unidiomatic that it becomes a parody of the music.This recording cannot be taken seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like it","review":"I don't like this album at all. The singing is clumsy and unmusical. The performances are bland and uninteresting. Just what kind of singer this Russell Watson is, what can ruin the music so completely?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't like it","review":"It's perhaps my personal opinion, but I don't like this album. The singing is unacceptably bad. Don't understand how this cd can be released to the public."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing encore","review":"This encore album is disappointing, for Russell Watson's performances are completely uninspiring. He sings most of the songs in a forced and graceless manner, glossing over the many finer points of interpretation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst cd in my memory","review":"Oh, this is absolutely the worst cd that I've ever listened to!How come singing of such standard can be considered fit for release by a major record label. It shows how steep the standard of singing and music appreciation has declined in recent years.I'm afraid Russell Watson's ugly performances here can only aggravate the problem. He and his recording company are doing no service to music at all.A cd fit for the bin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have worn out playing this CD","review":"Until I saw Russell Watson perform on a PBS special, recently, I didn't know the name Russell Watson. Since i bought this cd i have just about worn it out playing it. What a wonderful voice, Russell has. He reminds me of Mario Lanza, strong and powerful. For this cd the vocals are great and the material is good. I strongly recommend this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst album that I've heard","review":"Russell Watson's 'Encore' is by far the worst album that I've heard. The main reason for my distaste is the singer's appalling singing. He cheats the music of its true power by his inadequate singing. The voice is also no that good. I've borrowed Russell Watson's 1st cd and I found that the singing in this 2nd cd is worse. The quality of voice has also deteriorated. What a bad showing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only the cover is good","review":"I can only find one good thing about this recording - its cover design. As far as the singing is concerned, it is a substandard release. Russell Watson simply doesn't have the right kind of voice to perform the music. The result is embarrassing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor voice, little talent","review":"It is evident that the singer in this cd, Russell Watson, is a singer with a poor voice and little natural talent.Not only is his interpretations stylistically incorrect, he also has to simplify the music to suit his limited vocal abilities.The voice itself is of unremarkable quality, and it also sounds reedy in medium range and strident at the top.Coupled with a faulty technique, the singing is, to be honest, rather unpleasant for most of the duration of this cd.While this cd may satisfy some, musically it is a virtual disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a bore!","review":"I've never listened to a more boring CD!Although Russell Watson does have a voice, his singing is without passion. Very boring and unengaging! Just like the singing of a robot.It is a great pity that Russell Watson has not put his God given voice into better use."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like it","review":"Having listened to this album, I can now say it loud and clear: I don't like it!I don't know Russell Watson personally. He also seems to have a clean image. I'm only therefore commenting on his singing on this album.It is bad. Very bad. His shortness of breath is surprising as many a pop artist can do better than him. (I'm a pop fan.) If he claims to be an opera singer, I'd expect he can do much better.Anyway, this kind of stuff just won't bring me to classical music or opera. No way. It'll require a much better singing to do the trick.In the meantime, I'll just donate off this album. I don't care to listen to it again. Just a waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading impression","review":"Reading the reviews here only confirms my fears about the road Russell Watson is undertaking.Although Russell Watson transposes, simplifies and cut-down on the music, he still represents to the public at large that he's 'the real thing' and is able to do justice to all types of songs, including classical numbers.As a result, many people, especially those who haven't really listened widely, have been misled into thinking that Russell Watson's singing not only is acceptable, but is also amongst 'the best'. Some people has also lowered their standard of appreciation, just for the sake for awarding 5 stars to this singer.In fact, the more 5 star reviews there is (and just look at the superficial and biased way those reviews are), people will be more convinced that Russell Watson is not the real thing. At most, he's a 3rd rate pop singer, who can't do justice to either classical or pop music."},{"rating":"2","title":"My number 1 album this year","review":"Russell Watson brings his magnificent tenor to the lush, expansive orchestral arrangments, and the two compliment each other perfectly. A superb selection of songs showing the trueness of his voice, his ability to transport a melody and (again) his excellent enunciation and wonderful phrasing and breath control.Whether it be his wonderful opening number, \\"Va, pensiero,\\" or the beautiful \\"Ave Maria ,\\" or the tender rendering of \\"You Are So Beautiful,\\" this collection showcases Russell Watson's amazing talents in a grand and memorable fashion. Of particular interest is the altogether exciting alternative version Watson provides for in \\"Bohemian Rhapsody.\\"The lush arrangements, the versatile Russell Watson, and the classical arias all come together to make this my number one album this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can name arias now because of Watson!","review":"I totally ignored Opera or classical music until Russell Watson came along. When opera singers mentioned in these reviews appear on public television, I turned off the channel. But with Watson, I can't help but listen to him and just be amazed at this voice that changes with the song. What a talent!If there are slight defects in his voice, I don't know what they are or care. His singing is great and I give him 5 Stars for what he is doing. His pop songs are sensational, especially \\"Is Nothing Sacred!\\" I really like his \\"Che gelda manina\\" and \\"Celeste Aida.\\" I can't even imagine that I would even be mentioning these arias a few months ago. Watson truly has opened the doors of classical music to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply an excellent album","review":"This is simply an excellent album. Having seen Watson sing on TV in Canada on various programs and hearing he had a CD being released in October, I had to buy it. I wasn't disapointed. It's all here, classical, pop, wonderful orchestral sound, and a brilliant singer. You won't be disappointed with this album"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable, Simply Unbelievable!","review":"Unbelievable, simply unbelievable! When Mr. Watson performed in a televised special last year, I think thousands of people were astounded as I was to hear his incredible voice.I was able to listen to some of his songs on -line via various web sites. Unfortunately, the quality was terrible, but now I have all of his CDs and it is truly mind-boggling.His voice is incredibly rich and full, and most importantly, covers every gamut of song you can think of. If you thing variety is the spice of life, you'll absolutely love Mr. Watson. Just listen to his first 3 tracks and you will know what I mean.Hopefully this 2nd CD will be among many more future albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"In love with wonderful singer!!","review":"In all my years, I have never known a singer with such a range of songs, styles and voices. Yes, voices.He sings every song with a different voice. Better still, is his charismatic and lovable personality that he brings with his singing that few singers have.I am in love with Russell."},{"rating":"2","title":"A vocal wonder","review":"I need only 3 words to describe this album - a vocal wonder. The singing is outstanding. Recommend it highly to everyone"},{"rating":"2","title":"Encore, a great CD, beautiful voice","review":"Listening to this, I just wish some of those composers (Verdi, Puccini, etc.) were alive today, so they can appreciate Russell Watson's beautiful and powerful tenor voice.To say that Watson is the best opera singer in the world would be unfair. After all, he's still young by opera standards. He's no Domingo, but give him a few years and he will be challenging the top tenors.I agree with those reviewers who consider Watson to have a 'beautiful voice'. Watson truly is the peoples tenor. He must have something magical to attract so many fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hit!!","review":"I respect artistic freedom, and people should be encouraged to try out different style. Russell Watson is one of those rare singers who can attempt such ventures, a singer who has something special to deliver and do justice to the project.Russell Watson and his singing here has all of the qualities to attempt something new and exciting. Encore, is a result of Watson's talent. As a result, this CD is a tremendous success and is one of the most entertaining CDs ever. A hit!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most exciting singer I've heard in years","review":"I have no regrets in purchasing this CD and easily can give it 5 stars. It certainly earned this rating. I really hope this wonderful singer goes to top of the charts. He deserves it because he is the most exciting singer I've heard in years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Singer in dire straits","review":"Russell Watson is clearly in dire straits here, for his voice just cannot cope with the music thrusted onto him. I hope he can learn more about singing and be more humble before doing yet another low standard recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncommunicative singing","review":"Russell Watson's singing is so uncommunicative! How can he claim to be a \\"people's tenor\\" when he sings in such a charmless manner?I don't mind any technical defects of Russell Watson which some others claim that he has. But I'm really annoyed when the singing does not care to invest his singing with feeling. Watson doesn't seem to understand what he is singing - he merely produces the sound. Can this be termed good singing? I don't think so."},{"rating":"1","title":"I prefer Frangoulis","review":"Originally, I think Russell Watson is OK as a singer. However, after listening to Mario Frangoulis, I now realise that what Russell Watson can give me is very unsatisfactory. I think Frangoulis is by far the better singer. He is more handsome too! If you listen more to Frangoulis, you will now that the boring singing in this cd, Encore, is just not nice at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Imperfections abound","review":"Having listened to this CD by Russell Watson, I'm amazed by the many vocal imperfections that I can find in it.The list seems to be endless: Poor intonation, narrow voice range, unsteadiness in pitch, poor support, choppy phrasing, inattention to detail, stylistic monotony, narrow dynamic range etc. etc.I do not think that such a kind of singing is good enough for recording. That a major recording company has seen fit to release such substandard material, and that such downright bad singing has won the singer some fans may be indications of how far the standard of singing and music appreciation have declined in recent years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even karaoke","review":"The level of singing in this recording cannot even match the kind of singing that we can hear at the karaoke. Whether singing those classical arias or the more pop tracks, Russell Watson's inadequate singing technique just let him down again and again.Faced with such poor singing skills, no wonder that the studio engineer has to come to his rescue almost at every bar. However, their intrusion sometimes make things even worse, such as that ghastly sonic \\"pull back\\" at the end of \\"Celeste Aida\\". That, surely, is one of the most horrific sounds that I've heard on any recording.Watson's inexperience also shows in his interpretation, which is often lifeless and undifferentiated. That he manages to sell a few records is surely the result of promotion and sheer hype, for there's really little or no substance in this recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good at all","review":"That's no good at all. The singing is unspeakably bad and without any feeling. The acoustics of the recording is quite terrible. The play of the music is unimaginative. Can you think of any vocal recording that is worse than this one? I can't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lifeless performances","review":"There are 2 things which can invest a life into a performance of music, and they're technique and feeling. Alas, both are absent in this recording by Russell Watson. As a result, the performances here are lifeless, uninteresting and technically deficient.I think the characteristics of this recording can also be heard from the very 1st track. Thus, I suggest people listen to this recording first before buying. Otherwise, they may be in for a great disappointment, unless they somehow like this kind of lifeless singing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dry and unappealing voice","review":"Russell Watson's voice is dry and unappealing. As can be heard from his effortful (and ugly) singing in this album, his dimunitive voice lacks both sap and juice. As a result, his singing is abrasive and he often seems to have to squeeze out the notes through his teeth.Such unappealing singing really turns me off! I think most high school students would be able to sing better. What a talentless singer on parade!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wretched singing in a disappointing album","review":"After hearing so much about Russell Watson, this CD comes as a grave disappointment. Not only is Russell Watson's voice of unremarkable quality, much of the singing is, to put it bluntly, wretched. Such bad singing is not helped by the very square delivery and unimaginative interpretation by a singer who evidently still has much to learn.To release an album at this stage when the singer is not ready will do justice to neither the listener or the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like it","review":"I don't like this cd. The singing is no good. The music is not interesting. I don't think I'll like any type of music more after listening to this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vocal caricatures","review":"What one hears in this recording almost amount of vocal caricatures. They performances here are most certainly not properly sung versions of the songs and arias. Instead, they are grotesque imitations which cannot hold up to any sort of scrutiny. There are far too many defects in the singing. One can almost find them in every bar of the vocal line, and this is no exaggeration. I won't deny that some people may enjoy this kind of haphazard melody tracing. But as a document of singing, this is amongst the worst, or perhaps is the worst, that I have ever heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unappealing interpretations","review":"I simply can't see how the interpretations on this recording can be called \\"good\\" or even \\"superb\\". To these ears, not only is the singing here technically below par, the interpretations are all similar with little variety in feeling. Such all-purpose blandness pervades the entire recording. None of the tracks can be said to be well sung or moving.It's a long long time since I heard anything so unstandard and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible singing, charmless performances","review":"My title for this title speaks all. Russell Watson doesn't have a singer's technique. He brawls his way through the music, stumbling from time to time at those technical hurdles.His performances are also charmless and uncommunicative. Maybe he doesn't know what the songs are about.A flat and disappointing release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inadequate performances","review":"In my view, a cross-over album must possess some charm. Unfortunately, this is one of the qualities that Russell Watson doesn't have - his singing is monotonous and rather boring. Maybe he doesn't have the requisite technique to perform these songs, some of which are rather demanding, and, as a result, his quest for musical survival leaves little or no room for him to invest his performances with charm and style. As a result, the performances on this album fall very flat indeed. To be honest, I don't find them to be at all enjoyble."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am now a Watson fan","review":"I had never heard of Russell Watson until I heard Va, pensiero being played at a record store. I guess a rabid Watson fan asked the attendant to play one of the songs from the album. I was sold. I got the album and am enthralled. Yesterday, I got his older Voice album too. I am now a Watson fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Watson","review":"I love Watson's singing style. He can sustain or reach the notes required in the classical songs and he has a pop voice for the pop-rocks ongs. It is an enjoyable experience having to listen to a new singer with such great voices. I thought all the hype surrounding this new singer was to good to be true, but it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Singer!","review":"Indeed this is one great CD that Watson has made. Over the years Watson has shocked the world with his talent and this cd brings out what the true beauty of music is and of how much talent he has.Watson is one of those rare talents that comes along in a blue moon. Fabulous singer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank heaven I was in the record store and heard Watson","review":"The reason I bought this Russell Watson Cd was for the very first track played over the loudspeaker system in a record store. I was simply awe-struck by Watson's voice in this beautiful song, Va, pensiero. It simply is a magnificent song the way Watson sings it.Imagine my surprise when I listened to the rest of this fabulous CD. One surprise after another, i.e, pop, classical, rock, classical etc. Overall, this is an excellent cd for everyone.I am so lucky to have been in the record store when they played Watson's CD. Otherwise, I would have missed out on a spectacular voice and singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top-notch CD","review":"A great starting point for anyone putting together a Watson collection. What a voice -- tender, tough, vulnerable and honest! No wonder Watson's career has skyrocketed in a few short years.Highlights include: \\"Va, pensiero\\", \\"Volare\\", \\"Nothing Sacred\\", \\"O sole mio\\".... Actually, every track on this CD! Many fans consider Russell's current cd \\"Reprise\\" his best because of more emphasis on the classical music. This may be true, but Encore has such a variety of music you will love it. His golden voice is at its peak and the songs he covers, timeless beauties.Overall, \\"Encore\\" is a top-notch collection of music. While Watson's classical fans will no doubt opt for \\"Reprise\\", the casual fans will surely be satisfied with \\"Encore\\". This is, quite simply, one of the best CDs of all time. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inexpressive singing","review":"This cd, which I recently bought, gave me goosebumps. The reason? It is so badly sung that I can't help feeling a shudder every time the singer makes an ugly sound, which, honestly, can be count in the hundreds within the course of this cd.I don't find the singing here expressive, too. In fact, it's plain, boring and lacks emotional variety. Just listen most other singers, whatever the field, and you can usually hear a large range of expression that what one is treated to here on this cd. It might have been a stone singing...That this cd and its predecessor can sell in such amounts denote a decline in the overall standard of music appreciation in our society and that something has gone very wrong with music education in the schools. Nevertheless, it's heartening to see that quite a few have managed to speak their minds (and also the truths and plain facts) about the singing here. Their views certianly sound convincing to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work at all","review":"If Russell Watson is really keen to promote classical music through his singing, he should firstly brush up his singing skills, which is substandard at the moment, as well as try to reveal all the details in the music, rather than simplifying or even dumbing it down, as he is apparantly doing in this recording.I have no doubts that Watson will gain for himself quite a lot of fans. However, instead of guiding them to classical music, Watson will only mislead them into thinking what he does is geniune opera or classical music so that the true essence of the art will be misrepresented and even get lost.For those who that Watson's singing is great, I can only say that once they can grasp the many riches of genuine classical music and operatic singing, your enthusiasm on the genre will increase a thousand fold.So, don't limit yourself to what you're hearing on this album. Or else, you'll be missing out of many far greater things both in music and in life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vocal disaster","review":"A vocal disaster as far the Russell Watson is concerned.None of the tracks are well sung. Many aren't even technically up to par. No competition to all those great classical, pop or cross-over singers.This cd is valueless is terms of music performance.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Singer of little talent and poor voice","review":"Following on the commercial success of his 1st album, Russell Watson has released a 2nd album. Unfortunately, the singer's voice, which sounds unimpressive in the 1st album, appears to have deteriorated by the time he recorded this album. His tone is here often tremulous and dry and the voice is has even less beauty and power than before.It is all the more disappointing that Russell Watson's artistry has no matured to any extent after the release of the 1st album. His performances of the various songs here (in a music selection that is less interesting than that in the 1st album) is boring. Maybe this shows that the singer indeed has little talent in performance. But I still would have expect more emotional variations in the performances.As can be seen from what I've written, this recording is, to me, an utter disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Technically flawed and unstylish singing","review":"Mr Watson may indeed be a wonderful human being (as someone below wrote), but as a music lover I'm only concerned about the quality of the recording which I've bought.I'm afraid I can only award this recording 1 star. Basically, the singing here is technically flawed and without much style. I don't even find the voice of Mr Watson to be that appealing. There are many younger opera singers who can sing much better even without the assistance of amplication and look even better than Mr Watson, which of course isn't relevant. As far as cross-over singers are concerned, I can only say that Mr Watson is around the bottom of the heap...There's much rom for Mr Watson to improve and I hope he'll try to improve instead of producing such kind of albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to standard","review":"As classical singing, what one hears on this album is definitely not up to standard.As far as cross-over albums are concerned, this one is also below par as the performances lack charm.I don't think this kind of sub-standard stuff can be a good and proper introduction to classical music.I'm giving it thumbs down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Russell is a captivating and gifted performer","review":"This CD is a wonderful collection of classical and pop music by a truly gifted performer.Russell's version of \\"Che galida manina\\" and \\"E lucevan le stelle\\" are incredibly dramatic and powerful. \\"Is Nothing Sacred\\" is a very thought provoking song and his singing is so captivating.As is always the case when Russell Watson sings in Italian, the listener does not have to understand the language. He is one performer who can communicate through the emotion of his singing and that comes across on every song on this CD.It is an outstanding collection of some old Italian classics and some more modern songs sung like no one else can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only Russell provides me with an inner joy & happiness","review":"Russell Watson, is a tremendously talented individual who can sing up a storm. That sums it all up. What a great album! It's terrific for people like me who enjoy belting out the songs while we drive down the highway. This album is such fun, You absolutely can't listen to it without a smile on your face. I'm including the opera too. The Classical and cross-over singers can give me pleasure and an artistic sense of enjoyment when I listen to their beautiful voices and songs but only Russell provides me with an inner joy and happiness too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watson gives new twists to all the songs","review":"Such an incredible voice. Being a classical or cross-over singer or what have you, he doesn't get the publicity that he deserves. As the corny old saying goes, Russell Watson could have sung the telephone book and made it sound good.\\"Va, pensiero,\\" \\"Volare,\\" \\"Is Nothing Sacred\\" and \\"Che gelida manina\\" are some of the best songs on this album, but listen to this man sing, even on the lesser stuff. He has pipes that are just a step above so many singers in his field.And I kind of like \\"The Prayer\\" the 4th track Watson does with Lulu. Watson gives it different twist as he does with all of the songs and arias in this outstanding album. It is great compilation of songs by this versatile singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Add this album to your collection","review":"You will not regret adding this one to your collection.The first time I heard this I was a little put off by his powerful, but clean voice since I was use to hearing softer voices from most of the cross-over artists. But as I listened to the opera tracks, Russell sings them the way they should be sung, with power and robustness that goes with opera.Russell really doesn't need any help from the lush orchestral background music which sometimes distract from his exceptional voice. However, Russell transcends that beautifully as he glides effortlessly between English and Italian lyrics and from pop to opera.When you hear the arias, picture yourself outside on a warm moonlit night, hearing this wonderful singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enamored with his voice","review":"The purchase of this CD was an education for me. I, like many others, was not really familiar with Mr. Watson's work. After seeing Watson perform for a brief moment on some TV program, I was enamored with his magnificent voice and wonderful charm.Production quality of the CD is excellent. Watson, of course, is the greatest and this recording does him justice. \\"Ave Maria' alone is worth the price of the CD. Buy this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"His voice will stir your soul and spirit","review":"LISTEN to the voice of this man. This album captures it all and displays his talents in opera and pop. You don't have to understand it all to feel the warmth and passion and sincerity of this entertainer. If you like variety and want your soul to be stirred this will do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous CD","review":"If you haven't listened to \\"Encore,\\" then you must by this CD Now. Watson did a fabulous job.The entire CD is incredible.Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cd's got my vote","review":"I took a chance on purchasing this cd, and the gamble paid off. It definitely converts non-classical music fans like myself to listen to this foreign music. Russell Watson has a voice that definitely does not itimidate or so high brow that it turns you off. He definitely should wear the title of the people's tenor. He's got my vote."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning!","review":"The singing on this cd is absolutely stunning. Every song is a hit.I wonder how other record companies missed out on this fabulous singer. You'll get your moneys worth on this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will fall in love with singer","review":"This album is really exellent. Watson can just about sing anything. I am looking forward to buying more of his albums. Unlike most of the other cross-over singers, Watson has an operatic voice and a pop voice. The cross-over singers, while good, have semi-classical voices that don't fit pop-rock music or your classical arias.After reading the mostly positive reviews here, I decided to give this CD a try. Imagine my delight after I put on this CD to hear myself being enthralled by a beautiful tenor voice, technically excellent singing and wonderful musicianship! All of my family members like it, and they accuse me of listening to nothing else but Watson.I'd urge people to listen to this CD out in record stores before buying it and you too will fall in love with this singer. The few bad reviews are, in my opinion, misleading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A singer of his talent is a rare occurrence","review":"What an exceptional CD. I love it! Russell Watson has become one of my most favorite singers this year. He has so many voices, raspy like, sweet and soft, powerful, smooth, so many and of them mesmerizing.A few of my favorites on this CD are: \\"Is Nothing Sacred\\", Va, pensiero\\", \\"E lucevan le stelle\\", \\"Magic of Love\\", and \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\". This CD is an excellent choice to add to your music collection! A singer of his talent is a rare occurrence."},{"rating":"2","title":"CD is for everyone, will make you happy","review":"Believe me, you don't have to like opera music to love this CD. It is good for everyone, especially if you need some happy days in your life. His \\"Va, pensiero,\\" and \\"Is Nothing Sacred,\\" are incredible. The beautiful \\"You Are So Beautiful\\" is reason enough to buy this CD. But it is the classical music that I enjoy the most - \\"Ave Maria,\\" \\"Volare\\", \\"Che gelida manina,\\" and \\"Mattinata\\", to name a few.His duets that he performs with Lulu and Richie are exquisite and his final \\"Where My Heart Will Take Me\\" will lift your spirits upThis is my second Russell Watson CD, and I am thoroughly delighted! No regrets whatsoever, in fact, consider myself so lucky to have discovered Watson."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unworthy encore...","review":"Artistically, Russell Watson has been unwise in doing this \\"encore\\" disc, for his numerous defects in singing, as revealed in his debut disc \\"the voice' needs a lot of time before they can be properly solved.Unfortunately, the singer has not bothered to solve them before turning out another disc. It's therefore natural that all of those defects continue to plague this new recording. What's more disturbing is that such defects have now become even more apparant, probably owing to the fact that the singer has been over-straining his voice in the meantime. It all makes very unpleasant listening...I sinerely hope that Russell Watson can find a good teacher to improve his intonation, breath control, the matching of vocal registers, as well as to make him aware of the different vocal styles than a singer needs to know before tackling this kind of cross over albums. If not, one can only look forward to his future albums with dread..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bocelli, Groban, Safina and Frangoulis are all better","review":"Having heard Russell Watson's recordings as well as those by Bocelli, Groban, Safina and Frangoulis, I must say that Watson's attempts are the worst in the lot. This cd is therefore far less competitive than those produced by the aforementioned singers, who possess a better voice and a more secure technique.Other than a modern image, Russell Watson's doesn't have much to offer. Certainly not his singing. As there're so many excellent cross-over albums in the market, I don't think Russell Watson will be able to have a long singing career if he keeps on producing such low standard material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Follow-up to Debut CD","review":"I had been looking forward to more opera vocals from Russell Watson since his debut CD. Listening to his beautiful voice is the perfect antidote to rush-hour traffic, but do I want to hear Russell revisit pop tunes from the 1970s? No. Therein lies my complaint with this CD. I bought it expecting more opera, or at least, mostly opera, and this album is mostly revisited pop tunes from times past. More opera next time, please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Off-putting recording","review":"I don't think I'll return to this cd, or to this type of music again, for the recording is so badly presented, and with such plain bad singing, that I don't think I want to listen to any such things again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watson is no Frangoulis, or Bocelli","review":"I've listened to many recent recordings of cross-over singers. I just want to say that Russell Watson cannot match Maria Frangoulis at all. Not only is Watson much less handsome the Frangoulis, his voice and vocal skills are no match for Frangoulis, too.Likewise, Watson is no match for Bocelli, who has an excellent technique. Above all, Bocelli sings with great sincerity while Watson's singing is contrived.In conclusion, Frangoulis and Bocelli are real artists. Watson is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let down by the hype","review":"I've been let down by all that exaggerated hyping surrounding Russell Watson. He definitely is not as great as some would make him. In fact, his singing is quite appalling as he hasn't even grasp the basics of voice production. This album makes painful listening and should never have seen the light of the day.I'm terribly disappointed with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"From bad to worse","review":"The singing of Russell Watson has, I'm afraid, gone from bad to worse.His first album, The Voice, also exposes his many vocal and stylistic defeats. Unfortunately, things declined further in this his 2nd album. Even the quality of his voice has deteriorated markedly.The performances on this album give no pleasure. One star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fed up after listening to it once","review":"I'm greatly annoyed and disappointed by this poorly produced album. The selection of music is wide-ranging and interesting. Unfortunately, the singing here is so inadequate that listening to this album is almost a painful experience.The singer's high notes are unpleasant and under-powered (even when the songs are recorded in the studio), many of the sustained notes are cut off prematurely, presumably because the singer has run out of breath. Vocal ornaments have been glossed over and there is a seriously lack of dynamic variety in the singing.I've already given up this album after listening to it once, for I can't bear subjecting myself to such bad singing again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't give many stars.....","review":"I can't give many stars to this album. Nor does it deserve much.My greatest reservation is in Mr. Watson's singing technique, which is simply very bad. He cannot even hold a note properly and the intonation wavers all the time.Mr. Watson also pays little attention to the feeling of the music as well as the meaning of the lyrics. His performances are very generalised. Very superficial.Not a very enjoyable recording. I can only give it (at most) one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing CD in some ways","review":"I recently bought this CD and I found it pretty amazing, although in a rather negative sort of way.Much of the singing here is substandard. The singer, Russell Watson, doesn't not have a secure technique. As a result, his singing is vocally haphazard to say the least. Since he has to struggle for vocal survival, this doesn't leave much room for interpretation. The natural consequence of this is that the singing is undifferentiated and uniformly bland.Prior to writing this review, I've read some of the recent comments by listeners. I'm so amazed that some people can go to such length in praising the singer as to totally mis-represent what one can hear on this CD.That's why I consider this an amazing CD, even though it has little artistic or musical value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shouldnl't be encoring","review":"I don't think Russell Watson should release this album as a sort of \\"encore\\". His performances on his first album is extremely bad and his performances here are even worse! It is clear that the singer and his recording company are merely trying to capitalize on Watson's undeserve fame without paying much attention to artistic standards. This is a very bad attitude for music production."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad encore","review":"What bad singing this album contains!None of the tracks here is up to standard. The singer's immense vocal flaws are plainly evident in almost every phrase that he does. Flat high notes, chopped up phrases, glossed over details and incorrect style etc. etc.An almost totally worthless album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly performed album","review":"I'd have liked this album more had the performance here been better, for the music is indeed interesting.However, the singer on this album, Russell Watson, ruined everything by giving us performances that are totally not up to standard. The singing can even be said to be ugly and unmusical. The performances here are so bad that I found it impossible to enjoy this recording at all.I won't recommend it to anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unworthy effort","review":"I don't think this album should be released at full price.The singing is definitely bad. The singer is unable to grasp the difference in musical styles between the different numbers. It is a total disappointment.Such substandard stuff doesn't deserve to be sold at such a price. Or at any price."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a terrible encore","review":"With such a hoarse voice, bad technique and lack of talent, it is utterly surprising that Russell Watson can release another recording. But maybe he does have some fans, who merely hanker after his looks. Yet, as vocal performances, what one hears on this recording is just terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"As bad as it gets","review":"Can't imagine a worse recording than this poorly sung and unimaginatively performed album. None of the tracks here are vocally up to standard. Some of the singing is indeed painfully ugly. As the singer uses the same kind of vocal style when performing the different types of songs, his singing is uncommunicative to the extreme. It's horrifying that such a kind of recording can be released at all.Black marks for both the singer, his producer and record company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely hellish singing","review":"Can't imagine a more poorly performed vocal album.Russell Watson doesn't have a voice. He certainly has no technique. Style is alien to him. Charm he has little.A totally worthless album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't kindle any enthusiasm","review":"With such bad singing, I just can't understand who such an album can kindle any enthusiasm on the part of anyone, especially those who some idea of good singing. It's really a bad production that is unappealing to the extreme. Can't be recommended at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible encore","review":"One usually encounters an encore when an performer has given an excellent performance and that the audience demands an encore.Here, despite his making a greatly substandard first album, the singer, Russell Watson, has made a second album which proves to be even worse. The standard of singing here is simply unacceptable.There shouldn't be such an encore in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unplesant encore","review":"Wow, the singing here is very bad!How come such poor recording can be released? I think the record company should at least insist upon the singer re-recording the majority of the tracks here! Better still to find another singer to go this recording.I can't recommend this recording to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great voices for different songs","review":"This is the ultimate collection for any music lover. Those who never thought about buying a Russell Watson Album/CD should try this one. This CD shows you a range of songs from opera to semi-classical to popular music to pop-rock.With a different voice for each genre of music, this is what sets Russell apart from many singers of yesterday and today and he is even better singing LIVE. With today's technology most can't sing except in a studio full of bells and whistles. Take a listen and FEEL the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watson is at the top of our list of classical singers","review":"I've purchased all of Russell Watson music, including 3 copies of the different Encore versions. When our friends visit us they think the only singer we know is Russell Watson because his CD is played the most at our house!We love his clean, pure and tremendous voice. I have been a classical music fan for many, many years. We have Cd's of every classical singer you can name but when Watson came on the scene, he just captivated us with his charm, voice, and a warmth you do not see with most singers in this field.When we saw his Atlantic City concert a couple of years ago, that performance solidified our belief of his talent and down-to-earth presence. Although we do listen to the other great classical tenors, baritones, and sopranos, Watson is at the top of our list."},{"rating":"2","title":"CD means a lot to me","review":"I first bought this album after witnessing his superb New Zealand concert on PBS. The concert moved me so much, I had to rush out and buy this CD and went right to the head of my list of desert island disks.It has never moved from that position, and the more I listen to it, the more it has meant to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new fan of Watson","review":"I had heard about Russell Watson but didn't know where to start with his music until I stumbled across this CD. It was my first Watson CD, but it certainly won't be my last!Encore serves as the perfect introduction to this versatile, talented singer because it's full of dazzling classical and pop songs that are enjoyable to listen to. In fact, you will be hooked after just hearing the opening phrase of the first song, Va pensiero.The cd is a perfect mix of classical arias, pop tunes, rock and broadway. I enjoy listening to this CD, especially while driving, or any time I need something to perk up my spirits.I'm no Watson expert, but thanks to this CD I'm rapidly becoming a fan. If you'd like to experience one of the newest, most memorable singers, pick up this CD now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watson at his best","review":"This is simply Russell Watson at his best. The music makes you feel like you've been transported to Italy on some tracks and to space in another. Even if you're not a big Watson fan, this collection would only delight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Sacred indeed","review":"Just listen to the first bars of Volare using your Real Audio Player. This has got to be THE ugliest sound ever to be captured on record. Even Florence Foster Jenkins' efforts pale in comparison.The sad part, however, is allowing great composers' names to appear on this disc. They must be rolling in their graves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doing a disservice to music","review":"This sort of album is doing a grave disservice to music. A friend of mine has bought this album, hoping that it'll convert her 2 kids to classical music. Unfortunately, the singing on this recording is so bad that not only aren't the kids impressed by it, they said that any curiosity they have on this type of music were snuffed out after hearing such poor performances.But that can only be expected, for Russell Watson isn't a classical singer and his singing technique is woefully inadequate. But to release such a kind of album, and to make such inflatory claims about it, is doing a grave disservice to music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outrageously bad","review":"I found the quality of this album to be outrageously bad. It is totally irresponsible of both singer and record company to release such a hugely substandard album, which probably can only fool those who have little or no experience in the appreciation of vocal music. Such an attitude is, honestly, despicable. I won't recommend this album to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put off by bad singing","review":"No matter what kind of effect Russell Watson and his record company seek to achieve, they have failed miserably on matters of music for the performances on this album is very bad. I don't think anyone, be they pop or classical music lovers, would find the incompetent performances here to be truly enjoyable.This is an album which will only put people off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantastically bad!","review":"This album is bad, fantastically so!I can't imagine any singer to be able to get a major recording contract when he sings so very poorly. Russell Watson is certainly a phenomenon, as he is not only able to do so, but is also able to amass quite a number of fans through commercial hyping.This is really a most unsatisfactory release, and one that doesn't deserve to be issued."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't compre with Bocelli","review":"Russell Watson can't hold a candle to Andrea Bocelli. The singing of the former lacks technique, grace, charm and style, qualities which one can find in abundance in the singing (and cds) of the latter.As such, this album gives poor value for money as there're lots of better things on offer in the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watson misses the mark","review":"Russell Watson has missed the mark again. Unable to learn from his mistakes in The Voice, the singer has again attempted to perform music that is beyond his reach. Just listen to \\"Che gelida manina\\" and you're hear some of the most labored singing ever committed to record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far less good that the 1st album","review":"I found this 2nd album of Russell Watson to be far less good than the first one. The music here is less interesting and the performance of the singer is not that good. Is Russell Watson so satisfied with his success that he cares less about production standards?"},{"rating":"2","title":"VOICE was great, ENCORE even better","review":"Like a fine wine, the phenomenon that is Russell Watson becomes better with time and with grace and has never sounded better. With the stunning first debut of the VOICE, Decca has produced Encore, and this CD is again at the top.While the VOICE had a great collection of songs, the tracks on this CD make this a true value. While the classics like \\"O Sole Mio\\", \\"Mattinata\\", \\"Che gelida manina\\", and others continue to remain his mainstay, this CD has showcased Watson's wonderful versatility in some terrific pop-rock tracks such as \\"Is Nothing Sacred\\", \\"I Just Don't Know How I Got By\\", and \\"Where My Heart Will Take Me\\". Pop-rock has never been sung any better.In the wake of this successful CD, Watson continues to open the doors of classical music to the public with an excellent packaging of classical and pop-rock tunes. Purchase this Cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"A compromise that doesn't work","review":"This is in many ways a disappointing release. In trying to show that Russell Watson is a versatile singer, his record company has ambitiously created for him a very taxing program. Of course, no one is expected to encompass all musical genres with ease and compromises in the singing can only be expected. However, Russell Watson has done less well than expected even when one bears in mind the nature of this project. He not only isn't able to provide any modicum of the diverse musical styles required by the songs, he also sounds uncomfortable in many of the more demanding songs and arias. As a result, this project cannot be called a success. For the ordinary listener, this release also makes quite uncomfortable listening too. I don't think this kind of recording project can do any service to the music, or the singer for that matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't cope with the music","review":"This album is really unsatisfactory as the singer just can't cope with the music.On the face of it, this is a cross-over album which aims for the mass market. Unfortunately, the selected music, be it pop or classical, proves to be far too difficult for the singer, who grapples unsuccessfully with the notes and can reveal little emotion in his singing.The orchestral arrangements are not very well played and the acoustics often sound overblown and unnatural, which makes this recording rather uncomfortable in terms of sound.I can only give it 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"No way!","review":"This album just can't do. The performances range from bad to terrible. Russell Watson has no technique and little interpretive talent, and he makes a mess out of the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"An extraordinary album","review":"I find this an extraordinary album, although, regrettably, the word is not used in a complementary sense.I find this extraordinary because the record company, the producers, the singers and some of the singer's loyal fans don't even realise how bad the singing is in this album and how utterly unstylish the performances are.It is quite unbelievable that an album of such standard can reach the record stores. Maybe these are the times. But as a person who enjoys good singing, I must resist any hype and give this album it's due worth - One Star."},{"rating":"1","title":"No match for Mario Frangoulis","review":"Somebody wrote that Russell Watson is no match for Andrea Bocelli. I agree.However, I think Mr Watson's shortcomings are highlighted even more when compared with the wonderful Mario Frangoulis. Mr Frangoulis has a much more beautiful voice and superb singing technique. He looks much more handsome than the uninspiring Watson too."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened here","review":"While I enjoyed his first album immensely, I was wondering what happened here. His voice and technique actually deteriorated from his first album. And his \\"opera voice\\" now sounds as though he was singing with his tongue hanging out of his mouth... terribly annoying. The only song I enjoyed as Va Pensiero and other compositions are just...annoying. The other duelist in the Prayer is just bad. Compared to Safina and Bocelli, this album doesn't stand a chance. If its not for Va Pensiero, I would have given this album a 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"All hype and no substance","review":"There is little substance about this recording. The singing is bad, and the performances are charmless. What exists is merely empty hype surrounding the singer, who now has a reputation that his poor vocals doesn't deserve. What a disappointing album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like it","review":"The singing on this cd is absolutely awful. The singer cannot even hold a note properly. I don't like it at all. It's not very honourable of any record company charge such a price for this kind of badly produced album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply not good enough","review":"Watson's singing isn't good enough for the songs contained in this cd. His voice is too hoarse and constricted for those operatic arias. Makes unpleasant listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stunningly bad!","review":"I was stunned after listening to this recording. How can a commerical recording be so bad? I'm referring to the singing of Mr Watson. He has a weak voice of limited range. He can't sing the notes accurately. He has no sense of style.I think what Mr Watson can do is only to teach people how NOT to sing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I heard much hype about Russell Watson. Bought this cd and found it totally disappointing. That level of singing can't even be accepted in any decent school or church choir. How come such a cd can be retailed at full price? Quite outrageous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"inadequate singing with little passion","review":"There shouldn't be any dispute as to the merits of Russell Watson as a singer. His many vocal flaws have been documented in his 2 albums, including this latest one. Unless one enjoys bad singing, one can easily hear the many defects and inadequacies in Watson's performances.There is also little passion in the singing. Watson merely belts out the notes without investing them, or the words, with much feeling. It's actually worse than karaoke singing as many people put in more feeling when singing at the karaoke.This album therefore represents poor value for money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Substandard","review":"Are there now any standards in the production of recordings? If there are, how come that this abysmally bad recording got to be released? The singing on this recording is simply terrible! Many more talented children in junior high school choirs can sing infinitely better than the singer featured here. I'm pretty aghast at such substandard stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No match for Bocelli","review":"The singing here is no match for the much finer achievements of Andrea Bocelli. In my view, Bocelli has a more beautiful voice, a more secure technique and a much better musicianship. The Italian also sings with a heart. Russell Watson just can't hold a candle to him in the cross-over repertoire. This cd is therefore not competitive at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than bad","review":"Frankly, I would have liked to award this CD no star had it been possible! The singing here is unspeakably bad and the orchestral parts are indifferently played.I won't judge Mr Watson by using the criteria applicable to classical tenors, for Mr Watson doesn't belong to that category. However, as a cross-over artist, he still fails miserably as he lacks artistry and even a decent voice.In the cross-over repertory, Andrea Bocelli has a better technique, Alessandro Safina has a stronger voice, Groban is a more communicative artist, Mario Frangoulis has more handsome looks, Charlotte Churh has more innocence and charm and Opera Babes are far more innovative. By contrast, Russell Watson has little to offer no matter in what aspect.What a miserable failure this recording is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Multitalented singer provides moving experience","review":"This is a masterpiece. Especially great are the recordings, \\"Mattinata\\", \\"You Are So Beautiful\\", and \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\". Russell's vocals are strong and exciting and provide such a moving experience. This can be said for ALL the songs. This is truly a multitalented man."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a voice!","review":"What a voice! I couldn't imagine that such a flawed instrument can be invited into the recording studio!More seriously, the untrained voice of Russell Watson can give little pleasure. With his haphazard singing skill, the recording is not worth listening to. I've, unfortunately, listened to it and I must say that it is one of the worst, or perhaps the worst, recording that I've ever encountered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanton disregard of the rules of good singing","review":"This album is appalling in the sense that the singer, Russell Watson, has watonly disregarded almost all the rules of good singing AND then represents that his kind of singing is good and preferable to those who can singing 100 times better than him even in their bathrooms.Russell Watson's croaky, dimunitive, strained and dry voice is already a trial to the ears. Unfortunately, his insecure, clumsy, unemotional and defect ridden singing succeeds in driving away whatever pleasure that remains in the music.Never have I heard such a poor sung album. Never have I chanced upon such a bad singer. Buy this album at your peril. (Or you can listen to it first, when the above will immediately be apparant after a few bars of singing.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally disappointing","review":"This recording is totally disappointing. Rusell Watson's singing is technically unassured and he appears to be unaware of the different stylistic demands of the pieces that he sings. Such perfunctory singing and performance attitude is to be deplored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Voiceless encore","review":"How baffling that a voiceless singing can have the chance to release a 2nd album where many much more talented singers are swept to the side-lines! I just shows how deplorable the state of affairs has become in the music industry.I find nothing to recommend in this album. Just listen to it, any track, and you'll find a voiceless singer trying desperately to sing songs that he cannot cope with. Unless one enjoy such a kind of labored singing, this album can bring no pleasure. Besides, such poor singing should never be imitated by anyone, unless one wants to lose one's voice after a few years.One star, at most."},{"rating":"1","title":"A recording of little or no merit","review":"Russell Watson often calls himself the \\"people's singer\\". However, does he mean that by bringing classical music to a wider audience, he can neglect the standard of his singing or that he can present the public with substandard recordings by assuming that the public would not notice his defects?I'm greatly offended by such artistic hypocrisy! If Mr Watson sincerely and genuinely wishes to promote classical music amongst the masses, he should try to present the music in its best light rather than simplifying, distorting and dismembering the music so that much of its artistic and musical value got lost as a result. Not only is Mr Watson doing a grave injustice to the music, he is also belittling his listeners in thinking that they do not deserve the best.Consequently, this recording has little or no merit whether as a record of singing or as a means for the promotion of classical music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Singing worst than most choir boys","review":"I wonder if people realise that the singing on this CD is worse than that of most choir boys. It appears that the singer here, Russell Watson, is incapable of singing well in even the simplest of phrases. Needless to say, he stumbles embarrassingly in the more strenuous passages.Another complaint is that his singing has little communicative power. The reason for this is that he doesn't seem to know what the music and the lyrics are about. As a result, he sings in a boring manner, giving each song the same generalized feeling.There's no question that Decca is marketing Russell Watson very well, and there're always some fans who would praise him to the skies. But if one purely talk about music and singing, this album has definitely failed to make the grade.A total disappointment (and a musical disaster)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't think of a worst album","review":"This album is really terrible - the performance by Russell Watson has little charm and is technically atrocious. Honestly I really can't think of a worse album that I've listened to.I think Mr Watson should take some vocal lessons before going into the recording studio again. Otherwise, it's being irresponsible to the record purchasing public.I would award this album zero star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored by this recording","review":"I don't think this recording is good at all. I've put it one for a few times and but I can't discover much merit in it. On the contrary, I'm bored by the singing, which gives one neither surprises nor inspiration. The only good thing about this recording is its packaging, but this hardly counts.No, I don't like it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninteresting performances","review":"What uninteresting performances there are on this CD!None, yes, none of the tracks can be called satisfactory from a vocal point of view. Much of the vocal lines are distorted, squeezed and chopped up under the crude hands (voice) of Mr Russell Watson. The entire CD gives me no pleasure at all!I hope Mr Russell Watson can learn the sing better before rushing to release yet another CD. Or else, it would amount to an extreme disrespect for his fans.But honestly, after listening to such a terrible CD, I have little interest to buy another CD by this singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't be without this CD","review":"This is CD truly represents the talent that Watson has.No one who even thinks he might like Watson should be without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect CD, have all versions of it!","review":"My boy-friend bought this album for me last week because it contained my favorite Russell Watson song: Va, pensiero. I also purchased the New Zealand version and have recently began playing it when my boy-friend and I are enjoying a quiet dinner or just relaxing.Candles, moonlight, the stars, and Russell -- it doesn't get better than that"},{"rating":"2","title":"A CD that is blissfully enchanting","review":"Beyond possessing a tremendous voice, Russell Watson's great triumph was to invest in every song -- nay, every note -- a breath-taking depth of emotion. Never artificial or overwrought, it is evident in Watson's singing that he is feeling every word. This sincerity and passion, combined with his amazing technical ability, form a shimmering alchemy which more often then not leaves me entirely overwhelmed.This CD contains several superb examples of this alchemy, including \\"Che gelida manina\\" from La Boheme, and the electrifying \\"E lucevan le stelle\\" from Tosca. Listening to the latter, I found myself literally gripping my seat, exhilarated. Opera truly lives when it is felt as well as sung, and anyone who understands this will find find this CD blissfully enchanting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watson is extraordinary","review":"I agree with everything that has been said about this album. It is one of the finest collection of classical and pop songs that I have ever heard, and Russell Watson's singing is extraordinary. I particularly loved Ave Maria and O sole mio, though the entire album is wonderful.I wouldn't let the lesser pop tracks deter you classical fans from buying this album. They certainly make an odd coupling with the classical tracks but still, that's Watson's attraction, and anyone who loves the tenor voice will not want to be without this classic album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watson's music is exciting and comforting","review":"I have been listening to Russell Watson for 2 years now and continue to find his music exciting and comforting. I find his voice is unique and distinctive unlike any other classical or cross-over singer. There are thousands of pop singers so his pop \\"voices\\" can be on par with the likes of the very best.As a teacher of the English language, I find Russell 's phrasing and enunciation-impeccably clear and easy to understand. His Italian may be wanting but, with practice, he will improve. This is a collection that will be with you all your life and that you will grow to appreciate and be comforted each time you listen to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"16 great tracks","review":"This is a great collection of diverse songs from the very talented Russell Watson. Guaranteed to make your day a good one are \\"Volare\\", \\"You Are So Beautiful\\", and \\"Where My Heart Will Take Me\\". Watson can sing each song in a voice that is perfect, whether it be opera, semi-classical, pop, or near rock.Simply a dazzling singer that you just have to appreciate. Sixteen great tracks that will brighten your day...Enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings joy to his singing in every song","review":"I loved Russell Watson when he appeared in Atlantic City a year ago. The songs he sang on the show were utterly wonderful. I wanted to experience those songs again.I did partially with the VOICE and now with Encore. But I do enjoy this album even more than the VOICE. My only disappointment is I wish he recorded Nessun Dorma again for Encore. He sang it so beautifully at the Atlantic City concert.But, we can't have everything...It is such a joy to enjoy the passion he can put into his singing in every song"},{"rating":"2","title":"Every song is my favorite","review":"This CD, like the VOICE, is a fascinating album and the first thing that was immediately obvious was how much Mr. Watson's voice has improved and to my delight, new voices have been added. As usual his deep feelings are apparent, and the selection of songs is very good.I especially liked Va. Pensiero, Is Nothing Sacred, Mattinata, You Are So Beautiful, Che gelida manina.....well I won't go on because I really can't pick a favorite....every song is my favorite..."},{"rating":"2","title":"No singer like him today!","review":"I've loved Russell Watson ever since his first appearance in the US at the Atlantic City Concert. He was a smash hit!His voice is still as wonderful as ever. I was hoping that he would release some of the songs from the show, but this is even better than expected. In fact, he now has come up with a new, terrific rock voice singing \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" and \\"I Just Don't Know How I Got By\\".Watson is just fabulous! There is no singer like him today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Any music fan will love this album","review":"I have a large collection of music(country,pop,and rock) which continues to grow as I try to appreciate different types.I was introduced to Russell Watson when I saw his performance awhile back on a Bravo show featuring England's top pop and rock singers singing broadway melodies.When Watson sang his amazing voice blew me away so I had to get one of his Cds. I purchased Encore.He is brilliant on the pop-rock selections (Is Nothing Sacred, Bohemian Rhapsody) but he has also introduced me to the classics which I have never been interested in. Watson has a spectacular voice for the classical arias and then switches to a pop-rock voice for his pop tunes.Any music fan will not be disappointed with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watson's voice will be eternal","review":"Russell Watson has one of the most pleasant and likeable voices that will remain eternal. He has showed the world that he could sing. He then showed us all that he is an outstanding if not one of the best concert performers existing today. He has a personality that personifies the good times in life as well as those times of reflection.As his voice continues to reach the pinnacle of wisdom and maturity his songs will give us more good times interwoven with the bittersweet His voice reflects the realization that we should savor those moments and remember them fondly as we hear on this CD. His Encore and all of his recordings will remain timely forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like it","review":"I'm not a fan of classical music. I a fan of pop. I only wanna say that I don't like this cd. The singing here is awful. No feeling, just coarse shouting all the time. The singing can learn a lot of pop singers in terms of feeling and maybe even technique. Fit for the bin!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't compete with Bocelli and Frangoulis","review":"Just listen to this cd, and hear how poorly and boringly sung it is! Whether in terms of voice, singing skills and emotional commitment, Russell Watson can in no way match the genuine artistry of real singers like Andrea Bocelli and Mario Frangoulis. I don't think I'll want to buy any more cds from Russell Watson again."},{"rating":"1","title":"An album of low standard","review":"This certainly is an album of low standard.In terms of selection of music, the contents of this album prove to be quite unimaginative.The singing is the biggest weakest here, with the singer, Russell Watson, being unable to sing properly even the easiest song in this album.I also don't like the orchestral playing, which sounds all too overblown and unsubtle.The album is not a very enjoyable one, I'm afraid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking in finesse and style","review":"I've read that some people say that Russell Watson has a 'broad range' just because he has attempted many different kinds of songs in his albums. But have they considered that Watson, whose singing lacks finesse and style, fails in most of the song types? I don't think one can be called a singer of 'broad range' by merely attempt different kind of things. He must do them (or most of them) well before he can achieve true versatility. Otherwise, I croaking singing can also call himself versatile by singing (abysmally) the songs in this album. Be rational. Do have some minimum standard, please.In my view, the singing here is not acceptable at all. Indeed, it often amounts to an embarrassing revelation of the singer's many shortcomings. A parody of music this recording can only be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a joke?","review":"Is this a joke?The singing here is just laughable! I and my family found it extraordinarily funny. I originally expected it to be a serious album. But listening to this singer groping around at the notes and failing to sustain a phrase just makes me cringe!I'll award it 5 stars for fun, but to be serious, it can only get 1 star as for artistic quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommend anything Watson does","review":"Russell Watson has always been scorned by the classical music critics and immensely loved by his fans. While he is rapidly approaching the greatness of the 3 tenors, he is breaking new musical grounds on everything he does because Mr. Russell has a great ear for a melody and his music is always finely crafted.But most of all, his music is magnificently enjoyable. How can you not enjoy something as beautiful as \\"You Are So Beautiful\\", touching as \\"Is Nothing Sacred\\", and happy as \\"Mattinata\\".This a typical Russell Cd. Great! I fully recommend \\"Encore\\" by Russell Watson and any other album of his."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music is fresh, innovative, and never boring","review":"I must admit that I originally thought Russell Watson was heading in the wrong direction with this album, leaning toward pop tunes with a rock style. Especially, coming after his Voice album. We tend to prefer classical music. My wife and I saw him in concert on his recent visit to Ohio.But we were mistaken..his interpretations and arrangements of -Is Nothing Sacred, I Just don't Know How I Got By, and Where My Heart Will Take Me are absolutely phenomenal. My wife, who is a big fan of Pavarotti and Groban, can't stop listening to \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\". We, of course, especially enjoy his wonderful vocals on all of the classical arias.We both have now learned to trust Russell Watson's expansion into the uncharted musical waters. This album has allowed Russell Watson to keep his recorded material fresh, innovative and never boring. I highly recommend this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleep inducing","review":"I almost fell asleep when listening to this boring album. I don't like classical music and therefore whether or not Watson sings in a classical manner I don't care. However, his monotonous and uninspiring singing really puts me off. Is there nothing better that record companies can give us these days? Fortunately, this is just a borrowed album, for I just won't spend a dollar on such boring stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"This can only be a joke","review":"This can only be a joke. The recording is so poorly made that it cannot be intended as a serious music release. In particular, the singing on this recording is terrible. I've never heard any recorded artist make such a terrifying and nightmare-inducing sounds! The effect may be very comical. But as a serious music release, it just won't do."},{"rating":"1","title":"puzzling","review":"I bought Russell Watson's debut album and thought it was quite decent. It seems that for this album, Mr. Watson degraded his singing potential level as well as the selection of songs. He has a powerful voice for opera but his voice doesn't quite match the \\"pop\\" genre. I think Russell sings well but is mixing too much with his musical selection. Personally, I hope that his next major release would contain more opera pieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"From bad to worse","review":"This isn't a cd to be recommended as the singing is very substandard.The performance of Russell Waton seems to have gone from bad to worse, as judged from his 2 recordings. There's almost no technique and the sounds that he makes are quite terrifying. Nor has his singing any charm.One of the worst recordings that I've heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cross-over joke","review":"I consider this album a cross-over joke.In trying to show his versatility, Russell Watson takes on music with a wide range of styles. Unfortunately, he sings them with just one single style. Not only is his singing unidiomatic, this is not even cross-over as Russell Watson just fails to cross-over the different musical styles - he remains resolutely on the same inch of ground all through.A boring album and a musical failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unworthy encore","review":"Russell Watson has given us an unworthy successor to his first album. Whereas that first recording boasts an imaginative choice of music and some sturdy singing, this new release is much more unimaginative in its production. Worse, Russell Watson's singing has greatly deteriorated and he is merely a shadow of his former self.I think that if the singer is in poor voice, the record company should wait until he has recovered until getting him into the studio. Artistic excellence should always take precedence to commerical considerations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored by this recording","review":"I regret having bought this recording for I'm bored by it. The singing is uncommunicative and unimaginative. Sometimes, the singing voice even becomes strident.All my friends also don't think very higher of this recording. Some, in particular those who're good at singing, consider the singing here to be ridiculously substandard. A few said that the singer has unwittingly revealed his own shortcomings by attempting a program that is beyond his reach.Anyway, it's to me one of the most boring recordings that I've listened to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy singing","review":"Russell Watson may have a \\"face\\". Yet, he is woefully inadequate as a singer, for the singer on this recording is simply lousy and ungraceful.This recording represents poor value for money as it is sold at full price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake and ghastly singing","review":"This cd is quite terrible. The singing is unable to do justice to the music. Indeed, his singing is plain bad, whether in terms of technique or emotion.Just listen to the end of 'Celeste Aida'. Hear what ghastly sounds the singer produces at the end. He obviously cannot soften the tone and there has to rely on the studio engineers to pull his voice away. Unfortunately, the effect is creepy. It also exposes the singer's lack of proper singing skills.I consider such engineered singing to be fake and unworthy of listening. I'm actually deeply offended by such poor singing when listening to this cd. If the singer requires so much electronic assistance, we might as well buy as cd sung by a robot!A totally disgraceful release!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad singing","review":"The singing of Russell Watson is simply bad. I listened to this cd twice and have no further intention to play it. Nothing interesting, nothing enjoyable. What a disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Undeserved encore","review":"Given the poor singing exhibited by Russell Watson in his debut album, it's unworthy of him giving any encore. Surprisingly, he and his record company have thought it fit to produce another album, one that is even worse than the first one. The singing is substandard and there's practically no interpretation at all by Watson. Not only is this album no art, it isn't even music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A one star recording","review":"With such poor singing and bland performances, this album only deserves one star, or probably less. It is also disappointing that Russell Watson's already not too strong vocal powers seem to have suffered a decline here. Nothing much to recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't like it at all","review":"Some people say that the albums of Russell Watson can convert one to classical music or opera. I don't think it works with me. The singing here is so bad that one just cannot enjoy the music. In fact, it may put one off to classical music forever.I much prefer those 3 fat men singing - at least their voices sound nicer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not match for Bocelli","review":"I don't think this album can match the much better releases of Bocelli, and even Safina. Russell Watson's voice is much less powerful than the aforementioned two, and his almost has no technique. If Bocelli and Safina deserve four star, this can only get at most one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watson is no talent","review":"It is clear from this recording that Russell Watson has very limited talent in singing. Putting aside the problems of his voice, which is uneven and coarse for most of the time, his singing is completely charmless. I wonder if he knows what the songs are about.This album is a total disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No good at all","review":"Whatever supporters of Russell Watson may say, their idol has more looks than voice. As can be heard on this recording, his performances are embarrassing, for instead of being proper interpretation of the music, they merely expose Watson's many vocal weaknesses.This is an album to avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watson stumbles","review":"This is Russell Watson's 2nd album, and he stumbles again and again throughout. The major problem here is that Watson's voice and technique are both not up to the demands of the music. As a result, his singing is extremely effortful and therefore unpleasant to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far worse than I thought","review":"This album is far worse than I originally thought. The singing of Russell Watson is technically deficient, charmless and even boring. Instead of converting people to classical music (or cross-over music), this kind of careless production may instead frighten people away from such kinds of music.I don't think this album can be recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor demonstration of versatility","review":"It is quite clear that Russell Watson and his producers hope to demonstrate the versatility of the singer by putting together a set of music which contains many different musical styles. Unfortunately, such intention has backfired as Russell Watson is unable to perform all those songs to a reasonable standard. Just attempting to sing such different kinds of music is not by itself the hallmark of versatility, in particular when one performs as badly as Russell Watson. Honestly, I think Russell Watson, instead of being a versatile singer, is a singer of a rather narrow stylistic range. He performs best when doing music of no great diffculty and those written in a narrow range. Otherwise, his singing can become plain ugly. Having regard to the standard of singing here, I can only give this CD one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"From bad to worse","review":"The first album by Russell Watson is quite a bad one, for the singer didn't have the technique and experience to bring the music to life.Unfortunately, the singing here in his 2nd album is worse! His voice has deteriorated and he is even less mindful of the mood of the music that he sings.One of the worst recordings that I've bought!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst in the cross-over bunch","review":"Russell Watson is, in my view, the worst cross-over singer that I've heard. While the voices of Groban, Bocelli and Fangoulis have more lasting beautiful, I've become tired of Watson's monotonous tone pretty soon. Also, the others have a much better singing technique, which makes their performances more interesting, subtle and of lasting interest. Listening to Watson is just like drinking tap water. It gives you next to nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A comical turn","review":"Listening to this cd, I almost think that it is intended as a vocal joke. The singing, and also the interpretation, is farcical. Those who have any knowledge of good singing will certainly laugh at all those vocal blunders, and those who looks for any sense of style in the performance will surely giggle at the poker-faced delivery.I'll make a good party recording, I suppose. But I can only give it one star for musical merit or the lack of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star recording","review":"This recording deserves just one star, as the performances are not up to standard.I certainly do not mind singers doing cross-over, as the concept can be quite interesting. However, the minimum requirement is that the singing must perform the music competently and that the singing must have a sort of charm.I can find neither in this recording. Russell Watson's technique is so inadequate that he fails in almost every song. His singing is also boring and he actually sounds bored himself. If this is expressive singing (as some have alleged), I just don't know what true expression and expressiveness are in this world.This recording project therefore fails. I hope the record company can find a better singing to undertake this kind of cross-over albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Singer with little technique and imagination","review":"The music on this release is all quite demanding. It needs a very well-trained singer to perform them to satisfaction. Unfortunately, the music is here entrusted to the incapable hands (voice) of Russell Watson, who literally croaks his way through the music. Listen to any track any you'll discover dozens of instances where Watson is incapable to achieve or attain what the music demands.There's also little imagination in Watson's singing too. He usually can only sing with an all-purpose tone. His way of ending phrases with a half gasp is a most annoying mannerism.It is fortunate that my copy of the album is only a loan from a library. Having heard this much hyped recording at last, I can now have a clearer idea of what Russell Watson really represents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomparably bad","review":"This is really something that can be said to be utterly bad. Compared with other cross-over singers like Bocelli, Safina and Frangoulis, Russell Watson does not have a comparable voice and singing technique. His singing is dinstinctly campy and technically insecure.I also object to the singer's uncommunicative approach to singing. He delivers each and every one of the songs in the same style. What a boring singer Watson is!I have never heard any singing (on recordings) that is worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star recording","review":"I can only give this recording a single star as Russell Watson has simplified the music to such an extent that it amounts almost to cheating. If Russell Watson is indeed a versatile singer, as some of his fans have claimed, he should have the ability to deliver the music in accordance with the score. Unfortunately, his vocal inadequacies can't do justice to the music. As a result, he tranposes, trims, simplifies and tones down many things, rendering those great songs mere tunes for humming in the karaoke.Russell Watson has done great damage and injustice to the music that he sings. His influence in the musical scene can only be negative."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrifying record","review":"Instead of being terrific, as some people seem to suggest, I just find this recording to be terrifying! The singing of Russell Watson is not only unstylish and technically flawed, the sounds that he made are simply off-putting. Ironically for a singer who's marketed as having a \\"voice\\", Mr Watson's vocal instrument is of quite unpleasant quality. An unlistenable recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite CD","review":"This is one of my favorite CDs in the whole world. I've played it a lot (in my car, in the waiting room at work, in the slot in the computer while I'm doing the billing, in the bedroom to wake up to) (and stuff).I just never get tired of it----Whether he sings classical or pop. Great instrumental presentation, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watson touches your heart","review":"Encore is a CD which is impossible to find. Once I got a hold of it and listened to it, I found that Watson speaks to me on a level only a few can touch. So much so that \\"Where My Heart Will Take Me\\" is the last song I Wish to Hear Whenever I leave this world.Watson Has a Gift in which he can touch anyone with a heart. I'm a 34 Year old male who by all rights should not know how to love this genre of music provides. But Russell has a way of doing it. GET THIS CD, PLEASE"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserves 10 Stars","review":"Russell Watson's first album was a tremendous success. Listeners couldn't expect a better attempt for the 2nd album. However, Watson has done it again. In fact, his singing here is even better than in his debut album, which indicates how Watson is maturing and fast becoming one of our great singers. If the debut album is worth 5 stars, Encore should get 10 Stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic singing.","review":"The singing on this recording is fantastic!The singer sings so brilliantly and his voice has power and flexibility. This recording makes for wonderful listening, and I'll be buying another CD as I've worn out this one listening to it over and over. Worth buying 2-3 more Cds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Biased review, terrific cd","review":"I am extremely prejudiced when it comes to Russell Watson so this would be a very biased review. Musically, I believe that he can do little to no wrong, but even I was taken aback with this CD. The musical arrangements are absolutely incredible. My favorite song on the CD (just to mention one) is \\"E lucevan le stelle\\" because it is sung with such force and beauty. Watson is fantastic, but I am constantly amazed how he was able to top his first release with this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All the songs on this CD are excellent.","review":"I purchased this CD because of \\"Va, pensiero\\" and \\"Where My Heart Will Take Me\\" but my favorite two songs are \\"Is Nothing Sacred\\" and \\"O sole mio\\". But I find myself listening to \\"I Just Don't Know How I Got By\\" and \\"Magic of Love with Richie over and over again. I guess this tells you that all the songs on this CD are excellent. Russell Watson Is a superb singer performer entertainer. One of THE best. You will not get tired of listening to this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Future star of tomorrow","review":"Telling you how incredible this English singer is would be like explaining how great Pavarotti is. If you don't know you should!This CD is packed with brilliance. One is hard pressed to find anything bad about Russell Watson. He sizzles in his rock songs, his stature as a classical vocalist is superb, despite what the know-it-all English classical musical critics say, and his performance in concerts is as exciting as they come.Buy this album and listen to one the future stars of tomorrow."},{"rating":"2","title":"The VOICE brought me back to the music I love ...","review":"Encore US keeps me there. While Va, pensiero and Mattinata, etc., are my true loves, Mr. Watson has won me over with Is Nothing Sacred and I Just don't Know How I Got By. His talent knows no bounds. Yes, he sounds like different people - but that is the beauty of Russell Watson - something for everyone! How many artists can offer two for the price of one? Only one, that I know of. I eagerly await more from this wonderful artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"An ENCORE is what you'll want when you hear the CD","review":"After hearing the first CD, I expected this CD to have nothing but Opera (which was so beautiful on the last CD). But to my pleasant suprise there were POP standards that I had never heard this way before. \\"You are so beautiful\\", was more beautiful than any Joe Cocker rendition (which I have always loved), because of the incredibly talented RUSSELL WATSON.His rendition of \\"Somewhere\\" from West Side Story will leave you with your heart beating and tears welling up in your eyes. As for the POP/OPERA mix - I didn't expect to be so drawn into the music and voice of this CD, especially after the AWESOME perfomances on his debut CD. All I can say is... \\"ENCORE, ENCORE!\\" Keep them coming RUSSELL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A tenor who cannot sing like a tenor","review":"People described Russell Watson as a tenor. However, I can't hear him singing like a tenor on this CD. He cannot reach the tenorish highs, and he hasn't the heroic voice of true tenors. In fact, I don't even think he is a classical singer at all, as judged from the weak sounds that he makes and the exceedingly poor support of his tone.It's a gross corruption of the word 'tenor' if one uses it to describe Russell Watson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little passion, inadequate technique","review":"What I heard here is a complete disappointment.First of all, Russell Watson isn't what he claims to be: He is neither an opera singer or a classical singer.Secondly, he has such a poor technique that makes him not suitable at all for the promotion of classical music to the masses. His technical inadequacies will only distort the music that he sings.Thirdly, he sings without passion at all. Listen to the truly great singers. Their singing is so full of emotion that one can be moved to tears. Russell Watson's singing, on the other hand, is cold and unwieldy.What a disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A one-star album","review":"I can only give this album one star, for its quality isn't up to standard. The singing is bad and the orchestral accompaniment is unsatisfactory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shouldn't have encored","review":"Russell Watson and his record company shouldn't have produced this 2nd album. The first album is already a grave disappointment, I mean to genuine music lovers. Unfortunately, not only has Watson's singing not improved in the meantime, I has actually gone from bad to worse. The selection of music is also less interesting than the first album, and, other than the presentation, there's almost nothing to recommend in this new album, in particular in relation to artistic merits.This is an album which should never have seen the light of the day, and should best be forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst vocal cd in my collection","review":"I've got over 5000 cds in my collection. I have to say that Russell Watson's \\"Encore\\" is by far the worst amongst those vocal cds that I have. The singing is simpliy atrocious! It's very irresponsible for any record company to release such a kind of recording without any quality control."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lifeless encore","review":"I don't understand why Russell Watson and his record company would release such recording other than for reasons of reaping a huge profit.The performances in this album has no artistic value whatsoever! The singer hasn't even mastered the basics of singing. As a result, his singing is strident and uncomfortable. He misses quite a lot of notes, too. A kind of artistic cheating, I presume.No, this kind of poor quality won't do for a commercial recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot be compared with Safina and Frangoulis","review":"What I heard in this recording is just substandard singing. Russell Watson can in no way be compared with genuine cross over artists like Safina and Frangoulis, which are blessed with better voices and have superior vocal skills. Watson doesn't even look as well as them!This recording represents poor value for money. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neither a classical nor cross-over singer","review":"I don't think Russell Watson is a classical singer for his singing is distinctly non-classical in the sense that his projection is weak, the voice range narrow and that he is unable to execute the many details required by classical vocal music. In fact, that he needs to rely on the microphone when singing live already indicates that he's no classical singer.I don't think Russell Watson is a cross-over singer, too. To me, cross-over singers must possess a sense of charm and ease of delivery that is totally absent in Watson's singing. Instead, Watson's performances on this cd is dull and rigid.This is not an enjoyable cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"A singing autopilot","review":"I'm not at all learned in singing technique and therefore I won't comment on the technical flaws of Mr Watson.However, I'm dissatisfied with his boring approach in singing. It's as if he's on auto-pilot. No emotional differentiation. No emotional identification. I found no feeling, no flesh and blood in Watson's performances.What a perfunctory singer he is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved every song on this CD","review":"I just loved every song on this CD, especially the \\"Is Nothing Sacred\\" number. I go to sleep with it on every night!!Just listen to some samples and if you like it, you'll love it!Wonderful..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watson's singing is top-notch","review":"I bought this album originally for Va, Pensiero, which is its highlight. However, I also enjoy the others. Watson's singing is top-notch on this album - equal to his VOICE album.The orchestrations are superb and each song is done perfectly. I am always amazed at the versatility of Watson and his voice. This is a singer to be watching for in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Encore has everything","review":"Great CD. Encore has everything for all music lovers- pop, rock and classical. Watson sings each song as they should be sung, with sensitivity, power, emotional, swing, and heart. What more can you ask for?To the reviewer who said that this CD is worse than the first one and Watson's voice has declined, why did you buy this CD if you thought it was that bad or are you just writing negative reviews every week because of some hatred you have for Russell.Grow up and support your favorite singers and let the Watson fans support this amazing singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nobody does it better than Watson","review":"Having listened to most cross-overs releases of the past 5 years, I can say that this, this second album by Russell Watson, is by far the best of the batch.Here we can see how a singer with a tremendous voice, so much technique and a sense of style unmatched by anyone makes he songs he sings his own. The performances are technically superb and interpretative-wise so appealing. One of the best CDs. Ever!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You have to have at least one Watson CD","review":"I bought this CD for one reason: \\"Va, pensiero\\", it's one of my favorite songs by this magnificent talent and I couldn't find it on any other CD! This is the song Watson sings at his limited TV appearances in the US. I ended up loving the whole set, though.His magnetic personality and charm oozes throughout all of the songs he sings. I wish I could have seen him in concert. Not only does he have the kind of talent that we all can't help but love and adore, but I understand he's even better, live, communicating with the audience as no other performer can!I'm only in my early twenties and I feel strangely attracted to this classical singer when I listen to his tunes. They are honest, simple, straight to the point.No one should be without at least ONE Watson CD in their collection. He is timeless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooked on Watson","review":"This was the album that got me hooked on Watson last year after seeing him in concert in Ohio. Maybe it was the cover showing a very hip Watson walking in an airport or maybe it was the absolutely perfect choice of songs on this album. What other album covers such a diverse range of music from opera to rock? Maybe it was the sparkling and witty arrangements by Hayward and co.Whatever it was, I have listened to this album hundreds of times and never gotten tired of it. You won't either. With its mixture of classical and pop music, this is the perfect album to get for someone listening to Watson."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have CD","review":"This CD is a must-have for even the most casual of Russell fan. It has everything, from pop to classical music.The USA edition is the one to get, although the New Zealand version has two great songs with Hayley Westenra. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frightfully bad","review":"There can only be one kind of description for this recording: It's frightfully bad.It can be heard that this recording has been very hastily produced. Things certainly aren't very polished. The singing is particularly bad, which the singer, Russell Watson, grooping for notes in an embarrassing manner.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"The work of an inexperienced singer","review":"No doubt Russell Watson has his aspirations. Unfortunately, he is unable to realise his aims as he is very much still an inexperienced singer. He stumbles and falls over those many technical hurdles presented by the music on this album. As a result, his singing is not only not stylish or idiomatic, it is not even technically proficient.As far as singing is considered, I don't consider this album a success."},{"rating":"1","title":"Substandard","review":"The singing of Russell Watson on this cd is substandard. He fails both the technical and interpretative challenges. I don't find this cd to be at all enjoyable. Just a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A vocally disastrous encore","review":"Although Russell Watson seems to have a number of fans around who keeps on praising him regardless of the quality of his performances, objectively speaking, this album is a veritable vocal disaster.In none of the tracks has Watson performed to anything close to a respectable musical standard. On the contrary, his labored vocalism, defective technique and shallow musicianship have made his performances more of an embarrassment than anything else.This is a very disappointing encore indeed! And one which shouldn't be attempted in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"That really can't do","review":"Records of such low quality should be strongly denounced! I have no objection to cross-over. However, this must be done be technically proficient singers who possess the requisite charm for such a kind of recording projects.Russell Watson has neither technique or charm. To hear such excruciating singing is one of the great aural tortures in life! Astonishingly, despite the variety of the music showcased in this recording, Watson manages to appear totally unmoved - the singing is bland to the point of robotic.That really can't do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of all the hype","review":"All those hype surrounding Russell Watson can be very misleading. From what I can hear on this cd, the singer has little voice and there's nothing beautiful about the quality of the voice too. The singing is consistently disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What kind of standard is this?","review":"Just what kind of standard is this?I feel exceedingly angry after buying and listening to this album. In my view, the singing is just terrible for the singer cannot even do a simple phrase in a smooth and even voice. Such low standard singing in a commercial album which is sold to the public should be roundly denounced! This is, by far, the worst vocal recording that I've ever bought.I strongly urge recording companies to be more responsible than rashly releasing albums performed by totally unformed artists. No, I don't even think the singer here deserve to be described as an \\"artist\\".I really hope to have my money back if it's possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalling singing","review":"I'm make it brief and direct: The singing on this cd is appalling. I don't think I've ever come across singing of such low standard. This singer cannot even hold a note properly and he has to cut and cheat on the music to enable him to survive. This is artistically dishonest. Besides, the singing is simply bad, whatever the standard that one applies to judge it. A a recording this is!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"6 Stars!!","review":"Too bad Amazon won't let me award it six stars! This is one incredible album.Not only do you have Watson singing all sorts of different styles, but you've got the great orchestral background. \\"You Are So Beautiful\\" is the best version I've heard. So sensitive and beautiful. \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" is one of the best on this album. It sounds like they really worked on this song, I'm sure it must have been complicated to sing all those different sharp chords.I seem to never get tired of listening to Watson sing any song. And I keep playing this album, loving it more all the time. All different walks of life visit me, and each person is never disappointed with hearing any one of these songs when I put this on.It's the perfect cd to relax with, and have nice gatherings to as well. Even if one isn't a Watson fan, this will make you think twice about the genre...how unique it is, and how wonderful this singer is."},{"rating":"2","title":"My First Watson CD, and It won't be the last","review":"This is the first Watson cd I have ever purchased. It really is great one to own. I'd say I listen to this more than any other cd I own, and, for me, that's saying a lot. I would never be listening to classical music at all if it weren't for Watson.I couldn't care less if he's no Pavarotti or whoever cross-over, classical singer you want to mention, because, again, WATSON, is who I like and want to listen to. I've listened to other \\"great\\" singers and just turned a deaf ear. Not so with this exciting, versatile singer who has opened new doors for me in the world of music and I thank him, again and again.This man is terrific. Trust me on this one...I own many, many cd's, but this is the first \\"classical\\" one"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a good one","review":"I was never a fan of classical music until Russell Watson came on the scene and he changed my music habits overnight! I'm now listening to \\"O sole mio\\", \\"Mattinata\\" and the rest of the arias along with his great pop songs. No other classical or cross-over artist has had this effect on me. Why? No idea. I just like Watson's personality, voice, and everything about this new singer from England. He seems like a good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"At the top of my desert island disks","review":"I first bought the New Zealand/Australia Encore album when it first came out last year. That CD moved me so much and went right to the head of my list of desert island disks. When the USA Encore was released, I purchased it and now has moved past the New Zealand version and has never moved from that position. As the months past by, the more this CD has meant to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums I've heard","review":"I'm not a Russellophile. But, my friends, this is one of the best albums I've ever heard. The combination of of Russell's voices on the classical and pop tracks are a marriage made in heaven.Working with these lilting melodies or exciting classical arias, Russell is absolutely wonderful with a voice and mood to suite each and every song. This album is a genuine find.Sure to become the treasure of your cd collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"CD every music fan must have","review":"I've been a Russell Watson fan for quite a while, and when I heard of this CD I was very excited. When I saw it in stores I couldn't wait to get it! I finally picked it up two days ago and have been listening to it over and over ever since! It's truly wonderful and I'm amazed at how he can seamlessly transfer from opera to pop to opera with such ease.On this recording he performs songs ranging from Volare, Ave Maria, I Just don't Know How I got By, Somewhere, Magic of Love, Celeste Aida and Where My Heat Will Take Me. He puts his own spin on all the songs, and this is a CD every musical fan must have! The highlight is probably his rendition of Bohemian Rhapsody, which is, as others have said, out of this world.Do yourself a favor and rush out and get this! I only hope he does a follow up to this CD featuring more of the same. Fantastic CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Song is fantastic!","review":"After seeing Russell sing spectacularly, although briefly, on some TV shows, I decided to take a chance and buy his CD, expecting to only like 1 or 2 of the songs like most of the CDs I buy.How wrong I was! Every song on the CD is fantastic....his voice is relaxing...inspirational...and addictive! Buy it - you will like it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"He's the best","review":"Thanks to Russell Watson for introducing and giving us non-classical music fans this great collection of classical music. As a new Watson fan, I absolutely love this CD. If you've always been a fan, you'll be glad to hear that you'll go crazy over it. From track 1 to track 16, they're all great. He's the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant CD","review":"I love all sorts of music but Russell is my all-time favorite and has been since I first discovered this marvelous classical or whatever singer you want to call him. So many of my friends are pure classical fanatics so I do receive a lot of friendly ribbing about a classical singer who sings pop but his continued success MUST tell ya something and I always mention it to them, gloating!I'm just glad to see that one of my MOST favorite arias, \\"E lucevan le stelle\\" is sung masterfully by Russell Watson in this otherwise, masterful compilation. Brilliant CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watson brings joy to many of us","review":"This collection is a joy! I, like a few others, remember seeing Mr. Watson on television a few weeks ago and was taken aback by this singer who can sing pop one minute, then change course and sing \\"classical\\". It was truly unbelievable. I had to buy the album that was publicized and as I listened to it, felt so much pleasure and good feeling. I had to order his other album on Amazon and had to put in some good words for this wonderful singer. I've shared the CD with friends and they have had the same experience, so it's a double joy for us all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great talent, Great voice","review":"I must admit that I had my doubts about this one. To release a second album so soon after his successful VOICE album requires a lot of confidence, talent or just plain guts.In this case, its all three. Russell Watson did a marvelous job. He has always been much more of a professional musician than the mostly hostile media gave him credit for. Without talent or guts to break new ground, his albums would not be selling as they are now. He has proven his artistry beyond doubt.I would have preferred more classical musical selections that might have better shown off Russell's classical tenor voice, but all in all this is one very good album. He never ceases to amaze me with all the new voices he comes up with each album. Great talent, great voice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Prefer Watson","review":"Although I've enjoyed Russell's singing and concerts since he started, I was totally unprepared for the energy and pure 'voice' he put forth in making this album. Russell never \\"just sings\\" any music, whether it be classical or pop. This CD is, indeed, a fine recording by Watson.Listening to other \\"crossover\\" singers I prefer Russell's voice. Russell is so innovative and energetic, coupled with a strong, clear voice, that I find myself playing this CD more often than other CDs.His opera voice is AN opera voice and a good one. I've read newspaper critics deploring Watson, Groban, Frangoulis, Brightman and the rest of the new cross-over singers but each singer has his/her own niche and music fans.Despite the critics, I like the crossover singers, especially Watson."},{"rating":"2","title":"He captures us nonclassical fans with his marvelous voice","review":"As someone who never cared much for classical music, I am among many who were very surprised by how much we like this cd so much. I bought it because I was introduced to Mr. Watson on his brief appearances on television where he sang pop-type/classical songs and just liked everything about his persona and voice.But, my true interest came after hearing Russell sing the classical songs on this CD.

Sometimes superb. Russell Watson has so much talent, he makes the music come alive. I listen to this CD day and night and am thrilled each time I hear one song after another. Remarkable CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watson's voice is beautiful, my personal opinion","review":"Music appreciation is a very personal thing, and I can only express my own view, which others may disagree. The first thing is that I found Mr Watson's voice to be so beautiful. The timbre is exceptional indeed. I also found his singing to be so charming and communicative. I often found the performance here exciting and full of joy. I believe I listened with an open mind and these are merely my personal observations. Everyone has their own tastes as far as music is concerned and I respect everyone's views, if with an open mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watson is flawless!","review":"The masterful orchestrations are surpassed only by Watson's flawless singing. I can't choose a favorite, because each selection gains a new perspective upon every playing.This is not an ordinary album. This is to be listened to with little or no lights and plenty of quiet. Un like most cross-over albums, this is indeed high art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous CD","review":"The first record I ever heard of Russell Watson's and one of my absolute favorites. This is a complete departure from the kind of CDs I usually buy but it's a wonderful one.On this record is some of the most beautiful and thought provoking music I have ever heard.It is a true masterpiece that all Watson fans should own and music fans should listen to.It's marvelous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good CD","review":"This album was recorded a couple of years ago and sold extremely well.The sound is near perfect and Russell 's voice although still young in terms of classical voices, still sounds strong and dramatic. A very good CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"A singer who can't sing","review":"The evidence is all here. Russell Watson is a singer who can't sing. He attempts to perform everything, but his performances betrays the fact that both his technique and interpretative abilities are not up to it.A poorly done album, one that does neither justice to the music nor to cross-over as a genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish Russell had more CDs to buy","review":"Russell Watson has had a strong effect on me since I was introduced to him on the Good Morning America show.I just couldn't forget his \\"Va, pensiero sung so impressively in two different voices, a pop voice and a stunning classical tenor voice. After buying his CD, there is no one I would rather listen to for hours on end, that rich tenor voice can sooth and excite your senses.When you are in the mood for classical music, no one fills the bill more than Russell Watson and if you want pop, instead, then this CD has a very good sampling of pop tunes as well as pop-rock.I only wish Russell Watson had more albums out there to buy. I guess we all have to wait in eager anticipation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bocelli and Groban fan now loves Watson","review":"When I bought this collection last year, I was not a Russell Watson fan. I much preferred Josh Groban and Andrea Bocelli in style and substance and just tossed off Watson contemptuously.Boy, was I wrong and this collection single-handedly turned me into a Watsonphile. Now I have all of his Cd's. If you don't know him or haven't listened to him seriously, you must buy this record, it will change your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great voice, great style","review":"A great value! 16 fantastic songs including a mix of songs consisting of O Sole Mio, Ave Maria, The Prayer, Mattinata, Somewhere, Bohemian Rhapsody, and Where My Heart Will Take Me.

If you are looking for a great album, this is it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to the task","review":"Russell Watson is totally not up to the task in this recording project. Neither his voice or his technique is capable of giving a respectable rendition of the music, much of it is simply beyond his abilities.I think it would be more responsible of Mr Watson if he can take some classes in singing before rushing out another badly performed recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too amateurish","review":"The singing on this album is no good. Too amateurish. It fails to move me and my family. Little value whether for serious or leisure listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shouldn't have encored","review":"Given the bad performances of Russell Watson in his debut cd, and that his vocal skills have not improved at all, he shouldn't have given this \\"encore\\", which again presents the inadequacies of Watson's singing. I can hardly find a song here that is competently performed.One star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong voice for such music","review":"Russell Watson does not have the right type of voice for most of the music that he sings here. As a result, his singing is effortful and unidiomatic. Unpleasant to listen to. I'm sure there're millions in this world who can sing better than Watson. Anyway, just forget this 3-day wonder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gives no pleasure","review":"This album is really bad. Gives no pleasure to me whatsoever. The singing is atrocious. No feeling in the performance. Acoustics is ghastly. Totally unsatisfactory!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This album is most disappointing. The singer, a newcomer named Russell Watson, has an appalling vocal technique and is apparantly completely ignorant of different musical styles. As a result, his singing is technically fault-ridden, musically uninteresting, stylistically incorrect and emotionally bland.I don't think I've ever encountered such bad singing before on records."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extraordinarily bad","review":"After reading all those hype surrounding Russell Watson, I bought this CD for a try. I was extremely disappointed by it as the performances recorded here are extraordinarily bad!I can't imagine a singer who can't sing properly can nowadays make a recording. The singing of Russell Watson is as bad as one can imagine. In fact, the atrocity of his singing skills has to be heard to be believed!Some people have commented in Russell Watson's voice, which they consider to be very fine. But I trust my ears more than such obviously biased words, especially after listening to this cd. The voice of Russell Watson is, in my view, less beautiful than the average recording artist.In addition to all these disappointments, the orchestral playing is perfunctory and the acoustics is rather absurd at times. What a terrible recording this is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A vocal disaster","review":"Can't imagine why Decca can produce and release this kind of recording. It's a veritable vocal disaster!Russell Watson's singing skills can be put to shame by an ordinary choir boy in many high schools. His voice is small, and his range is narrow. He's neither musical nor stylish, and his performances are strangely uncommunicative.In reality, he suffered lots of vocal mishaps throughout this recording, which can make one cringe or mad, depending one what perspective one is looking at it.This is a recording which doesn't not deserve to be released to the public."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete failure","review":"I consider this recording to be a complete failure. Russell Watson simply fails to do any justice to the music. It's ironic that he and his record company are promoting Watson as a versatile singer. The fact, as can obviously be heard from this recording, is that Watson does everything badly. Surely not a mark of versatility!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing 2nd album","review":"The 1st album of Russell Watson is quite good. The selection of music is interesting and Russell Watson seems to be in good voice.Unfortunately, this 2nd album is a grave disappointment. The selection of music is no longer interesting and the singer is in plain bad voice. He also seems to have taken less time to go over the music, too, as the singing is often mechanical and without feeling.Is Mr Watson content with the success that he has gained with his 1st album such that he no longer pays attention to his singing?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad music making","review":"It is difficult to express in words how bad this recording is. Russell Watson, the singer on this album, doesn't even seem to have grasped the essentials of singing. Not only does he cheat on the notes and has to break longer phrases into disparate blocks, he often sings flat and his voice turns sour when he ventures above the staff. Listening to his agonising singing, I just wonder how many \\"takes\\" Watson has to do in the studio before a complete track can be assembled, even though such complete tracks, as can be heard on this recording, is not quite of publishable quality.Watson's emotional response to the music and the texts is also deficient. I wonder if he actually knows what he is singing about, in particular as regards songs in a foreign language. Needless to say, such bland and unresponsive singing makes this recording even less enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst CD I've ever purchased","review":"This is by far the worst CD I've ever purchased. I really don't know how to describe it, but, to put it simply, the singing is extremely bad. It's obviously the work of a complete amateur who has little skill and talent in singing. The choice of program is also beyond the singer's abilities.I am surprised that some people seem to like this recording (or many it's just the same 2 or 3 person who keeps on writing those unconvincing 5 star reviews here). But speaking for myself, I consider it a shame that any recording company cares to release to the public a recording of such low quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"All hype no substance","review":"There's much hype surrounding Russell Watson. However, there's little substance in his singing, which proves to be abrasive and pretty unmusical. The singer still has much to learn before he can produce a decent recording. Rushing such a kind of substandard recording out into the market before the singer is even technically ready isn't a very responsible action by the record company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watson isn't of Groban's class","review":"Russell Watson is definitely not in the class of Groban, who sings with great charm and skill. By contrast, Watson merely belts out the music without emotion. It's just like listening to a person shouting at you at close distance.Horrible recording!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Watson unable to cross the boundaries","review":"This album is touted as a cross-over album. Unfortunately, singer Russell Watson is unable to transcend the musical boundaries. In fact, he isn't good at any of the styles of music that he's chosen to perform. The classical songs are technically defective, the popular works lack charm and those middle of the road tracks are bland and clumsily executed.From what I heard on this album, Watson is obviously a Jack of all trades but a master of none."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enjoyable","review":"This album is not enjoyable at all, at least to me and my friends. We're pop music lovers and, after reading some articles on Russell Watson, who claims that he can bring people like myself to classical music, we decided to give it a try. However, we can only say that we hate classical music even more after listening to such incompetent singing by Russell Watson. Hope not all classical singers are that bad in technique and over-bearing in sound. S"},{"rating":"1","title":"A travesty of singing","review":"The performance of Russell Watson in this album is, honest to say, a travesty.Despite all those empty claims of Russell Watson being a \\"fantastic\\", \\"marvellous\\" or \\"brilliant\\" singer, what one hears in this album is a singer barely surviving in music that is clearly beyond his abilities to cope with.The voice of Russell Watson, which, truth to say, is of mediocre quality, already discloses quite a bit of wear and tear. His singing often lacks any sense of phrasing and dynamic variation. Whenever vocal agility is required, he dodges the challenge and simplifies the music. In the more strenuous moments, the sounds that he makes is truly distressing. This recording surely marks one of the lowest points in recording history...Needless to say, I don't like what I've heard. If Russell Watson is to make yet another recording, I do hope that he can do better.

The book is appropriately slow paced, being the memoir of Sir Robert Mayfair Bruce, who writes of the ascension to power of the 'new world's greatest hero' Lord Fitzpatrick. Bruce's story (and particularly that of his family) answers the question many people have in the face of great historical change, asking \\"what can one person do to change anything?\\" Combining steampunk elements, fictional intertextuality, and poignant moments of human emotion and grace, Theodore Judson has created a book that, while easy to put down, continues to beckon the reader to pick it back up. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imaginative","review":"This is an entertaining and imaginative future history story. Set several centuries in the future, Fitzpatrick's War takes place in a world where electrical power is forbidden. Sophisticated technology exists, but the mechanical technology is steam powered and biotechnology is relatively advanced. The book features an interesting society called the Yukon Confederacy, a semi-feudal society which has elements of a Christianized Sparta. The plot concerns the efforts of a leading member of the Yukons to emulated the career of Alexander the Great. The quality of writing and characterization is solid. The presentation of the Yukon world is very good and Judson has shown both real imagination and some rigor in developing this future history.

Before he gets too much older, I would certainly love to see him honored at the Grammy's for his body of work . . . and perhaps make an appearance on VH-1's \\"Storytellers.\\" We are most fortunate to have had the opportunity to experience this \\"Painter Passing Through.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Listening Pleasure","review":"Read the other reviews for details of Gordon Lightfoot's career and Canadian National Hero status.

A hateful attempt to justify racial stereotypes via bogus sympathy for its black characters, and equally bogus historical detail. The author displays a rudimentary sense of pot-boiler plot (literally, as it happens), all to the most sadistic end. Bonus star awarded for its status as one of the unmentionable lowlights of 50's pop culture. After all, its title did coin a term - expropriated from the name of an African tribe - that still offends. That's the power of exploitation fiction, for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"For beginners, who try self-teaching","review":"This book is most suitable for those who would like to make your guitar sound more authentically in short period of time, especially on their own.

A great package compiled by Billy Milano. The cd is really cool as it is SOD's third gig. The DVD has two new videos (F**K The Middle East and March Of The SOD/Sgt D & The SOD) which are really cool. They will never get played on MTV of course, but are just really well done videos. There are 5 mini concerts in addition to the Main Feature. The packaging combines images from other releases by the band, to make a real nice new image. The art was done by the webmaster of the Official SOD & MOD Fansite ( sod-mod.com ). On the back is a new collage featuring the homosexual looking Sgt D action figure from Japan. The band has called this figure gay looking & I don't know why they were even produced. It takes a mean, cigar smoking zombie & makes him look like he could be on children's anime. Hopefully McFarlane toys will release a true SGT D figure. The DVD is worth buying. BUY IT!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Tale from Edgar Wallace","review":"I rate this story four stars. Very original, somewhat speculative, and unlike most stories of the time driven mostly by action and not dialog or the omniscient observations of the author. I'm not sure exactly how to place this story, it has a higher body count than most stories of the era, and its rather minimalist romance angle could be dispensed with altogether and the story would still be pretty good. As usual Wallace is a little over the top in his story telling, the hero is a detective with a flair for the dramatic, and there are several minor characters that clog up the tale with subplots that lead to some twists and turns. Some mystery within a mystery sort of twists to the plot, but, overall an enjoyable read. If you are in the mood for something completely different, this might just be the thing you are looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Secret House","review":"I enjoyed reading this book.

I love the lack of caraffe and unsightly burner plate. However, within 5 months of purchase the unit began a slow leak at the spigot valve which progressed to a major leak rendering the unit unuseable. The two included extra valve seals should be a red flag to consumers of this product indicating that Hamilton Beach knows about the problem and it's serious enough to justify including extra seals with the product. By the way, replacing the leaking seal in my unit with a new seal did not fix the problem. In fact it became worse. Hamilton Beach is sending me a new tank which I'm still waiting on. I anticipate that this one, if it is the same design, will also eventually leak. By that time, it will be out of warranty and no longer a problem for the manufacturer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hamilton Beach Brew Station","review":"I love the coffee maker, this is my second one and I would purchase again.

The dollar clips like to pop out at inconvenient times. Although it is not difficult to put them back in, when your trying to exchange monies this can get annoying. Also the carrying handle is centered on the top of the box, which is fine when empty, but when change is in it the balance is off. The change falls causing added aggravation."},{"rating":"2","title":"an interesting rock n roll journey","review":"The best part of this book is the insight given about the rock and roll era of the 70s from the point of view of a teenager/young adult who just happened to be a part of the \\"scene\\". Bebe takes us on a trip through rock and roll of the 70s telling us not only about her experiences, but giving us some insight into the off-stage personalities of some of rock's biggest icons. The only downside to the whole experience is Bebe's attempt to make herself appear to be almost as \\"huge\\" in the rock and roll industry as the people she writes about. In reality most of mainstream America had never heard of her until her daughter (with Steven Tyler) became a successful teenage film actress. All in all, however, a good read if you are able to overlook Bebe's attempt to be just a little more than what she really was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book...candid and honest.","review":"I really really enjoyed the candid manner in which this book was written....I love Bebe Buell's honesty. Although I still find it odd that she just doesn't think she's a groupie :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but Exhausting!","review":"What can I say.. I did enjoy this book. But after reading all the other reviews on it I must agree, it gets kind of old when all she does is talk about how great she is. But I found the book interesting with all the info Jimmy Page, Iggy Pop, Mick Jagger, etc. The book also had a lot of great pictures. I would recommend it, overall it was good."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's inspiring","review":"At first I thought she wrote very amateurishly, however, once I got into the book (and it didn't take long), I found her style only added to what she had to say. I skated through this one quickly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Bebe","review":"What a pathetic piece of flotsam. Never \\"anyone\\" but chose to sleep with \\"everyone\\", boy or girl, no difference - if she thought that they could help her \\"career\\" - such as that was. \\"Was\\" may be too kind of an interpretation. A zero of a \\"model\\" who chose to hook her wagon, or legs, around anyone holding a guitar. This is a fun read just for its prurient nature, but her whole \\"poor me, I'm so talented BS\\" is shameful. She was marginally recognized for the men with whom she slept - nothing more. Liv, I'm glad that you rose above your upbringing - lucky for you your \\"mother\\" had very little to do with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great book!","review":"I adored this story of Bebe Buell's life. I am very confused by some of the bad reviews. They don't make much sense at all. Sounds like catty mean remarks instead of a real review of the actual book itself. I really liked Bebe's take on things. Her honesty and her fearless way of admitting her faults as well as her strong points. I like that- a woman who is not afraid to have confidence and tell it like it is and was. I say don't let any of the negative reports sway you. Read \\"Rebel Heart\\" and you won't be disappointed. The 70's were a time I wished I could have experienced. Reading about it here in Bebe's book was the nest best thing to being there. Oh, and the pictures all throughout the bio are really fun too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring....","review":"I found it hard to believe that someone with such an opportunity for a can't-put-down book managed to be pretty boring. I was looking forward to this book because I was sure I would like it. Sex, drugs, rock & roll - what more can you add? How about a little personality?I wouldn't recommend this groupie book but if you want a good one, pick up I'm With the Band by Pamela Des Barres. It's a lot more entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly Boring Arrogant Fluff","review":"I can't say I expected much of this book and I was not disappointed. The editing is non-existent. It's hard to believe that BB actually has any recollection of many of the encounters she relates since she can't remember what she said the page before. While at first it was almost fun to dog ear pages where there were contradictions and poor English usage, after a while it became highly annoying. What did she pay her ghost writer to do anyway?Her arrogance - deserved or not - takes away most of what make this book an interesting light read. There are parts in the book, mostly early on, where she is more self depreciating and those parts quickly passed as good entertainment. Unfortunately her attitude inexplicably changes to something less endearing as she is literally passed down the ladder of the rock hierarchy to a point where she is groupie to nobodies and she feels it necessary to try to validate herself. A pity indeed.You've been forewarned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"From what I'd read beforehand I was expecting \\"Rebel Heart\\" to be the type of book that I'd either love or hate. Unfortunately it invoked neither love nor hate in me once I'd finished the last page. I didn't feel a thing. I read it with an open mind. The flaw of \\"Rebel Heart\\" is that it comes across as an exercise in self-promotion. I was constantly reminded that the author, Bebe Buell, thinks of herself as jaw-droppingly gorgeous. Whether she is or she isn't - this started to grate on me after a chapter or two. Bebe Buell also considers herself as muse, not a groupie mind, to a number of rock stars. But of course what she has always wanted to be is a rock star herself, which she would have been, had people been able to see beyond the fact that she's jaw droppingly gorgeous. The reason I read \\"Rebel Heart\\" was for research on Bebe's daughter Liv Tyler for a website. There was enough background for that purpose. However, once I put the book down it disappeared from my memory soon after."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toxic","review":"This woman, BeBe Buell, is sick. She contradicts herself constantly in the book. She was a groupie, plain and simple. She was pretty enough, but not like she thought she was, not extraordinary. The part about Prince writing a song inspired by her had me rolling, laughing!!! Give me a break! He says \\"baby\\" not \\"BeBe.\\" I doubt Elvis Costello was writing that many songs about her either. My god, this woman is deluded! I feel sorry for Todd and Liv."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"When I finished reading this book, I actually felt sorry for Bebe Buell. Her ego is so large and she is so deluded that she has no concept of reality. She claims to be independent while begging for money from Todd Rundgren and Steven Tyler and she calls herself a good mother while her daughter is being raised by her grandmother. She's a used-up groupie. I was not impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get it from the library","review":"I honestly don't know what to say about this book. Bebe Buell has lived a life that many would be envious of, or would at least find entertaining. However, in her book you wind up feeling sorry for her, as she relives a past full of disillusionment, sex, and rock and roll. There is an interesting story in here somewhere. However, it is poorly written, constructed, and edited in this book.I have no doubt Bebe would be fun to talk to, and has some good stories to tell. However, she should have picked an assistant writer who would have reined her ego in and let the story out. I was extremely disappointed to read a book that I had so looked forward to reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Candid and Upbeat!","review":"I read Bebe Buell's new book \\"Rebel Heart\\" and was very impressed by how candid yet upbeat the book was. Bebe goes into detail about the good times and the bad times. With the good times we can only wish we were in her her shoes and with the bad times she does not ask for our pity. She simply explains the mistakes she has made. It was hard to take a break from reading the book because of how interesting all the stories were. The book is filled with charm, sadness, humor and candor that make a good book. I am very impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"heartlessly boring rip-off","review":"Bebe Buell wrote a book about being a groupie like Doris Day would write a book about having sex with Rock Hudson. She says nothing of interest...unless you're buying her book in order to learn all about how she keeps herself not looking her age through not smoking, drinking, taking drugs, or over eating."},{"rating":"1","title":"painful","review":"i read this book with very mixed feelings. while i enjoyed some of the stories bebe buell had to tell from the glory days of rock n' roll, i couldn't get past her obsessive need to try to convince the world that she was/is fabulous, wonderful, gifted, beautiful, talented, etc. and her constant justification of how she raised (or didn't raise) her daughter.And some of the her claims that she inspired half of the songs created during the 70s and 80s are laughable. Particularly her claim that Prince wrote \\"little red corvette\\" about her. they had never met each other!The intriguing rock and roll stories here are just too few and far between, getting lost somewhere between her ego and her guilt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forced March","review":"If, like me, your boyfriend is a huge Todd Rundgren fan, you're not going to be able to skim this book and look at the pictures because he's going to want to discuss it in detail. So be warned.Bebe's story is interesting and I understood everything she was trying to say about herself. It's the writing that's so bad. Concepts such as topic sentences, the rules of grammar, and editing are no where to be found in the pages of this book. It's not good enough to tell a good story - you have to tell a good story well. The errors and inconsistencies were a complete distraction and made the experience painful and tedious.I wish Bebe well and I hope she has all the success in the world. I just hope she doesn't have any more literary ambitions to inflict on us."},{"rating":"1","title":"self-deluded","review":"I have never read anything written by someone as deluded as Bebe. While I am interested in the people she talks about I cannot believe anything she says. Her vanity is unbelieveable! The world should be kneeling at her feet. And I cannot believe she put her \\"lyrics\\" at the top of every chapter. Reads like something written by a third grader. Sorry, I couldn't finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's hear it for self affirmation!","review":"Bebe Buell comes across as a selfish, egotistical, wanna be in this book. It took me forever to slog through this tripe. I'm sure there is a story worth telling about her life and experiences, but she certainly didn't do a good job of telling it. I was initially excited about the prospects of this book as I was coming of age in the early seventies and a huge rock music fan. I also remember her centerfold from Playboy as one of the first I'd seen. She presented an exciting and beautiful image, and the prospects of reading about this woman who was a muse and not a groupie was enticing. However, my initial elation waned as I read. This should be a text book in how not to lead one's life. Based on this book, she needs to get into therapy with Stuart Smalley, after all, \\"I'm Good Enough, I'm Smart Enough, and Doggone It, People Like Me!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Advice: Get this from the library!!!","review":"If you are at all interested in this book, please see if you can find it at your local library. That's what I did, and let me tell you I'm very glad I did. Why? It's AFWUL, especially the writing, followed at a close second by the pathetic, oft repeated self-importance. Run, run away FAST!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to read","review":"This book should have been a fun read. As a big rock fan, I bought this book anticipating an enjoyable reading experience. I figured as I read on, that the book would get better. Wrong! The author took every opportunity to document her beauty and talent, not only as a muse, but as a rock star in her own right (?) Her beauty you can see from the pictures of her past, but 300+ pages call this repeatedly to your attention, page after painful page. The writing was disjointed, with an annoying amount of exclamation marks.However, on a positive note, the author's explanation that a married Elvis Costello sends her hidden messages in his songs was truly a riot! Almost worth the read, although not quite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the book~","review":"Bebe Buell seems down to earth and friendly and takes us to a powerful era and time. Her fame via being a FORD model alone would be noteworthy, but the fact, that she was able to SNAG so many cute and powerful pop stars is great! I think that she is quite beautiful and she touched my heart with her vulnerability and also love for animals. This book is powerful and it teaches that even if you are one of the most beautiful woman in the world, you can STILL get your heart broken. I wish Ms. Buell all the best in her future endeavors. This book is entertaining from start to finish. I would really like to have given the book a ten star rating instead of five!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been good....","review":"I loved the stories, being a huge rock fan. I wish I had been alive in the 70's so I could do the things she did! This book, however, is very poorly written, repeats itself over and over, and Bebe Buell is a thoroughly unpleasant braggart. Try Pamela Des Barre's book instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Study In Cool","review":"All in all, this was a delightful book and fun to read. It was hard to put down. Rebel Heart is a case study in *cool* and the people that make that word exist. Everyone I have loved since childhood is here in technicolor and then some. The spirit of the book is good- no bitterness or cowardly outburst. Just straight-shootin' and in many cases I felt like I was right there in the room.Bebe Buell is many things to many people. To me she is a REAL woman who has lived and can now pass on her experiences to us young pups who might make too many mistakes otherwise. She is also inspirational in the *looks* department. If I can age anywhere near as well, I will be a happy camper- she is just beautiful!I was kinda left hanging at the end. I am so curious now to know what has happened in her life since the book came out. It screams for a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"we still love you","review":"i like this book because...it is written in words that the ordinary person can understand,and it lures you in leaving you wanting more..much like alot of the people she incountered in her life!i really apprieciated the comment from her early in the book that no matter what else she says,that todd rundgren is /was/and will always be an important person in her life>>>so sorry todd ...(im a big fan)..in your lyrics ...write an embaricing book about me,it seems she still cares.in this book she confirms alot of things i have speculeted about for years...also in the book it give a list of the music she has recorded..some of which i didnt know about,so iwas able to seach it out..bebe has always gotten negative feedback,but i think its from envy..i wish i had just met some of the people she has!bebe we still love you..you rock on!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"POORLY made film","review":"If you want a good movie with actors who can act along with a great plot- don't get this one. It was poorly choreographed and the actors/actresses, well, cannot act. It was made out to be a kid/karate movie but was horrible. I don't recommend this to anyone over the age of about 9 or 10. The only reason the kids will probably like it is how the two kids do weird things to beat up the crooks (ex. the boy and girl escape on bad guy by sticking his face in a toilet and handcuffing his hands to the pipe, along with pulling his pants down to reveal boxers). I highly suggest you do not get this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great children's book","review":"My grandson (12 years old) has read all three series and finds them spellbinding.

The previous reviewer was evidently referring to the Walter disc in this Sony series, but his remarks apply with equal force to this disc. The untampered DSD transfers preserve the aural profile of the master tapes and recreate faithfully the acoustic of Severance Hall -- a bit dry for some tastes, but allowing every strand of the musical texture to be heard. The transfer is so good you can ever hear pages being turned in unison and Szell audibly urging his forces on (e.g., in the finale to No. 40). Very highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anything English Is Great","review":"Wonderful story - Great acting - Marvelous scenery - Great actors ---- How could you ask for anything more... hm dodd"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleak House","review":"When puchasing this item I had the choice of this particular presentation or the more recent BBC production featuring Gillian Anderon, Alun Armstrong and Charlie Brooks (2006). I chose the Diana Rigg, Denholm Elliott (1985)mainly because of cost. I have regretted my choice. I viewed the (2006) some time ago and now comparing the two, the more recent production was far superior.There were times through the film, if I had not known the story fairly well, I would not have had any idea of what it was all about until near the end. The colour was dark which seemed to add to its mystery.It must take great skill to bring out the depth of Dicken's study of human nature but this production seemed to miss it in my opinion. The acting was very good but it did not seem the right cast for Denhom Elliott; not his usual role.I wished I had spent the extra and got the later edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"so-so","review":"Having not read the book...but knowing of its \\"classic\\" status...i gave this video version a try. I have to say i found it a bit boring and tedious... so i gave up on it after about 45 minutes. I found the colloquial English accents difficult to understand at times..which is not unusual for an American, i suppose. I'm sure they are quite authentic...which speaks highly of the cast...but it can be hard to follow at times. Dickens has always been sort of a \\"hit-or-miss\\" author to me...i love some of his books...but don't care much for others. The over all plot just didn't do much for me...atleast in video form. I read that it was a complex book with lots of sub-plots...which intrigued me since i'm a big fan of Tolstoy.

I never read the book,I knew none of the characters, so I cannot compare their acting or the story line. I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to someone else. It held my attention and kept me in suspence as to what would happened next.

I bought it for my son, Nicholas, thinking he would be excited about a book with his name in it.

When Nicholas is shipwrecked and lands, alone, on an island, he is happy to be away from his family. His parents worry at first and offer a reward to find him, but as time passes they spend the reward money on more jewels. How awful!

It is a rare treat to find something that fit all of our age ranges. It is nice to play together when we don't have time for a full length board game like Monopoly. Each hand takes about 10 - 15 minutes, allowing you to stop whenever you need to or continue on until a winner has accumulated a set number of points. The only skill needed is to be able to put cards #1 - 60 in sequential order. There is some strategy, but that comes quickly.

My 9-year old is very good with numbers and loves to play games, and this one is a huge hit with him! My 11-year old enjoys it, too. What's great is that there are different levels at which you can play, so it can be very simple or as challenging/complicated as you would like.

I wind up looking up 3 or 4 citations and getting a sentence or two of information to use... one time for example, I wanted info on the Tabernacle in the Temple in Jerusalem.And for reading it cover to cover for general knowledge, I could not wade through it. The learned professors who prepared this no doubt know their subject, but I find it such dry reading I can only manage a half chapter now the then.

The one weakness of this book is the inclusion of crafty, artsy, non-wearable and some downright weird designs.

Pieces made out of felt just don't belong in the same book as some of these masterpieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intellectual Exercise in Unwearability","review":"As an intermediate level (not seasoned pro) jewelry designer, I eagerly awaited this book's arrival. What a disappointment! While there are some wonderful, creative rings in this book, far too many are unwearable and more than a few could be downright dangerous to wear! While there is a place for pushing a medium/project/idea beyond its previously defined parameters, this book provides little inspiration for, and appreciation of, a craft that is defined by its ability to be worn by real live beings.

I don't think so."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enchanting book","review":"I am a fine metals/jewelry student and I recently saw this book at the Northwest Metals Association Symposium.

There are some whose narrow view of the art and craft world makes them believe that this book is not good. Craft is no longer limited to what is useful or utilitarian. I wish those people would open their eyes to this fantastic world where art and craft blend seamlessly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been titled \\"890 really weird rings, 110 masterpieces!\\"","review":"No doubt the book is beautiful. The photographs and text are just enough for the eye-candy type book it was meant to be. My problem with it is that the title should have made it more clear that these rings are mostly 'artwear' and not jewelery like most of us expect. The book is intended for the experimental artists not for serious jewellers. There are *some* stunning examples of real jewelry and extremely creative and innovative styles but very few. The '500 brooches'book is the same. The cover and back plate are a little deceiving.

Following this a commentary on the texts \\"Eight Verses on Mind Training\\" and \\"Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment.\\" These two works are worth the price of the book in themselves.Like all of the Dalai Lama's works I have absorbed and learned from this piece and strongly recommended it to anyone who is a practitioner of Buddhism or looking for a guide through the craziness that is life today.

The author beginning the story with how he gained interest in the subject sets the stage & reels you in. the details capture your attention. He reviews a 500 year map drawn by a monk & discovers the latitude/longitude numbers were switched. Therefore this map & all other maps copied off it to modern times are wrong...the city is in a different location. the part of the book dealing with being in the middle east & the dig, brings archaeology to life.

It captures the essence of Philadelphia's \\"Rittenhouse Square\\" the way it is if you were thinking of visiting Philadelphia for a weekend in the summer. The musicians are the soul of Philadelphia. It is inspirational for young musicians because it features some young musicians playing their music in the park for visitors to enjoy. The setting lends itself to music of all kinds.

Harris is funny, provocative, frank, and incisive as she ruminates on family, community, education, racism, religion, hair and the mannerisms that inform the black and white people who intersect on these social and cultural plains. Her essays are steeped in a wisdom that has accrued through a joyful life.

Gatiss also seemed to include lots of filler to get the necessary 280 pages for BBC Books publishing requirements.

I suppose the songs were OK and, if the second half sounded like the first, it might rank 3 stars. The problem is that this final master must have been engineered by a moron. We've all heard of the loudness wars, but this CD sets a new bar for horrific levels of compression. It is unlistenable. Really, anyone who let this CD leave the engineering studio sounding like it does should be completely ashamed. It's an insult to anyone who buys the product. I would say that the artist should be upset their music was treated this way, but in the end they are the ones that should be saying \\"No, we can not release an album that sounds this bad\\".

I haven't heard songs of this calibre come from bands in AGES. (The last being the Art-Rock of the Smashing Pumkins in the 90s). Ive had the pleasure of seeing the Arcade Fire perform live, and well the Band members are so talented that they just keep changing their line up, (with all members constantly trading their instruments after each song).The songs are all great, especially the \\"neighbourhood\\" songs, with the first song maybe being the best (GREAT build up)I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strum & Whine = Boredom","review":"I made the mistake of buying this when it had 2 5-star reviews and because it was recommended in association with a CD by an artist I like.

Most of the time these hyped up bands never live up to expectation and or they are just plain bad. With the Arcade Fire, I wouldn't quite say they are bad but they are definitely a big letdown. The idea of starting a song soft and slow and then having it come to some sort of crescendo seems like a good idea but not for two to three songs on the same album. Other than that, there just wasn't anything that really tickled my fancy about this album. If there was something, most of the time it was a rip off of some other band (New Order drum beat).

I also love the fact that I don't have to skip past half the cd to hear one good song.The Arcade Fire are from Canada and before the making of this album several family members of the band died, hence the title 'Funeral' but also the very dark tone of the album.

I loved the rawness of the singer's voice, and the lyrics were beautiful. the first song is one of the best songs I have ever heard. I feel so thankful for having found this CD! Really, it's something everyone should listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Do Mariners Broadcaster Dave Niehaus and Arcade Fire Have in Common?","review":"Just back in NYC from Seattle where, since it's baseball season, I heard plenty from Mariners lead broadcaster Dave Niehaus and his trademark call of \\"My, oh my!\\" to punctuate the most exciting Mariner moments. Well, it struck me that \\"my, oh my\\" is exactly how I feel about Funeral. So even though I rarely chip in when over 300 reviews have already been written, this one is worth it. Nine months or so after downloading Funeral I return to it three or four times a week for its passion; its driven music; its stories of urban days, nights and dreams; and the raging, yet somehow always controlled singing. Some cuts are not as superb as others, but the Neighborhoods songs Tunnels, Power Outage, and 7 Kettles, along with Rebellion (Lies) and In the Backseat, grab you, shake you and won't let you go. Like hearing London Calling, or Don't Be Cruel, or Like a Rolling Stone, the first time -- my, oh my, indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy, heartbreaking and lovable.","review":"This is a wonderful record. It restored my faith. In lots of things. I thank The Arcade Fire for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Love Is Made To Forget It.....\\"","review":"From \\"Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels)\\" to \\"In The Back Seat\\" the album is in every way flawless. This is one of those bands that you know if they had more attention, they'd probably be \\"one of the biggest things\\". I bought this album not expecting much, I got it because I thought the name was catchy. But I was in for a huge suprise. Listen to it, and you'll know what I mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"it has that first album fire","review":"I'm a newcomer to Arcade Fire, sure I've heard their songs bouncing around here and there and when I have I've thought *wow, who is that?* but due to my heavy degree of scatter-brainedism, I forget before I can look them up. a friend of mine really introduced this group to me a few weeks ago and I've really been loving the heck out of them ever since. there's a lot of talent here. if you enjoy indie-rock at all, Funeral is a great addition to your repertoire."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as it gets for a first album","review":"I am a recent fan of AF and started with Neon Bible. This debut album reminds of the feeling of pure raw driven energy I heard in the first efforts by The Cure, U2, Cranberries and Talking Heads. This is not to say AF's sound is similar to those bands but that I heard unique genuine compositions coming from the heart with potential for greatness. Those other bands went on to more polished sophisticated and popular work but the early stuff containing the seeds of success has an unadulterated feel that cannot be matched. My favorites are Wake up, Haiti, Rebellion. Even after weeks of repeated listening I'm still overcome when Regine begins \\"Haiti, mon pays ...\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"This is where it really started","review":"I came to \\"Funeral\\" via a wonderful festival live appearance and the grandeur of \\"Neon Bible\\", but this is where it really all began: Merge, a brave indie music label took on this rather grand but inexperienced group from Montreal and made an album which included such obscur titles as \\"Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels\\"). While the group has gained in stature and especially confidence since and their sound has become both more amplified and grander on \\"Neon Bible, \\"Funeral\\" is a tremendous first album with most of the signature sound themes already present, with the rhythmic build up and the anthemic style. A great starting point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is six stars possible?","review":"This is truly the best album I've heard in the last five years. It's been in my CD player for the last two weeks, and I can't take it out. Every time I hear it, it is a little better. It's unlike anything you've ever heard: mystical, magical, motivating, thought provoking, you name it. If you care about music at all, this CD just might change your life. It's a special experience, and proof that genious still exists somewhere in Canada. (First Broken Social Scene, now this... Is there something in the water?!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Believe the Hype!!!","review":"This album is fantastic. Easily the best release of 2004, and in the top 5 of this century. It took a few listens for me to fully appreciate but great albums often do. You'll be hooked from the first listen and it just gets better from there.I've been listened to this album for atleast three days in a row now and it's offically....awesome.BUY IT! NOW!...also I ordered it direct from Merge Record's website and they sent a free poster and sticker. Very cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really awesome","review":"So many of these new bands can't seem to manage putting out a totally good album. I can name the bands that have on one hand. The Arcade Fire would be my pinky then. They are a band that is totally open to everyone, without fashion constraints (and hopefully indie snob constraints too). Either Funeral or Antics (Interpol) is the best album of the year thus far. I like them both so I will let someone else decide. Hopefully they sound this good in concert and continue to sound this good on their next album. I'll be there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Year and a Classic","review":"Enough of wondering how good this is. It's the best. Period. There won't be a better release this year, and it will make lists in years to come for one of the best of the decade. Seriously brilliant. Seriously classic. Must you suck by not getting it? No. You musn't. To quote Hanibal Lector, \\"GO NOW!!\\" ...to the Funeral."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD I've bought in a while.","review":"Wow is all can say. This CD is just amazing. The string arrangements on the songs are great, they add a whole new depth to the already great instrumentals. It took me a little bit to get used the singers voice but it really grows on you. All in all I would have to recommend this CD to everyone. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Layers and Layers of haunting sounds.","review":"It's been a while since a debute album has impressed me but this one certainly has, it's one of the best albums of 2005.The Arcade Fire are from Montreal and before the making of this album several family members of the band died, hence the title 'Funeral' but also the very dark tone of the album.There is sound everywhere: drums, bass, distorted guitar but also violins that sometimes fill in musical space and sometimes double up with the bass, giving it a very pumping sound.The singing is very haunting, not neat but fittingly for the songs. 'Rebellion (Lies)' is just one of the many great songs on this album so get it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond bad","review":"Some the worst singers I've heard. Both male and female voices are jerky, uneven, out of tune... No melodies, bad instruments. A complete failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Melody is SUPPOSED to be an important aspect of music....","review":"....unless you think Lou Reed is god. In which case, you might think that this album is the bees knees that the critics have described it as. Yes, it's well packaged, laid out, presented..a nice little artistic theme throughout...but guess what? The music ISN'T GOOD!!!! Underneath all the pretention and hype, lie songs that just aren't good!! And vocals that are virtually unlistenable. I might not give this album only 1 star, because some of the intstumental aspects of a few tunes are cool, but there are so many glowing reviews from the sheeple on Amazon that SOMEONE needs to give the potential buyer a friggin' reality check. This album is #14 on Amazon? THIS ALBUM IS #14 ON AMAZON!!!!! Proves how easily so many are swayed. Open your ears, wash the residue of the Pitchfork review out of you sponge like brain, and listen to the CLIPS for GOODNESS SAKE before buying this."},{"rating":"1","title":"if you subscribe to NME, buy this album","review":"if you're the type of person that buys albums after reading a lot of hype without having heard any actual music (i.e. those who own albums by elefant, stellastarr, etc.), then this album is for you. beyond calculated, it's like somebody conducted a focus group on what's popular in indie rock and came up with this. take \\"Neighborhood #4 - 7 kettles\\" for example, the album's painfully awkward \\"dance track\\", undoubtedly a response to the focus group's finding that dance-y stuff is currently \\"in\\". the album's song titles outdo even coheed and cambria in pretentiousness. the whole endeavor is a virtual homage to the city of omaha. do yourself a favor don't buy this garbage because you will think it's a masterpiece for 36 hours and then never listen to it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't hear it.","review":"OK, I don't get it. This album is noisy, odd, and disjointed, and the vocals are weak and annoying. Am I missing something? It didn't impress me when I bought it, so I put it aside for a few months. I justed picked it up again today, after reading an article about the band in a recent issue of MOJO. I just don't hear anything that impresses me at all. I'd nominate this for most overrated album of the new century."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that enjoyable","review":"I was recommended this album by Amazon, and read all the great reviews, so figured I'd give it a shot. So I get it yesterday, throw it in...and man, it's bad. Not awful, but just bad. The rifts are decent - reminds me a bit of Neutral Milk Hotel - but the lead singer is just awful. Just thinking about his voice gives me a migraine. In the end, I'm going to go against the grain and say move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Artsy fartsy indie rock at its most pretentious","review":"Besides a couple good songs, this much ballyhooed \\"critics darling\\" of a band's new album is nothing to write home about.Annoying, smug, whiney vocals.Obscure, abstract song titles.Threadbare hooks.Probably makes the Neutral Milk Hotel clones, the Decemberists, proud."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Album I've Never Heard","review":"This \\"Funeral\\" album got it's share of hype, but it really amounts to nothing more than tripe.This work has been mentioned in Top 10 lists, album reviews, on Amazon, etc. I reviewed each song from \\"The Funeral\\" here on Amazon, and I wouldn't spend a single penny at a BMG blowout on it. I needed a funeral for my ears, as the lead vocals are painful at best. The album, a limp-risted work, sounded like a cross between Queen and Modest Mouse, and that's probably an insult to Brian May. The music isn't that good. If this sounds like your bag, go get this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland.....Bland.....Bland......Bland","review":"If this is what passes for Indie music today, the scene is in for a world of hurt. My god is this horrible. This album gets a lot of hype from people who have yet to see their manhood drop. It'll come someday, but please don't fluff this album. Whiny, pretentious, even geigh. If you want to see some real Canadian filth, watch Canadian Bacon. RIP John Candy...I wish you would of taken these guys out when you had the chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"If you want something, don't ask for nothing\\"","review":"The first time I listened to Funeral, I was confused. Did I find something I absolutely loved, or was I weirded out by his wavering voice? I didn't know, but I was intrigued by the gorgeous soaring piano on \\"Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels)\\". So I put it on again. And again. And again.And now Funeral is one of my all-time favorite records. And I mean seriously. There is nothing like an album that you can put on and become completely immersed in, and Funeral is one of those. There are parts where it is beautiful, where it is raw, where it is melancholic, and where it is anthemic.It's one of those albums that I have to listen to in order. I can't just listen to a track here and a track there. But if I did have to pick a few favorites, they would be \\"Une Annee Sans Lumiere\\", \\"Neighborhood #2 (Laika)\\", and \\"Wake Up.\\"But seriously, just put it on and let it go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Lord!","review":"Funeral is this year's You Forget It In People for me. It's an album that's bound to have its share of detractors since it's gotten hyped to the point where it's easy for someone to become turned off from the start. And Funeral really didn't sink in until I gave it a few listens. It's a gorgeous record, a complete explosion of some of the most densely constructed beautiful sounds to hit indie rock in a long time. To write them off as another \\"orchestral pop band\\" milking The Soft Bulletin, you're missing the point. The Arcade Fire present a completely frenzy of emotionally wrought songs that get tear ducts working. The first song \\"Tunnels\\" is a fabulous opener, one that slowly builds to a point of absolute release. \\"Power Out,\\" \\"Laika,\\" \\"Crown Of Love,\\" and \\"Rebellion\\" are all gems, and the final tune \\"In The Backseat\\" will have you sobbing if you're not already. Believe the hype this time, and pick this one up. Definitely the best of 2004."},{"rating":"2","title":"stop the comparisons","review":"I'm sick of seeing all of these reviews referencing 5 or so other bands/artists...the girl singer sounds like bjork? what? she's a melodic female singer with a girlish voice. and she's good...but not bjork.this truly is a great album but it's not because they sound like other people, they are great because they are original and have created something powerful.if there are any comparisons to be drawn i would say it is loosely to the Pixies because of the male/female vocal contrasts, the range of emotion, the mystery, and the unique style. They are the sound of a generation bursting with creative energy and talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Work At Starbucks And I Love The Arcade Fire","review":"Are you are wearing a brand-new pair of distressed lo-rise Diesel jeans, a ringer t-shirt with a silly 1970s logo printed on it, and perhaps a pair of suede Pumas? This is the ideal soundtrack to match your outfit, then: bland, trendy consumer product for your \\"alternative\\" lifestyle. The shrewd critical ears at Pitchfork named this the #1 album of 2004, and I'm sure the songs are soon to appear on \\"The O.C.\\" No doubt this record's in heavy rotation right now at all the Urban Outfitters stores. Enjoy!Soundwise, most of the tracks owe a big debt to Yo La Tengo (ambient guitarscapes) and Neutral Milk Hotel (string section, goofy/vulnerable lyrics). It seems a shame to compare either of those great bands to the Arcade Fire, however, except to suggest your money would be better spent on \\"Painful\\" or \\"In The Aeroplane Over the Sea\\" instead of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"So many people whose taste I respect told me this was a brilliant new sound from an exciting new band, so I bought it sound unheard.I played it 4 times, sitting and listening all the way through without distraction. I don't get it. Nopthing about this appeals to me. It sounds (to me)like pretentious mishigosh run through a blender and then poorly mastered.I must be missing something. But it's not this CD; I gave it away to a friend who tells me he likes it a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Sing a Note","review":"This band's lead singer is perhaps the worst I have ever heard. The musicians play their instruments well, and the production is good, but this guy cannot sing a note."},{"rating":"1","title":"A love it or be bored by it band/album","review":"There are obviously a lot of fans of this album, and they all rate the most glowing reviews as \\"helpful\\". I can't say they are wrong, but for me, my advice is to listen to them on Youtube before you buy, or buy a few tracks from Amazon before you commit. At least 3 songs. The lead singer's voice may sound intriguing on the first song, but it never changes. You may love it, or it may just wear on your nerves with its winey-ness. The echo-chamber effect and fuzzy overlay may be magical or monotonous. I am certain that I will be attacked now by the true believers, who will insist that either a musical idiot or that I like heavy metal or something. But I am just saying this album will likely not leave you thinking \\"it's pretty good\\". It will be either \\"Incredible\\" or \\"I guess it was okay\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the last guy said","review":"This album is so overrated, and more frustrating is the fact that the only great song on here is greatly overlooked (\\"Tunnels\\"). I will go so far as to say that these guys will never inspire me again, because any time the first song on your first major album is the only good song on the record, chances are you don't have anything more to offer. U2 must be trying to act hip by playing Arcade Fire before their live shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"The obvious debut of the year in my opinion.......","review":".......and it seems in everyone elses as well. This record a consistent modern day masterpiece of moody indie rock. They're also Canadian, which seems to be a big plus nowadays in indie rock. From bands like Broken Social Scene to more little known acts like Raising the Fawn, Canada just keeps producing great band after great band. But getting back to the record, \\"Funeral\\" is simply stunning from start to finish. There are obvious standouts like the majestic opener in \\"Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels)\\", and the pulsating \\"Neighborhood #3 (Power Out)\\", but really every track on here will blow you away sooner or later. When people say it is the best record released on Merge since \\"In the Aeroplane Over the Sea,\\" I have a hard time arguing against it. Really worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"Having seen the band live with U2 back in 2005, I knew they were good. I have been adding their cd's to my collection ever since. This is their best one. \\"Arcade of Fire\\" is fantastic & is the song that kicked off the U2 concerts in most cities!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Montreal Recommendation","review":"If you like this album, I would also recommend that you try music from another Montreal band called Les Cowboys Fringants. They have a similar Quebec folk music base that is meshed into great indie rock like Arcade. The only drawback is that they sing in Quebecois (French), so I don't understand a lick of what they're saying. Also, Amazon charges for their CD's like they are imports (how hard is it to get something from Canada to the US?!?!), so I'd try and find some cheaper MP3 downloads, but well worth the money."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:W,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"card-container"},R=["disabled"],H={key:0},B={key:1};function M(a,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return i(),o("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",O,[(i(!0),o(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(i(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(i(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(i(),o("span",B,"Loading...")):(i(),o("span",H,"See more"))],8,R)):b("",!0)])}const x=d(C,[["render",M],["__scopeId","data-v-13911472"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/20.md","filePath":"guide/20.md"}'),N={name:"guide/20.md"},G=Object.assign(N,{setup(a){return(e,n)=>(i(),o("div",null,[v(x)]))}});export{P as __pageData,G as default};
