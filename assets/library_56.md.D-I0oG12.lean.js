I didn't gain any superhero powers, but I don't expect a simple T-shirt to endow me with the ability to fly or shoot lightning bolts with my eyes. That would be silly.Only one small issue keeps me from awarding this shirt the coveted 5-star review. I'm not convinced that the Alpha Wolf (the top dog) is a wolf at all.

While at the fair the Black Knight approached and wanted to battle, I withdrew my sword of wonderful power but there was no need. The wolves howled and jumped from my shirt, ready to defend their master. When all was said and done, the Black Knight was running back to his 1988 hatchback and I had three new best friends.

Two; there is no design on the back which is my preference for wild animal design t-shirts so I actually bought two and cut the front of one out and sewed it onto the back of the other one.

I was very feminine, the kind of girl who loved ruffles, pink high heels and collected Precious Moments statues. I thought it would be fun to wear this cute tee. A bad mistake. First, I noticed dark, thick hair sprouting on my chin. I went to my beauty shop but there wasn't enough wax in the world to keep this beard from crawling over my face. My biceps started bulging like miniature mountain wolves themselves. I found I needed to go to the bathroom standing up, rather awkward in the corporate ladies room because I kept leaving the seat up.

The 3 Wolf design obviously accounts for the unrelenting hounding by submissive nymphets - what can't be so easily explained is the resulting enhanced reproductive function.

Here is where giant oil tankers and cargoships are dismantled on sandy beaches by scores of bare-footed labourers under primitive and dangerous conditions. Roland Buerk, BBC South Asia correspondent, describes vividly and with sense of detail how ships end their life and become again a mass of raw material, a source of meagre income for young men from the poorest areas and of wealth for the fortunate few. The grim story is told with poetic force and a fatalist note - maybe just a bit too much of that. But as a tale of how globalisation works in practice today it is more powerful than most."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below Average","review":"This book was pretty disappointing.

It felt like you really only get a taste of what a humanitarian and enviromental disaster ship breaking in Bangladesh and India really are. It reads almost as if it is a \\"day in the life\\" book, mainly because it focuses on the dismantlement of one particular ship.

It is only incidently about apparitions. In fact, Kauffman concedes without discussion that the apparitions are supernatural (!) but assumes they must be demonic since they are reported to say things that sound Catholic. He complains that the apparitions have not been subject to the testing of spirits described in 1 John, but he gives no exegesis of that passage to justify its being applied to situations its author could hardly have had in mind. I wish Kauffman would have given more credit to the Church which has placed apparitions under careful scrutiny and rejected most. I enjoyed Kauffman's personal story of growing up Catholic and having a shallow magical form of Marian devotion. It should serve as a reminder that we need to teach our children well. Otherwise they will be vulnerable to shallow seductive teachings -- including protestant fundamentalism."},{"rating":"1","title":"A distillation of Mariophobia","review":"It is a commonplace among many Protestants that Catholics honor Mary \\"too much\\". What is never discussed is how much honor is \\"just enough.\\" Writers like Kauffman make is clear that *any* amount of honor given Mary is \\"too much.\\" They are fixed in a phobia and regard her with such horror that all expressions of devotion to the one of whom Scripture said \\"all generations will call me blessed\\" are waaaaay too much. In other words, Mariophobic books like this tell us more about the author than about the subject. Reading it is like being told by a teetotaler that a sip of wine or a glass of beer is alcoholism. It is like being told by an anorexic that a normal meal is gluttony. Catholic devotion to Mary is simply normal, human and healthy, like honoring one's mother.

Having the twinlaser is great. It shows where the kerf of the blade will be on the piece you are cutting. The laser was dead on, which is great since I never used a miter saw before. However, the switch for the laser does not work well. The switch is spring loaded to keep the drain off the batteries. You need to \\"flick\\" it the right way to get it to operate. This is a pain because it is under a dust cover, probably to prevent sawdust from getting inside.Overall the switch problem is overcome by the fact that the saw had all of the features I wanted It does a great job for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laser problems","review":"I purchased this saw despite the earlier feedback about laser problems; I figured that the reports were old and that the problem had been addressed. No such luck. The lasers worked for a day before the left one went out. Nice saw otherwise, except for the extension table and fence. Back it goes.UPDATE: After looking into it a little further, the problem became obvious, and will eventually happen to you: the laser wires are positioned very close to the saw blade, and are protected only by a thin flexible plastic tube. If a small piece of wood is caught by the blade and spun inside the right-hand side of the blade housing, it can hit the wires at the point where they enter the housing, and cut them.The wires need to be better protected or moved."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE LASER DOES NOT WORK","review":"The laser does not work.

So I called Porter Cable, and after half an hour and several different phone numbers, They told me that if the saw is \\"giggled to much\\" that the wires to the switch may come loose.

I returned the book via Amazon's process, and am waiting for confirmation that my money has been refunded in full.

Hers is a quiet, intelligent performance which deservedly got an Oscar nomination. Leigh fooled the New York film critics who gave her their top accolade as Best Actress! Yuck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious film, Leigh's character is awful","review":"I did not like this movie at all. It was tedious getting through the entire film. I am a fan of Jennifer Jason Leigh, but the character she was portraying was awful. I kept hoping it would get better, that Leigh's character, Sadie, would redeem herself, but she never did. She seems to have no positive attributes. Sadie is an alcoholic drug addict who uses people and has no talent. A curious thing about the film was that with each performance, the entire song was shown/played. This was fine during Georgia's (Mare Winningham) performances as the songs were pleasant, but this was absolutely terrible and unbearable during Sadie's performances. Especially when she does a cover of a Van Morrison song, which must have close to 10 minutes long. This movie does not seem to have a plot, but instead simply shows a part of each of the sister's lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad I turned it off halfway through!","review":"I tried to watch this poor excuse for a film for about an hour.

I'm dumbfounded by the reviewers who didn't care for Jennifer Jason Leigh's performance; I thought it was stunning. On the other hand, I found Mare Winningham thoroughly dull -- she hardly moves a facial muscle in the entire movie, and isn't much of a singer for a supposedly wildly popular star. I also question those who refer to Leigh's character as lacking talent; Leigh's performance of the Van Morrison tune \\"Take Me Back\\" is riveting, goosebump stuff. I saw this as a story, not of a talentless younger sister, but one who -- as her brother-in-law puts it -- is an original, without malice, while her sister is neither. The only slow parts of the film are some of the unnecessesarily drawn-out musical numbers; since Winningham can barely sing, why give us four full minutes watching her do nothing but stand on a stage and sing poorly?Strongly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the underrated \\"BASS\\" releases of all time!","review":"TRACK LISTING:1.

Just a few notes into her songs, and you start to sing along with her. Julia Rich--Awesome and Amazing--!! You must here her live with the Glenn Miller Orchestra when you can. You to will be an instant fan of all her music"},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money - find something else","review":"The amazon web site indicates this will work with newer versions of Win but it does NOT work with Win 7 - which is all there is now a days.

The installer gives the option of installing powerdesk, ghostsurf, and others. Do yourself a favor when installing it and choose the option for a custom install, then don't add the extras, just systemsuite. If you wish to add ghostsurf or something else later, just run the installer again.I believe the negative reviews here are due to people installing every program the suite allows you to install. Vcom made a mistake by packageing so many extras, the average user doesn't know what to install and just grabs everything. Just get what you need, the main systemsuite program, antivirus, and firewall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work","review":"I've bought the two previous versions of this software (going back to when it was called Fix-It Utilities) and never had a problem. But now a new company, V-Com, has taken over the product, and their first revamp, version 5.0, doesn't work. At least, it would not install itself on my Windows XP system - I kept getting error messages saying that the program could not be activated. I had to uninstall it and return to v. 4.0.

The Promise Ring remain one of the foremost pop-punk/emo bands around, and this debut CD is still their best. Straightforward, catchy, and undeniable -- this CD moves from deeply emotional melodies [the wonderful \\"A Picture Postcard\\"] to the kind of frenetic punk beats that dare you to jump up and down [\\"Red Paint\\", \\"Everywhere in Denver\\"].

Normally I'm not one to go out and buy an album based on recomendations and without personally listening to it, but this one time, I did. I didn't like it. Ok, I'll be fair, there are 2 songs that have some good points (good meaning-- they don't hurt my ears). In those songs, I can tell that the lead singer possibly DOES know how to sing, but for some reason tries to sound waaaay too whiney and off-tune on every other note. Why? 'Cause it's emo? Stylish? I don't know. If you reallyreally have to try them out, at least buy the CD used and burn the two somewhat decent songs before selling it to an unknowing friend.

Every Fall, my hair starts falling due to the weather changes and extensive staying in the sun and swimming pools. This shampoo not only stops the hair loss, but makes my it look unbelievable.

They are best known for their music from the 1981 to 1985 period with the Original five, Andy, Simon, John, Nick and Roger. This features their biggest commercial hits, the great chessiness of Girls On Film (still my favorite Duran song to this day), the driving Hungry Like the Wolf, the teeny bop favorite Save a Prayer, the funk of The Reflex and the driving A view to a Kill. BUt I Want to say something in my opinion Duran has been BETTER after this period, their albums more thoughtout and better written. Just look at this compilation, 3 of the better songs on Decade are after this period. \\"Notorious\\" is a brilliant piece of funk, \\"I Don't Want your love\\" can have you dancing all night and \\"All She Wants Is\\" has one of the coolest synths I've ever heard.

They are average folk and that adds to the charm of the book.Even though Second-Time Cool: The Art of Chopping Up a Sweater is a very thin book, there are lots of ideas that can be generated if you are the kind of person who can be inspired by visual cues to imagine your own creation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I was very disappointed in this book.

If you like Cyndi Lauper (and that was the first concert I ever went to) or maybe Madonna in Desperately Seeking Susan, you might like this book for inspiration.

There are also scenes of lions eating other lions, and a mother leopard ate her cub since there was no other food for her to eat.I gave it a four because most of the fighting was between lions and hyenas and not from what probably be cooler fights like between lions and crocidiles.

It took me about 90 minutes to put this together by myself. The directions are difficult to follow, because they are poorly illustrated. The suggestion of using plastic ties, to center the jumping mat, was a life-saver. I simply used twine and it worked just fine. It would be best to have a second person to help put it together. Overall, we are very pleased with how much the kids enjoy it and how solid it feels."},{"rating":"2","title":"My boys' LOVE this trampoline....","review":"I have two boys ages 21 months and 3 years and they both LOVE this trampoline!!! It was their favorite Christmas present by far. It's great exercise for them, it plays cute music, and it doesn't take up a large amount of space. It did take my husband and I a good 2 hours to put it together, but it was well worth the headache!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I got this at a house sale and the kids loved it","review":"I picked this toy up at a house sale and can attest to its good construction and fun. Our kids and frankly any friends that come over all have a go at it on this mini tramp. It gives them something to do and fidget with and frankly when they want to sit on thier butts all day with tv and video games this is a good thing. I'm lucky I didn't have to assemble it as it was already assembled but good toy for kids to get some excersise with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good in theory, not in real life.","review":"When I first saw this I thought it was awesome. A way to combine exercise and learning. Only problem is, it takes forever to set up, plus it is more helpful if you have another person helping you with the cord. The sensor/string attached it to fell off and rendered it educationally useless. We had to take it apart when we moved and both my husband and I are dreading putting it back together...not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great jumper for 4 and 7yr olds.","review":"This is not a toy for one person to put together. With that said, you should know it doesn't have the best directions, but they were good enough so you can get it together. The sensor on the bottom also took some adjusting but does work well, as well as it has rubber gromits that hold the bungee cord in place.Kids love it! It has been fantastic and every child who comes over gets right on it and jumps to their hearts content. Even with the tv on, they are jumping and loving every minute of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Toy with an amazing price tag","review":"My daughter just turned two last week and has been begging me for a trampoline. My brother and sister in law found this and sent it to her. She absolutely loves it. I was worried she would not be big enough but it is perfect for her. She loves to hold on to the handles and jump. She really enjoys the music that can accompany it. Before we received it they sent us the reviews so we were prepared for how difficult it was to put together. It wasn't that it was so difficult or so many steps. It was that the directions that accompany it are not very good and you have to do a trial and error using the pictures. It took us 1 hour and 20 minutes to put it together. You will need to people when you are putting the trampoline part on. Well worth the frustration to put it together. It is the first toy I have found that my daughter is interested in everyday for a sustained period of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kids love it!!","review":"We just got this trampoline a few days ago, and everyone loves it! My one year olds are able to get on it and jump, my 4 year old really enjoys the games and the silly sounds it makes when she jumps, even my 8 and 9 year olds are having fun with it, since it holds up to 80 lbs. We have it inside, so at night when they have all the extra energy, I send them to bounce. My one year olds have sensory problems, so the input that they get from this is really good for them. I do think the colors are a bit bright, but it seems like they thought of every possible safety hazard, as everything is covered and padded. It does require two adults to put together though, but assembly only took about 25 minutes. I am really happy with this toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great inexpensive combo.","review":"Unlike the previous negative review, I have had nothing but success with this rod. I bought the combo from a K-Mart on recommendations and did not have high expectations. I added a new spool of 8 lb fireline. With this combo I have caught plenty smallmouth,largemouth,crappies,sunfish,perch, and one 5 lb catfish. I have used the same line for about a year and a half and have had no problems. This rod and reel have been thrown in the back of my truck, my dads truck, several closets, two garages. Note I said thrown... This thing has had no problems still going strong. For 22-30 dollars you CANNOT beat this combo for beginner or an experienced fisherman. I bought this as a backup and currently use it as my go to rod. GET IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"¡''¡'''@#%~+*&^%","review":"If your wire gets tangled you untangle it. If the tangle is too messy you cut the wire. If it gets sucked into the gears and bearings inside the spool you can sometimes get it out by cutting the wire, but sometimes you have to open up the spool and clean out the wire from the moving parts inside. However, if this is not possible it goes in the trash.After two minutes using this reel (and rod) the wire got tangled, sucked into to the spool and it was not possible to open and fix. I have been fishing with my 8-year old daughter many times, however, this time all she got out of the experience was that she learned a few new words (but she got no fish). If you like wasting time, money, and enjoy aggravation, buy this product; If not, don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very helpful","review":"My son and I read this book together shortly after he was diagnosed with ADHD and it wasn't very helpful for either of us.

This book is written for all the children with ADD - and for their parents too.

When I saw this I thought it would be perfect plus he loved the schoolbus design. It was not what I would have expected. I have purchased many critter trail products in the past and have been very satisfied. Not this time. The first one I ordered was broken. THe plastic clips that locked the door in place were broken. Amazon was wonderful about the return and had a new to me the next day with no extra charge. After I got the new one I noticed how bad it was. The water cap keeps coming off the water bottle. The easy open lid intended for easy cleaning won't stay shut. The handle pops off and the plastic is paper thin. The only good thing is that it can connect to their other cages so you don't have to worry about empty water bottles and hatches that pop open. It does make a nice hideaway for the hampster"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice for transport but a bit small as habitat","review":"Our kids were very interested in getting this for our hamster. It would be fun if the wheels turned and/or the hamster could power the wheels by running. Our hamster seemed bored in the bus. Would be fun with other pieces connected or as a transport mechanism for your pet. It helps if you put a chew toy in the bus to keep your pet occupied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small Yellow Bus","review":"I was really excited to see this item in person. It's the cutest little school bus carrier! Its wheels actually roll so I wouldn't leave this unsupervised with a small child. As people have mentioned before the water bottle is pretty cheap. The little metal cap does continuously fall off so I would keep a second on hand just to be safe. Other than that this product is exactly as advertised! I would definitely make it an addition and (with tubes) connect it to your main cage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gerbils Can Escape","review":"Like the design and like keeping the food all in a separate pod like this connected with a tube, but after about a month, the gerbils figured out how to unlatch the door from the inside. The latch is unprotected and easy for them to release."},{"rating":"2","title":"i CAN do it","review":"My Dad bought me this book as a joke because, as the title says, \\"this girl can't cook\\". To my surprise I found tons of easy recipes that I can accomplish. And the fact that they are interesting and not common makes me actually look forward to throwing these recipes together. And surprise of all surprises... they're edible!! I'm right proud of myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cd that never gets old.","review":"If I could take 3 cd's to a desert island with me, this would be one of them.I've had it for years and I still listen to it at least once a week.What a great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Begin at the BEGINning","review":"The driving force with which the feedback fills your ears to start of the lead track on this album make it my favorite R.E.M. tune of all time. WARNING! Do not play this song while driving a motor vehicile. This ranks as one of the most drop-the-hammer-esque songs ever written. Buy the album. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's made my life richer.","review":"I own all their albums up through \\"Hi-Fi\\", and find this to be as good as anything else from the IRS years. Everything from \\"Murmur\\" to \\"Document\\" is really strong, and this 4th album of their first five is no exception. The only real hit here is \\"Fall On Me\\", but who hasn't heard \\"Superman\\" also? Other personal favorites are \\"The Flowers Of Guatemala\\", \\"What If We Give It Away?\\", and \\"Begin The Begin\\" is a great way to....begin. I'd hesitate to call this an essential album of theirs, but any fan of their mid-80's work should dig it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musically rich soundscape","review":"Solid REM effort from the get go. Begin the Begin kicks in a cd that contains pure artistic energy and beauty. I love this cd! The jangly guitars mix with the edgy guitars on the harder numbers and the melodic strumming on the slower ones create great moods; all add potent music to create great songs (lyrically I don't know what the songs mean, but you can still sing along with them).Hyena,I Believe,, Cuyahoga, Fall on Me, and the unlisted Superman continue the uptempo musical assault. The Flowers of Guatamala,What if we give it Away, and Swan Swan H slow it down in order to catch your breath. This is prime time REM."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first and favorite REM","review":"This was the first REM I ever had, I got it when it came out and proceeded to follow them to this day. Superman is a song everyone should sing whenever they feel down. And you should always put your arms out in front of you as if flying when they sing the chorus. SwanSwan H shows their darkside dark but beautiful. Every song on this album makes me feel good and makes me sing. Yehaw"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of their best...","review":"This is a great cd! Great mix of songs. Personal favorites: These Days, Superman, Fall On Me, and Begin the Begin. I can't believe I waited this long to get it. Just one more in a long line of great cds."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Chinese Food\\"--how apt","review":"Another reviewer called this album \\"Chinese Food R.E.M.\\", and I think that sums it up pretty well. I like when I'm listening to it, but with the notable exceptions of 'Swan Swan H' and 'Hyena', I rarely remember any of it. I think it's a good album, don't get me wrong--but it's the most consistent R.E.M. album, which means that the highs and lows have been smoothed out. It's certainly not my favorite, R.E.M. or otherwise. I prefer the other hit-or-miss albums, if only because the good ones are really good (and this is the 21st century. You can skip the bad ones.). Of course, 'Hyena' and 'Swan H' are great. I'll even put myself in the minority here and say I love 'Underneath the Bunker'.This one definitely beats 'Green', 'Murmur', 'Out of Time', and I never bothered to listen to anything after 'Monster' (though I liked that one). Overall, if you're new to R.E.M., you'll probably like this one. If not, you'll probably like it anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best R.E.M. Album","review":"The songs on this album are excellent, from the simple anthem \\"Cuyahoga\\" to the controlled chaos of \\"Just A Touch\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful experience","review":"This is a wonderful album. After several jangle-pop records, R.E.M. decided to delve into some more unique territory, and it works. Several tracks, namely \\"These Days\\" and \\"I Believe\\" are among R.E.M.s best. A must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"An 80&#65533;s College Radio Classic","review":"This album came from deep in the Reagan Era. For that generation of college radio listeners, it may just help you remember how much fun this music was and how good it still sounds today. It is upbeat, loud and fun. Life's Rich Pageant helped push this band into broader popularity, while it contains the raw edge of the first IRS Collections. It contains some of the best of this band, before they became mainstream and serious."},{"rating":"2","title":"A landmark album","review":"R.E.M.'s career divides neatly into two phases (so far) - the I.R.S. years, when they were college radio darlings, and the Warner Bros. years when they became a household name. \\"Life's Rich Pageant\\" is arguably their best work of the I.R.S. phase. Harder-edged than \\"Murmur\\" and \\"Reckoning\\", the songs have a new clarity, in part due to the up-front treatment on Michael Stipe's vocals. From the opening guitar of \\"Begin the Begin\\" this is the sound of a band reaching their peak. (I should say one of their peaks, but this album captures them at their hard-rocking best.) For all the ferocity of songs like \\"Just a Touch\\" there are some lovely quieter moments as well - \\"The Flowers of Guatemala\\", \\"Swan Swan H\\" in particular. \\"Underneath the Bunker\\" reveals a side of the band often overlooked - their sense of humor (fully realized on \\"Dead Letter Office\\").Of all the R.E.M. albums I own, \\"Life's Rich Pageant\\" is the one that spends the most time on the CD changer and it still sounds great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad REM release at all","review":"REM continue to rock on in their new rock groove in this album release. It's a enjoyable CD to listen to with great sounding songs and neat beats. Much has been said that I agree with in the other reviews. I quite enjoyed two songs in particular in this release and these were; Cuyahoga and What If we give it Away.Any REM fan will not have a problem with this album and should enjoy the songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Noisy cats indeed","review":"The first REM album I ever bought (though not until 1989), at still my personal favorite - maybe its because this is the way I always expected them to sound like? the greatest country rock album ever. if you don't have it, get it. Almost 100% 5 star reviews so far - you do the math."},{"rating":"2","title":"REM's First Attempt at Breaking the Alternative Barrier","review":"When I want to hear REM kick it, with a pure rock sound, all I have to do is pop this CD in and hear the first track-- Begin the Begin. Throw the headphones on and crank it up! If you don't have neighbors, take off the phones and crank up the subwoofer.This is a fantastic album, before Michael Stipe became Superman, and then Lost his Religion. A more studio sound than earlier albums, which has its pluses and minuses....One of my favorite albums in my collection. When I need to burn off some excess energy, this is the CD to do it. On the other hand, Fall On Me is one off their best ballads (also great in concert). A great song to come down from after Begin the Begin. My only complaint with this album is Underneath the Bunker-- what WERE they THINKING? I can't count the times that I've raced over to the CD player or remote to skip this stinky filler... Oh, well..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD","review":"This disc is the summation of the works done by REM through the years.

Begin To Make Political Statements Here","review":"On LIFES RICH PAGEANT, R.E.M. begin to make major political statements, even as, thanks to the production work of Don Gehman, they dig themselves out of the murk of FABLES OF THE RECONSTRUCTION, which had been recorded under very tense conditions. On the contrast, this CD is actually good for dancing to without consciously trying to be, although songs such as \\"Fall On Me\\" and \\"Cuyahoga\\" have a strong environmentalist message. The cover of the \\"sunshine pop\\" song \\"Superman\\" was clearly unnecessary, though, as the band's own songwriting can pretty much stand on its own. Nevertheless, the bandmembers' opposition to Indonesia's trumped-up 2005 drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist makes this CD an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Images aren't there in the digital download","review":"I wish the images would have been included in the download.

The transfer is beyond terrible. This film was originally shot on a very wide scope (like most spag westerns) and has a stack of tight focus shots. All of the above works against this full screen pan and scan version. Basically it's like trying to watch the movie through a pin hole.I'm glad I hired it first.

I remember WCCW only from watching it on ESPN and reading about it Pro Wrestling Illustrated, but to see the innovations that this territory brought to the wrestling landscape are incredible to say the least. Like most wrestling documentaries tragedy seems to overshadow the good feelings you get from the dvd.

I had a few laughs at the antics of performance artist Pastel, played by Jean Tripplehorne, and a few of Broderick's blind dates were amusing to watch, but most of the time I was torn between liking the characters (except the ones you're not supposed to like, the movie will make it obvious who they are) and hating their actions.

A great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Craig, But He's Funnier With Geoff Peterson & A Censor","review":"The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson is our fave TV show. Craig is hilariously irreverent and the funniest guy on late night by far. Just listen to the audience; Craig gets actual LAUGHS while the other guys predominantly get applause; like a pat on the head for being clever. Having said that, this DVD was nowhere near as funny as Craig's late night show. He needs Geoff; they complement each other like the new Laurel & Hardy, but funnier and contemporary and irreverent. This DVD was surprisingly lacking teeth. It's almost as if Craig needs a censor so he knows exactly how hard to ride the line. Still a fan, but his TV show is just better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This DVD was so disappointing. I purchased it based on the recommendation of the reviewers. First, it flips through three different locations, which is annoying. Secondly, it covers just the basics of presenting. Rapport requires far more advanced skills that are suggested by a reviewer. There is no significant content substance from an advanced speaker's prespective. While the presenter is very good in both style and delivery, you can glean this information off any public speaking website. His language skills, humor and pace are excellent, but when you boil down the common knowledge content, you feel a bit ripped off for paying the hefty price of $99.00. Id' give the content a 1 star. His style is deserving of more, but the price really should have been around $59.00 in my opinion. So I'm giving the product only 2 stars. Also, his marketing staff should make it clear this is beginner stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless if you're not using Power Point 2007","review":"I purchased this DVD and have had MAJOR difficulties reproducing the results that are being demo'd on the DVD. I am pretty tech savvy and I am finding myself completely frustrated at the moment. I have watched DVD multiple times and I'm following along step by step, yet it's not working. I have a more recent version of PPT, but that really shouldn't be an issue in my mind. Too bad it's too late for a refund. Give it shot if you own PPT 2007, but I wouldn't bother wasting your money if I were you. It's hardly worth the aggravation for the steep price that you are paying. Sorry to say that I am very dissatisfied. So my recommendation is to not waste your money and look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A minor miracle","review":"Michael Harris' The Chieu Hoi Saloon is one of the most harrowing depictions of a character in crisis that I've ever read. Denis Lehane once described noir as working class tragedy, where the characters \\"don't fall from great heights, they fall from the curb.\\" Harry Hudson, The Chieu Hoi Saloon\`s protagonist, falls from curb to gutter to sewer, and somehow manages to keep falling. The stakes are small, there are no hamhanded plot points, there's just this one broken and heartbreaking character doing the best he can to play with the hand he's been dealt. It's a minor miracle he even manages to survive the hell of his day-to-day existence; that he does so with a kind of grace and courage is evidence of how wonderful a writer Harris is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old Hardware Ver 1.","review":"Pros: Can print using LPR(this is what I'm using), IPP or SMB.

I can't think of a group or artist who still puts out great material like in their prime. This is not a good album. At all. It just sounds wack. In the Cd insert there is a letter from a fan who asks them to stop over producing their albums. To do an album like Beach Boy's Party. They should. Or somehting. They may get a good pitchfork review and fans loving them and magazines saying how awesome they are, but this is a really bad album. Don't buy it. Run away. See em live... They still sound good live. But as far as albums go...this was a real dissapointment. Life is short. Find another band. There is tons of stuff out there like Belle and Sebastian. Granted they had some outstanding albums. They should break up. Just stop. And for everoyne giving this 5 stars...please. You should stop writing reviews becasue you look real dumb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"This album is better than Catastrophe, and it really does keep getting better with each listen. I think the reason is because it's a long album, and all of the songs are very substantial. I keep noticing new moments of subtle greatness with each listen. Yes, it's upbeat, and yes, I do kind of miss the blueness of their older stuff. But to say it's not good or even sucks just makes one look like a musical illiterate. It's impossible to not like this stuff, or at least appreciate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Album","review":"This is the 2nd Belle and Sebastien album I've purchased, with the first purchased in the 90's (\\"Boy with the Arab Strap\\"). This album has a lot of hooks and a great retro sound (60's modernized). I always liked Boy with the Arab Strap, but never enough to buy their follow up albums. This album has me wanting to revisit their other past albums. Overall, this album has great pop sounds. A few songs initially came off as too corny, but I grew to love those as well. Maybe coincidentally or not, I hear slight influences of Nick Drake, Velvet Underground w/Nico, Kinks, and maybe some Trex. Not really a criticism, but don't expect the ballads to be intensely sad - I would describe them as pleasantly depressing (if that is possible). Overall, one of the best albums of 2007."},{"rating":"2","title":"Near Pop Perfection (4 1/2 stars)","review":"This disk barely sounds like the band we've come to know as Belle & Sebastian. Even compared to the then thought of departure album Dear Catastrophe Waitress. On first spin this album may come as bit of a shock and no doubt will detract the 'fans' wanting a return to the 'sinster' days. However, what the band has produced is nothing short of miraculous pop. At times hey harken to the New Pornographers ('the blues are still blue') while at others sounding like a band straight out of the 70's. Most of the songs are so catching and infecting you'll have them in your head for days, but not in an annoying way. In a way that makes you hunger to hear the album once again. So many great songs on this disk and it may stand as the best album of 2006 and definitely the second best album of Belle & Sebastians career. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"i'm lovin it","review":"i just got this album and i friggin love it. i absolutely love it. i listened to samples, then got it. and i love it. have i said that enough?its a flashback to the story telling songs and the sound of the '70's. which i love. they're like Paul Rudgren and Carole King's lost kids. and in the front of the album booklet, it has what i think are notes from fans and answers from the band members. and this just adds to thgeir coolness. i don't have any other albums of theirs, but their other albums are definitely getting added to my wish list.they've just become a favorite of mine. i doubt that they could put out something sh*tty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This record is full of secrets and musical allys to pursue.

The quality and momentum of the music is nice on this album. I have read that this album was more produced than the others. And I love it! When I first listened to this my boyfriend and I were driving 30 miles south of Joliet from Chicago on Christmas Day. It was a melancholy day, with snow blowing by while we drove through the cornfields. This album impressed me...actually made me sing along since it had the liner notes in the CD. Seriously, how many CDs make you want to take out the liner notes so you can sing along? Also, what I found interesting is that the liner notes also included countless questions from, what I assume, are random fans that were answered in writing by Belle & Sebastian. Quite entertaining, I thought. All in all a great album. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Recommend","review":"I first came to know Belle & Sebastian when my pal Patrick put \\"Lazy Line Painter Jane\\" on for me. As I was preparing for a bus trip to Los Angeles, he said the song reminded him of me (you will find a boy tonight/ on the first bus out of town). I bought a few Belle & Sebastian albums since and enjoyed them but it was Dear Catastrophe Waitress which hooked me, and then lo and behold this album came out.The Life Pursuit is just as good as Waitress and then some. Great tracks like \\"Sukie In The Grave Yard\\" and \\"The Blues Are Still Blue\\" show what a great and diverse band this is. The music kicks it, the lyrics are completely witty and the songs are actually very catchy. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums this year!","review":"First of all, let's get one thing out of the way...this is a much different type of album than previous B&S; albums. You know what? Who cares! This album is fantastic. Every song on it is catchy and well-crafted, the sound is adventurous and it never seems to get old.Eventually, every band has to either quit writing songs celebrating teenage angst and risk alienating their core fanbase or keep writing them and look silly as they get older. Fortunately, it looks like Belle and Sebastian has taken the latter route.Highlights include \\"Sukie In The Graveyard\\" (just try and get the opening out of your head), \\"The Blues are Still Blue\\", and \\"White Collar Boy\\". But literally every song is memorable in one way or another. Buy this album now! You won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"belle and sebastian at their best","review":"i didnt think they could top push barman to open wounds, but they did it, and in empahtic fashion.

Always re-inventing themselves to never sound stale or dated. For ten + years now they have putting out stellar records, I mean why dissect their canon of songs, just get everyone of their albums, or whatever, download the crap and be happy you did and that lame dude or dudette next to you can listen to their revolting U2.We audiophiles can rejoice for having B&S; in our collection"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is where they lost me","review":"Okay, I'm not one of the B&S fans who expect them to be fey and wispy even when age and dignity would dictate otherwise. I followed them on all their weird journeys. I loved \\"Dear Catastrophe Waitress\\" and shook my head at all the bad things people said about it...but the seeds of this major disappointment were sown in there with the cutesy hooves in \\"Roy Walker\\"...this new album is first of all too long (it's a double on vinyl) and I can't BELIEVE there wasn't 5-6 songs that could be culled from it easily. There's a couple good tunes and melodies but mostly it just seems to be the band delighting in being a band..their playing is certainly at their best, but throwing in everyone's songs, regardless of quality, just to 'rock out' is not helping anyone. Stuart's songs are okay, but barely any muscle or hooks to the melodies. The end of an era, unless they straighten up. Who would of believed it, but the great B&S have worn out their welcome."},{"rating":"1","title":"overreaching and failing","review":"Sure, the production is over the top and Stuart's voice, gorgeous and not wanting for range when delivered delicately, is affected and approaches a caterwaul on many of these tracks. But the most damning critique I can give this ill-conceived mess of an album is that it seems that B&S; are trying to put out a companion album to their touring mates The New Pornographers.Think about AC Newman and Neko Case attempting to channel Murdoch and Campbell....it would be an embarassing disaster. The same holds true when the opposite is the goal.I had extremely high expectations for this album as I welcomed the shift in style heralded by DCW. This is not a further step in attempting to explore new areas by the band, this is a step into the abyss that somehow pleases a majority of critics. It happened with Radiohead, Wilco, and now B&S.; No thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh...mediocrity","review":"I won't complain that this does not sound like The Boy With The Arab Strap. I won't complain that it is overproduced (I don't think it is). Some of their best singles and b-sides got more production than the 500th run of Cats.However, this is just more uninspired dribble from Stuart Murdoch and his hipsters. Before listening to this outing I wondered what retro musical style they were trying to emulate this year. Sounds like they have moved on, just not much for me to go back and want to listen to again aside maybe Track 5 and Track 9.Boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"The End of an Era","review":"I was the biggest, hugest, most excited Belle and Sebastian fan, EVER. I even continued to follow them after Fold Your Hands, Child....which was not their best. Then they won me back with Catastrophe, which is one of their best. They made a great comeback. I ignored all the hipsters who were catching on to them too late without knowing what they were getting into. I watched everything get reissued and become less and less of a \\"secret\\". And all the changes in lineups and spinoffs. Now, I think with this album they've turned into a big crowd-pleasing bore. The songs are lively without life and the lyrics are mundane and cheesy. Maybe it's the production. Maybe it's the pressure. But guys, this ISN'T it. This is not the same band. And if this is your favorite album of theirs, you just don't get it. They need to call it quits and step back for a bit. I'm just disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"the problam...","review":"The problem with this album, and the one before it is that this is not the same B&S; that gave us such gems as \\"dog on wheels\\" & \\"Slow Graffiti\\". Over the years they've lost two band members, and it deffinetly shows. No matter how hard she tries, Sarah just can't take the place of Isobel.All the albums before Dear Catastrophe Waitress had that same producer which is why they all follow the same theme, a theme that their fans have grown fond of. After Isobel left and they changed to Rough Trade they lost their interesting side and became \\"croud pleasing\\". You cant really falt a band for wanting to reach an larger audiance (and therefore make more money) but you can fault them for being a poor pastiche of hits from the 70's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice.","review":"This is not If Your Feeling Sinister, and that's OK. It seems that Stuart has channeled Brian Wilson instead of Nick Drake for this one, and I'm really glad he did. The harmonies are amazing, the arrangement fantastic and the production is superb. This might be one of my favorite Belle & Sebastian records (along with Sinister and the Lazy Linepainter Jane EP). Belle & Sebeastian have become a perfect band who seem to play off each other beautifully. I'm glad to see that after all these years they can still make a new album that actually sounds new.

I would strongly suggest looking through a copy to verify its usefullness to what you want to do before investing money in buying it.It sets up the machinery and provides examples of methods to determine distance from a linearly defined boundary of paramaterized point sets. If this is what you need to do, then it will indeed be a useful book.However wider claims of great usefullness in analyzing general performance of businesses, or any other entities characterized by incomplete information and random variation, need to be accepted cautiously. Hence my warning that it will be of very limited usefullness to the majority of analysts, and it would be well to verify that it addresses the problem one needs to solve before buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ideal for Intermediate-level students","review":"I lived in Italy for two years as a college student and once spoke the language fairly well.

Their hits like 'Orange Crush' and 'Losing My Religion' still get played on FM radio stations everyday.But, unfortunately, their early years are overlooked for their more famous Warner Bros. recordings. And that's a real shame, because R.E.M.'s best music came from their years on the IRS label, which is now owned by Capitol.This set, 'Eponymous' is the set to own if you are just starting your R.E.M. collection. It's got all of the major early IRS recordings from 1983-1988. I can't get enough of songs like 'Radio Free Europe,' 'The One I Love' and 'It's The End Of The World As We Know It,' all of which appear on this set.And, Capitol gets tons of credit for remastering all of these classics.

There is no inside the INXS camp, just a odd story here and there about the band. They seem to miss all the facts. You would learn more about INXS in a behind the Music one hour special than in this book.Its seems it is more concerend about the scene in the 80s and the local band, tax laws, what they had to dinner yawn, yawn.All we wanted was there side of the story and sadley it missed all these points."},{"rating":"2","title":"Showing Your True Colors","review":"Fantastic!! Best personality coding book I have ever read!! Easy to understand and reads very quickly! She explains the different personalities using the color coding system of Blue, Green, Gold, Orange, with each color representing a different dominent personality. Easy to understand and to incorporate into everyday life. The example stories she gives in the book are fun to read and put it in the most simple form for relating to each personality. I found myself viewing people differently, in a more positive way, and figuring out just which color they would fall under. I work in a customer service business, and found the information in the book, helped me understand my co-workers as well as my customers much better!! Wonderful and motivational.

In todays competitive environment we have found that teamwork is something we all want, yet so difficult to obtain. It starts with knowing what it is that you \\"bring to the table\\". With Showing Your True Colors you are able to identify, understand and foster people to come together to share common goals. Whats so great about the book is that there is no \\"right or wrong\\", there is no \\"pinpointing\\" it is just who we are and we are all so valuable. I mostly enjoyed the Color Combinations which helps understand that not because we share our Primary Colors that means we are alike. As a True Colors Licensed Trainer this is \\"the Color Book\\".Looking forward to Mary's upcoming publication."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for everyone in the work place","review":"This is not only a great help for team building but it is a great insight into your own place in this work world"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Book","review":"A well written book.

The most believeable (and engaging) parts revolved around the football episodes and the narrator's relationship with Rachel; however, for me, the narrator's interactions with Bev did not ring as true as the rest of the storyline. Also, though the Christianity was sincere, it sometimes intruded unnaturally into the narrative (mostly toward the end). One other issue that detracted from the novel was when the coach kicks kids off the team for NOT fighting. Is this the action of a Christian coach? Even so, the characters are fully developed with both strengths and weaknesses. As the story progresses, the reader will easily predict where the plot is going; however, Jenkins does present a few surprises along the way. Overall, I can see this novel appealing to a wide audience--it has football, family relationships, and romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jerry B.

The plot--town fallen on hard times, star coach comes out of retirement to save school and spirit--is the very definition of cliche, and the entire book is basically an excuse for Jenkins to proselytize about the saving powers of Christianity. I knew it was going to be bad when I saw the blurb (from the highly esteemed literary review Sports Illustrated!) on the back cover: \\"Reading this book is like listening to a good country song.\\" Bleagh. The writing is so bad, the messages so offensive (you're a coward if you don't fight, the three important things in life are God, cattle, and football, etc) that I could barely force myself to keep reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Written by one who truly understands the field..","review":"As a student of Professor El-kikhia's Foreign Policy courses, I can address his almost uncanny knowledge and understanding of foreign policy and the Middle East in specific.

I own a audiophile quality audio gear and can affirm without no doubt that there is no audio difference between this 2010 and 1997 version. In fact, the remastering credits are exactly the same as the 1997 CD.

It's funky and it rocks. Sure, Mitch Mitchell might be a better drummer than Miles but Buddy's in the pocket groove is what Jimi needed on this disc and it meshes beautifully with Cox's funky bass playing.The track 'Machine Gun' is a tour de force of guitar playing. Only Jimi could pull off something like this. I love Mitch Mitchell's drumming but Buddy's backbeat really holds things down beautifully. The beginning of 'Power To Love' is pure Hendrix.This is probably my favorite 'air guitar' CD. It is no mistake that some of the best and most well known guitar players continue to cite Jimi as an influence. He was ahead of his time. I can't say this is his best recording but for me it's one of my favorites and will remain so.

Jimi goes out there and doesn't come back until the end of the show. I had a friend that didn't like Jimi (yes, these people do exist) but I converted him with this album.

The album captures a raw sound that is hard to capture in a studio. Band of gypsies is great also because you hear hendrix moving away from his 1960s sound at the perfect date-new year's eve 1969. This music has much more of a personal sound that his studios albums never quite managed to pick up on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Burning Desire","review":"One of the best.

Also, this is the album that helped bring rock and R&B together. Nevermind the incredible guitar solos on machine gun, what about the content?! Jimi knew how to recite poetry on the guitar as well as Beethoven with the orchestra. It's totally epic. This album is as essential to rock as anything by the Beatles and as essential to R&B/soul as anything by Marvin Gaye. But mostly it's cool and has really good songs. And Stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hendrix Funk","review":"Jimi Hendrix played a New Year's Eve show at the Fillmore East in New York without the Experience but a new band he dubbed Band of Gypsies. With Billy Cox on bass and Buddy Miles on drums, Mr. Hendrix's sound moved away from the psychedelic rock he was famous for to a darker, bluesier sound that was infused with r&b. The sound was definitely a forerunner for funk music. \\"Machine Gun\\" is a wicked track that has a deep and dense sound. \\"Power To Love\\" is a r&b flavored track while the album's closer \\"We Gotta Live Together\\" is an ode to a harmonious existence. The music from Band Of Gypsies is a departure from what he was known for and a progression in his musical styling. Unfortunately, he was never able to really expand on these sounds as less than a year later, Jimi Hendrix would lose his life to asphyxiation due to a drug overdose."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the best","review":"I certainly need not tell anyone how great Jimi was. Why explain the obvious? All that is left to debate is when, where and how was he best? This albumn gets my vote. Certainly not his most explosive or technical work but perhaps his most relaxed and truest to his soul. This is indeed different from his studio work with the Experience. This is headed toward funk with the help of Buddy Miles on drums and the occasional vocal. This is a master of his craft looking down another path. A path that he has travelled before but not in some time. This was recorded live on new year's eve 1969 closing a turbulent decade and opening one that Jimi sadly would himself leave much to quickly. The standards are here and some new stuff he tries out on what was i'm sure a captivated audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential for true Hendrix listeners","review":"This has got to be one of my favorite Jimi Hendrix records, primarily because it was the first time I had heard the legendary Buddy Miles.

He had giant ideas and they flowed through his hands tocreate an aural/visual landscape.At times the music will inform you, show you desolate plains of death shrouded in fog, cut through byflashes of deadly tracer fire, it will pick you up and throw you.You sit in the parking lot with the music ripping your mind and keep playingas the clock tics you late.

It is not a surprise that this compassionate, loving, submissive-to-God definition of a man flies in the face of the worldly view. Pres pours out his heart and will take some heat for doing so. However, as a 40 year-old father of three, I have walked down some of the same trails as Pres and received great encouragement from his book.

Her voice is a curious distillation of DIANA KRALL and GLORIA ESTEFAN and the musical personality (already hinted at the \\"Chicago\\" movie) feels home at the easy listening pastures.

I bought the cd to learn the music since I was going to see her concert. Her live performance was incredible, but the cd doesn't dissappoint. I was singing along right away. Queen Latifah's voice is beautiful, and so is she.

Song selection is bland.","review":"I loved Latifah's last offering. Her future is clearly in song and not hip-hop. That said, This album seems quite bland. While her voice will impress even the most staunch Jazz purists. Her song selection lacked the same \\"fire\\" The Dana Owens Album had. Perhaps, being 38 not 58 has something to do with my feeling like the song selection is lacking. But, my thought is that most of the people who are listening to Latifah are closer to my age. She preforms so well vocally that she deserves another CD but based on the song selection --I do not see this album doing well enough to warrant her getting another album. That would be a shame.Long live the Queen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great singing album","review":"Queen Latifah fails to dissapoint. There is nothing she can't do. She can rap, She can act, and she can SANG! With Trav'Lin Light, She takes on classic songs originally done by Phoebe Snow, The Pointer Sisters, 10cc, Billie Holiday, just to name a few and adds her own, new fresh spin to them. What bothers me is that when it comes to her singing, she does strictly covers which makes me wonder if it's easier for her to write rap lyrics than it is to write jazz, R&B; and easy listening lyrics. I think more original non-rap songs would be nice. Adding \\"I know where I've Been\\" fromHairspraywas a great way to close the album. The voice this woman has makes me wonder why she started out doing rap music in the first placeMy Top 5 tracks1. I'M not in love (Originally by 10cc)2. Poetry Man (Originally by Phoebe Snow)3.

In other words they were selling an item they didn't even have, and it was of sub-optimal quality. The 25 yard roll was actually several smaller lengths which raised my cost per item for resale, and some of the pieces had large holes and runs in them making them entirely unusable.

Adult. This is an incredible set of songs, one I have yet to tire of. And it hasn't aged a bit like some of their earlier material. I think it is the best the Boys have to offer. In terms of consistant songwriting, lush, rich, layered instumentation and production, and some of Neil Tennant's best vocal performances. Incredibly heartfelt and full of nuances. Every song on this disc is a winner. Nothing here that can be called \\"camp\\" or \\"ironic\\" ( things PSB have often catered to ). Behaviour is, along with \\"Very\\", the peak of the Tennant/Lowe partnership. They have since come very close at times to capturing what is in spades on Behaviour, but they have yet to better it, and I don't think they ever will. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"my fav pet shop album","review":"Behavior is my fav from them. I love the less disco sound on this one. Some of there stuff is to diso for me. This is a elctro pop gem. Every synth fanatic should own this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very mature album","review":"When I first purchased this album, I was just going into high school. I did not think too much of it then, considering I was addicted to the group's previous hits like 'Always on My Mind,' Oppurtunities,' and 'West End Girls.' Their sound matured as my taste did not. In my first year of college, I relistened to the album on a rainy day and fell in love with it. It is, in general, their darkest album, dealing with issues(AIDS, death) many people would rather not acknowledge. However, Neil's voice is so bitterly soulful in these songs and Chris Lowe's keyboarding is an audio masterpiece, one cannot help but enjoy them.'My October Symphony,' a personal favorite, is loaded with allusions to the Russian Oktober Revolution, and contains a string quartet. Interestingly enough, this song was the inspiration for Guns 'n' Roses 'November Rain.'This is, in my opinion, their best album."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Being Boring\\" says it all","review":"The Pet Shop Boys tweak their sound a bit here, bringing in an orchestra for a few songs and giving the guitars more prominence. But they don't seem to have had much fun doing it. The end result is an album that's far more impressive than involving. With the exception of \\"Being Boring,\\" a beautifully understated pop song, the Boys always sound as if they're holding something back. Even \\"How Can You Expect To Be Taken Seriously\\" sounds timid, despite the introduction of power chords. Superior versions of \\"Being Boring\\" and \\"Jealousy\\" can be found on \\"Discography,\\" so start there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Being boring indeed","review":"The lead track, \\"Being Boring,\\" has engendered affection over the years, but it is unmistakably ironic that a song with that title leads off an album of mostly plodding, sleepy, electro-elevator music. Most of the songs are boring. You'd have to be a hardcore PSB fan to find this a good album. For everyone else, this is the single for \\"Being Boring\\" and \\"How Can You,\\" and all the rest are B-sides."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"When I bought this CD at first, I didn't pay much attention to it .. but after hearing it over and over, I have grown much appreciation for what this CD brings ..

The best song of course is \\"JEALOUSY\\", and It alone justifying buying this CD at $10"},{"rating":"2","title":"not their best","review":"Don't get me wrong: this album is fine. still, something was missing.

The \\"Dramatists Play Service\\" on the front cover certainly tells us that that is what this is! Not a pamphlet! Not a short story! While reading it,you should try to envision it being performed by actors on a stage, live, in front of an audience (if some of you know what that means...) And, as such, it is really quite entertaining. I don't see it as more than that, but, then again, neither was \\"Strangers with Candy\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"nice and cheesy","review":"Sister Elizabeth Donderdock is unappreciated in her Squeamish township. (So as not to offend the Amish, the Sedarises replaced the \\"A\\" with \\"Squea\\". I'm sure no one suspects.) She is the only person who has the secret touch it takes to make the famous Squeamish cheese balls, but the town doesn't realize how important she is until she disappears. Although not David's best work, this play is a lot of fun to read and features a lot of good-natured silliness. On the otherhand, it appears difficult to stage. Make sure you have four good actors who can play male and female roles, Amish as well as alcoholic and can speak Ukranian."},{"rating":"1","title":"not up to the typical sedaris level","review":"I totally love both Amy and David Sedaris, but I have to say this was very disappointing, I'm not even sure why they published this.

This book opened my eyes to a whole new side of postpartum depression and how all women deal with it in different ways. Brooke Shields makes it okay for women to speak out about their feelings after delivering, even if they're not the typical \\"happy new mother\\" feelings. I highly recommend this book to any women who are pregnant or soon plan to become pregnant so that you are aware of things to look for and realize that it's okay to ask for help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seeing the truth","review":"So many millions of women suffer PPD. In fact depression is a very wide-spread problem in today's competitive society made only worse by the difficult economy we live in. So what makes Brooke Shields so special? Nothing. In fact with all her wealth she can get the therapy and support she needs that MILLIONS of others can never get. It's easy to go tell other people to go get help when you haven't a clue what it's like to not have the money to pay for it. Due to her lack of talent Brooke Shields has struggled greatly to not be just a has-been. She's a former child star who's famous for just being who she is. I felt this book was an attempt to stay famous just like all her constant announcements of her virginity did. When she got too old to continue lying about her virginal status (and there's no question anymore that she did lie about it), she had to find something else. If she didn't she and her horrible movies would have been long forgotten now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost","review":"After reading some of the reviews it is clear to me that many people who \\"like the book\\" are simply star-struck over Brooke Shields. Post Partum Depression is too important and serious of a subject to be literally exploited to bring publicity back to someone whose career is lost. Brooke's lack of talent and fading of her once incredibly photogeic beauty, has caused her to use her past PPD to up her career. I believe this because of her remark of how she'll forgive Tom Cruise if he comes and sees her in a play in England. The remark was very inappropriate and off the subject. It was made to promote her play and to make it look like her work is in the same category as Cruise's, which of course is rediculous.All this is a shame because the book could have brought a lot of intelligent debate over PPD, cures, causes, treatments, etc. Instead, look at what's going on in the media."},{"rating":"1","title":"No tears for Brooke","review":"Give me a break. Brooke Shields has more money than most Americans can earn in several lifetimes, and she certainly has more celebrity than her meager talent would deserve in a rational society. She doesn't need to drag in paying spectators from the Oprah-watching crowd to share her pain. Brooke has worn out her welcome as a public figure, so please, go live in private and leave the rest of us alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"ENOUGH!","review":"How long does Shields plan on banking in on her PPD? I am so sick of hearing about it. Now a book with a different cover and title? Enough! I tired of Brooke Shields years ago when her movies kept getting worse and worse. Yes she is argueably one of the most beautiful women in the world, but she is also inargueably the worst actress ever. I'm amazed that Shields is willing to keep making more and more money from her PPD. Where's her embarrassment? I will believe that she wrote this book (and continues to promote it) simply to help other women, as soon as I hear about her donating all the money she's making to the cause. Til then I am so sick of hearing about Shields and can't wait til the media is tired of her again. Unfortunately her team of publicists will probably keep us suffering."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather smell diapers...","review":"than read the rest of this book. Despite her Princeton degree (which I think calls into question the caliber of the school), Brooke Shields has all the writing skill of the average 6 year-old. She is out of touch with the real world; she is a privileged, pampered, sniveling wench. Her complaints of powdery CLEAN diaper smell, having to take a crap, and having to be cleaned by a nurse because she was too damn lazy to take care of herself, all smacks of ego and elitism. I wish she had jumped out of the window, or swallowed the bottle of pills than taken taken pen to paper. I want my money back as I couldn't stomach one more chapter of this drivel.I will however keep it on my bookshelf, because whenever I do feel depressed, this book with indeed be the antidote. For THAT, I thank Brooke Shields. What a hilarious, mad-cap adventure it is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Courageous move by Brooke","review":"I grew up admiring Brooke Shields. She may not be a very talented actress, but when it comes to beauty she's in a league of her own. But what I really admire about her now is that she uses her fame to bring to light a very serious problem that a lot of people don't understand. While I disagree that PPD is something most people haven't heard about (think Andrea Yates and all the other news stories over the past few years), I do agree that the more light shown on PPD, the better. This book will help a lot of people understand how real PPD is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice for most, not for the serious cases","review":"My wife has PPD. Big time. Reading about Brooke's situation was at first a relief. But then she learned about Brooke's brief time on Pacsil and RELATIVELY short weeks with depression. We do not belittle her experience. PPD is a serious illness. But, Brooke's experience is minor league compared to my wife's battle. If your are struggling in a a more significant way, you should instead read \\"Sleepless Days\\" by Susan Kushner Resnick. True representation of hard core PPD. Again, I never take anything away from the women suffering from post partum. I'm just trying to give direction to those of you with the harder cases. By the way, my wife is doing sooooo much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A spark that failed to ignite a flame.","review":"I was diagnosed with PPD/OCD after having my first child and while I'm glad that there is someone out there using the media as a means to shed light on this topic, she lacked to fully articulate what it means to go through this. The whole book was her saying \\"why me?? I don't understand, why me??\\"There are far better outlets on line that give women information and a network to support their efforts in fighting this battle. [...] is a great tool if connecting with women who are going through the same feelings and thoughts that you are, and it helps to realize that you are not alone.If you want to read someone else complain about why they are going through this, read it. However, if you're like me and want to find a book that relates to the real horrors we go through while dealing with this, pass, because this isn't it."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"I never enjoyed a book this much in my life! YOU ROCK BROOKE!! I love the way she writes and her humor was so refreshing. I felt the same pain and the tears would stream down one minute and laugther the next.

It was traumatic. More than PPD, it sounds like she was simply suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. While PTSD may be an aspect of PPD, the two are not *necessarily* mutually exclusive. Plenty of women who have lovely births suffer from PPD, simply for different reasons and with similar or different symptoms. Most new mothers will mention all of the same things going on with them, whether they are suffering from PPD or not: overwhelmed, unsure of themselves, failure of expectations, etc. I think our definition of PPD is outdated and is not to be defined by this author, for sure.I have to agree with other reviewers who stated that 1) the book is not well written and 2) there are many more helpful, comprehensive books on the subject. I refuse to argue the for/against drugs issue, for that is an issue every indivudal must make for herself.Above all, DO NOT attempt to identify with Brooke Shields or use this book as your PPD bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Honest and Urgent Information Needed to ALL!","review":"Brooke takes you on a deep and profound personal journey that is so easy to understand and relate to with many illnesses. She tells it like it is and the book is hard to put down. Over half way through you can take a break and then keep reading to realize how much more there really is to post-partum depression and or psychosis. Even the effects of miscarriages and fertilization processes are mind bending. EVERY DOCTOR and MOTHER to BE should read this!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Story","review":"Five stars for this book. I experienced everything Brooke Shields described in her book almost 24 years ago with the birth of my first child. No one (family or doctors) knew what was wrong with me. Of course, I didn't know what was wrong with me since I had wanted a baby so badly and had been fine until the birth of my child. The feelings of despair and regret began in the hospital and almost immediately after giving birth. It was the most confusing period of my life because no one understood. I believe this book is very valuable to all women suffering from this devastating and, at times, unexpected illness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"An honest look into what it is like to experience postpartum.Shields puts the spotlight on this little spoken about secret that a lot of women deal with, in silence. Society has set women up to feel like failures at motherhood, and Shields' book reminds readers that they are not alone. Postpartum is real and should be talked about and dealt with.Eat your heart out Tom Cruise!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank God for Brooke Shields","review":"This is one of the best books on tape that I have ever purchased. Brooke narrated so beautifully and cadidly. There are so many women who have gone through postpardum depression and never talk about it for fear of being judged. I just want to thank Brooke for sharing her own personal story and helping women not to feel alone and for some, helping them to seek the guidance they need in order to get better. The story is heart wrenching, but humorous, raw and real. Thank you to all the mothers out there for what you endure and for the love you give to all your children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I got this at the bookstore one afternoon and finished it the next day. My husband is now reading it, because Brooke does a fantastic job of putting into words much of what I felt after the birth of my son, but was unable to explain clearly to others. She pulls no punches, and is brutally honest about her thoughts of disconnect from her baby, her anger at family and friends for not getting it, and even her thoughts of suicide. But what she does best is show the help that is available, so that no mother should ever have to feel alone and hopeless. This is a book for every parent-to-be, so they are prepared for the possiblity; for every family member or friend who will be in frequent contact with a new mother, so they might recognize the problem before it gets out of control; and for anyone who has ever wondered 'Can it really be all that bad?' Yes, it can, yes, it is, and yes, there is help and hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK...but...","review":"I am half way through and am getting a little bored actually. The writing is ok I guess, but I just feel like the same thing is being said over and over. I really do sympathize with Brooke, I really do. It's just that I'm not sure I can get through this book. I have a one yr old and after she was born I felt that I made a huge mistake and was feeling more irritated with her birth than happy. I had visions that I didn't even think I wanted her at all and thoughts of giving her up. I was clearly sleep deprived and depressed and after a short while, those feelings lifted and she became the love of my life. I could not imagine my life without her! So I guess I was expecting more from this book and for me, it just didn't deliver. But this topic is clearly a serious one and if a mom has it, it doesn't mean she's awful, just human!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional","review":"Far from being a book just for women this is a book which I believe all people can relate.I am always wary of books by celebrities as they are more often than not just another venue of self promotion.However sometimes a celebrity will use the currency of their fame to write a book to raise awareness of a problem: this is one such book. The author writes extremely eloquently and frankly about postpartum depression.It is not only her experience of postpartum depression that she relates so well but also the experience of depression in general. The book reveals not only a gifted writer but a generous soul.This book is full of insight and I would recommend it to anyone who suffers from depression or has a loved one who does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too close to home....","review":"Brooke Shields bravely discusses the \\"dark secret\\" so many of us new mother's experience. Unfortunately, new motherhood can be for many a time of ultimate despair instead of the image of blissful contentment we long for. In Brooke Shield's very open, honest and poignant account of her battle with PPD she hit so closely to my own story that I was unable to finish the book right now as it was all too familiar as to what I experienced. Bravo to Brooke Shields for taking the stigma off this disorder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great information!","review":"I am the mother of 4. I received this book as a gift while pregnant with #4. I found it wonderful and insightful. Even if you don't suffer from Post partum depression, so much of her struggles relate to the normal baby blues. Anyone that has been pregnant or wants to be could use this book as a helpful guide for those tough days after the baby is born.Even if you don't love Brooke Shields, it took a lot of courage to write such a book. Our society is so judgemental! Noone should judge a person and there motives, until they have gone through depression themselves!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll pass","review":"Here we go again with Brooke Shields, another media hound looking for attention after she used Michael Jackson for that and realized even going out with him would not help her acting career. Anyway, I do believe women suffer for PPD and maybe some anti-depressants temporarily work for them. However, I think many of Brooke's issues were related to her advanced maternal age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly unbelievable","review":"It should come as no surprise that she is suffering from depression. The root of MOST depressive states is a self-possessed mentality. This is a classic example. Being about ones self is DEPRESSING, and this story only details the story of WHY.Truly sickening, at a time when her baby needed her absolute love, attention, and devotion, Brooke was, as she has ALWAYS been, all about her poor little self. This is a perfect example of why most people should not have children: they lack the emotional maturity to actually CARE for someone.Do the kid a favor, find an adoptive parent that is up to the task of parenting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I couldn't even finish this book.

It was an excellent read. I am not really a fan of Brooke's and have not suffered from ppd, but was interested to hear what she had to say. She can thank Tom Cruise for my interest. He should only be so eloquent in his speaking as she is in her writing. This would probably be a big help to others suffering from depression of any kind. She gives hope that there is a way back to \\"normal\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing and honest.","review":"I don't usually feel compelled to write reviews. However, this book touched a place in me that no other book has ever touched. Reality. This is a brave, raw, and honest book that is MUCH needed in todays \\"burying your head in the sand\\" society. I am so pleased that a \\"star\\" has used her celebrity to reach out to taboo America. PPD is real. And it's scary. And it doesn't discriminate. I appreciate this book and highly recommend it. Whether you have ever dealt with PPD or know of anyone that has, it is a truly honest journey through PPD and can only help to educate men and women everywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"I never ordered this","review":"I don't know how this became part of my list. Because I never order this book.I never ordered it."},{"rating":"1","title":"skeptical","review":"I thought the book was well written, but I was skeptical from beginning until end because of what I know about Brooke Shields. Some of you may remember that Brooke Shields claimed to be a virgin well into her adult years. I remember her on the Maury Povich show claiming to still be a virgin at the age of 27. Years later she fessed in an interview that her first time was actually at Princeton when she was 22 years old. Not that anyone really cares, but it was her who volunteered all this information.Then when her child was less that a month old, Brooke did a magazine article with photographs - in the article she claimed that having her daughter was the greatest joy she ever felt. This was when her child was less than a month old - so where was the postpartum depression at this time. Was it already over? It's just hard to know what to believe with this woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest","review":"What I loved most about this memoir about postpartum depression, is the honest way in which Brook Shields tells her story. She does not hold back any feelings she was having and told the story just like it was happening with a build up to her realization she needed help. Well, the aspect of memoirs that pull me in is an honesty being present, which with celebrity memoirs is often not the case. I thought she did a great job of telling her story and commend her for being honest and raw."},{"rating":"2","title":"intense, but good","review":"i found this book hard to put down. as someone who also suffered from PPD, i found it reassuring. glad i'm not the only one who had those thoughts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful","review":"I bought this book to get some insight into a mom I know going through PPD. I had a hard time getting past the selfish, princess parts of her life even though she tried to say many times that she is not this type of person.

Why go to all that hard work? Who lived there? Do we know any of this?The geology of the site is strange. According to this video, this is a volcanic outcropping, but the stones are sandstone, and sandstone is sedimentary, certainly not volcanic.

The movie recounts the story Khouri told in great detail before it starts pointing out all the holes, odd factual errors, and easily disproved lies. Having debunked Khouri's allegedly true story, the documentary turns to investigate Khouri herself. A world class con-artist with some powerful connections (Cheney family), Khouri is revealed as an audacious, cunning, quite possibly deranged character with a well developed petty side. It's the *degree* of her shamelessness that astonishes over and over. The students were literally amazed.Useful movie, actually. Conveys important lessons about the human willingness to accept well-told stories that validate our prejudices and about the power of evidence in clarifying important issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"I got this book by imagination!","review":"This book has been out of print.

Then one day out of the blue I decided to check again, and one seller just listed it for fifty dollars, a very good condition copy, and I immediately bought it! Now I'm holding it in my hands. Imagination works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Aside from the supremely corny cover art, which is almost enough to keep one from buying it, this is a truly great book. Of the four included stories, the best is \\"Gulf,\\" the leadoff. It is a short, thought-provoking story that was entertaining and kept me reading. However, it could have been on of Heinlein's all-time great short novels if expanded more. The ending, in particular, was a little too abrupt. Of the remaining stories, \\"Elsewhen\\" is an entertaining \\"What if?\\" romp. \\"Lost Legacy,\\" the other novella, is a very nice story as well. \\"Jerry Was a Man\\" is the only story that I don't find particularly interesting, but it still has merit and doesn't hold down the rest. As Heinlein always did at his best, this book is extremely thought-provoking and may make you re-examine what you thought possible. It often leans more toward fantasy than science fiction, which may turn off some, but this is highly recommended for fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, interesting subject of human evolution.","review":"A very good book of short stories written by the master of sciencefiction.

Maybe old hat now, but it wasn't in the 1940's. I'd be willing to be large sums that whoever wrote the Star Trek:TNG story about Data being, leagally, a Man, had read this once apon a time.

Jarnegan, despite possibly being the first Hollywood novel in America and a hard-boiled chronicle of Irish ghetto life, is just not the worth the time required to track it down. The novel begins grittily enough, but soon meanders into endless diatribes by the protagonist, Jarnegan, that seem little more than excuse for the author to vent his own thoughts. Some very questionable, dimestore Nietzschean, vaguely anti-Semitic rants occupy these pages. Historically significant, but as far as Hollywood fiction is concerned, Day of the Locust (N.

As always, the character development is perfect and well crafted. The scenes are elegently described, and when this is combined with an excellent plot this work falls into the small pile of the very best fantasy there is.I like the protracted battle scenes which give a sense of urgency to the heroes quest. The changing from scene to scene really drives the momentum of the plot. I find the romance, while slightly cliched still adds to the overall excellence of the plot.While the Shannara series is a series, each book in the first three stand alone, and are only vaguely linked. After all we can't all cope with a 9 volume series (still going strong) like the wheel of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Book ever","review":"This book Kept me on the edge of my seat. The Characters are well built, the plot is clear, and everything is so discriptive. Some people might say this is kindsa a rip off of The Fellowship of the Rings. Not at all. In this book the creatures are different,and the world is way different.Terry Brooks ensnairs the senses in a world of Elfs, Demons, Dwarfs and much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Brooks Masterpiece... 5 VERY deserved stars!","review":"Ohh... Brooks seems to be incapable of writing a bad novel. This is his ABSOLUTE BEST. It'll make you hate some characters, (Eretia.. grr!) Love them, Make you go crazy.. and such. The battle scenes are extraordinary, the characters are colorful, the plot is somewhat complex- somewhat simple and when you finish it, you'll be thinking about it for days afterwards. This book is everything you can possibly imagine, and more.But the end.... Alas... I cried like hell!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best cult book since Tolkien","review":"An amazing Tale of a land that seems to have existed in our own world. His story seems to come right out of the history books, the difference? -- It wont put you to sleep. his (T. Brooks) Battle scenarios Are soo realistically described that you almost feel that youracually in the middle of this 'battle between good and evil' Unlike Tolkien His story is fast paced, and yet still richly described. this style draws you into a world that he creates so incredibly thatyou'll find yourself wishing you had a sword at hand before you pick up this book!.. that is if you can put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than The Sword of Shannara","review":"Mr. Brooks more than makes up for his lack of creativity and use of Tolkien's main ideas in the Sword of Shannara with this amazing book. The Elfstones of Shannara is simply Brooks at his best. The battle scenes between Elves and Demons are extremely well written. At times you almost want to skip ahead to find out what is going to happen next. He also does a much better job of letting us know the characters more. Not to give away the ending, but when you finish the book you start to feel tears swell at times, which is something I never expected after reading The Sword of Shannara although such ability was hinted at in The First King of Shannara. I would certainly recommend this book to any fantasy fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It doesn't get any better","review":"I owned the hardback versions of Brooks' work for years, but when I moved from a large house into a small apartment, I had to get rid of my extensive library.

I love his style of writing and his character development. many people say that Terry Brooks is a copy of Tolkien. Which I think is absolutly not true.

I thought it was absolutly wonderful!When Amberle does the transformation I cried.I have never cried over a book before but I wept like a baby. I would read this book again and again..........and again! ^_^"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of Shannara","review":"The Sword of Shannara was a clumsy but promising attempt at a fantasy novel; the Wishsong of Shannara was an ill-conceived attempt to continue the saga. The Elfstones of Shannara is a marvelous epic that shouldn't be missed.Everything from the depth of the characters to the descriptions of the heroic battle with Demons is wonderfully done. Battles without and within must be fought, and worthy adversaries must be overcome. The ending is unexpected and deeply affecting.It's not strictly necessary to read the first book in the series. Start here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellant and Captivating!","review":"Excellant characters, excellant story line, and over and excellant book!

My favorite part is when the troll army kneels in front of old Eventine and he cries... very poignant! I strongly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it better than the first.","review":"I found it much easier to identify with the characters in this second book - especially Wil and Amberle. Also, \\"Elfstones\\" benefits by being less derivative and more inventive. I'd recommend this book to anyone looking for some good leisure reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed this one possibly more then Sword","review":"This was a terrific book, one of the best fantasies I've ever read. Terry Brooks is an awesome author. The Reaper was one of the coolest villans I've ever seen in fantasy. Him stalking Wil and Amberle was probably the best part of the book. If you liked Sword, I think you will love this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining","review":"Personally, I wanted a different ending, but the book was a good read. I didn't read the others in the series but I am curious now about what they are like. The story ended with some of the plots left open, since they want you to buy the next in the series, but it doesn't detract from the story. Everything was well explained, as far as cultures and past happenings, and the characters were well written and easily identified. I thought it was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Book...Ever!","review":"The Elfstones of Shannara is the greatest book ever.

The magic is cool and superbly written. The battle scenes are riveting, detailed and adrenaline pumping to say the least. The pace is fast, the characters are well developed , especially Ander Elessedil, Wil Ohmsford , Amberle and Eretria. One sympathises with Ander. Undoubtedly , the best part of the story is its heartrendingly superb climax.The only flaw of the story is the repetitiveness which is sometimes irritating. All in All a great book!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a good escape from reality.","review":"When I said that this was a good escape form reality I meant no disrespect to the novel because, as it is, this is one of my favorite books.This tale tells of all that a fantasy book should have.

The action in this book is double compaired to the first two. I like how Wil is trying to master the use of the Elfstones that is being blocked by his human blood. The ending kind of makes me sad because Amberle becomes the new Elcrys', even though it is a good thing I still wished she didn't have to become the Elcrys'."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVER RATED!","review":"The entire Sword of Shannara series is one of my least favorites. Elfstones of Shannara is deffinately better than the first, but that isnt saying alot. The characters arent developed enough for me, Amberle and Wil were more likeable than most in this series, but the druid Allannon bores me to tears and is the most unlikeable good guy EVER! The plot is good, but the story advances way to fast. The whole world invented here doesnt work for me. How can you live in a land that you can apparently walk across in a matter of days, and have races of people unfamiliar with each other. I mean, if your going to dream up an entire world maybe it should be bigger than Maine. Apparently other people like it, but not worth the time in my eyes. Speaking of eyes, some one stick an icepick in mine so I can never read this book again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There is nothign new under the sun,...","review":"I have seen a lot of comparisons to Tolkien, as if Tolkien was interested in competing with other writers in his genre. Tolkien wrote and created a world. Others have come along and attempted to elaborate on that and make it their own - that's this book in a nutshell. If you enjoy Tolkien you may like this, but I think it's like a photocopy of a photocopy or a photocopy - kind of looks like the original, but blurred enough to be something else -- the original being the clearest.

The plodding plot unwinds at a mind-alteringly slow pace, with no energy or joy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story, but old ideas","review":"This was a 1980's book, so in those days this was good. Today, however, people are inventing new creatures aside from giant eagles, elves, demons and druids, so the Elfstones of Shannara is old material for me. I also notice that long books (500 pags. or so) tend to spend many words on miniscule details, so people would say it can be compressed to 400 or 300 pgs. and not lose its story.I gave this book 4 stars though because of the reading experience. The events are suspenseful, engrossing, and you can feel the characters, their emotions, hopes, dreams, fears and failures. Brooks writes well. I challenge him though and other writers to go out of the usual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Elfstones!","review":"The novel intertwines two plotlines: the quest of Wil Ohmsford and Amberle Elessedil to find Safehold and create a new Ellcrys, and the attempt by the Elven army and their allies to slow the Demons to give them time to find it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the first","review":"Terry Brook's second novel, the sequel to the Sword of Shannara, is a solid work that while influenced by Tolkien seems less derivative of the Lord of the Rings than it's predecessor. Loads of action, interesting characters and one hell of a bad guy (the Reaper). A must read for fans of fantasy novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Overall Story Development","review":"Brooks had me in a strangle-hold from the start to the finish of this marvelous story. In certain parts throughout the story, I was truly frightened for Wil and Amberle, who constantly had the Reaper on their heals. Wonderfully vivid descriptions of the agonizing deaths of the Elves grab your imagination and also depict the true hatred the Demons bore for the Elves. This is truly fantasy-horror literature at it's finest!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not disappointing","review":"This book is by no means disappointing. It's got a cool storyline and nicely built characters. The only problem I have with it is not in actual fact IT but rather Brooks. Terry Brooks is a descriptive writer who likes to go on and on about the scenery and people's expressions. It's cool at first but then it starts to become really trite and expectable. Otherwise, if you don't mind loads of narration, delve into this touching, slightly sentimental tale!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great!","review":"I use this to scrub my wood floors.

I would not advise anyone interested in learning FrontPage buy it. Any book published by Microsoft Press is better. I hope those friends of the authors who had given endorsements would have been ethical enough not to mislead readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment.","review":"I have read a number of books on FrontPage 2000. This book has to be rated as \\"Poor\\" if not \\"the Poorest.\\" It is hasty, sketchy, confusing at places, poorly structured and leaves out quite a few important features of FrontPage even for beginners. The examples are narrow. The numerous \\"coffee breaks\\" are laughable. The CD-ROM included in the book is crude and really of little use.

Although the case is really sturdy and even has a protective cover over the screen and looks just like the pic.

After reading some of the glowing customer reviews of this movie, I wonder if I don't remember it as clearly as I thought. I watched this with my mom, and both of us thought the script and direction weren't up to par. Both seemed forced--the dialogue didn't flow very well, and didn't sound easy and natural. The music also really bothered me--a lot of the time it was overly emotional and melodramatic, and reminded me of soap opera music. However, there are redeeming aspects--the three leads. Jeanne Moreau, Claire Danes, and Jude Law are all very talented, and all manage to do respectable jobs. Danes has good chemistry with both Moreau and Law, and that shines through the often bumbling lines. So I didn't hate it, and it wasn't unbearable--obviously some people loved it. If you really like any of the main actors, and the story sounds interesting, go ahead and give it a whirl. Just don't expect too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected................","review":"Claire Danes played a good role in this movie but the dreams about her crush object (Jude Law) were rather confusing. The movie goes back and forth to the past to the present and it's hard to keep up with. The story was rather choppy as a result and I didn't feel as though the movie ended as it should have.

I found that the red and white were opposite of what they should have been for left and right. After that, my right speaker stopped working and I had to wrap a twist tie around this product's wire to keep it bent so the right speaker would work, until just now I was tweaking the bend to get the right speaker working again and now both speakers have gone out and its a pain to just get one of them working. It's ridiculous for the wiring in this product to go out so fast when it has just been sitting on my desk not moving since I bought it.DO NOT BUY, it's better to spend a few more bucks on a quality product then try to get away with cheap crap like I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Allows a headphone from a tv","review":"This is a great adapter as it allows me to use regular \\"Walkman\\" headphones to listen to a television.

Perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solution to sound coming from both t.v. and headphones","review":"I wanted to play games quietly but my tv didn't have a headphone jack. So I bought these to get around that problem and they work very well. One problem though is that it exchanges my left earphone for my right, but I just switch the colors around (red in white and white in red).Some helpful advice:1. Your tv has to have red and white \\"audio out\\" ports (usually in the back)2. Like me, you may need a headphone extension cord. My headphones are a little short so my face is 2 feet away from the tv screen.3. Many of you may run into a little problem where sound is coming from both the headphones and the tv which kinda defeats the purpose of the headphones. My solution was to turn the tv sound all the way down while the headphones were still plugged in. For some reason the sound for the tv speakers go down but not the headphones.Hope that helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to TV/movies/games at night without disturbing others","review":"If that's what your goal is with this cable... then look no further.

The physical connection felt ok, but when I ran the speaker test, things were not ok. Only one of the front speakers got a signal, while both surround speakers got a signal at the same time. I switched the cables around every which way, and got nothing but improper sound output to the various speakers and subwoofer.I then found some better quality cables of the same type that stated \\"stereo\\" on the package at a local store for $3.89 each, just slightly more than I paid for these after shipping. After swapping them in I ran the speaker test on the Samsung player again, and got correct sound out of all 5 speakers and the subwoofer.Since I got these cables for$.62 each plus $2.99 non-refundable shipping each, they weren't worth returning.Bottom Line: ***tty cables"},{"rating":"1","title":"gr155000","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS CABLEPlease don't get conned into this cheap cable....you get what you pay for....and I hope you don't need it anytime soon.I CANNOT BELIEVE AMAZON DOES BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective","review":"The female 3.5mm jack end was defective and would not take a male headphone jack.

They were always bundled with something so I gave up and came on here. 15 minutes, I found these, great price, snap in tight fit. Even tho a lot of people are into HDMI Cabeles, I am too.

The intersection between politics and post-colonial theory is the first such application and as Ashcroft suggests on the back cover it is truly ground breaking. The book traces the issues of identity and politics and highlights the major issues which are of concern to African studies, negritude, decolonisation, the state, civil society , human rights and globalisation. Perhaps the most interesting chapter is the chapter on citizenship. I would highly recomend this book. It is not only useful to undergraduates but will be provocative for the more advanced reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is the author too intelligent?","review":"This book was one of the textbooks for an honors leadership course I took in college. I absolutely hated it. The concepts were interesting but the language was too hard to follow. I felt inferior as I was reading this book, which is not aomething an author should strive to achieve.Although, as I stated above, the author had interesting ideas and concepts, there was one thing that I had a tough time swallowing. The author argues that there is no such thing as a \\"bad leader\\". Instead, if you are not a good leader, you are not a leader. I strongly disagree with this idea, as an individual can be a leader but not a good one. I'm sure that most people can think of someone in their life that they would categorize as a \\"bad leader\\".I will never recommend this book, nor will I ever purchase or read another book written by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"A collection of previously published rather predictable","review":"This thin volume has nothing new from Locklin. He treats Bukowski so gently you might think Buk a fragile fairy godmother type if you didn't know of him previously. This book is obviously printed to make a buck and toadies to Sir Mammon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back off on Gerry, pal.","review":"Who is S.Dahi to call Gerald Locklin a hack? Who is S.Dahi at all? Gerald Locklin is a respected and well-published poet, and this book is a nice remembrance of Bukowski from a friend and colleague. It is fair to note that the volume is slender and that some of the material has been previously published, but it's still pretty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hack on Hank","review":"Gerald Locklin has the dubious distinction of writing the first \\"book\\" on Bukowski after his death. The whole book reads like a quickie for profit job. In fact most of it was written while Buk was alive. There are letters and attempts at poetry by this \\"hack professor\\" mascrading as Buk's close friend. Don't waste your $25.00 on this book. Instead buy Gay Brewer's (also an academic) book on Bukowski which is by far the best book written on the subject so far (June 2000)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Simply--ORIGINAL!!","review":"A very original CD!! This band has turned techno/trip-hop/and rock into a lovely broth that is smooth, not chunky, and easy to swallow. Their second song is quite ear catching--the one named \\"Raincheck\\" is even better--for I can see this as quite a breakthrough hit for them, if not here, definitely overseas. I found myself humming the song all day after hearing it, and I couldn't stop listening to it!!Once again the level as to which this genre has grown boggles the mind. Can you think what this will be 25-50 years from now? Tin Star has definitely earned a slot on my CD shelf. Buy this album now!! Make room Lo-Fidelity All Stars, Pidgeonhed, Underworld.

If you ever have a chance to see them in concert, go for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mix of Both Techno & Rock","review":"I bought this CD primarily because of the hype involved with the group's more popular song entitled \\"Head.\\" However, there are songs on the CD that top \\"Head.\\" The songs include a variety of songs ranging from upbeat tunes resembling techno to slower songs. As most CDs this one has a few weak songs as most CDs do. The other songs certainly make up for the weaker. It's a much better CD than I had expected and I highly reccomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silly old fool nods head","review":"There I was, pottering through the record store dredging the Blues shelf for something for a lazy weekend when I realised I was tapping my pocket-change, nodding my silly old head & feeling a Saturday night tingle on a tedious Friday lunchtime. The rhythyms on the moving-about-quickly tracks are infectious; David Tomlinson's thin, melancholy vocals sound more earnest than the lyrics really deserve but they nevertheless lounge beautifully over the slow buzzing of the bass and are guaranteed to encourage an indulgent, louche weekend."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was GREAT!!!","review":"I think that Ric B.

Thats what the cd does for me. I remember hearing \\"Hold On\\" and being all charged and ready to take on anything. With \\"Release Me\\" it felt like someone was holding on for too long and just couldnt let go of what was in the past. Overall the cd is solid and the girls co wrote on a few songs. What got me was the harmonies its like they've been singing together for so many years. Its crazy and for the most part the rest of the cd is an adventure and fun to listen to. I'm at least glad that they came back with another cd in 2004 \\"California\\" a different take as well.Solid cd that reps the 90s in a big way and thats whats up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just do not like it","review":"A few good songs, but you have to listen to the horrible ones first in order to get to the good one or two.

The figures from Revoltech rock!The only constructive critics that I'd make to the guys at Revoltech are:-Some hand base slots are difficult to manipulate in making it enter with the joint articulation system.-Mazinkaiser is great but it would be much greater in having in the form of it's predecessors: Mazinger Z and Great Mazinger."},{"rating":"1","title":"revoltech","review":"Fist and foremost, let me say: this is not the first Revoltech action figure I have.

As I was putting it in a possition, one of the joints broke. Therefore, if you have a Revoltech figure make sure you know witch way the ends are in before you adjust them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, terrible Music","review":"All four ex-Beatles produced some pretty great music and some pretty awful music on their own. Paul's bad music was lightweight and boring; George's was preachy and overbearing; and Ringo's was just not memorable in any way. But the worst of the bad music belonged to John because it was so superior, arrogant and preachy. And this album is the worst of the lot. John should have had the judgment to tell Yoko to get out of the control room when the Beatles were recording \\"Let it Be\\" and to get off the stage after they broke up. It's not that she had no talent (\\"Hard Times Are Over\\" from \\"Double Fantasy\\" is actually quite good), but she didn't have much and none of it is on display here. A dismal and embarassing effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Performance Art vs. No-talent Hackery","review":"Anyone who claims that avant-garde music by someone like John Cage et al. takes no talent or creativity needs to listen to some of Yoko's \\"work\\" on this album to see the fine line that exists between Dada and...you can see where I'm going with this.And let me add to the chorus of people saying quite rightly:There IS NOT, nor OUGHT THERE BE, any song called Jamrag. It's King Kong, and this is one of the worst recorded examples of it due to the aforementioned wailing. \\"Well\\" would have been enjoyable but Yoko's screeching is unbelievably, grossly, out of place.In June of 1971, Yoko Ono was the least musically and/or artistically talented person in the Fillmore East. And that includes the audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Say it ain't so, John!","review":"I bought this CD, God curse me. Listening to it was like listening to a bobcat screeching as its claws are painfully pulled with a pair of pliers. No wonder the Beatles broke up.

SOME TIME IN NEW YORK CITY rocks out! What did you want - John to rewrite \\"Imagine\\" and \\"Instant Karma\\" for the rest of his career? Producer Phil Spector, with the Elephant's Memory band, complements John and wife Yoko Ono's topical songs. SOME TIME IN NEW YORK CITY stands as a musical snapshot of Richard Nixon's America. Compare any pop-music politics (U2, Ice Cube, Sting, etc.) to \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday,\\" \\"Sister O Sisters\\" and \\"John Sinclair\\" and tell me if the Lennons weren't just as righteous in telling it like it was. Further, LIVE JAM, the SOME TIME IN NEW YORK CITY bonus disc, is worthwhile just for the live \\"Cold Turkey\\" - don't play it near a graveyard, those guitars will wake the dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lennon's most important album","review":"I don't take any notice of reviews or Rock Critics so I'm able to listen to an album via the Enjoyment factor.And here I would state that very little on the Plasic Ono Band has much to offer and is quite an uncomortable listen at times with ridiculous songs like Working Class Hero-which Lennon clearly wasn't he was brought up middle class unlike say George Martin who was born dirt poor.With Sometime in NYC Lennon was a political commentator who took some of the issues of the day to turn into songs.The sleeve is brilliant as its set out like a newspaper but this idea was used before by Jethro Tull for Thick As A BrickThe \\"bonus\\" disc is not important and something of a waste of time.I seem to think you can now buy this album on CD without the Zappa nonsense"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Underrated Lennon CD","review":"Sometime in New York City is a great album. I would actually give it 4 and a half. I admit that some of the issues are very dated, but it doesn't hurt the quality of the album. Also, Yoko's songs are suprisingly listenable, especially Siaters, O Sisters. John's songs are obviously better, though. Woman is the Nigger of the World, New York City, Sunday Bloody Sunday, and John Sinclair are especially good. The songs I didn't mention are good also.The Live Jam CD is also good. Yoko, however, really hurts it. Don't Worry Kyoko is horrible, and she manages to wreck Baby Please Don't Go, which would have been great. Cold Turkey is excellent and the others are also good.The first CD is much better than the second, but the second would probably get 3 and a half to four. I would still reccomend buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bottle of Urine.....","review":"I bet the rest of the Beatles were Like WTF? Probably super happy That John did not do this garbage when he was with the band. Yoko Ono....wow. What did he see in this? I bet she even smelled funny. Like when you live in a dorm and the aroma of Ethnic Eastern food is permeating through the walls. And it makes you never want to eat foreign food again. If I went to this concert I would have chucked a bottle of Urine at Yoko ONO. Belief me I would not have missed.

I would never have thought John Lennon could record something as terrible as Sometime In New York City, especially after the truly magnificent Plastic Ono Band and Imagine albums. Each song is written around a person or event of the time, meaning that listening to it today is a baffling experience. Nobody knows who Angela is, or what happened in Attica State. One of Lennon's greatest songs, 'Women Is The Nigger Of The World', appears in a weak form on this album. Although I like the song, this version doesn't save the album. I prefer the live take that appeared on the Lennon Anthology. The only redeeming feature of this album is it's second disc, a live album that includes a brilliant performance by Frank Zappa. Still, the only song on that which has merit is the stomping 'Scumbag'. A poor attempt by Lennon's to record a political album. I would only buy it to finish my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst solo Beatle record","review":"Sure, The Wedding Album and Two Virgins are worse--but there was little attempt to create real music on those misbegotten records. Sometime is the worst album Lennon ever made: intelligence is replaced by hip posturing; Lennon's deeply felt emotions are replaced by slogans. Heck, even McCartney's worst album (Give My Regards to Broadstreet)glided along on craft. That's something missing from Sometime.I'd only recommend this poor album to a completist Lennon fan. Phil Spector's production and the playing by Elephant's Memory bury at redeeming melodies Lennon and Ono came up with. It's aged badly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put A Gag On That Woman!","review":"After Lennon/Ono sat in with Frank Zappa/Mothers at Fillmore East in '71, it was decided that both FZ and John would own rights to the resulting recording and be able to release it as they each saw fit. Frank wound up being a bit peeved that John actually gave himself and Yoko songwriting credit on some of the material (King Kong) that was obviously composed by himself. No big woof. But later, when FZ released his \\"Playground Psychotics\\" album, he expressed his irritation, and \\"commented\\" on Yoko, by giving one section the title \\"A Small Eternity With Yoko Ono\\". I couldn't agree more. Really wretched!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hold your nose.","review":"Whereas as the John Lennon songs on disc one are obvious knock-offs (he fits newspaper headlines to hoary old musical cliches; I can't imagine he spent more than a minute on any of them), Yoko Ono appears to be really trying--and that's the sad thing. Well, I might pity her cluelessness if I hadn't heard \\"Sisters, O Sisters\\"--I'd rather shoot myself than hear it again.Avoid this record like the plague; that's my advice--and I'm not just saying, \\"don't buy it\\"; I'm saying, \\"don't even listen to it\\". If you have any taste at all, you'll be very sorry. I certainly am."},{"rating":"1","title":"John's & Yoko's Butchery","review":"Jamrag? What the heck is Jamrag? That's really Frank Zappa's King Kong, but Lennon stole the writing credits. Lennon and Ono jammed with the Mothers that night at the Filmore, and they agreed with Zappa that the show would be taped and they would mix it together so they could release it. John and Phil Spector, behind Zappa's back, set out to release it without Frank's permission. They mixed out the vocals on Scumbag ... the only vocals, and did a host of other baffling, stupid things. A horrible injustice and a mess of a record. No wonder Frank hated collaborating as much as he did."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment personified","review":"I purchased this cd for one particular track \\"MAME\\" having played it many times off a 45 when I was a jock on commercial radio.

His lyrics have always zeroed in on what makes this man's heart beat. His battles with the Parrot record company are legendary. An Irish rebel. This CD has many of his great ones. It has a few of his sucky ones also. Greatest Hits? I think not. But what really burns me about this CD is the song Brown Eyed Girl. A true classic. A masterpiece. But on this CD, Mona Lisa's smile has been altered. No longer are we making love in the green grass behind the stadium but now we're running and laughing. The record company has decided that makin' love in the green grass is too paganistic for modern society. By modifying the lyrics the song has lost its heart. And in my opinion has tainted the entire CD. If they are allowed to change the lyrics maybe next time they can change the players or the singer. Hell, put Tony Burrows on vocals. That guy sang nearly every song in the late 60's anyways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long time listener to Van Morrison","review":"This CD is a great collection of early to recent more early Van Morrison.

This album reflects the greatness of his voice and his ability to interpret a song. How can you pick a greatest song from this album? There is the pop standard \\"Brown Eyed Girl\\" which has managed to be a radio staple for years but goes above the traditional emptiness of pop radio. I love \\"Have I Told You Lately That I Love You.\\" Probably the greatest love song of all time. But as Van always does, he manages to write a love song that is cool, not cheesy. \\"Jackie Wilson Said,\\" is another love song that Van does to perfection without being cheesy. I can't pick a favorite from this album, they are all so good.

But this is not Elton John, Van Halen, or any other hitmaker. Even a Beatles 'Best Of' makes more sense than this. Each album by Van Morrison is a statement by itself, and can only be appreciated in its entirety. This LP seems to attract new listeners, and earns its second star for that reason only. Besides, you have 'Moondance' as Van for beginners. For graduate work, his masterpiece is NOT 'Astral Weeks', but 'St Dominic's Preview'. 'Veedon Fleece' for your Doctorate.

Each time that I listen to it, it's as if it is the first time I've heard it. There are so many different voices singing on this CD that it takes a long time to realize that most of those different voices are actually coming from Van Morrison. Each song is so supremely interesting and creative that one simply cannot take it all in. I have to make a choice...do I concentrate on the words this time or do I simply enjoy the background trumpet. These are not ordinary songs nor is this an ordinary artist. Each song is like a present that's been opened for the first time .

In the third verse, right after \\"Sometimes I'm overcome thinkin' 'bout it,\\" the words \\"Laughin' and a-runnin, hey hey\\" were substituted for the original line. I'm sure Morrison never sang it that way -- sounds like some Polydor production person lifted the audio of the line from the first verse and inserted it into the third.Don't make the mistake I did by buying this.

Inexcusable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Compilation of Great Music","review":"Straight to the point, this is one of the worst compilations of hits I have ever heard. I LOVE Van Morrison, but i HATE this CD. It flows very badly from genre to genre, and on top of that, it isnt even that good a collection, A few of morrisons best songs are missing.This is a collection for people who know nothing of morrison and his genius, or want an aweful introduction to his music. Just buy Astral Weeks and Moondance (they are less expensive than this CD, and combined its only a couple bucks more.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wondering why they call this guy Van the Man?","review":"Then you obviously don't own this CD. Fix that sometime soon. Any album with Brown Eyed Girl and a bunch of crappy songs is still worth a purchase, but you get lots more: Three good songs by Them (garage-band anthem Gloria, Baby Please Don't Go, Here Comes the Night) and several great songs by Van himself: the aforementioned Brown Eyed Girl, Sweet Thing, Moondance, And It Stoned Me, Domino, Jackie Wilson Said, Cleaning Windows and the previously-unreleased Wonderful Remark especially stand out, though there's more.Still, it's not perfect. I don't care how popular Have I Told You Lately is, I don't like it. In my mind it's a sap-fest from someone who isn't really sappy. Same with Queen of the Slipstream. Get rid of these two, as well as Dweller on the Threshold and Warm Love. Swap in Madame George and Caravan. Then you'll have the true Best of Van Morrison."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have bought it from Amazon.com","review":"If I'd bought this CD from Amazon.com instead of the local CD store I would have wasted only fifteen or sixteen dollars instead of twenty.

In the end, I was snoozing.I'm glad I was'nt in a theatre watching this, those seats are so bad for napping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent thriller that tries a bit too hard","review":"\\"The Recruit\\" is a decent spy thriller about an up-and-coming CIA agent (Colin Farrell) being mentored by an old veteran (Al Pacino) in the ways of being a spy. This movie packs in the plot twists, deceptions and misinformation, often leaving the audience as much in the dark as the characters. At times it seems like it almost tries a little TOO hard to be edgy and warped, with more twists than really seem necessary. It's kind of like taking a good stew and throwing in more ingredients than you really need, deadening the taste.Still, if you can put that past you, it's a pretty exciting movie, a decent action flick, and it really shows off the talents of Pacino and Farrel, who were both made to play the roles they've taken on. Definitely worth a rental, and even worth buying if you're really into spy movies that are a bit more realistic than James Bond."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent...","review":"Great movie. Although its a type of movie that you really have to pay attention to or else you will be completely lost in the last scenes it is still a great one.So story is about this man James(Farrell) who has tried to find out the exact cause of his father's death. A CIA man Burke (Pacino) recruits him to join the training for the CIA. Jaymes overcomes all of the obstacles he faces, being the star of the training. The tables begin to turn as he is faced with dissmissal from training and assigned to a case dealing with a woman he is involved with. Towards the end, he finds that nothing is what it seems when he has an interesting encounter with Burke.Good acting. Pacino and Farrell do a great job. Good directing. However, like i said, the beginning is very self-explanatory but then towards the middle and especially the end you really have to be paying attention because you get lost very easily.Recommended, its a good movie but a little complicated at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tense thriller","review":"I'm not sure what prompted me to add this to my Netflix queue, but it finally found its way into my mailbox -- and I was very happy with the film. I'm not a big Farrell fan, but he did a fantastic job as the son of a deceased oil man who just might have been a special agent. Farrell is recruited by Pacino, and undergoes intense training...only to break under pressure. Or so it seems. Pacino is Pacino, so of course his performance is outstanding.Some aspects of the story are a bit predictable, but the twist at the end was nice. If you're a fan of films that have you grasping the arm of your chair, this movie is for you. Good pace, language not too bad, and high on suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting set-up, disappointing conclusion","review":"I have to say I was disappointed with this movie. It started out with a relatively interesting premise and the training scenes were quite enjoyable. Unfortunately it then descended into farce, with contrived twist after contrived twist.The characters were underdeveloped, apart from Farrell and Pacino. Farrell is solid throughout and proves he can carry a film. Pacino, however, seems to be on autopilot and delivers the same shouty performance he seems to give in every film of late."},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU CAN'T TRUST ANYONE.","review":"a good movie involving the c.i.a. and the recruitment process,training and assignments,but as with any movie or life theres always a fly in the ointment.just dig deep enough and you'll find it,and it's usually the big one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didnt like it","review":"Pacino will do anything these days it seems.

Not a terrible movie by any means, but not a necessary one, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Anyone Say Age Discrimination?","review":"Yes, without exaggerating, that's what this movie is all about. (Of course, the usual sex and hormones, too!) The 20-somethings of the world are taking everything over, even Al Pacino's high paying job!There's a real message in this movie, which probably went over 99% of people's heads. We over-the-hill types are discriminated against all the time in the workplace because we are simply over 40 years of age. A landmark federal law even had to be passed to protect us from the rest of you young-ens!While the movie takes it to ridiculous lengths, pay very close attention to Al Pacino's emotional speech at the very end of the movie. It's absolutely the only redeeming thing about this pathetic Bourne Identity rip-off!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining but silly","review":"This movie comes from a world in which the CIA only employees good looking, athletic, top of their class engineers who are very happy to sit in high tech classrooms learning how to use weapons just to get low pay. So of course the plot leaves everything to be desired, as does, for the most part, the acting. The sinister twist in the plot is of course silly, and the MIT engineer nods knowingly at the technobabble.If you want to watch a good spy thriller, watch Smiley's People instead. The acting is superb and it is much more entertaining. If you want to go for some action, watch The Professional instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good beginning but then it goes south with a vengeance","review":"I had high hopes for this movie. I had heard it was loosely based on the Harold Nicholson case where a veteran CIA officer who worked on \\"the Farm\\" began spying for the Russians.The first twenty minutes or so don't disappoint. The scenes where Pacino recruits Ferrell and the training at the Farm seem to be pretty realistic and well done.But after that, the movie pretty much flies off into a never-never land that I'm sure would leave veteran CIA officers laughing with derision at what passes for a story. I don't want to spoil the plot for those who must see it, but suffice to say, CIA agents are not likely to ever, ever chase each other and engage in gunfights in Washington DC. In fact, they aren't very likely to do that in foreign countries either. I think as the Russians said, \\"When the guns come out, intelligence ends.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Pacino's Out of Breath in CIA Yarn","review":"I love Al Pacino. But Al Pacino looks and seems so tired in this movie. I want to see the Classic Pacino of The Godfather, Serpico and Dog Day Afternoon. I'd even settle for the Comeback Pacino of Scent of a Woman, Carlito's Way, Heat, The Devil's Adocate, Donnie Brasco, and The Insider. But in The Recruit, all we get is the Post-Insomnia Pacino who says his lines with such strained physical exertion that you can feel the weight of every word. Pacino's choices of late have been questionable (Anyone catch Simone or People I Know?) so The Recruit is a step in the right direction. The plot and its CIA techno-babble hold its own and Colin Farrell is charasmatic enough to keep things going but the whole time I was waiting for Pacino to make the The Recruit worth my while. That never happened. When the credits finally rolled I felt I had finished watching the film more out of courtesy than genuine interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU JUST PASSED THE ENDURANCE TEST","review":"Al pacino!a lot is expected out of this old-timer....well,\\"nothing is what it seems to be\\".The man is desperate for a screen presence.Accepting a role just because he is portrayed to be the king-pin of the movie.Of course his experience shows in the dialogue delivery.Colin does a neat job as the recruit.The first few frames of the movie seems like a documentry on the \\"Central Intelligence Agency\\".Hats-off to the screenplay-the movie does not stall.The part which really brings some satisfaction to the viewing audience is the part where pacino says,\\"you passed the final test\\".This is where clayton and the audience is really surprised.Altogether the movie is a launching pad for Colin and one black dot for Al."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I felt the whole movie was very predictable - I pretty much figured out everything that was going to happen in the scene before it happened. Colin Farrel is a great actor and he does a really good job in his role, I just don't think he had much to work with. Al Pacino has done a lot better with both chosing roles and acting.

The movie takes us through the training as well as other action as we see that recruits are tested as much mentally and emotionally, as they are tested physically.As par for course, Pacino does a great job and has the audience believing his portrayal of the character. Just as the plot is multi-layered, Pacino's character, Burke, is just as multi-layered.I would recommend seeing this movie. Although the gadgetry is not as you would see in a James Bond movie, it is fascinating seeing the training."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, But Little Staying Power","review":"There's really nothing wrong with \\"The Recruit\\". It held my attention throughout, thanks in no small part to the acting of Al Pacino and Colin Farrell - Pacino's acting chops are legendary and Farrell's someday will be - yet I never found myself completely enthralled. It was a solid thriller, better than the typical popcorn thriller, without being truly thrilling.The storyline is fascinating - Farrell's character is recruited into the CIA by Pacino's character, and the film explores the themes of deception and suspicion. Whom can we believe? Who can be trusted? Is anyone telling the truth? Fascinating themes and ably explored, yet the conclusion isn't solid enough to sustain the intensity of the film's themes."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Really Liked It! :)","review":"This movie stars Al Pacino & Colin Farrell and it has a surprise ending. I don't see what is SO terrible about it! As I've seen is these reviews. The plot is not exactly \\"The Godfather\\" but is still a good movie!

Farrell is recruited into the CIA, and has a love scene with some chick, and woooooh HE is hott! ;) There is alot of drama, and emotional scenes in this movie. Very good stuff.

Avoid unless you like bad spy films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great, Pacino deserves more, Farrell less","review":"Pacino took a step down in acting in this film. It really is not that realistic and I found several of the scenes to be bogged down in dramatic blah that in real life would not have happened. Sure, I realize it is just a movie but I have to challenge the director in asking what exactly he was trying to accomplish here. It has some fun action scenes but I suppose the plot is what suffers the most here, and when the plot falls, it all falls down.Al Pacino is a star, but why they had a bozo of an actor like Farrell in there alongside him is beyond me. Farrell can never add any emotion to anything he is in and I felt actually hurt this films chances of being better. Bridget Moynahan is also in it and I like her and wish she was in more films like this.

Pacino's George Bush inspired rant about \\"Our cause is just\\" and how in a world of right and wrong \\"we choose right\\" is obviously an appeal to the post 9-11 mentality. The CIA probabally fed the dialouge to the producer/director because it had worked so well in thier focus group studies.This is a CIA advertisment with some plot development thrown in.The last half of the movie could be considered a stand alone story, but first you have to sit through a CIA \\"infomercial\\".Not that it's a bad infomercial, but still underhanded and obnoxious if you see it for what it is. \\"nothing is what it seems\\" HA HA."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad laugh","review":"very poor movie.

Some of the stories are ok and have the typical Palahniuk dark sense of humor and strange humanity, but they are outnumbered by the bad tales and the silly linking/framing story.Oliver Stone can make movies almost as good as Mr. Palahniuk can write novels. What Mr. Stone was trying to say in Natural Born Killers is similiar to what Mr. Palahniuk is trying to say in Haunted. NBK is an indictment of the public's fascination with those who kill as serial killers or as thrill/mass killers. Haunted indicts a society of victims that we have become given that talkshows are now so all pervading that Tony Danza has one.So, while the indictment is prescient, the specifics fail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just no.","review":"Gross ,boring, poorly written schlock.

Some of the contained short stories are clever and entertaining (the rich masquerading as homeless bums), but others seem written simply to see just how vile a story could be composed.

Which is really a shame, because the premise is terrifc and very promising. But it's the execution that leaves me cold. Palahniuk's characters - and their bad short stories and even worse poems - are so outre, but so obvious, that reading this novel is akin to being kicked in the gut repeatedly. The first few blows smart, but you are so numb by the end that it's all absolutely empty and meaningless. No subtlety, no variety, and no humor.

I gave it two stars instead of one, because the first story \\"Guts\\" is pretty good, albeit a little over the top.I was a fan of Fight Club, and I guess it's possible this book is over my head, but I just can't recommend it. It isn't in the slightest scary, and once you realize that there isn't a single character worth caring about, a little boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hm","review":"This book was really difficult for me to get into. The narrative, while mysterious and bold and even downright insane, is at times overshadowed by the prose, which I found to be a bit wordy and could have used some serious editing. I think because of the prose I was unable to fully immerse in the stories here. Also, there were some moments that just felt too fantastical (like a sister getting pregnant from sperm in a pool). While I usually can go along with the fantastical, it didn't seem to work as effectively here. I would have liked to see this book only with the stories of each individual character, as the interrupting chapters didn't really help me get to know the characters and it was actually quite confusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brute of a read.","review":"\\"Tell me a story.

The stories you read are unforgettable; at times hilarious, often gut-wrenching, and even fantastic in the Neil Gaiman/X-Files sense of the word. Like a traffic accident you cannot turn away from, it grabs you by your innards from the get go. Palahniuk is in a class all his own as a storyteller.

The short stories were all like beginnings to stories that aren't finished. What caught my eye was the cover that also glows in the dark. That was the only interesting thing. Chuck needs to rethink about making books with a bunch of short stories in it. If he makes another short story book, it should only contain a few short stories that are more thought out and not about the characters personal lives. The only parts that kept me interested were the parts that weren't short stories.

The book began with the story \\"Guts\\" which kept me on the edge of my seat and I was thinking \\"I hope the rest of the stories are like this one\\" but they were not. The book was not scary either. And the discription on the back of the book is misleading. It says the captor holds them up for 3 month and witholds food, water and heat and that is far from the truth. The characters in the book destroy all their food and the furnace.

However, this book was neither particularly graphic (It seemed to spend about half the time it should have on describing carnage), nor did it have a good story (except for the \\"gutless\\" story). The characters were so horrible that I found myself not caring a whit if they lived or died. There were one, maybe two short stories that were entertaining, but by the halfway mark of the book, I found myself continuing to read only in the ever thinning hope that SOMETHING interesting would happen to justify the time I had invested in the book. It never did. I finally had to set it down and quietly slide it into that dark place where stories I will never finish go. Oh how I miss Stephen King in his early years!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless, grotesque waste of time and money","review":"If you're a fan of detailed disembowelment, sickening depictions of strange sexual perverions, and lots of blood, this is for you.The author promises a novel that will build anticipation as the characters become more desparate in their situation.

A ghost story. I also thought the idea of having severeal short stories create a novel was interesting. I have no problem with graphic writing, and I even thought \\"Guts\\" was a cool story in a way.But as the novel progressed, I started getting bored. The writing style lost my attention, and the characters all started melting together. I started getting annoyed with the lack of a plot. I gave up on it after skimming ahead and not seeing any improvement. I tried finishing it, because I hate starting a book and not getting to the end. But I just couldn't anymore. I'm glad I checked it out from the library and didn't pay money for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Concept, But Mostly Disappointing","review":"\\"Haunted\\" has some fantastic, classic Palahniuk moments that made me laugh and cringe and feel sympathy all at once (St. Gutfree's story, for example). However, overall, this book is pretty weak. As other reviewers have noted, the short stories are very good, but the main plot that is supposed to bind them into one, cohesive novel just didn't work for me. On its own, this is not an outstanding read. Compared to \\"Fight Club,\\" it's barely worthy of sharing shelf space."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some of the short stories are entertaining, the book isn't","review":"Without repeating others too much, save yourself a headache and read his short stories rather than this.

There's maybe two good stories, I found that where I thought the main plot was going was FAR more interesting and creative than where the story actually WENT, I browsed the chapters b/c the charcters bored me to tears, I hated everyone (but not in a Humbert Humbert way - not hate enough to be engaged) and DIDN'T CARE. The last real \\"short story\\" was good. Otherwise, a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"We get it, you're telling disgusting stories","review":"Let me start by saying, I'm a big fan of Chuck. I've read numerous books by him, and enjoyed them all - except this one. I couldn't even finish this book, and not because it was too shocking, or because I have a delicate sensibility. It was just too much of the same thing, and it started to feel like a one-trick pony: disgusting story, stupid poem. It just got so old, with cliche, revolting characterization, and a plot that takes two sentences to sum up. I read Palahniuk for his riveting storylines and his social commentary. I don't, however, want to read him trying to one-up himself for an entire novel. If you're a first time Chuck Palahniuk reader, don't pick this book. Read Rant, Invisible Monsters, Survivor, or any other one really. Those will give you a better idea of what kind of writer he is. This one's just a radar blip."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just doesn't do it for me","review":"I have heard this book referred to as black comedy, horrific and with numerous other adjectives. I mostly found it sad and depressing. The most encompassing theme I could surmise is that people love misery and that humanity is anything but humane. Still, the book was a surprise to me. For all the positive reviews, I still don't get it. Except for one or two stories, revulsion wasn't even a dominant aspect. I found little if any humor. I gave it a two-star rating because at times the writing was quite good, but even that was very uneven. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peeling an Onion","review":"Reading this was very much like peeling an onion - after every layer, there is yet another.

At various turns the stories disgusting, amusing, disturbing, joyfully macabre, sad and just plain eerie. The characters themselves? Pushed by greed, fear, love, and some indescribable. This isn't a traditional ghost story - the charachters themselves carry all the ghosts and demons they require.With every successive story, the compulsion to find out just what everyones secrets are becomes more and more pressing. \\"All hope abandon, ye who enter here.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Its haunting","review":"This book is not for the faint of heart (or stomach).

The characters were not fleshed out in any way that made their choices even remotely plausible... I know that this book is meant to be a commentary on reality TV, etc., but it completely missed the mark. Just a terrible book. It was only through my own stubborness (I can't leave a book unfinished) that I read it through to it's conclusion. Which by the way, was just as stupid as the rest of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying too hard","review":"You can always tell when someone is writing a book just to be artsy. What was great about Fight Club, Choke and Diary is that they were simply written and could be enjoyed. With Haunted he seemed to go out of his way to make this book unenjoyable to read. Take Catcher in the Rye, a great book, maybe one of the best, and yet any 8 year old could make their way through it. A book does not have to be wordy and written in a style that makes your head hurt. There are so many people that read books like this only so that they can brag about reading them and put up a front that they are far more intellegent then anyone else. Give me a book that I want to read, and enjoy reading anytime."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book is miserable","review":"it is vital that you understand that your life will be worse if you decide to read this book. reading it is like having an extended conversation with the most arrogant, unlikable person you've ever met. poorly drawn, strictly unlikable characters + transparent attempts at arrogantly detached humor + countless events straight out of a middle school gross-out joke contest = gut-wrenchingly unreadable novel. various obvious, adolescent points are reinforced countless times in many unpleasant ways. this is my first exposure to this author and i will certainly never attempt another of his books. it deserves zero stars, which is not an option on this site."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck for Chuck","review":"I love Chuck Palahniuk's work - I've read everything. This one seemed desparate, though. Palahniuk has always been creatively sick, and frankly, that's what I've loved. And although, this book was sick, and I'll even give it creative, the two didn't blend well together. The premise was terrific, and I had high hopes. The execution, however, was just plain hard to stomach. I don't want to read chapter after chapter of people starving to death, detailed descriptions of their body fluids, and a blow by blow of the disintegration of civility. That was done much better in Lord of the Flies. The book also has one of the worst endings I've ever read.

The first chapter was incredible, but it was all downhill from there. The chapters are usually split into three parts. A segment of the main story, a poem about one of the main characters, and then a short story written by the same character. You learn about the characters through the short stories. The problem with this structure is that some of the chapters dedicated to the characters don't happen until 3/4 of the way through the book, so as your reading the main story you have no connection or background to the characters.This book is also gratuitous in it's use of disturbing imagery. I'm a 27 year old man, so I don't mind violence and stomach churning passages, but only if they're relevant to the story and not just disturbing for disturbance's sake.I would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not overly concerned with fact...","review":"I really wanted to like this. The first short story, \\"Guts\\", was wonderfully disturbing and I was looking forward to reading more in the same vein. Unfortunately, all of the others stories paled in comparison and left me feeling let down. I pushed to read the whole novel just in case there was another knock-out story and was further dissapointed. Many stories started out as promising and fizzled at the end. The wrap-around story had far too many characters and their complaining all made them sound like the same person.Several of the stories contained premises that would fall through in the \\"real world\\" because the facts contained within were incorrect. I was thrown out of the story by events that would not have happened due to reality. I understand suspending belief but it happened so often it made the writing seem lazy.I will be trying another Palahniuk book, but I am not as eager as before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shock Value","review":"I've heard a lot of really wonderful things about this author, particularly Fight Club, but most of this book was only good for the shock value. Haunted was not very well written, and frankly, I feel like my vocabulary has shrunk after reading this.I probably disliked it so much due to the high expectations that I had. The book is not awful, I simply don't agree with the fact that Chuck Palahniuk is one of the contemporary greats of literature. He just writes a lot of gross stuff, which I guess my generation is into.It was just sorely disappointing to open Haunted expecting a true work of art, and finding random descriptions of intestines, or blood.

What was most shocking was my inability to suspend belief. Mistaking pregoria for a septuagenarian... well, then these people, these figures away at this writer's retreat, are really too stupid to live. Furthermore, the belief that they will find financial gain in how they suffered is completely foolish. If these people were the most jaded, as proposed, then they'd understand such shock value would only carry them through a week... maybe a month, only to be replaced by something more absurd, pathetic and disturbing.Chuck Palahniuk has written some fine novels, has had some great plotting devices and interesting character development.

This book dealt with a bunch of people thrown together and locked up together for an extended period and then it dealt with the depths to which they'd all sink while in this place.The book was completely stupid and pointless to the extreme. I remember such things as a CPR doll being \\"used\\" by some antagonists (imply what you want by \\"used\\") and razor blades being put into the thing to get revenge on said antagonists. I remember someone being eaten, etc. There was absolutely no point to the book other than to try and gross out the reader. Honestly crappy stuff.Waste of money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"By far, this is one of the stupidest books I have ever read and I read about one book per week. Had I not been bored to death on an airplane, I never would have finished it. If you are half way through, you can stop reading because there really is no point to the book. This book is about a group of idiots who self mutilate, cannibalize and murder so they can be famous. As if that is not enough, each character in the book also shares a short story about mutilation, murder and isolation. In most cases,the details are gory and unpleasant This horrid book adds new meaning to the word unnecessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like a collection of rough drafts","review":"Have you ever read Asimov's I, Robot? Haunted is kind of like that: A bunch of short stories strung together by a loose over-all narrative.The difference here is that, while Asimov's stories were more or less self-contained, each with their own distinct begining, middle and end, most of Palahniuk's 'short stores' read more like the set up for a larger story. Reading it feels like, as the title of this review suggests, looking through a folder full of Palahniuk's ideas that never made it to book form. Sure, some aren't without their merits. Some are interesting, or even genuinely entertaining. The rest are clearly meant to shock and appall by any means necessary. But really, if you're still reading Palahniuk's books expecting some greater meaning or purpose beyond mindless entertainment and shock value, you're missing the point.If you're still thinking of Palahniuk's books as \\"literature\\", the joke's on you."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"This novel just does not measure up to previous works. It is contrived and shallow (as are the characters). I got very bored reading this and actually stopped somewhere near the ending (and, to hit the point home to strangers.... when I was younger, I read every book in my house including my mother's medical texts). However, I could not finish this work."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of Palahniuk's Worst Books","review":"While I have enjoyed many of Chuck Palahniuk's books (particularly \\"Lullaby\\" and \\"Diary\\"), \\"Haunted\\" is just plain bad. The short stories almost labor to reach a conclusion, and the connecting narrative is ridiculous after the first few chapters.Chuck Palahniuk is a very good writer, but this book is not up to standards. If you are looking for a Palahniuk book to read try Fight Club, or Survivor, or Lullaby, or Diary, but not Haunted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bret's evil twin?","review":"I picked up Haunted and Bret Easton Ellis' Lunar Park at the same time, and read them sequentially. Being a fan of the horror genre, I was not disappointed by either book. Haunted is a bit darker than the author's usual works... Lullaby, Fight Club, etc. but is a great read if you've got the stomach for it.(Think \\"Choked\\")My teenager has read a few of Palahniuk's titles, but this is one I wouldn't pass on to anyone but adults.Funny Haunted and Lunar Park released together. Coincidence? Or something more sinister?"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Onstage, instead of a spotlight...\\"","review":"This collection of poems and quick rewinds on each characters life that lead you up to how they've come to be trapped in what appeared to be a writer's retreat - but has turned into a very sticky trap.The book rolls along, rather pleased with itself. Each character's misfortunes quickly trumped by the next person's tale. Each gross and depraved action quickly replaced (taped over in this case) as the next moment shows how much lower humanity can dip. Think about the movie SAW.The sudden Biblical departure at the end really doesn't help the fact that this story wasn't going anywhere in particular in the first place. Oh ye great first man. Oh ye great first woman.Really. All of this just an exercise for the author to play with language and ideas. It accomplishes nothing and really just plays out like an immature 'baby on a meathook' joke from 2nd grade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Undefinably Awesome","review":"from the first story, guts, i couldn't stop. it was a nonstop roller coaster, filled with death, love and severed body parts. it couldn't be better. for fun, read guts enough times to be comfortable with it, then read it aloud to your friends.i've had a kid vomit right next to me. and 6 of them just gave up after the third page. this book is too good for words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts out good, then goes downhill from there...","review":"Having read Diary before this book, I was looking forward to another exciting and unpredictable Palahniuk novel. However, I was very disappointed.This book started out good, the gruesome stories grabbed my attention and made me want to read further, but the characters' actions turn it into a rather boring read, at least for me. I lost interest when the actions went from realistic/believable, to fake and far-fetched.I got the book 2 years ago shortly after it came out, and I've been trying to finish it ever since. I'm not even halfway through, and it's almost a chore to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"One of the worst books I have ever read. After the intial shocker in the swimming pool, I read to the end, thinking there must be more to this book. There never was. I read the authors proud description of people fainting from shock when the stories were read out loud. I can't imagine someone fainting after hearing these stories, but I guess that is what the author is proud to achieve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad it's this bad!","review":"I would really love to be able to give this book a better ranking, but I can't. It really is that terrible; which surprised me more than it annoyed me. I love Chuck Palahniuk's other books; especially Choke and Survivor, but this one just has no real redeeming qualities. In all his books the characters are somewhat terrible people or at the very least not your usual protagonists, but I ended up identifying or even liking them almost against my better judgment. In Haunted, however, there are no redeeming characters or qualities. I just hated all of them and wished they would get it over with. Basically, if you filled a room with people who embodied everything wrong and shallow about pop culture/materialism you would have this cast and therefore this plot. It may not be so bad to watch them all die, but since they are all so irritating you need it to be over with quickly. At best it should have been a short story."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"Don't waste your time or money. The first chapter seemed promising, but it fell apart pretty quickly. I had the Kindle version so I was able to easily flip through the pages to see if ANYTHING interesting was going to happen. Nope. One positive is that the book has many fairly free-standing short stories by and about the book's characters. So maybe you can glean something where I came up empty handed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Fix for the Palahniuks","review":"This is Chuck Palahniuk, if you aren't sure exactly what that implies or figure that I'm simply restating the authors' name, then you don't understand what Chuck Palahniuk, the given name, the sound of the syllables as they leave the tongue, the impact they make as they enter the eardrum and make contact with whatever part of the brain which keeps the memories of Choke or Diary or Lullaby, represent. If you don't know, you better find out. Because lemme tell you, it's a stone-cold rush. And if I'm the one to turn you on to this mad, gut wrenching, head spinning, superfly high...Then you're welcome.Seriously- if you like feeling this weird kind of \\"this bastard is sicker than me so I must be ok\\", than Palaniuks your guy. Especially this one, damn, he broke the crazy train mold with 'Haunted', or your money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"suspend your disbelief anyway","review":"YES, the stories ARE gross and the plots are a bit ridiculous. But this book does not intend to convince you of its reality, it clearly states that it gets \\"more and more extreme\\", and this is MORE true for the main storyline, rather than the short stories. I have to say that I wasn't sure I'd be able to handle the rest of the book after reading \\"Guts\\" [and this is incidentally, the FIRST short story featured in here].Also... why was no-one else as sickened as I was by \\"Hot Potting\\"? I think I must've put the book down 30 times and kept the lights on when I went to sleep. But maybe I'm one of those faint-hearted after all. I have never written a review of anything before, and my opinion of this book, is that whether you like it or hate it, you will probably feel provoked to feel something strong. To me, that's successful writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"yikes!","review":"in order to read this book, one cannot get offended by some of the things mentioned.......an open mind is a MUST....if you are concervative, do not read this book....ok, now, you've been warned.:-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Relentless despair","review":"I don't know if I have ever read a book that painted a bleaker portrait of the human condition. Basically an anthology of relentless depair and cynicism but curiously entertaining. A book like this can't help but make you feel better about your own life because these characters are some sick sick puppies. The literary equivalent of a terrible train wreck. It is hard to watch but harder to look away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Minus One Star for the Unimaginative Title","review":"I'm not one for hero worship or idolizing people whether they be writers, saints or my grandmother, and I have no desire to meet Chuck Palahniuk, attend a signing or write him a letter, but I do respect and admire his talent, and if I could be one writer other than myself, I would be Chuck Palahniuk. I hope he continues to write novels that inspire the kind of polarization apparent in the reviews I'm reading. Whether or not you care for the toilet humor and grotesque imagery is a matter of personal taste and he certainly isn't a writer for everyone, but you can't make any kind of honest statement about humanity without shining a light into the darkest corners, and if you can make them laugh out loud along the way, I call that genius. If you want a populist author hero, go buy the new Harry Potter. I hear it's really dark too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Death to Reality!!!!","review":"In this age of get rich selling your soul for television ratings and psuedo-celebrity, Chuck Palahniuk comes through with a novel that should help everyone look within themselves.Through a series of short stories, poems and one continuous story, Palahniuk expresses his distaste for all things reality. While the short stories do not always live up the expectations heaped upon Mr. Palahniuk, they do intertwine to make the whole narrative a great novel.What some may see as over the top gore and violence is used to make a point. How many people have you seen on television eat something vile simply for the chance to make some money and become famous for the hour or so that the show is on?Chuck Palahniuk is one of the great American writers of our time. Enjoy his writings while you can. Before long all that will be left is reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"First off, I am a huge Palahniuk fan. I've read every work of fiction he's written and was really excited for this latest addition. Long story short, it left me disappointed. It wasn't a bad book, per se, but definitely did not measure up to the likes of Survivor, Invisible Monsters or any of the rest, for that matter. A lot of the time it felt like he was being over the top simply for the sake of it... like it's expected of him now, so he needed to take it to the next level.The cleverness and plot twists we have come to expect from Palahniuk were essentially non-existent, and though there were some interesting short stories in there, most seemed to focus only on getting a disgusted reaction from readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was I thinking!!","review":"I recieved this book as a gift. I had asked for it after reading alot of reviews from this site and others. I cannot Believe any one liked this book. I forced myself to read half of it, hoping it would get better! I have never been more disgusted or disappointed by a book in my life!!!!!!!! And I cannot believe that people actually enjoyed and would recommend this garabage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH IT!!! READ ANYTHING ELSE!","review":"I stopped reading it at the 200th page. I got over reading it really fast. I truely tried and hoped it would get better and some how catch my attention but it did not. The stories in between the main storie were not half bad but all together it was confusing, boring and not worth reading. When you cannot get to like any of the characters theres a problem. This is the first and only books i have never finished, that says something since i have read hundreds of books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Up-Chuck","review":"This book is sorry and pointless. I've read six of Chuck's novels because I read good and bad writers for the fun of the pain. It's horrible. Haunted doesn't have a point, and it seeks to disturb, as if society hasn't desensitized us enough. We are not able to be shocked anymore, so stories glorifying guts for gut's sake are pointless."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL","review":"Wow, was that awful. I completely lost interest about halfway through. The main conceit is uninspired. The characters were not even one-dimensional. The short stories were an improvement, but Harlan Ellison did it better decades ago. So in fact did almost any old Twilight Zone episode.Gory in a completely uninteresting way. I never thought I'd say this, but even Bret Easton Ellis is better in that respect."},{"rating":"1","title":"buy a Ween album instead","review":"My guess is he must have signed a massive publishing contract or maybe chuck's editor is afraid of what might happen to her if she quits. This man's imagination has led him far away from literature and deep, deep, deep into the muggy and humid black tarpits of cult fiction. Which hey, if that's what you're after, then cool. Just know now it ain't lit. It doesn't stimulate, it titillates.I recommend White Pepper or Mollusk. (Ween know they're being childish.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gruesome Pathetic Novel","review":"I am absolutely amazed that so many people gave this book such high marks. This is one of the most gory, gruesome, dismal and at the same time boring books I have ever read. I will admit that the first chapter regarding Saint Gut-Free had me curious, and even holding my breath. After the first couple of chapters, I felt as if the writer was desparate to see if he could up the shock value ante. The plot was mundane. Each of the characters was trying to be the most famous by doing the most harm to themselves. I become numb and bored to the violent acts about 1/3 of the way through the novel. I do not recommend buying this book. I would not waste my money or time."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I told you I threw up in the first chapter...","review":"how would you feel?? The very first chapter of the book titled \\"guts\\" made me physically throw up which has never ever happened to me before. I pride myself in having an odd and somewhat disturbing collection of books, but this... this was something else! this book follows a group of auhtors who are living under the same roof for the purpose of novel writing. I have read many a chuck palanuik book including; fight club, survivor, and invisible monsters none of which disturbed me even half as much as this book. This was my last palanuik read! From what I hear from other fellow fans his writing has only gotten more grotesque from here! So no thank you I draw the line in the sand here and no farther!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely F***ed...but AMAZING!","review":"I got the book last Thursday, and I finished it last night. It is absolutely sickening but some of the best writing I have ever encountered. I wouldn't consider myself a \\"sick individual\\" as some of the reviewers have implied you would have to be to enjoy this. My favorite books are \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" and \\"Wicked\\", however, this book is so entrancing and mindblowing that it is right up there with my favorites. And at the end of it all, the ending maintains intimate poignancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going for the shock value","review":"I didn't find this book that good. I had read 'Fight Club' and loved it and was hoping to get the same experience from this book, but that was not the case. Honestly, I felt like the writer was trying to be as disgusting as possible, going for total shock value. I also didn't feel that the book flowed very well. I'd really like to read some of his other books but hope that they aren't like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Palahniuk jumps the shark","review":"It pains me to say this, but this is easily the weakest book Palahniuk has written. It caps off a downhill slide that began with Lullaby and continued with Diary. I think Chuck needs to take a break and re-focus if he's going to keep the \\"our generation's Don DeLillo\\" title. First time readers are better off investing their time in either Survivor or Fight Club."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not comfortable","review":"While the sole is very comfortable, the side straps were far too tight and dug into my toes.

There were some clever bits that did just that. however, I felt like I had gone back to a college literature critique course. Most of the text has to do with the author's college professor peers.For me, it became a chore and I found myself trying to skip from cat sequence to cat sequence and skipping the critiques of the authors' peers. I don't often do this, but I gave up on the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW! NOT FUNNY!","review":"This is a very hard book for younger teens. Our 8th grade class has not understood the high class chinese philosphy that the cat uses we can never figure out whether he is being sarcastic or being real.

It is a much better choice that for instance Munowitz's \\"Principles of Chemistry\\" as it is better illustrated and gives betterexplained examples. It has some weaknesses, but it is a real Chemistry book, that might prove useful doing chemical problems. For a really interested person it is not a bad choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrendous Chemistry Textbook","review":"I am an undergraduate in an advanced general chemistry class and I had to purchase this...atrocity. Principles of Modern Chemistry is written by three physical chemists, who, while experts in their own fields, have an extremely skewed and flawed view of general chemistry. This book is not an effective textbook. It is replete with mistakes (diagrams,equations!!,questions), and very few effective example questions to reinforce the concepts. Instead, there are random equations placed about, and the central concepts are only lightly discussed. The organization of this textbook is also quite terrible.

I bought the used version of this book, and I would highly recommend buying the answer key to it too, my prof loved to test us on questions found at the back of each chapter, all he did was tweak the numbers and elements.Of course, we didnt cover the entire book, but this is as comprehensive as you need to get, unless you are doing some highly specialized chemistry. Good for acid/base topics all the way to quantum/Schrodinger's equations.

However, from the explanations in the textbook, it seems to be written for students who have already had taken general chemistry. The examples are not helpful for solving the problems and the explanations are very wordy and can even be convoluted at times. The ordering of the material is also very confusing and not helpful for most chemistry students. The only good things is that it has lots of problems and they are useful for learning the material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly written book.","review":"The concepts of this book are horribly constructed in convoluted sentences. Oxtoby may have been a genius, but he certainly could not teach, nor could he write in a manner that is both complete and simple.Also, this book is full of backwards logic wherein Oxtoby continually argues that chemical principles are true because a graph or math equation says so, rather than explaining how the principle (through experimental evidence) leads to a mathematical understanding. And although this may \\"offer\\" a more advanced, or complete analysis of these properties than other books may, he consistently fails to provide an adequate fundamental explanation before going further.This should have been ghost-written by someone more competent in clear, English prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"It deserves 0 - if not negative stars","review":"Note: I'm 18.

The highest compliment I can pay is that I have worn out multiple copies of this record. All the songs are interesting and well done. She has more than just awesome range: her phrasing and dynamics are phenomenal. It's rare to find music/songs/a voice that you can actually listen to over and over and never get tired of."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Love Rachelle Ferrell But CD SKIPS!","review":"I love Rachelle Ferrell's music. This is my second time purchasing this CD, because I wore the first one out! I had no problems with my first CD. However, this CD skips once or twice on every other song, which is very annoying! Also, the CD case arrived cracked. I am a frequent, usually happy Amazon customer. But this purchase was not up to the usual standards of Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Showing promise ...................","review":"The site review puts her in the same company as Anita Baker.

From the 1st track on this CD up until the last, I can guarantee that you will truly fall in love completely with this CD and not want to put it away. Rachelle is like a breath of fresh air, with vocals ranges that one can't begin to imagine a voice being able to do. To purchase this CD is one that you won't regret buying. I don't even think one can even write a review that would give her enough justice, but to purchase this CD will help you to hear, what we as reviewers can't begin to place into words."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply amazing","review":"This CD is a classic.

There's storytelling which flows quickly, and there are those passages that you just know took time to craft. I appreciate that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Standing On Holy Ground: A Triumph Over Hate Crime in the De","review":"I was fighting tears before I finished the first chapter. I thought we had come farther than this. What broke my heart was not just that a few twisted individuals would commit such atrocities, but that the victims did not trust the system to come to their aid. That speaks volumes. We still have a long way to go and Sandra's book has made that abundantly clear. Those who helped turn things around for this church are true heros and much braver than I.Betty Wilson Beamguard"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A Masterpiece!\\"","review":"Sandra E. Johnson has created a masterpiece in journalism! No bias can be found anywhere in her book--only the facts. As the story unfolds, one truly begins to feel as he or she were treading on Holy Ground (page after blessed page). Upon reading this book, no one can ever say againg that the truth is boring or that real stories must be embellished for artistic flare and entertainment. Johnson's words hammer home every riveting detail in a fashion that makes the reader feel as if they are gliding through a well-written novel. Who needs fiction when you can have this kind of truth?Through telling of how diverse people banded together to rebuild St. John Baptist Church, Sandra Johnson shows the world that love, faith, hope and a spirit of unity can come together to work miracles. It is a message that she proclaims to us all and we're the better for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated and not informative","review":"Don't waste your money.

Mr Sheed has the remarkable ability to take make complicated subjects understandable. I especially enjoyed his razor analogy in the discussion of life's purpose.

The photos are top quality shots mostly of animals mimicking various human emotions and situations. They are the light side of the book. The text is more weighty, but brief - I'd even call it profound. Put together, they give the reader a fun, yet meaningful reading experience that makes an impact. I've since purchased additional copies for gifts."},{"rating":"1","title":"I won't purchase from independent sellers again.","review":"this review is in general for the independent sellers on Amazon. I purchased 8 NEW copies of The Meaning of Life by Bradley Greive from 8 different vendors. 2 of the 8 came to be in less than new condition. One had a personalized message in it. another came to me damaged - I'm guessing it became damaged during the shipment - however other than the plastic 'mailbag' it was in, there was no other packaging to protect it. The seller should have wrapped the book in something ELSE before placing it in the plastic.So, of the 8 NEW books I purchased (to give as gifts), I can only use 6. That is only 75% of my total purchase. If this isn't reason to NEVER order from the independent sellers again, I don't know what is.

It claims to be a witty, thought-provoking book that makes an ideal gift for anyone who's seeking their true purpose and wants to laugh along the way. The only thing this book has going for it is the amazing animal pictures. It did have one thought that I really liked: \\"Some people say that life is all about acquiring knowledge. If that's true, then why do smart people dress so badly?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"The Meaning of What???","review":"It's a shame that Bradley Trevor Greive ruined all of those beautiful photographs of animals and nature with all the little green letters at the bottom of each of the pages.

It explains why the divorce rate is high. WHy there is so many deadbeat dads. Why volunteering is way down.Before you consider the meaning to life, ask yourself this: who depends on me. Do they come first? How will my decision effect them? Indeed, doesn't a focus on OTHERS rather than myself bring true meaning? One of the msot consistsent findings in psychological research (I'm a Shrink) is the correlation between happiness and helping others.The Author feels that the meaning to life is a focus \\"inward.\\" True meaning comes when you focus outward.

How arrogant of a man to claim that he loves animals so much but then sell books filled with ridiculous, comic-like photos of animals, just to make himself wealthy and famous. Not only is this book insulting to animals, it's insulting to the intelligence of the reader. I can't believe anyone would be so childish as to find anything useful in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money, save a tree","review":"Save your hard-earned money and skip buying this greeting-card-like book. You will also save killing more trees -- too many have already been sacrificed to provide the paper for this simpleton stuff. Despite the hype, there's nothing more in this book than a 10 year-old child could write in a few minutes, and as other reviewers have pointed out, the books in this series (all by the same author) are degrading to the dignity of animals. What a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for those Searching","review":"As someone who always says I am looking for the Meaning of Life, this title caught my eye (even though I didn't think it actually contained the answer). It does tell you that you need to find your own meaning (guess I knew that) but the quotes are SO true and the pictures SO cute, I thoroughly enjoyed them and they give me the message that I am on the right path. I look forward to the day when \\"I'll be excited about beginning another day and be filled with heartfelt joy.\\" Sounds great to me!I you are interested in this topic I would highly recommend Finding Your Own North Star: Claiming the Life You Were Meant to Live by MARTHA BECK.Good Luck on your search."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meaning of what?","review":"I was unsatisfied with this book. It is quite cliche and far more shallow than the title would imply. Maybe I expected too much, but I assumed there would be some wisdom here deeper than can be found in a Hallmark greeting card.

That was probably surprising, me being a guy who likes Bernard Cornwell novels, among others. But I could only get through 12 pages of this one. The author introduces dozens of characters at once, and I found myself going back and forth, back and forth, ad nauseum, to the family tree. It was only moderately helpful. The task of deciphering who is in what branch of the family is complicated by the fact that families intermarried, married cousins, etc. The more characters she introduced in Chapter 1, the worse it got. I was so thoroughly befuddled that I put the book down, placed it in the 'donate' stack, and found the other 12 I had as last year's Christmas presents, and put them in the donate pile, too.

It has a film noir atmosphere, and does not shy away from taking provocative stands on a myriad of issues. For example, one episode explores the right of the individual to say \\"no\\" to the peer group pressure of a newly-formed vigilante group, a concept that strikes at the heart of functioning democratic societies. The only complaint of I have with this boxset is that BRENNER did not have more episodes to include.

It's now been a week or so and everyone has reported that little oranges continue to pop up. Tree is well formed in the bonsai traditions, comes with a good little bonsai pot and is an indoor variety so doesn't have to just live outside somewhere where no one ever sees it.Great gift, and I even bought one for myself.

I found that the two books complemented one another well. I was mainly interested in Sengoku jidai (Warring States period) history, and this book provided a decent overview, while Turnbull's book provided many of the details of the period which were not mentioned in this book. JAPAN: FROM SHOGUN TO SONY serves as an ample overview of Japanese history from 1543 to 1984, although an individual seeking very in-depth coverage of a specific segment of that time period would do well to supplement this book with another book dealing specifically with the particular part of the time period in which he is most interested (i. e., Sengoku jidai, Tokugawa era, Meiji era, pre WWII era, etc.).The terminology used in JAPAN: FROM SHOGUN TO SONY is very accessible, and the book makes for a interesting read.Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original Parts is the way to go","review":"I purchased both original and compatible Brother print cartridges, I am a believer that the original parts are the way to go.

As good as this one is however, my all time favorite Go West album is \\"Dancing on the Couch\\" released back in '87.

Each mini section was very short, and I found some of the medication information to be incorrect (I am not a doctor but we've had quite the experience with all types of medication).

Nothing in this book helped me with the maintenance of them.Bottom line... if you have a brand new bike that has top of the line components, buy this book.

There wasn't anything really new that I didn't already know or hadn't read before. I was hoping for specific information on toddler emotional development, such as: when is my toddler emotionally capable of ________ . Instead it was just a general overview of toddlers. A chapter is devoted to shy children or \\"slow to warm up\\", and really active children. And I guess is you have one and don't know much about those two temperments it may be useful. However I have a \\"slow to warm up\\" child but again, no new information."},{"rating":"2","title":"An academic overview of the toddler's psyche","review":"I am still in the process of reading this book.

A nice change from superficial fluff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it. What a waste of money","review":"Let me just make this short and sweet: this book sucked. Sorry to be so harsh, but I did not find it worthwhile in any sense. It was not insightful, instead making extremely obvious points over and over again. It was preachy and judgy.

Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"too guilt ridden","review":"The book had some great information, but the overall take home for me was all the ways I could mess up my daughter for life!

I learned a TON from this book, and it made me a better mom during those difficult toddler years.

Read it if you want to feel guilty."},{"rating":"1","title":"One-Sided, Hateful Biography","review":"This will be short because much of what I have to say echoes previous reviews. Kenneth Lynn dislikes Chaplin to the the extent that he has written a biography of the man that is patently unfair and one-sided. Lynn is often shameful in attributing hateful and narcissistic motives to as many of Chaplin's career and life decisions as he can. Lynn focuses obsessively on Chaplin's sordid sex life at the expense of his exquisite art. (Lynn doesn't know much about film, it is clear). Lynn writes of Chaplin's political leanings in terms that would make all but red-baiting Joseph McCarthy, the Junior Senator from Wisconsin, blush. Its almost as though through Lynn, McCarthy has returned from the grave. Read this book only if David Robinson's \\"Chaplin: His Life and Art\\" remains out of print, and then read it skeptically and as a last resort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chaplin is on trial once again and this time convicted.","review":"For anyone who has read David Robinson's definitivebiography on Chaplin there is nothing new inKenneth Lynn's \\"Charlie Chaplin and his Times,\\"unless you wish, as the author seems to, that Chaplinwas convicted for all the crimes he was actuallyacquitted of. The author attempts to support hispreposterous thesis that every move Chaplin evermade was either a conscious or subconscious responseto his mother's mental illness. There is nothingabout creative or technical process here, only a 1920'sprudishness and '50's red-baiting mentality. Many ofthe author's interpretations of sexual symbolism inChaplin's early films are truly not for the squeamish."},{"rating":"1","title":"A skewed view of Chaplin and his times","review":"It is not until late in the book that Lynn's true aim in writing about Chaplin becomes clear. It isnot, as the title implies, an attempt to seat Chaplin's work in the social context of the worldaround him. Instead it is, along with Joyce Milton's \\"Tramp,\\" another attempt to correctthe left-wing view of Chaplin as an innocent well-meaning artist driven out of America byphilistine witch hunters. Unfortunately, like Milton, Lynn goes much too far in the otherdirection. For instance, he credits such dubious sources as Joan Barry's FBI statement andtestimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee with far more validity thanthey can bear. By the end, it becomes obvious that Lynn has dug into every source that canpresent Chaplin as a politically-hypocritical sexual monster. That he might have been, but Lynn's bias is so obvious that it becomes impossible to get near the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I hung with this book because 'Mr. Lynn' is a highly respected writer. He did not disappoint in that area, the writing is crisp at times but the tone is crabby and vindictive. His obvious dislike for his subject gains as the book progresses. He seems to find it very difficult to compliment Chaplin or any of his films. I think most people when reading a biography hope for a objective approach from the writer but at least in Mr. Lynn's ' Chaplin' you won't find it.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music!","review":"This CD is from the sound track of the movie, \\"Pretty Woman.

This aunt and uncle have a reclusive neighbor named Miss Ophelia, a piano teacher, who agrees to give lessons to the girl, Belly. Miss Ophelia and Belly becomes friends, and it is during this friendship that Belly learns Miss Ophelia is having an affair with the uncle. The resultant activity is heartwrenching, both very funny and very sad. An added feature is that MISS OPHELIA plays heavily on gossip, superstition, and hypocracy.

She takes piano lessons from a woman name Ophelia that calls her Isabel, shows her what a real lady is, wins over her heart, and also the heart of Uncle Avery, Aunt Rachel's husband. This causes a lot of problems in Belly's life and causes her to learn a lot life's lessons pretty early. This book was written very beautifully and opened my heart back up to my childhood.

I love \\"Today\\" and \\"It's My Life,\\" they were great 80's synth-pop-dance tracks, the latter of course recently remade by No Doubt. The first half of this disc contains the more easily accessible material from the early albums, but from the very beginning one can see Talk Talk eager to break out of the synth-pop mold. As Talk Talk matured, their records became less pop-oriented, more textured and nuanced. There is a lot of great music here, none of it fitting into any preconceived mold of what pop music is supposed to be.

The first thing I thought when I put this album in and started listening to it was this would be the CD you would want to play in the future if someone ever wanted to know what 80s music was like and the whole era itself. Its not just that but if you listen to the music and lyrics its more than just an 80s band. They actually have good songs and lyrics. My favorite tracks are Its my Life and Talk Talk.

It completely transcends the typical, blah, two-dimensional fantasy novel and offers us the true irony behind the forming of a legend - about a \\"hero\\" who is several rungs below the decent.

This story is an atempt to put a British spin on story about a few misguided, mangy, want-ta-be American Rambos and a couple derranged, misbegotten Brits. Perhaps, the story wouldn't have been so bad if the the author had understood some things about American slang. He kept getting mixed up on who was who. Americans do not ever say \\"bloody\\" and we are never \\"bloks\\". The ending has been heard, or read, or seen, on the \\"box\\" hundreds of times. It amazes me how we can pretty much look like 'em (the Brits), but be so damn different from them.

There is no real substance in it and the prose, which may have entertaining in England in the forties, is boring and frustrates one trying to get at the meat of the matter. It also seems to be a spin off of the \\"swing the clubhead with your hands\\" technique in Ernest Jones' Swing the Clubhead, which in contrast to this book, is both entertaining and instructive. By the way, the 1952 copyright edition of the Jones book is much better than the 1937 one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Billy Dean's Young Man CD","review":"I love this CD!

Having heard many Louis Prima songs before ever owning an album, I thought all of his songs would be perfect and golden. Well, in the Capitol Collectors Series there are a couple of weird filler songs but overall the songs are enjoyable. I was even pleasantly surprised toward the end of the album, when I discovered fine quality jazz tracks.Overall I am glad to own some of Louis Primas greatest hits and I don't regret a thing.

This is the second time I'm buying it because I wore the CD out (actually, I lost it, but hey, it probably would've worn out soon anyways, right?) Typically classified as pop or broadway, it is definitely more along the lines of swing, or a genre of my own creating, 50s Italian. Listening to it makes me think of movies such as Bronx Tale, Goodfellas, and the like.

They all swing, and there are ballads in there as well that are great. The 'Embraceable You' track is hilarious. I bought it mainly for the 'Angelina, Zooma Zoom' medley, but as a whole this is probably the best Prima collection available. His version of 'St. Louis Woman' is cranked up. All of these tunes were recorded in the late 50s, when Louis Prima was at the top of his game. His mixtures of style, sudden tempo changes and craziness always keeps you on your toes. He let his horn section do lots of solos; some of the saxaphone work is some of the best I've heard for swing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prima Swings","review":"The Louis Prima Collectors Series is simply one of the best collections of music ever. Every song on the disc is a classic.

I even bought extra stuffs like plant food, cool mist humidifier just to revive the plant. Well now, after 3 weeks, 90% of the leaves are gone, branches bare, looks like those bare trees that you see during winter.

I hoped they would die on their own but after three weeks they were still there and the plant itself had started to die. I bought plant insect spray and they killed the bugs. The plant died two weeks later. I was very disappointed since I'd always wanted a bonsai tree and gardenia is my favorite scent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Plant I ordered, DON'T BUY THIS PLANT","review":"I ordered this plant and I can't even beleive you're allowed to lie like this and get away with it.

Seems to not have any growth and getting yellower by the day. I'm not sure it survived shipping very well. It was moist when we got it, but there was only one bloom left on it which dropped after one week. I didn't care for it any differently than the Jade, which sits right next to it on the counter. The only thing it seems to attract is bugs. We finally had to put it outside because it was getting pretty bad. I think its still alive, but not sure how much longer it has."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was this?","review":"So it came with beautiful greens and full of flowers. Was really optimistic, no instructions - i.e. how old is it? After the flowers died, it got fleas, which are soil related. It bugged my other plants. However, its a cutting of a shrub, not a bonsai. Its just stuck in a bonsai pot. Now I'm in the bug spraying mode- frustrating. It would have been easier to care for it as a plant, since its buggy. Now I have to train it into a bonsai. It seems root bound, but we're not supposed to anything the first year. Gardenias are hardy but delicate so I'm frustrated with spraying for bugs and for the season I have to bring it in and I hate bugs."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Chiffon Scarf","review":"Mignon G.

I am hoping to see \\"From the Dark Stairway\\", \\"While the Patient Slept\\", \\"The Patient in Room 18\\", \\"The Mystery of Hunting's End\\", just to name a few on Kindle very soon.

The machine does not work as advertised. It gets cloged continuosly. Coins do not roll down the ramp properly. I many times ended up with a coin being delivered to the wrong wrap. It is also hard to know if you got a full count of coins so many times I ended up re-rolling the rolls. I eneded up sorting the coins manually and pretty much feeding them manually into the wraps. No doubt wrapping quarters is easier by hand.Good concept - bad execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of garbage","review":"This isn't fragile, it just plain doesn't work. After putting only one or two coins in at a time, it still jammed up for no reason.

Taking it apart is your only option, and putting it back together is a pain as well.I can't imagine this would ever work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Introduction","review":"Formed by vocalist/songwriter Martin Walkyier after he left thrash act Sabbat, Skyclad is undoubtedly one of metal's most unique bands. The fact that they're classified as \\"folk metal\\" speaks volumes, as the genre was most likely created so we'd have some way of classifying Skyclad in the first place! How best to describe Skyclad...Therion meets Jethro Tull perhaps? This is undeniably metal, but with heavy emphasis on the electric violin and folk elements. It's heavy, at times aggressive, and progressive as well.Released in 1996, Old Rope serves as a \\"best of\\" collection, and is the perfect album for introducing new listeners to Skyclad. It features a hefty 17 tracks, including some live performances, which span Skyclad's career up to that point. Old Rope is an inexpensive way to discover a great, avant-garde metal band that just about any open-minded metal fan should enjoy on some level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Sinatra","review":"Look closely. That's Nelson Riddle standing behind a forlorn Sinatra on the cover. This is a devastatingly beautiful collection of sad songs with Gordon Jenkins pouring on the strings as only he could and Sinatra singing his heart out as only he could. Both were poets at what they did. There's so much on this album that is emotionally overwhelming--listen to \\"A Cottage for Sale\\" for example. Sinatra was at the top of his form and the album was a tremendous international hit and rightly so. I remember it as it came out of the box at Deibel's Records in Wellston Missouri and a storefull of fans grabbed the premiere copies, one crying already just at the cover!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing arrangements","review":"I purchased the CD because I wanted one of my favorites HERE'S THAT RAINY DAY, but am very disappointed - Sinatra's voice is strong but the orchestra and musical arrangements are very weak!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where Do You Go?","review":"I've owned this album for some time, and many times it seems appropriate to get out the good scotch and a strong cigar and become immersed in this album. There's something stark but spacious in the arrangements. You can picture someone in a crowded but lonely bar, staying until last call, getting one for the road. But then it's time to leave. Lighting up the last cigarette, heading out the door into the chill of the evening in anytown U.S.A. It begins to rain, but you can't go home. Too many memories there. So now what? Where do you go? Well maybe there's another bottle of scotch at home, and a fresh pack of smokes. And there's \\"No One Cares\\" already sitting next to the CD player. This is the soundtrack for this type of evening and early morning. Guess you'll be OK. Frank can do that. It's almost as if he understands and takes the load off your shoulders. This is one of the few albums that does this and does it perfectly. Now if you'll excuse me, it's last call.

Full disclosure, I'm from Cleveland originally so I had a ball watching this satire. That's what it is -- don't take it for a comedy or a drama...it's a satire and a bit of a black comedy. Subtitled one woman's story is about to climax. About Parker Posey's sexual dysfunction, it's both naughty and nice. Danny DeVito is hilarious....the section of the movie where there's a slide into the pool is a good analogy for the theme which is about the quest for not only the big O but also personal fulfillment. Paul Rudd lets Parker take the lead, Mischa Barton is sweet and savvy and very sexy. And it proves that all is not perfect with the prettiest girl in Cleveland even when you marry her. Don't miss the hilarious and deleted scenes....completely mindless popcorn movie...for late night viewing instead of HSN...."},{"rating":"1","title":"No fun","review":"NO fun at all. She has not ever had an orgasm and when her husband leaves her she starts to look around..."},{"rating":"2","title":"So close, so close...","review":"The problem with the \\"Oh in Ohio\\" is that it was \`produced' and \`marketed' as a comedy. At its core, it is not. It would be a much better film, and actually much funnier, if it were re-edited as a dramedy.Many of it's comic moments work, and could be far more effective if the film was about 45 degrees more serious. But too often the comedy is either underdeveloped or overwrought. The film, as presented, tries too hard to be funny, especially with a cast so gifted at understatement.Oh's cast, the skill of the director, et al, to capture their obvious magic and the film's story concepts make it, in many ways, a rewarding film. If you can forgive some of it's minor excesses, you will begin to feel what it's like to be kissed by Posey, Rudd, Barton, David, Bailey, Graham & DeVito.

Also the single most horrible flaw with this game is that you HAVE TO PAY FOR ONLINE!!!!!! If you have this for the xbox 360 you already pay for your online capabilities but these guys want you to pay more and its ALOT more. Its 10 dollars more to get on and get insulted constantly by a bunch of nerds! If you want to play online in this game get the demo for it because it is free. If this game didn't have horrible voice acting, chapter endings and previews, loading screens that constantly pop up, and a online fee it could have been a great game.

What?","review":"Before I touch on anything else I'd like to state, up front, that if I had known the book was printed in Comic Sans I would not have bought it at any price. This is not a joke; the horrible font is a major distraction from the story. It was hard to believe my eyes, frankly. It may have been a full minute before I was able to actually accept the information they were trying to feed my protesting brain. Even now I find myself opening the book with the expectation that I have been mistaken, and the font is back to normal--no.The illustrations are faded, 3rd-generation copies of low-resolution scans of the originals. They are, for instance, so poorly rendered as to obscure the words written on the scrolling ribbon across the jars on the frontispiece.At $25, I feel taken advantage of by the publisher for the level of quality in printing and typography.

The product took me only 90 minutes to install; most of this time was spent pulling out the stereo head unit (an HU-605 in my 2006 Volvo S80).It works very well with the IPod; the only complaints:1) Sometimes when you start the car; the system skips around and the stereo displays \\"CD Changer Load Discs\\". It takes about 5 seconds and then it works fine.2) If you try and quickly change the \\"CD\\" (which changes the playlist) the unit can become confused, and it takes a few seconds to recover its mind.Other than that, it works well and I'm happily listening to my ipod; and my sirius radio through the AUX input on the unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware Authorized dealers","review":"I bought a unit from AudioKraze via amazon and when I connected to my Volvo head unit, it doesn't recognize three different ipods I tried.I called USASPEC and they said that AudioKraze is not an authorized dealer so they couldn't warranty the unit.so, don't buyer beware if buying USASpec from Audio Kraze"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised","review":"Installed in my 2003 V70 with HU-613.

The authors demonstrate how 'knowledge' is vital to innovation within Japanese firms, with clear distinction made between 'tacit' and explicit' knowledge. An effort is made to distinguish the differences between Japanese and Western firms through an emphasis on the importance of 'tacit' knowledge and a 'middle-up-down' management process. Other than Chapter 2 (a review of philosophical background relating to epistemology which might put some readers off), this book has minimal jargons and complexities and would be an easy and enjoyable read even for non-academics. The arguments presented by the authors are well-illustrated with relevant industrial examples. Overall, this is a book that not only brings a new perspective to knowledge management but also raises questions for the ardent researchers who might ponder over its relevance to non-Japanese firms."},{"rating":"2","title":"A look at knowledge creation","review":"I came to this book through a reference in Novak & Gowin. What caught my eye was that someone was willing to talk about an epistemological stance other than the analytic, reductionist view held in science. For the most part, I found this book's understanding of Western epistemology to be reasonable; I can't speak for the Japanese epsitemology cited. What interested me, and for which I recommend the book, is their view of knowledge creation. The case studies lend weight to their view, but they do explicate a possible model for turning subjective knowledge into explicit knowledge. They suggest a management model for making it happen. The book is very well written and edited.I believe the book needs a very careful read *outside* the business community. I would put this book down as the business version of Feynman's *The Character of Natural Law*."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a book and it's free online anyway","review":"The only thing you need to know about this \\"book\\" is that it's not a book at all, but an article that is available for free online as a 10 page PDF file. Google the title and save yourself the $8.95 plus shipping that I spent to find that what was shipped to me I already had on my hard drive. The \\"book\\" is 56 pages double spaces and the size of a small birthday card. As to the concepts discussed, I find them highly interesting but in fairness I'm still investigating this subject so I'll leave the analysis to others better qualified but the central theme that knowledge is tacit and created in Japanese firms vs. quantifiable, objective and structured in IT systems in the western world is worthy of consideration. Two stars for this idea having value for anyone looking to re-create the organizational knowledge structure of a company, but I'm being generous. It feels like I got ripped off."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Can't Miss\\" book","review":"I recently had the opportunity to attend a motivational seminar by Ken Futch, and for others who have, reading this book is like icing on the cake. For those not fortunate enough to have seen this dynamo in action, Ken's book is packed with real life strategies to help you achieve your own personal best. Written in an easy-to-read, down-to-earth style, Ken has the stories/examples and sense of humor that make this book a very entertaining read. After being impressed with Ken's seminar, I purchased this book for my son who is entering the job market after graduation from college. Although we are from two distinctly different generations, he too enjoyed the book immensely and felt like he gleaned information that will help him succeed in the workforce and in life. Just one side note, Ken is much better looking than Bill Murray (smile)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterful Storyteller Offers Insight, Advice While Making You Laugh","review":"Ken Futch is a very funny man. He talks funny, he tells funny stories and he even writes funny. It isn't often one reads a book that keeps you laughing the entire time you're learning. But this book does exactly that.This gifted storyteller uses numerous examples from his own life to teach valuable lessons about overcoming obstacles, preparing for failure as well as success, and turning a temporary situation into a longterm opportunity. He reminds us how easy it is to overlook the everyday opportunities that are staring us in the face. More importantly, though, he offers specific advice on how to recognize opportunities and take advantage of them every time.As we learn about Ken's failures and successes, from his childhood in Burgaw, NC to the jungles to Vietnam, to the ivory towers of AT&T;, we discover that we each have something in common with Ken. If he isn't already your friend, he will be by the last page."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fantasy of rape and male dominance without consent","review":"Do not confuse this book with an S/M fantasy. There is no mutual consent, and no attention to the motivations of the submissive females or the dominant males. Many graphic scenes of rape of unconsenting young adolescent females with bondage & male dominance. But the descriptions focus on the physical act, ignoring the psychological subtext which is central to good S/M fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mashed Potatoes and Country Gravy with Turkey == Mystery Mounds","review":"Prepping for the assault on Mount Robson in Robson River Campground, we opted to give Alpine Aire's Mashed Potatoes and Country Gravy with Turkey a try. Oops--we don't pack a pot large enough for the required 3.25 cups of boiled H2O. We found an O2 absorber and a country gravy packet inside. The directions didn't address the gravy packet. So we boiled 2 cups and mixed 'em with gravy and then into the main package while boiling another 1.25 cups. The water mixed poorly. We waited 8 minutes after each addition of hot water and still the moderately chunky turkey wasn't fully rehydrated, although the bits had a turkey flavor. The overall result was poor quality instant potatoes that were too runny and flavorless even with added salt and pepper. We threw half away and ate crackers instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible food","review":"I brought these on a camping trip and was sorely disappointed with them, especially with all the positive review here on Amazon.

They either need to design the product better with an extra bag to cook the gravy or take the product off the shelf.

Don't buy it unless they make changes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"IT'S OK","review":"My fan will not work on high, so not sure what the problem is, power source? anyway I do like the fact that's it's made in the USA and it does blow a lot of air on low.It could be a good fan depending on your use.I purchased it for tent camping (8 man Tent) and unless you need hearing aids, this fan is noisy, so much so that we would not be able to sleep with it on.To bad, it could be a great fan if the noise level could be lower, but than the trade off would be NO AIR.Like I said depending on your use, it could be a very good fan for you.

Current draw is around 1 amp, 1.5 amps, and 2.6 amps for the 3 speeds. Doubt I'll ever need to use the highest setting, it's that good at creating a breeze.Can't speak for durability yet. Everything is plastic so I wouldn't let it get banged around or fall. The feet do look a little flimsy so I intend to fill the hollow spots in with epoxy. They'll break off the housing before the feet themselves will bust. OTOH, because it's all plastic, it's pretty light.Will make a great fan for warm weather tent camping which is my intended use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good ventilator","review":"Purchased for use on 37 ft long wooden sail boat.

There is quite a difference in the speeds between low, medium and high, with low using very little current. High uses quite a bit more. I think it should cost half of what it does though. I guess it's this expensive because 12-volt fans are kind of a specialty item, unlike standard 120-volt household fans, which cost far less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleasantly surprised","review":"with this fan, to the point that I purchased 2 in addition to my initial purchase. Would be excellent for people with broken or no air conditioning in their vehicles, boats or DC solar systems like I have. I'll probably buy a couple/few more, but not until the price comes back down to a minimum of $65, or less. As nice as this fan is, it is still hard for me to justify $73+ for a plastic fan, mainly due to the fact that I haven't had the fans long enough to see what their longevity is. It really is cool just hooking one of these fans up to an Optima battery, kicking back and knowing it would cool me for days, even without a solar panel.

I am currently online looking for other books on the subject because I found it so compelling.I think the book is more likely to serve as a resource for an artist--as a source of inspiration or ideas--than for a researcher. If you enjoy the study of symbols and tradition, and if you are looking for a jumping-off point for further investigation, or for some creative enterprise, this could be your book. If you are a serious researcher, you will--apparently--be badly disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Book, Makes a Great Gift","review":"This book is really nice.

This is the only movie I've ever seen that didn't have an ending. It went to black and I thought the video went out on me but then the ending credits started and I thought, \\"what the f...?\\"They never fully explained the \\"Marlene\\" part of her name. It started to, but as with most of this movie, some things were just ideas that seemed to fall flat.The actors were great in their rolls, but it was a poor script that never managed to wrap itself back around to make any sense.I heard so many good reviews when this movie came out that I really expected something far better. However, when a movie doesn't resolve itself and has a screwy ending that leaves the viewer wondering what just happened, it's not good.If I was in a movie theatre, I'd demand my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"It fully deserves the 2012 Crap Award","review":"Most of the movie is a recollection of trauma of a girl. You wait for some explanation, development and conclusion, waiting for the ending. And like in some cheap paranormal or horror movies, the surprise is that ...there is no explanation, no development and above all, NO ENDING.A total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and disappointing","review":"I was really excited about seeing this film, after reading so many 5-star, rave reviews from both critics and the general public. The story and subject matter sounded very interesting, and I was expecting great things. Unfortunately, for me, there just wasn't enough substance to the story, and the constant flashbacks were distracting. Other than a couple of violent scenes, there was no excitement, no plot. It just seemed like a long and pointless story about a disturbed young woman and her well-meaning sister. In the end, we are left to wonder if she was ever able to get well and leave the demons of the past behind her. Very little story and no clear ending....that's about all I have to say. One more thing: Elizabeth Olsen did a fantastic job in her role, but I honestly did not find myself rooting for this character as much as I wanted to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me?","review":"Whomever wrote the summary for this movie should be barred from the writer's guild... Psychological thriller? If you want to be bored out of your mind for two hours. Stunning debut? Elizabeth Olson spends majority of the movie showing skin and facing the camera with a vacant stare. The only reason I watched the entire movie was to see if the action ever picked up (it did not).-Musical score is excessively overdone-Ending is absolutely terrible... Worst I have seen in a while.-Terrible script."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfying","review":"I love independent films and art house fare but this one is a major disappointment. Others have criticized Drive as being too slow, but it was spot on and very satisfying. It is also a good comparison in that it similarly has an abrupt, somewhat incomplete end. But Martha Marcy May Marlene seems so slow because there is no character development at all. If it wasn't for all the flashbacks the viewer would feel as if they were watching someone take a nap. None of the main characters has any arc or is changed by the circumstances. On top of that, the movie comes to an abrupt end just as you are expecting some kind of interesting plot development, ok any plot development. I'm fine with movies that leave you thinking, but this one leaves you thinking, \\"Where's the movie?\\" I agree with another reviewer that there is a film waiting to be made about leaving cults, but this isn't it. The actors are good, but not great given they have very little to work with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the beef","review":"She's an amazing actress...gives substance to the vacant Olsen name.

(Where has she been this entire time?) This movie is disturbing on many levels, but the acting and plot and directing and cinematography are arresting and irresistible. The movie is provocative in so many ways and it is impossible not to become completely absorbed. I do not know whether to view this movie as a cautionary tale or \\"thriller\\" as the Amazon description stated, but it is a psychological study and once seen, never forgotten. It is a violent movie with rape and bloodshed and if you do not like shock value sex scenes then this movie is not for you. This movie, along with the film Melancholia starring Kirsten Dunst who is back after a long reprieve, are two of the best movies of the year, period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Martha Marcy May Marlene","review":"Did not think I liked this movie at first, but days later I found myself still thinking about it. I revolves around a girls who escapes from a cult and must return to a normal family setting. She does not adjust well and wonders if she made a mistake returning to her family. She has a lot of adjustment problems. The director put the movie together in such a manner for the events to permeate the subconscious, good job."},{"rating":"1","title":"They are right!!!

Four stars for the quality of the 3 songs i above-mentioned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dear Old 1985","review":"The Minutemen, The Replacements, Huskers, and this disc on college radio--a band at their most mysterious. Unfocused and the product of a group in turmoil, it's also probably their most evocative and \\"folkie\\" album. Joe Boyd, who produced Fairport Convention and the first (I think) 10,000 Maniacs album spins the dials here. \\"Maps and Legends\\" and \\"Kohoutek\\" are nothing but dark exercises in mid-80s jangle, however uniquely REM: decadent dead ends.

I wasn't endeared to it at first, but after several listens, it grew on me, and probably my surprise favourite of the whole disc is \\"Kohoutek\\". The whole disc has a lyrical quality of walking through a foggy wood and seeing silver threads and sparkling diamonds hanging from the willows beyond the fog. Michael's \\"mumbling\\" also lends to this feeling I get from the album, and the instrumentation does not disappoint, especially Peter's playing. The band may not like this album, but this fan does.

The album packaging is beautiful. The lyrics are are extremely bizarre and each song is a story about some wierd character, from Auctioneers to Train conductors to just plain wierdos. There is no unifying person or ego that ties all the songs together, so it's not a Concept record in that sense. All the songs except \\"Feeling Gravity's pull\\" are like southern tales from Flannery O' Conners acid trip, if that author were to have one. Most everyone knows \\"Driver 8\\" off of here, and that song is but one of many golden nuggets. True the album is somber and quieter than the rockers that would end up on \\"Lifes Rich Pageant\\", and many people supposedly dislike the mood on this album.

An evocative and intense journey, Fables may be the most unique of all in this band's catalog.

LP I bought (yes, on vinyl, thank you very much.) I've always judged their sound by this record, and so in a lot of ways, I suppose I'm an old-school R.E.M. fan. This was the album I listened to the most when I was at UGA in Athens, certainly not \\"Automatic for the People,\\" their total \\"please, sir, may I have a Grammy?\\" sell-out album after making \\"Out of Time\\" (which itself is the second-most underrated album, after \\"Fables.\\")This album sums up to me what R.E.M. was about -- murkiness, indecipherable lyrics and... well, barbecue. This album smells of barbecue sauce to me, does that make sense?Philomath, they know the low-down, indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give 'em credit for experimenting","review":"R.E.M. was determined that they wouldn't fall into a rut. After two classic, but similar sounding albums, they incorporated horns and other studio flourishes into their third album--with mixed results. Not to say there aren't still some great tunes. \\"Can't Get There From Here,\\" \\"Green Grow the Rushes,\\" and \\"Wendell Gee,\\" for example, are superior songs. The album lacks only the superior consistency of the first two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic R.E.M.","review":"As a native Georgian and former resident of Athens, I grew up listening to R.E.M. To me there is something distinctly Southern about the band's first three albums. The instrumentation, mystical lyrics and weird characters are a perfect representation of the Deep South. Fables makes me think of rainy days, pine trees, kudzu fields and junkyards. I think it is a great album, and although REM's later records are all good, in my mind they gradually lost that unique feel and became more of a pop band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dogs love this bear!","review":"I am so glad that Amazon carries these bears and I hope they continue to do so.

The product was well packed with clear instructions and was very easy to use. I think its helpful that the engine was warm and that the container was placed inline or just below the level of the engine to improve the syphoning effect. A few pumps of the handle and the oil started to flow into the container and took only took me around 5 mins to extract nearly 4 litres of oil.Looks to be well made and durable for the job/s ahead. The end hose is around 5mm in diameter so should fit into most dipsticks although on the Yamaha jet-ski it went directly into the dipsticks oil tamk.Be careful and there's no need to make any mess except perhaps a few drops of oil.Real easy and saved me a sure $70+ for getting someone else to do the same job - so it's paid for itself already !!Hope this helps and don't be afraid to try an oil change yourself good people !Chris"},{"rating":"2","title":"It works like you'd think","review":"Took a little less than 10 minutes to drain 7 quarts of 5w-40 oil that was warm but not hot. The car hadn't been run for 45 minutes. The hose is very nice. It's like the hoses bike cables go through so it doesn't just bend up. When you hit the bottom it just stops, so you can just cram it in there and pump until you hear it sucking air. You don't have to pump constantly. Maybe 10 times than a one minute break.

Before pumping up the unit, I tried to bring the extraction tube out a little, and although I never felt it hit bottom, it became stuck somewhere in the oil pan. The oil was drained manualIy, and new oil extraction tube remains inside the oil pan. System failure. The extraction tube was cut off, dipstick reinserted, and after talking with the Kubota folks, I will end up taking the Kubota to the dealer to pull the engine, remove the oil pan and remove the oil extraction tube.

Lastly I used Evangelous' book \\"Mastering VB 6.0\\" on the side (Also from Sybex).A word of warning though, you can skip the questions in the book and do not even bother with the CD since the question/answers aren't accurate and the program on the CD that Sybex is promoting does not run after installation, it would start up and then freeze. I was disappointed as the two books that I purchased from Sybex were of good quality (Mastering 6.0 and this guide).

All in all I liked New Riders book better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not comprehensive enough","review":"This wasn't a bad book but I was disappointed because it seemed to ignore advanced topics. For example, the discussion on asynchronous objects basically tells you to create an early bound object with events. There is no discussion at all of the merits of call backs versus events, which is an important topic. Another example, the discussion on distribution manages to avoid licensing issues such as vbl files and lpk files.You definately need to supplement this book with other material.

This album is a reflection of his meticulous attention to detail. I'd rate it 5 except for one thing: Marvin's guitar tone seems to have lost something.

We love it! It is really easy to use on a wide range of tables. We mainly use it at our bar, but it fits well on all of the tables we've tried it on so far. It is a great thing to have for going to dinner with friends or family. It also comes in handy when having company with a small child as one can use this and the other can use the high chair. Folds up easily to travel.The tray is a bit tough to get on and off, but that is probably good so that the child can't pinch their fingers.I do have one complaint and that is regarding the strap. It is the kind that has one center piece and the two side straps snap into the center. It holds the child in securely, but doesn't always come unsnapped on one side very easily. I also have a Graco swing with the same snap & have had the same problem. This can be a bit frustrating, but is definitely not enough to keep me from highly recommending this item!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute Necessity!!!!!!!!","review":"This seat is so much better than all of those huge, expensive, hard to clean high chairs that everyone has to have as a first parent because it is better.

The acting is stiff, stagy. The writing is the same or worse.Waterloo Bridge, perhaps the best of the lot, feels like a stage play, which was what it was in a previous life. Mae Clarke is attractive as the lead, but the soldier who falls in love with her is wretched. We are asked to believe that he fell in love with a prostitute minutes after meeting her and proposed marriage, whereupon he introduced her to his upper class family. Bah!The other two movies, Red Headed Woman and Baby Face have even sillier plots and acting that is just as bad--or worse. The advertising of these movies would lead one to believe that they are racy, but the raciest scene in any of the three are the legs on the front of the case.

Pointless, which shows how highly they thought of the prospect of this move making any money or perhaps being any good. The move got old pretty quick, its also annoying.

Saucy, sometimes trashy, pre-code frankness. Baby Face features two different tracks and it's interesting to watch, and listen, to the differences.

The first 230 pages are just re-living that book, and it's only after that that the plot of this book is revealed, and an extremely weak one it is. Cornwell seems to be bored with Kay's world and un-able to create new stories for us. Hopefully, this book leads to enough change in Scarpetta's life to re-energize the author.Have you noticed that the Scarpetta series has always been a dark one? Every book in the dead of a cold gloomy winter? Lucy and Kay & Pete constantly fighting depression? Never having good luck, always having bad things happen to them? Every book has had this. Well, this one is the darkest, the gloomiest and the most depressing.

Do yourself a favor and skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Scarpetta book","review":"I have been a big fan of Cornwell and Scarpetta. This book was a big disappointment.

I have her personal autograph setting on my desk. So it is with regret that I say this is probably her worst work to date. For some reason she has decided to use an over abundence of words to tell a very predicatable story. Almost to the point you can guess what you are going to read on the pages before you turn them. She has added caracters that really have no relevance to the story or maybe I should say they would certainly not have been missed. Also leaving no question where the next book will start and who it will include. I also think she made a really big effort to include Lucy's sexual preference more often than necessary. I have absolutly no problem with homosexuality, but it seems as though she has made it one of the major themes of this story. Nevertheless, having said all this I would never miss one of her books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Last Precinct Lays an Egg","review":"Loyal fans of Cornwell will be sadly disappointed in this first person introspective that reeks of psycho-babble.

For the worse? Who's to say because this story is not over. I found the changes in realistic, and the emotional side/factor of the character gave her more depth than she's ever had before.Cornwell's books are always complex, this book seemed moreso.. perhaps because it backtracked so much into the previous book Black Notice. I've always told friends that Cornwells' books are stand alones.. where you don't need to read them in order. But if you're reading TLP, you really need to read Black Notice first, otherwise it won't make any sense to you.I give this one a 4 stars, and do wait for the story to continue in the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An in-depth physchology of Kay","review":"I am most impressed with the tone at the beginning of this book.

Later the book takes on her usual \\"cool\\". I am a bit disappointed with the quick fix like ending. I feel like she drew the book out so much at the beginning that she had to hurry up and wrap it up at the end. I feel it unlikely the \\"gorgeous\\" Jay is hooked up with a real sleazy-type.

This book might not compare favorably to the pace and action of the other Scarpetta books, but at least it's well written (compared, say, to Syndey Sheldon). So Patricia Cornwell tried something new -- so what. Scarpetta's adventures were beginning to run together in my mind anyway, and this book gives a clean transition to Scarpetta's new career in the big apple.

The last good book in the series was \\"From Potter's Field\\". Anything since then has been junk. Everytime I buy one of Cornwell's new books I hope that her writing and imagination will be as good as she was in her early days, but she has lost it. The Last Precinct is basically her feelings on lesbianism, not homosexuality, but lesbianism. She's really trying to push the issue with her readers, and that is not why I read her novels. I suppose Kay Scarpetta will come out of the closet soon. No thanks....There are plenty of other good authors out there to choose from, although I will miss the old Kay Scarpetta.

The story isn't compelling; the plot doesn't resolve itself with clarity; the characters are shallow and unlikable.To make matters worse, the author portrays every male as sex-crazed, inherently evil, and shallow.

What a juvenile style of writing. Every statment is wreathed with emotion: \\"raging, seething, trembling, anger, fury, resentment, incensed\\", etc. Reads like a 9th graders attempt at punching up an essay using a thesaurus. Yuck! I picked up \\"Black Notice\\" at the library and the premis sounded interesting but all that emotional emoting with a slow story threw me for a loop. What the heck, I thought I'd give Ms. Cornwell the benefit of the doubt and try one more time. I picked up a second book \\"The Last Precinct\\" and after about 20 pages gave up and started skimming. The overall plot between the 2 books was somewhat interesting but unfortunately it was obscured by the noisy, histrionic writing.

Cornwell writes with figurative language very creatively but I felt she often over used it. Certain subjects were very long and drawn out. There wasn't anything that kept me interested. I found it difficult to read this book because I just wasn't interested. I was expecting this to be a suspense book but she wrote more about the main character's self discovery than the actual murder situation. There was also nothing in the beginning of the book that caught my attention. I believe every good book should have a great attention getter and that is something Cornwell lacked. This is not a book I would reccommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Last Precinct","review":"I am a great Patricia Cromwell fan. After reading this book, I think Kay needs a new job and maybe \\"a life\\".

How about a new permanet relationship, preferably with a man - and a little fun in her life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Silence would be golden","review":"The generally lackluster writing and a dreadful reading make the abridged audio casette version of The Last Precinct scarely worth even one star. I could have dealt with the moping around and lack of interesting plot much better if I hadn't been unintentionally amused by the reading. The attempt to give Kay Scarpetta a mid-South accent is a dismal failure -- first, of course, because she is a native of Miami, not Richmond, and secondly because it is so poorly done as to be ludicrous. Couple that with the annoying decision give all the characters accents of some sort and the result is laughable at best. Cornwell's work should be read straight, no frills, just the way her stories used to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Transition","review":"Let us hope that this installment in the Scarpetta saga is a transition. The character could be an enduring one, but I feel that Cornwell has used up the ME scene and maybe the Richmond scene as well; and as another reviewer has said, has painted herself into a corner. Cornwell has created some compelling characters and in the past has used the police procedural to give them effective voice. Perhaps the impending move to New York will reinvigorate the author and the character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected much more","review":"Very disappointed in The Last Precinct. There was little action, way too much time spent in verbal communications and Kay's character seemed to take on a totally different personality than her earlier days. It was bad enough with this \\"werewolf\\" character in Black Notice but to rehash him in this latest book....I say lets move along to some new material."},{"rating":"1","title":"This series has evidently dried up","review":"Cornwell's books seem to get worse & worse. I am so tired of reading about how rich Scarpetta is. How much do we have to read about Scarpetta's costly homes & cars. If that's not bad enough now we have to hear how rich Lucy is too. Lucy has become even more nauseating - which is amazing.In this bk. it seems like more time is spent on Scarpetta whining & analyzing her thoughts than analyzing any evidence. Towards the end I just wanted everyone to die so I'd never have to read another Scarpetta novel.Sometimes authors have bad spells and pull out of it, however I think Cornwell will never emerge. What's sad is this isn't even close to the worst Scarpetta novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"The last Cornwell.","review":"My husband and I just finished THE LAST PRECINCT. We have now read all of the Kay Scarpetta books, and probably won't read any more of them. Patricia Cornwell has a real gift for orchestrating grisly plots, but nothing more. Her main characters all sound alike: stilted and sullen. Kay Scarpetta has built her life to order, and all she does is whine. In fact, no one ever smiles or laughs in these books. They ooze the determined, self-obsessed misery of folks who have never truly suffered a day in their lives. We held some hope for THE LAST PRECINCT because of the blurbs: \\"...takes readers deeper into Kay Scarpetta's heart and soul than ever before\\" . . . \\"'Where do you go when there is nowhere left?'\\" Could it be that Scarpetta would finally undergo the epiphany she so badly needs, and be forced to work her way through the chip on her shoulder? Nope. These characters age but they never grow. And we're just too depressed to care any more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Shifting of Gears","review":"I really enjoyed this book; some of the things the negative reviews don't like are just what I enjoyed. I think its obvious that Kay is going to begin a new chapter in her life, and this book wraps up a lot of loose ends in Richmond but still has an interesting mystery at its core. Its not surprising that she seems less spunky and spirited and so mentally drained in this novel because, well, she's just been raked over the coals emotionally too many times. How she has survived not only the horror she sees daily but the horror that has occured to her personally has been a mystery, and her \\"burning out\\" is a logical evolution of her life. Yet the door opens to a great new chapter in her life in New York (hopefully) and a few strings are left untied, so the auther can completely shift gears and open up many new story lines for Kay. I suspect, or maybe its just wishful thinking, that her new friend Jamie will become a \\"regular\\" and we could even see her own books in the future!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Like They Used To Be","review":"I certainly miss the Kay Scarpetta of Cornwell's early books. Those writings were full of crime, excitement and great forensics. The last few novels, however, are about sexuality, ego and materialism...what a sell out."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Last Precinct","review":"I believe that even bad Scarpetta is better than no Scarpetta and wouldn't think of missing a Cornwell book. However disappointing I found this book, what I found most disturbing was the author's usurping of Linda Fairstein, a real life person who also writes mysteries (though legal rather than medical) with herself as a model for the protagonist. The dedication to Fairstein seems like a forced nicety. I find it most disturbing that a character in a novel should be lifted both from a real living person and her alter ego in novels. Granted many Scarpetta characters are \\"based\\" on real people, but this seems too much. I await the next book with hopes of originality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patricia at its very best !","review":"A wonderful web of creative characters and situations. Not to mention the master strokes of forensic analysis amd thrilling sequences that makes impossible to live the book until the very end of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Precinct-the continuing Scarpetta saga!","review":"Last Precinct just adds to the \\"following\\" of the Scarpetta's adventures. The story picks up from the previous book,Black Notice, and enhances the adventure for the reader. And her niece, Lucy, adds just the right intrigue for the story's continuing plot from previous adventures."},{"rating":"1","title":"A trip to the Dentist","review":"Reading this book was as painful as a trip to the dentist. By the time I had managed to work my way through the first 100 pages, I had come to the conclusion that for all concerned it would of been less painful if Chandonne had killed Scarpetta and ended this series that has gone downhill so fast. That being said, I probably will buy the next book just hoping that Patricia Cornwell can find the magic she had in earlier books in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply a rehash","review":"The Last Precinct is simply a rehash of her previous book, Black Notice. The current plot centers on the serial killer in her last, but rather than continue with the plot it remains stagnant. Again a character is introduced within the last 60 pages or so of the book who could not be anticipated, thereby leaving the reader frustrated. The protagonist, Kay Scarpetta, is at her darkest and leaves the reader unsympathetic towards her even though the circumstances call for such."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING, BORING, BORING.","review":"Wish I would have read the reviews before I bought the hard back copy. I have been an avid Cornwell fan for years and anxiously awaited this release. Much to my dismay it was hard to pick up once I started it. Don't bother. Never went anywhere. Hard to follow but probably because it took forever to read being so longwinded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I just finished reading this book and I thought it was great. I do not agree with the bad reviews. It was not a repeat of the other book it went on from there. It was very hard to put down and had a great ending. I love this author and have everyone of her great books."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT ONE OF HER BEST, SADLY","review":"I am, for lack of a better adjective, a Cornwell \\"nut\\" having read all of her Kay Scarpetta books. The main flaw in her latest creation is....confusion. Let's be honest - we read her forensic treasures for the mystery, intrigue and \\"page-turning\\" suspense! However, if there are (IF THIS IS INDEED POSSIBLE) too many twists and turns we lose track of her ingenuity - forced to sort through endless facts thrown in the \\"mix\\" rather than relish her tempting forensic tale. Another problem was how \\"slow\\" the beginning seemed with much talk about Kay's instability and psychological health after her brush with (at the end of \\"Black Notice\\") Chandonne.There is also, unlike her other Scarpetta masterpieces, no finality to the story. She, quite obviously,leaves us \\"hanging\\" (HOPEFULLY only 'til her next Scarpetta outing)- with a sloppy summation that, I feel, short-changes the reader!!!LONG LIVE KAY SCARPETTA!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"no one can whine like patricia can","review":"Kinky Friedman has a song 'No one can pitch like Catfish can', I'm sure it would be easy to parody the words to fit this book. Patricia has reallly sunk low."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly \\"Psycho Babble\\"","review":"Boring and silly. Read a Rendell/Vine book and enjoy psychological suspense.

However, life is too short to spend on something this tediously \\"crafted\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"No-brainer","review":"Written by a functional illiterate for functional illiterates, this babe must have relatives at the publishing house; it's the only explanation for chopping down trees to print this tripe. Boring plot, boring characters and bad, bad writing. Cornwall,\\"you did a bad, bad thing.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Should Have Stayed in the Morgue","review":"This is the first book I've ever read by Cornwell and involving Kay. Maybe this was the wrong book to start on but I thought it was boring. Also, why the detail on how Kay is feeling all the time. She's mad, hurt, upset, hasn't been a good friend, etc. The part that I really didn't like is when Berger and Scarpetta are watching the video of the prime murder suspect being questioned. It goes on for pages! Totally unnecessary. If this is how the other books are, then I've read my first and last book by Cornwell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kay and characters have lost their spark","review":"While I read and enjoyed Patrica Cronwell's other books, this one left me cold. Kay has become so paranoid and self-involved that her life is no longer interesting, nor or the characters that surround her. I couldn't bring myself to finish it -- I found it so bad -- and was sorry I bought it hard cover. It's my last Patricia Cronwell purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to her usual standard","review":"The book starts off where Black Notice left off. Although I have read Black Notice, that was a few months ago, so I found the book confusing and lacking in necessary detail. And I think that writing the book in first person present was a huge mistake. While we see through the characters eyes, the view is bland and colorless. I did not feel that there was any connection with the character, but that she was trying a writing exercise in communicating what you physically see."},{"rating":"1","title":"I picked the wrong Cornwell book to start out with","review":"My mistake (or actually that of the person who recommended this book to me) is to have chosen THIS book to introduce myself to the writings of Patricia Cornwell.I found myself continually asking, \\"When is the actual STORY going to begin?\\" I never finished it, giving up as it went through one retrospective sweep after another.It's probably a great book if you're A) already a fan, and B) very familiar with the usual cast of characters in this series...I've not given up faith. I'll try another Cornwell book, but this time I'll put more thought into my choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, But Gory","review":"This book is very interesting, but seems to move at a slower pace than previous Kay Scarpetta novels. The many twists and turns do get a little difficult to follow, but make the book hard to put down. The crime scenes and autopsies are explained in too much graphic detail. Read this book if you like good mysteries and gory horror movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"O.K. But Too Much Whining and Moaning","review":"I have really enjoyed Cornwell's books, although recently she seems to have Scarpetta spend entirely too much time whining for herself and bemoaning Lucy. In \\"The Last Precinct\\" Scarpetta not only does this to excess - it was tiresome, especially for the first half - but also exhibiting personal weakness in contrast to the strength we have come to know. And Police Captain Marino is portrayed as an intolerant slob; one can wonder how he continues to hold his position. On a positive note, this book tied in nicely with the previous book, \\"Black Notice\\", which one should read first. All-in-all, I hope Cornwell gets off her downward spiral and soon will recover."},{"rating":"1","title":"difficult to stay the course","review":"While I am not an avid Dr. Scarpetta fan I have enjoyed some of her books. I found this to be a difficult read. I had read the prior story so was familiar with the protagonist. The time spent delving into Dr. Scarpetta's psyche was way too long. The energy spent in self analysis and paranoia was way too much for my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"After thoughts","review":"Most of this book consists of explanations that should have been in the previous book. First 100 pages: Zzzzzz. The balance not much better. Scarpetta needs to get some more interesting people in her life besides a ... niece and a cop friend (?) that even she detests most of the time. One star and four yawns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!!!!","review":"Follow my advice! This book is a waste of time and money. Not only do you have to trudge through 100 pages before anything remotely interesting happens, it never goes anywhere. You're constantly thinking, \\"OK Patricia, I got the fact that Kay Scarpetta is smart. I got that fact that she is in emotional distress. Can we move on?\\" I've read several of her mystery novels and have gotten the notion that Kay is the fictional ideal that women readers find interesting and admirable because she is extremely intelligent and beautiful. However, on the other side, enough with the \\"Men can't handle strong women\\" tangent in the story line! It was played to death in Black Notice and The Last Precinct. Do yourself a favor and skip this one. Unless you read the previous two novels you won't understand any of what she's griping about anyway. A very poor effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Last One","review":"I have listened to all the other Cornwell books. I am in cassette four of this one and doubt I will bother to finish. It is not entertaining; it does not hold my interest, my mind wanders. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Long","review":"I found this recent work by Patricia Cornwell tedious reading. I am found of her chief character Dr. Kay Scarpetta, but either Ms. Cornwell is losing her touch or I'm reading too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Last Stand","review":"I was very disappointed with the ending of this book. There was so much build up to the story of the Loup Garou and all the people that may or may not be involved with Chardonne. I cannot believe she wrapped up the story in about 20 pages after building up the story for over 300 pages. There was so much more she could have done with the ending that when I put the book down, I had a very bitter taste in my mouth and felt very let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"First Cornwell Novel Will Be My Last","review":"\\"The Last Precinct\\" was, unfortunately, the first Cornwell book I have read--and will most likely be the last. This rambling, plotless narrative contains a [plot] so inane and preposterous that it makes the wilder Kennedy assassination ...theories seem highly plausable. Maybe all this would have been clearer had I read the previous Scarpetta editions--but somehow I doubt it. Perhaps Cornwell has used up the Scarpetta character and should consider jettisoning her for a fresher approach and set of characters. This novel is, at best, plodding and dull, with Cornwell's substantial knowledge of forensic techniques taking priority over an engaging plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment","review":"I used to just love these books. But this one had no plot and it was very boring. I was unable to finish it and usually I can't put her books down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I have read all of Patrica Cornwell's books and until the last one, I loved all of them. The last one was questionable but this one is terrible. I wonder if she is using a ghost writer. I can't believe the same person who wrote her earlier books wrote this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY Disappointed - made me sleepy","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I found it boring, very long with little action, and not at all typical of Patricia Cornwell books I have read in the past. Her writing has become more psychological than action-based. So, if you like to read about thoughts and feelings and are not into much action and excitement this is a good book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Continuing decline","review":"This book appears to be yet the next installment of Cornwell's decline from the quality of her first novel. This disappointing book left far too many loose ends in its wrap-up, though the core story was not bad and was concluded appropriately. Each time I read another Cornwell novel, I swear it will be the last. This time I may take myself at my word."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Last Precint","review":"I don't know what has happened to Patricia and her wonderful writing ability. Something evidently is weighing very heavy on her mind these days, as it seems she has lost her touch. The book never seemed to take off and get you going as all her others in the past. Having been an avid Cornwell fan for years, I was very disappointed. Perhaps her private life is getting to be a too much for her to handle and to be able to write as she once did. This book was pure salami."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"I couldn't put down the previous book, and this one is the exact opposite. It obsesses over everything that happened in the previous book without moving the character forward. Really, you could never read this book and not lose your place in the series. It is just like missing a few days of your favorite soap opera -- no harm done. Save yourself the money and wait for the next one, hopefully one with a new plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass On It","review":"My days of breaking down bookstore doors to get the next Cornwell book are probably over. I have people standing in line to borrow my book and have told them \\"forget about it\\". This book was BORING from front to back. If I want whining and self-indulgence, I can turn on a talk show. The only consolation is Cornwell's next book has to be better than this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Last Precinct","review":"Wow. I am very disappointed with this latest Kay Scarpetts novel.The first thirty-some pages are consumed by Kay's indignation over becoming a victim; a deformed maniac has come after Kay, his pursuer. I had to laugh that Kay was so troubled by this latest victimization, given that she has been stalked and nearly killed by at least three different serial killers whom she likewise investigated in past novels. Why is she acting like this is a first?! She should be used to being nearly murdered by now. Par for the course.Oh, Patricia, work harder next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"STOP PLEASE!","review":"This book was a real burden to read. I have really enjoyed all of the other Scarpetta books even the Hornet's Nest etc, series. This was just, I don't know, boring. The plot, never found it really. Kept jumping around. One chapter it is all about her and Benton, then Lucy and her money, boss, whatever. Her job, did she quit, will she stay? Her therapy. She needs therapy. Should have dumped all this stuff in two or three chapters and maybe had Scarpetta moving to New York to start something new. Felt like this book satisfied some deadline to get a new book out and did not have any ideas!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book","review":"This book is something to be read in the toilet. Only slightly better than reading junk mail flyers from my local supermarket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and too detailed","review":"I found this book very difficult to read. It was hard to find the plot as it seemed to be bouncing all over. I was half way through it when it finally started to make some sense. Even though I have read many of her books in the past, I will probably not read another."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Sveglie\\" (wake up) Dr. Kay","review":"This book is the most tiresome of Cornwell's series. As always her explanations of medical procedures, evidence examination, autopsies, and etc. are incredibly educational. This is truly her art. However, the story line falters all the way up to the finale which does give this \\"read\\" a measure of redemptive value. This was her only book that had me wanting it to end out of sheer fatigue. I was tired of hearing about her depression, oppression, and ostracision. I wanted to reach out and smack the old doctor. Being Italiano myself I truly enjoy her \\"preoccoupation\\" with the culinary joys of cooking, eating, and the sanctity of a traditional Italian meal.This book leaves a lot of room for another sequel as I'm looking forward to seeing what happens to the \\"nasty boys\\" of this edition.Keep up the integrity Dr. Kay and start listening to Marino more often, will ya?! Don't be such a \\"Testa de Gizo\\" (head of cast iron)!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"1/4 good story, 3/4 hand wringing","review":"Patricia Cornwell has stolen 3 days from my life of the 4 it took to wade through this book. A LOT of wasted words and frustrating hand wringing from Kay. I will no doubt give Cornwell one more try when this story is (hopefully) wrapped up and tossed in the furnace in her next Kay Scarpetta book. It is a poor sequel to \\"Black Notice\\" and a major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"I've been a Patricia Cornwell fan for years, and wait IMPATIENTLY for each new book to come out. This one really let me down. The first third of the book was based on the story from the previous Kay Scarpetta book. It had been so long since I read it, though, that I had trouble following the storyline. Then, when it finally got to the new storyline the ending left me saying WHAT HAPPENED? I kept going back to see if there were pages missing from my copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful self analysis","review":"Kate Scarpetta is supposed to be one tough woman, not given to self analysis, self doubt or weakness of character. Too much time was spent dealing with the flaws in her character. I have read only one half of this book but I may finish it in the spring when my winter doldrums are over. Much too depressing to finish now with a new six inches of snow on the ground, grey skies, low temps, icy driveway and sick children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time for Patricia and Dr. Scarpetta to hang up lab coat.","review":"I started to read \\"The Last Precinct\\". For the life of me I could not get finish it, (hardly even started it). A friend told me to read \\"Black Notice\\" first, I might be able to read it then. I did. \\"Black Notice\\" was better. I was able to tolerate \\"Precinct\\". Dr. Scarpetta truly needs to see a shrink. Storyline \\"flatlined\\", making it as dead as her patients."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened to the series?","review":"I can't finish it. About halfway through it and can't go on. The other books in the series had intrigue, fear, mystery, page-turning suspense but somehow all that was forgotten and left out in this book. Patricia Cornwell...what happened??? Before I buy the next book in the series I'll be checking it's reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conspiracy theories","review":"I hated this book, but not for the reason I expected. Black Notice was so dark and depressing that I expected this one to be even more so. Actually, it was so sloppy and unbelievable that I just couldn't get involved in the plot.Aside from rather uninteresting introspection into Kay's personal history, this entire book consisted of rewriting the plot of two previous novels (Point of Origin, Black Notice) into an even more complicated conspiracy... and setting us up for future (and probably even more unbelievable) conspiracies in the next book.My proposed plot for the next one, at least as plausible as the conspiracies, is this: Kay awakes in a mental institution, receiving therapy for her delusions of grandeur, paranoia, and possibly multiple personality disorder. She really did kill Diane Bray, but was found not guilty by reason of insanity. The rest of the conspiracy was the product of her paranoia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, terrible, terrible","review":"I have loved the Kay Scarpetta series over the years - but with the last two novels I think it's time for Cornwell to head in a new direction. This series has evidently dried up. I was so disappointed in this book. If you have been a fan of the series everything in this book is old information - a certain amount of this is expected in a series - but this one was a waste of my money because \\"I've heard it all before\\". Kay, Lucy, and Marino have become very unpleasant people - there is no joy in their lives, even off the job. Doom and Gloom!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's Going On?","review":"I'm sure I'm not the only one who's tired of Kay Scarpetta's angst and anguish at the expense of a real story. The distracting and stilted present tense of the prose could have been tolerated. But re-hashing her last book and the book before that? Maybe Ms. Cornwell has gotten bored. I know I have. The end of the book is an obvious harbinger of the next - because what little new plot there was didn't resolve. What a disappointing trend from a heretofore favorite author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't bring myself to finish it.","review":"Having read all of Cornwell's Kate novels, I started this one with the same enthusiasm, only to be disappointed. I just can't \\"get into it\\". So far it has lacked the appeal of her previous books. Who knows, maybe I'll get it another try, someday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recycling","review":"I read some of Cornwell's earlier books but grew tired of them for some reason. I decided to try this one and got to page 85, at which point she was still recapitulating what happened, I surmise, in the previous book. But readers read to find out what happens in the current book, not in some earlier one. I stopped reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed....","review":"It took me almost 25 days to finish this book. Once, I have to stop, because the first few chapters were just self-pity, self-angry, and a bitter taste of life... I just have to read another book just to get away from those chapters. When I decided to finish it... oh well, I have to, I've paid for it... I don't think I would buy her next novel, I might just borrow it from the library to save money. Very disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed Feelings","review":"I had given up buying my own copies of Cornwall's books after years of waiting with bated breath for her books to come out. I now can wait for them from the library. The last couple of books, especially \\"Black Notice\\", left me flat and seriously considering not to read any more of this author's works. However, being 'faithful' to my authors, I did read \\"The Last Precinct\\" and enjoyed the fact that everything that seemed to be left 'dangling' in Black Notice seemed to be clarified. I read Last Precinct in a few days; however, I still feel that she is portraying her characters as being very shallow. Just when I think I am going to get \\"into\\" Marino or Lucy, Cornwall quickly pushes them out of my grasp. I'd like to see her go 'beyond' calling Marino on his cell, beyond 'hoping' Lucy will be there for her....get some \\"umph\\" in her writing. Frankly, it doesn't bother me that I won't see another Cornwall book for the next 2 years. Pity!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Cornwell disappointment","review":"I am one of the legion of past Cornwell fans who are simply fed up with Scarpetta's tiresome psychological problems. I began reading Cornwell's books because of thrilling plots and fascinating insights into forensic science. Unfortunately, Cornwell now spends all of her time on the tortured relationships between Scarpetta, Lucy, the deceased Benton, and Marino. If this is \\"character development,\\" I'll pass. And please, enough with the Virginia Chief Medical Examiner being under constant criminal suspicion! Ridiculous! Unfortunately, Cornwell must not read the hundreds of negative reviews that all sound the same (or she's too rich to care), because she shows no signs of returning to the really superb writing that marked her first books. Stay away if you liked the early Scarpetta."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same song, umpteenth verse","review":"Patricia Cornwell used to write really great books, but now she just keeps writing the same one over and over and over... Let's see, we have the betrayal by a co-worker (check), the latest trauma for Lucy (check), the deep angst and depression (check), the persecution by mysterious groups (check), the gruesome killer with a weird agenda (check), and so on. Honestly, the paranoia and self-pity are really getting boring. I keep reading the new ones hoping she'll go back to her old form, but I'm just about to give up. It's just too tedious!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Last Precinct","review":"Definitely not one of Cornwell's best. Too much concentration on Scarpetta's state of mind. I prefer the \\"edge of the seat\\" drama. This book didn't deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooooring!","review":"Most of the major writers of crime fiction get away with sloppy plotlines and mailed-in characterizations just as long as their base readership gets to see the same characters as in the book before. The Last Precinct is no exception. I was so bored that I simply could not slog through the whole thing. Too bad; if this one has even been remotely readable I might have moved on to Cornwell's other work. If you want to read a thriller with a little heart, pick up any of Michael Connelly's work, or one of relative newcomer Jeff Lindsay's Dexter novels. You owe it to yourself not to support lazy writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much!","review":"A werewolf tries to kill her and she has to hide out with a friend who has a deep, dark secret and her niece is kicked out of the ATF and she's still in mourning for a murdered lover/colleague and she's investigating the death of a policewoman who was fiendishly plotting against her, but then she's accused of her murder. And there's a crooked prosecutor and the estranged son of her cop buddy who's lurking in New York with the Mob and the governor's wife is upset because some hate crimes might make the Jamestown colony look bad and then there's what happened to Mr. Peanut!This is the first book by this author I've read. It doesn't stand alone - there are so many characters thrown at you and bizarre plot twists that a first-time reader is overwhelmed. A novel this long should have a more definite resolution. You're given lots of details about characters, but not really introduced to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Cornwell","review":"As a mystery author with my first book in its initial release, I have been an admirer of Patricia Cornwell for years. Kay Scarpetta is a marvelous creation, and in this novel, Kay struggles to resolve numerous unresolved issues. Her therapist puts it that way, as will the typical reader. THE LAST PRECINCT grows directly out of the events of Ms. Cornwell's most recent novels. This book has everything the Cornwell fan has grown to expect from Kay and the series. All the usual characters are on hand, even a certain deceased man, in a certain way. The plot twists and turns, and THE LAST PRECINCT is a winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"'POOR ME'","review":"I'm only half way thru this one,and I've never heard so much\\"Bellyaching\\"! Poor Kay, she's getting old! Most of the bookso far, is full of discriptive adjectives on how terrible she feels about everything and every one.P.C. has always been one of my favorites, but I\\"m going to haveto nickname her \\"The Queen of Superlatives\\". The best part of this book is the picture on the back of thebook jacket."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated This Book","review":"I have all of Patricia Cornwell's [Kay Scarpetta Series] and I am sorry to say that her last book Black Sunday was terrible, so I should not have bothered to buy The Last Precinct. It was a total waste of my money. I don't know why Cornwell is even bothering to write anymore books. She seems to have lost her touch or doesn't really care to write any more. I guess she has made enough money. I am sick of her going on and on about Lucy and Kays love affairs. Cornwell is really making Kay one dumb lady. I guess I will no longer be buying Cornwells books if she keeps writing the junk she has in her last 4 books."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm done with this series","review":"Although I have been a loyal reader of the series, The Last Precinct will be the last I read. I think I would still be a reader if Kay had saved Mr. Peanut! One moment that she thought of something outside herself and acted on it would have been enough to keep me as a reader. Instead, she is totally self-involved, whiny and the books are dark and depressing with no letup. People are not that one-dimensional and therefore the characters are becoming boring. And for heavens sake let up on Marino!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit complaining --- already!","review":"I have been an avid fan of Cornwell and enjoyed her books. Think I have missed only one which I had planned to find but now I am not so certain I will bother. Poor me, poor me, poor me is what I get from almost every page. As Barbara Bush would say \\"Get over it\\"!And as Harry Truman said....\\"if you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen\\". I won't quote any other famous people but do think Patricia needs to take a vacation from all that is bothering HER as it is obvious it shows in her writing. I am only half way thru the book but that is only half the story. That is as far as I am going with this one!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Whining in Richmond","review":"Okay. I read books while riding an exercise bike in the morning before I go to work. If it is a good read, I'll pick up where I left off reading when I return home. In the past, Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta series has often been that type of book. But . . . not this time. The padding (and lack of a courageous editor) is obvious. Kay's repeated musings about \\"poor me\\" and inward entreaties became tiresome within the first 50 pages, yet the pattern continued to repeat throughout. The whining about personal relationships got so bad that I thought I was reading Elizabeth George! Also, every short trip, whether by car, SUV or helicopter in and about the Richmond vicinity could not pass without detailed, trivial, irrelevant descriptions of cars, scenery, etc., little of which added to the story. PLEASE, Ms Cornwell, quit cannibalizing your old books for plot lines and characters, and concentrate on your story (if you have one)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ditto","review":"I can only but agree with previous reviewers - I have quit reading this book and will think twice before picking up another Cornwell novel. Over the last few years, her characters have become people I do not wish to know. Their lives are too disturbing, too dark, too seedy. After reading \\"The Last Precinct\\" for a couple hours, I was in a depressed state and felt the need to take a shower. Her books are no longer entertaining and fun to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Scarpetta!","review":"I was totally shocked when I saw the average review for this book (only three stars)! Jeez, I loved it! I can never get enough of Kay, Pete, or Lucy (even though she is still a childish brat). Ms. Cornwell has done a wonderful job of breathing life into these characters, and devising plot lines that keep me interested and on the edge of my seat. I do recommend that if you haven't read Black Notice yet, go read it now before you start The Last Precinct. TLP starts right up where Black Notice ends. As a matter of fact, if you haven't read any of the previous Kay Scarpetta books, I really, really, really advise you to buy them from Amazon.com (or check them out at your local library) and make some time for some serious reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop me before I buy again!","review":"There was one previous Scarpetta book (I have forgotten the title) that made me annoyed enough to actually write a review - I think this one is worse. What are these people (the author, the publisher, the reviewers) thinking? That we're stupid? I'm going to vote with my feet here and NEVER, NEVER buy another book by this woman who obviously cares nothing about her fans. If she did she wouldn't be commiting this fraud. At least there is ONE improvement - Marino stopped saying \\"crib\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is my last book from Cornwell","review":"I enjoyed the first books in her series and recommend them to others. This last effort shows that Patricia Cornwell has simply run out of gas and stories. I forced myself to complete the book. The author has lost her way and is now writing for the advance money. The plots are getting sillier and sillier."},{"rating":"1","title":"IF I COULD GIVE THIS A -5, I WOULD!","review":"I have been an avid reader for a minimum of 53 years. I found this book to be SO BORING, that I kept falling asleep whilst trying to read it. No surprises. No climaxes. I kept at it until the end, and was THRILLED TO KNOW I HAD FINISHED. Enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"The beginning of the end?","review":"I waited for a while to say this. Every author can have a bad book or two. The transitional focus change from what might be seen as a bit more action to a reflective deeper character frankly flopped. I don't care not because the character isn't worth it but because the author doesn't carry it off.After reading the following books I wondered if this wasn't the first attempt to save something the author had grown bored with and serial characters can become boring. Other authors have started this transition leading to Best Sellers with only a few grunts of \\"no\\" from a few die hard fans of the other version of the writing. Branching off into other works is also a trait. The following books were way below standard for her. So far below I don't bother to even look to see if anything new is coming out nor do I buy them used when they do.Read this? Yes. It might be Kay's real farewell to us all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get well Scarpetta or get lost.","review":"Scarpetta has indeed finally gone over the edge. She has gotten so parinoid she needs to go into the psychiatric ward of a good hospital for treatment. Her resignation from the Virginia State Government is justified. It is too bad Cornwell left it unresolved at the end of the book. Of all the novels that are going to make up the Scarpetta lexicon this one will probably rank as one of the all time worst. I only hope Cornwell acts quickly to re-invent Scarpetta or she may soon have to stop writing Scarpetta novels, if for no other reason than Scarpetta fans becoming pernamently disallusioned with the character. Get well Kay, get a life, learn how to fight back, or simply stop waisting our valuable time and simply go away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring at Best","review":"Unlike the other books in the series, I found this book to be less interesting and boring at best. Nomally I fly through her books, this one took me almost a month to read through!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It just didn't grab hold","review":"I found this book so tedious and such a departure from Ms. Cornwell's previous work that I was quite disappointed. The 1st person, present tense writing style has always driven me batty; it always feels like the story is being told AT you rather than told TO you. Some authors may believe that it's a more \\"personal\\" style of writing, but I think it's a poor attempt on the authors part to give the reader a deeper sense of being part of the characters life, when in reality it feels more like a cheap trick or a cop out.I would really like to see Ms. Cornwell branch out with these characters. How about a book where Kay is a supporting character but Lucy is the main character? That could be interesting, as long as she ditches the present tense writing style, and lets the characters get back to basics, with her normally strong, willful and energized women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointed","review":"I could not finish this book. It just rambled on and on, with no story to speak of, and certainly nothing to keep this reader's attention. Terribly disappointing. I had to check the cover to make sure it was really written by Cornwell. I tried to keep reading, thinking it would get better... or get SOMETHING... but it never did. Totally boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVID FAN DISAPOINTED","review":"I was sooooooooooo anxiously awaiting the latest Cornwell novel, but unfortunately disapointed by the storyline ! It was confusing, flat and not a smooth storyline. I felt it lacked the mistery and surprising turn of events that Cornwell is so well known for. Hopefully I will make amends on the following novel, or else it would confirm that she has gotten to do this for fame and fortune and no longer out of passion like her novels prior to this one. Should you be a first time reader of Cornwell - start with the Body Farm or the Hornet's Nest to really see her shine !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cornwell getting sloppy","review":"I generally like patricia cornwell's writting, but this story was just plain bad. In this book, she proves she can get gross, a way to avoid a skillful or clever story. I'll really hesitate before reading anything new she comes out with."},{"rating":"1","title":"STINKS","review":"I am disappointed. I loved Patricia Cornwell's earlier books and was a big fan. I thought it was just getting off to a slow start and thought I should give The Last Precinct the benefit of the doubt. Well, by the time I made it through chapters 6 and 7, I just couldn't stomach any more of her \\"Therapy\\". Maybe it got better after that but I felt I couldn't waste more time to find out. To sum it up, I am glad I got it at the library instead of wasting my money. What happened, Patricia Cornwell?!?!?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"I loved it. Couldn't put it down. It really went into Kay Scarpetta's history. It was nice to finally have insight to how she ticks. I cannot wait for Patricia's next book! Wonder if (when) \\"Jay\\" and \\"Bev\\" will return in the future??? GREAT JOB, Patricia! Was also great to hear you on the radio (WXKS - Kiss108) during your recent visit to Boston."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par","review":"I always grab Cornwell's books as soon as they are out....should not have invested in this one..just didn't hold my attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Serial Killer WIth Bad Breath","review":"That is all I remember after finishing up 449 pages of neverending boredom. The plot does not seem to fit well. There are gaps everywhere. I am amazed I did not skip through the pages while Scarpetta whined about what seemed to be series of bad relationships. The only reason I am giving two stars instead of one is because I think Patricia Cornwell has her way with words. I am hoping for a better one - soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better that the last ones...but still boring.","review":"I have read all of Patricia Cornwell books, and since the last ones, i.e. Cause of Death, Point of Origin and Black Notice, were such a great disappointment (unlike the first ones), I think that, in a way, I enjoyed The Last Precinct. At least it did not make yawn in a wish to finish it, like her last ones. I agree with most of the readers, who say that Cornwell can and has done it much better. I do not know if I will buy the next Scarpetta novel, I think I have become tired of buying her next books in the hope that they will be better than the last ones. One last thing: why is Cornwell turning Marino into such an annoying character?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the Last, please!","review":"Obviously, there must be something wrong with me because I really enjoyed The Last Precinct! It was one of those books that I had a hard time putting down. In fact, I was hoping, the next installment might be out already! I was looking forward to reading about Kay in New York, being \\"second chair\\" to Jaimie Berger. I also enjoyed the fact that this book was a continuation of Black Notice. I certainly hope this is not the last book in the Scarpetta series. I think she needs a break from the morgue, though, and New York is as good a place as any to take a sabbatical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same story/book--different title","review":"I really enjoy reading a series of books from the same author--in fact I don't even mind the same 'type' of writing or story lines that murder mystery series novels most likely contain. BUT I do mind buying a book and feeling like I am reading the previous book in the series. The Last Precinct's story line is such a continuation of the previous book's werewolf theme and \\"Is Benton really dead??\\" storyline that I was bored and unchallenged while reading the majority of the book. The final chapters pick up a bit--and that is only b/c FINALLY some new material/characters come into the storyline.Patricia Cornwell can write much more interesting material--this must have been a very hard sell because as my title suggests--same story/book-different title!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Last Precinct","review":"Patricia Cornwell is an excellent writer, but each book in her series presents situations that are more macabre than the last. If you like mysteries that are reminiscent of film noir, then this book is for you. As far as I'm concerned -- The Last Precinct is my last book by this talented, imaginative author."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is it.","review":"I swore after I read Black Notice that I wouldn't buy another one of these. This will definitely be my last. Take the same story line as her last few books and add more sex and violence and there you have it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last Princinct is Not Her Last Book","review":"Unfortunately, the 468 pages of this book were put there to give some space between Point of Origin and Patricia Cornwell's next book. This effort was boring and confusing. You may keep on reading in hopes that she will make sense of things, but you'll be disappointed. I re-read this book to learn what I had misssed, but it seemed even more jumbled the second time.Do yourself a favor and read all her early Scarpetta books, or at least Post Mortem and Cruel and Unusual, but stop before you crack the cover of Point of Origin. Avoicd this current book, The Last Princinct. There are so many delightful mystery-thrillers out there.[....]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Come on folks, give it a chance","review":"I have to admit, I have been disappointed in the past two Scarpetta novels and actually held off buying Last Precinct until recently. However, after reading it (very quickly I might add), I see much of the old Patricia Cornwell resurfacing.I enjoyed the movement and the plot of the book as well as the twists that never cease to amaze me.I think that in an effort to please the reader, the author \\"pumped out\\" a few novels that we didn't find pleasing. In response to us she has produced this one and I feel that we are seeing the resurrection of a good heroine.So, I'm not giving up - I'm anxiously awaiting the next novel in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Long, Confusing & Depressing","review":"I'm a huge fan of Kay Scarpetta but this book was just too much. It was constantly referring to Black Notice, the book prior to this, so much so that I felt as if I should have read the two back to back.It starts out slow and is (of course!) resolved in the final few pages. I think that Kay is getting to be one dimensional -- surely she has some sort of a life away from work? Everything revolves around her and everything is tied together. I know, I know, it's a novel about *HER* but it gets to be too much.If you've read all the others in this series, of course you'll have to read this one. But, I don't think it's up to standard tho I was left with a feeling of hope for future Kay Scarpetta novels!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreal","review":"For the first time in all of the books I've read of Ms. Cornwell this is the first that I could not only \\"put down\\", but halfway through I didn't care how it ended. Only that this tedious work of unbelievable fiction FINALLY did end. It was wordy and frequently redundant. An author of this caliber should concentrate on content and not the obviously payment per word."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another disappointment","review":"Patricia Cornwell's early books are loaded with gripping plots and unforgettable characters. Not so in her last 2 books with Last Precinct even less satisfying than Black Notice. Dr. Kay Scarpetta has become a whiny character with no dimension other than her job. I figured out the plot of this book at the end of Black Notice. She should have combined the two books into one. Borrow it don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long winded and disappointing","review":"Since this is my first Patricia Cornwell, I feel that I need to go back and read books 1-3 before I make a full assesment of her writing. I found this book sometimes overly detailed and longwinded, almost like she was trying to fill a certain page number. I found some of the subplots of the characters unbelieveable if not underdeveloped. Although I did like Marino, who reminds me of NYPD Blue's Andy Sipowitz, his color came across in this work. I finished this book partially because i was on a long plane ride and partially because I thought something was going to happen. I would definately give this author another chance but I cannot recommend this book, especially if you are new to the author, you might not want to start with one of the first novels of Kay Scarpetta."},{"rating":"1","title":"skipped to the end","review":"UGH... I am so disappointed in the last few PC novels and this one has been so terrible that I skipped to the end after the first 100 pages or so just to satisfy my curiosity about whodunnit (which is completely implausible and stupid, btw) without having to put up with the tedious story and Kay's insufferable attitude and paranoia. Oh, how I wish to have the wonderful read of All that Remains again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING, BORING, BORING.","review":"Wish I would have read the reviews before I bought the hard back copy. I have been an avid Cornwell fan for years and anxiously awaited this release. Much to my dismay it was hard to pick up once I started it. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"11 is an unlucky number for the reader","review":"I was a big fan of Patricia Cornwell, until the last precinct. I know you are going to have to read it to continue the werewolf story line but read it fast so the pain doesn't linger.I think some authors lose it with their character development and this one is lost to fantasy. The plot line leads us closer to the middle earth than it does to Richmond and the ending appears to be forced like she hit the number of required pages.So I know you will have to read it....just be quick and get the pain over with and go on to another author."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOTHING NEW UNDER THE SUN","review":"I read the last 3 novels of P.C. in a heartbeat, but it took me more than 6 months to finish this one. The first 100 pages are so uninteresting that I had to force myself through them.If we discount the unnecessary intense brutality, cruelty and incredible violence, there is very little plot or new information in The Last Precinct.That said, one cannot discount Patricia Cornwell's mastering of the English language, but it is not enough to make an interesting novel. It really seems that she had to produce a new book to satisfy her Publisher, despite she was short of inspiration at the time.The pace is very slow, and I was wondering, with only a few chapters till it's end, how there will be time enough to give the reader a satisfying \\"ending\\". To my opinion, it didn't, and I have found the development very hasty and the abundance of coincidences lacking credibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beating a dead horse (or a live werewolf?)","review":"I agree with some of my fellow reviewers that in \\"The Last Precinct,\\" Patricia Cornwell drags in way too much of her previous novel, \\"Black Notice\\"--the first hundred pages literally paraphrase what went on in BN. Unlike others, I've never found Dr. Kay Scarpetta to be a particularly sympathetic or even likable character. Cornwell tends to paint Scarpetta as the all-knowing and all-seeing wisewoman, with an insufferable attitude towards those she finds \\"inferior\\", most notably Pete Marino. The situation with her niece Lucy (oh, did you know that she's a lesbian? It's hard to ignore when Cornwell mentions that fact seemingly every time Lucy's name comes up) is getting to be a joke as well. Cornwell, as usual, is technically flawless in the forensic details, but inside Scarpetta's chilly, self-absorbed psyche is not a place where'd I'd want to hang out for very long."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH THE WAIT","review":"Having thouroughly enjoyed Cornwell's previous works (at least the Scarpetta series), I was thrilled to get my hands on \\"Precinct\\". It really wasn't worth the wait. I kept waiting for some pace to develop, and for Scarpetta to emerge from the self-pity malaise. It never happened. The conspiracy was far fetched and ill developed, and the insightful forensics Cornwell's fans have come to expect were nearly non-existant. I turned the last page feeling like Grisham fans have after his last four or five...suckered"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Going Through the Motions . . .","review":"I've been an avid fan of the Scarpetta series. This sucked. Give it up, okay? This was by far the biggest stinker of the series. More like reading a long deposition transcript than a novel. Blatantly setting us up for the sequel so she can grind them out again. Enough about brilliant, beautiful and now rich Lucy, okay? Hangdog Marino mooning around like a lovestruck puppy. Who cares any more?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Transitional Work Best Left Unread...","review":"THE LAST PRECINCT is Patricia Cornwell's most disappointing outing to date. Badly shaken by her near fatal run-in with the Loup-Garou, the freakish werewolf-like Parisian serial killer from BLACK NOTICE, Dr. Kay Scarpetta's strong-will is beginning to show signs of stress fracture. Kay doubts her abilities, her job, her judgement, and wonders if she's still cut out or even wants to remain Virginia's chief medical examiner. The doubts seems to reside more in the author's mind than in the main character. Cornwell seems to be cracking under the pressure of this wildly popular (read lucrative) franchise. If you're new to the series, do yourself a favor, skip this one in favor of an earlier volume or wait for what develops in the series after this one. Clearly a transitional work that doesn't really begin to kick into gear until after the first third of the book and then only in fits and starts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great follow up ...","review":"I'm a big, big, fan of the Scarpetta series, but I was starting to find Kay a bit tiresome in her self-absorption and her smothering concern of Lucy. This book finds her still somewhat self-absorbed, but I found the plot to be very satisfying--so much so that I did a 7-hour stint last Sunday afternoon because I had to know how it ended.It left Kay at an interesting crossroad, personally and professionally. What will Ms. Cornwell do next with her overachiever heroine?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kay Scarpetta, where are you?","review":"From the first chapter on, I felt cheated. I kept saying (out loud to whoever would listen), \\"This is not the Kay Scarpetta we know and love!\\" The book comes off as a very bad sequel, and the ending is an obvious lead-in to the next sequel. I didn't like the book at all, and really only finished it in the hopes that sooner or later it'd get better.

Last Precinct never got better from start to finish. There is little plot or character development. Disappointment in Ms. Cornwell's efforts is only surpassed by a feeling of disappointment that this author's work has so deteriorated that she does not feel the need to give her readers a fair return for their dollar. Shame on you Ms. Cornwell. This will be the last book of yours that I purchase. You are cerainly resting on your laurels and they have run out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragged through to the end","review":"I think authors get to the point that cranking out the next book is more important than quality. This book spends too much time covering event history from her previous book, Black Notice, and too many pages on points that should be covered quicker. Did she have to have so much filler? You just wanted to tell her, \\"get on with the story\\". And at the end, too many issues were just left hanging. You want to say .... Wait a minute, what happened to whats his name and whats her name? This book is certainly not the disaster of her Hornet's Nest or Southern Cross. However, Ms. Cornwell has done better in other writing efforts. I can only hope she demonstrates more creativity in her next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Why did she bother writing Black Notice? It's practically re-written in this book. I want the old Kay back. The independent, self-assured, intelligent medical examiner. Not this whiny, irrational being. Sorry PC but I agree with other readers, you're too caught up on your popularity, trying to fulfill book writing obligations and losing creativity and you're too hook on your own AC/DC persona."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Precinct","review":"I was excited to listen to another book by Patricia Cornwell. The book wasn't as complex and adventurous as previous works and this made it dissapointing for listeners. The voices presented by the reader did not possess the range of other readers that listeners have come to expect. Instead of being drawn into the book, often one looks ahead and hopes the next tape will somehow be better.

Warren led the Supreme Court from 1953-1969, perhaps the most turbulent period in American history outside the Civil War. His rulings have shaped modern jurisprudence and, despite their controversial nature when they were issued, have repeatedly shown their wisdom since.

I thought with all the attachments it would be awesome, boy was I wrong.1. It's really heavy 2. It looses battery power after charging for days in less than 1 minute. 3. It's really hard to get on and off the base. 4. The attachements are nearly impossible to get off but you have to put them on that well to not fall off during use.Big hassle, not worth the money or the energy."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"I bought this hand vac from Bed and bath because of it's portability and suction power. The first time I used it, it was great, but after a month for so it's now pretty much useless.reason why I think it's a rip off:- it takes a long time to recharge.- it's bulky and hard to remove from the base, it gets stuck a lot.- the dirt actually FALLS BACK OUT! The little rubber flap that keeps the dirt in is now deformed (in just 3 months!)so the dirt just falls back out.- the motor is not very powerful. There are times when I remove the attachement and find dirt still stuck in the attachment.- Very messy to dump the dirt out. It's just a filter and I have to use my hands to prie the dirt off the filter. And the dust just usually get every where when I try to dump it out in the trash can.I am really bummed out by this hand vac. It looked great and seemed great, but I wish I spent that money on a real vac."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product OK/ServiceNOK","review":"After the battery gave out, I ordered another.

It wizzled out after 30 sec. of work. The charge light broke right away, so I could never tell whether it was charging. I kept it around for 6 month only bacause I paid good money for it, and finally threw it away hardly used. I am very disappointed in Amazon's good editorial review which prompted me to buy it. They are supposed to be objective."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Excellent Product That I Can't Use","review":"Just to agree with the other 95% of the reviewers, the battery life is horrible. Which in my opinion is the most important aspect of anything cordless. If you only need to pick up crumbs for the next 3 months, this is the product for you. It does an excellent job. However, after 3 months, my children are still making crumbs, and I am forced to purchase another cordless vacuum. Therefore, I just wasted 60 bucks. I have actually resorted to using a broom and dustpan. But as we all know, that's for June Clever's generation. Hence, I will have to spend another 50 bucks on a Dirt Devil or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good product","review":"I purchased this product because I was impressed by the in-store demonstration. When I started to use it at home I was very disappointed. First, it did not fit easily into its charging stand. Many times I thought it was charging when, in fact, it was not. It does not pick up small dust and other debris well. Stuff you vacuum up falls out again when you turn it off. Cleaning the collector bin is hard since case does not fit togeather well. Over all I say, by something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to give cordless tools a bad name","review":"We have had this Shark (perhaps appropriately named for feeding on fleeced customers) for a year or less. During this time the machine has been used for light household duties which have not demanded a lot from it. Initially it held its charge for a reasonable amount of time but quickly this changed to the point where it does not last a full two minutes, even though it is kept \\"fully charged\\" in its stand. We bought this to replace an old Black and Decker \\"dustbuster\\" (one of the original ones produced) which still worked when we replaced it.

Fist they just throw all the parts in a plastic bag and then dump it in some peanuts. This one looked as if it had been used. The battery was giving out after a couple of seconds. I have a shark steam cleaner that is great but this looks like it was made by a group of 3 year olds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I'd read these reviews","review":"This is an expensive item (we paid $79 for the wet/dry version) for it not to even last for two years - hardly used. Our vac also only operates for about 10 secs now before dying. Why get a rechargable if you can't keep it on the charger (especially when the manual says to do so at all times)? The battery is horrible. This company should not be supported."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk... BUYER BEWARE","review":"Like most of the other reviewers, the battery in my Shark handheld vacuum completely died within roughly 2 months of use. In the brief time it was actually working, the suction was so low that the included extensions would actually detach and fall out of the vacuum as I was using it! Fortunately, the retailer I purchased it from was kind enough to take it back for store credit. I've since replaced my Shark handheld with a dust pan and brush -- saving me space, money, and unnecessary aggravation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery is the Problem","review":"Same as the other reviews. I got this thing mainly to clean out the cars. After six months it won't run long enough to be of any use what-so-ever.

It has been fully charged and used to pick up a teaspoon of sugar, which it didn't do, and I have tried to use it to pick up sand off my area carpets. It doesn't. This has been a waste of my money!

After using it for a few months, I noticed that it didn't seem to have as much power as when it was new. Now it barely works at all. No matter how long it's charged, it only runs for a few seconds and then quits. Definitely would not purchase again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, Bad, and Ugly","review":"When I first bought my Shark, it was wonderful. Powerful, convenient, balky assembly, but acceptable. The problem is that the battery becomes loses its ability to take a charge after only a few months. Now after literally only a few minutes, the vacuum needs recharging.Not cheap to begin with, the purchaser is now faced with what will be an undoubtedly expensive battery replacement. Frustration is compounded by the fact that Shark keeps the location and contact numbers for its service centers under tight security. Virtually imporssible to locate.The instructions do warn that replacing the battery is difficult. I suppose that is supposed to be fair warning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money!","review":"Terrible battery problems. Terrible sucking power.

I have a bad back and wanted something light.First, this machine is so cumbersome. Second, it gets very hot very quickly. According to the company you have to run it no more than 20 min (forget vacuuming the van from head to toe!).The most important??? The darn thing burned out the motor after the third time!!! I used it no more than 10 minutes each time. It burned out on the third time at 5 minutes. It's supposed to have a safety feature that if it gets too hot it will turn off automatically. You're supposed to wait for it to cool down completely. It never came back on!Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work beyond 60 days","review":"The Cordless Shark hand vac works great -- for about 60 days. Then the battery won't charge, or won't charge to let you use it more than 15 minutes at a go.Also, it's impossible to get replacement filters for this thing. Target doesn't carry them, and won't special order them for you.

When I first bought the Euro-Pro, the battery life was about 20 minutes. Now I am lucky to get 1-2 minutes of use, and based on other reviews, that seems to be the norm. Another problem is the lack of a flexible hose for hard to reach areas.The terrible battery life is a shame, because when the battery is new, the Euro-Pro has great suction for a rechargable unit. Because of that, I cannot recommend this vacuum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another one with a battery problem","review":"Same as everyone else - the design is defective and the batteries fail within a couple of months.

I will never purchase another EuroPro product again!Buyer Beware!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Off to a Good Start, but Battery Fails Quickly","review":"If this review were based on the first week, it would have gotten 5 stars. The noise is not too bad. Of course the Shark is somewhat loud. This is the nature of vacuums, especially small hand held units. Fortunately, it does not have the high pitched whine of the one it was replacing, which used to drive me bonkers. And it was quite powerful, with quite an admirable sucking power. Moreover, the overall unit design is pretty funky looking. Unfortunately, the battery did not last long between charges. And what is much worse, its performance rapidly degraded, so that a year later, it barely holds a charge good for a few seconds of vacuuming. If this unit had been used daily, you might expect such a loss of battery power. This was not the case as it was used only once a week or so. Because of this, and there is no easy way to get a replacement battery, I would recommend to avoid this vacuum until they improve battery performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRRRIBLE battery life","review":"When brand new, it worked great. Vacuum power was good, the attachments clever (you can vac the floor standing up!) However, the battery stinks. They claim 20 minutes on a full charge. I don't think we ever got that.

Note that we were careful to totally discharge the battery before recharging, as specified in the instructions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Happy for a few months","review":"I loved this cordless vacuum when I got it, and would still love it IF it held a charge.

After several emails, someone called to say they would send me another battery (I even offered to pay for it). That was 2 months ago! Now, I can't get anyone to respond to my emails. When I call, I get put on hold forever.

Consumers should be entitled to more than a few uses of a vacuum. I thank all of you out there for writing reviews on this product.

Then after about 4 months infrequent use, it died completely. Since I had lost my receipt, I was stuck. Then I bought one of the corded Ultra Sharks which died after 6 weeks use, and to send it back to the company AND pay the shipping to have it returned would cost as much as it did to buy.

I'm making an exception in this case because this product was such a remarkable rip-off.I'll be brief: for about a month, the vacuum worked amazingly well, and picked up anything and everything I wanted it to. After a month, the battery would no longer hold a charge -- it would suck things up for about 5-10 seconds, then be utterly useless, till it recharged 16 hours later.If I knew more about the law, I might file a class-action lawsuit against the makers of this thing. I feel cheated.So, if you'd like to pay $60 (or $50, or $40 or $5, for that matter) for a month's use, join me: we can chat about our large very expensive, uniquely Euro-styled paperweights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree with terrible reviews","review":"I've now had the Shark 1 year and it is worthless.

I can't say enough how much of a waste of time and money this vacuum cleaner is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same problem as others - battery!","review":"I've had this vacuum for some time (two years?) and hardly ever use it. The battery has lost its ability to hold a charge over time. It lasts less than a minute. It was a waste of money and I'm throwing it away. Besides the battery issue, it has a rather large footprint and takes up a lot of space. I would recommend Black and Decker's handheld with the removable batteries. You won't get as many attachments but then what good are the tools if the battery doesn't last for more than a minute?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Suction was only fair when brand new (struggled with crumbs, so forget about bolts or bowling balls as advertised) and even that minimal suction disappeared after 6 months.

I called Shark and they told me that only Shark can exchange the battery for $20 plus shipping. I went to a battery shop and they told me at least that price or more.

Even worse, because the suction power of the \\"Shark\\" was so weak, I decided to try to vacuum my caar with it plugged into an outlet. After about 15 minutes, the \\"Shark\\" just stopped working. I took it back and decided to buy a non-cordless handvac. This time, I bought the Dirt Devil Scorpion. Let me tell you, this is a real hand vac.

Oh, that must be Mr. Clinton! -- Exactly.And who is that 'Pavlovich' in the Thomas Swan's book? He turned out to be the Grand Duke Dmitri. A person with that title is a member of the Emperor's family, a brother or a cousin of the Czar. In our case, he is the cousin of Czar Nicolas II. So his last name is Romanov, and his full name is the Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich Romanov. Pavlovich is patronymic. To use it as a family name is the same as to use middle name instead of last name.Unfortunately, Thomas Swan doesn't know that. He calls Dmitry Romanov just 'Pavlovich.' Theoretically, it's nothing wrong to call someone by one's patronymic, but not it a that context.I understand this has nothing to do with the main subject of his book.

I got it home and the vacuum overheated constantly. It takes at least a half hour for the thing to cool down so you can use it again. I thought that I might have just have a lemon so I exchanged it for a new one. Same thing. It clogs very easily and requires four screws to be removed to take the top cover off to get to the belt or anything that might need unclogging inside.

The only thing I like besides the easy maneuvering is the reuseable bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT'S WONDERFUL --- WHEN IT WORKS","review":"We bought cause it looked cute in the store and it wasn't too pricy. The problem is it overheats easily causing the rubber belt to melt. Removing the cover and changing the belt is a struggle. You may also have problems finding the belts to purchase. The ones I've seen in the store come with the bags which I don't really need right now. I was disapointed that it's quite noisy although maybe slightly less so than the old Eureka we have.

Within the first week, the belt started burning and had to be replaced. Within 2 months, we've replaced the belt twice more. I'm now looking at replacing it after 3 months -- at this rate, I would have been better off buying another $200 plus vacuum that would last me 3 years.

We contacted Europro in an attempt to get it fixed under warranty, but all we got was a run-around. Rude telephone service made the experience even less pleasant. After many conversations, I was told I could send my vacuum to the only place they could repair it, at my own cost, if I insured it first, at my own cost as well, to a place in the United States (I live in Canada). I simply can't afford to do this. I can't afford to buy a new vacuum either. I bought this one when my old vacuum broke after I maintained it in good running shape for 13 years. This one gave me grief in under 3 weeks. My advice is to buy a vacuum form a company that you know will be able to service your product near you.

The moods of Pikachu are cute for a little while, but they just seem to annoy you eventually. Team Rocket (Jesse and James fr. the TV show) are all over the place. I thought that was pretty neat, but that is about it. For the exception of Pikachu, there are no new moves to learn and no new pokemon.

Starting with Pikachu makes the game more difficult, especially at the start. Considering that Pikachu is not a very strong Pokemon, and that you can catch him early on in the older games (look in Viridian Forest), I don't think this is a very useful feature. It could appeal to younger kids who like Pikachu from the cartoons, I suppose. You can catch all three of the starting Pokemon from Red and Blue in this game, but there are better pokemon out there. If you are going for all 150, I guess this would be the game to get, though. Once you defeat the first gym leader, the game is actually slightly easier than Red and Blue.In conclusion, I really don't think Yellow is worth it for experienced Pokemon fans.

The bulb is a Osram, but Sony uses Philips bulbs. This Osram bulb is rated at 4,000 hrs and the Philips bulb is rated at 8,000 hrs. The last time I purchased a lamp for my TV I got a cheapo with the Osram bulb for $80 shipped.

I started to laugh when I took the front tv panels off. I paid the best price around(it's $200 most places), the shipping was fast, and most importantly, the lamp was in perfect condition when it arrived. Never buy a lamp warranty policy on a new tv!! We paid $200, never used it for 3 years, it expired, and now we had to buy a new lamp-good price, but we're still out an extra $140.

Mainly because, while it was starting to get a bit dim the last year or so, it wasn't bad until the other day. It got REALLY dim. So instead of going out and getting a new TV, I opted to get the bulb.. for now. And Wow! I'm really impressed. It's like a brand new TV. Bright and vivid.

I called the customer service number to have the unit repaired and the company out sources its call center to India and it is extremely hard to understand the service reps.

I paid postage and insurance for the package. I also bought like $50 in vacuum bags before the vacuum failed. Now I've practically paid for a new vacuum. They never responded.

Contacted Amazon and got no help. The vacuum still looked brand new so I couldn't bring myself to junk it. Kept it in the closet hoping the suction would miraculously come back on its own. Checked it the other day, and when I lifed up the hose, it broke in half. Have never seen anything of such poor quality. Made in China, go figure...

It works extremely well on hardwood and ceramic floors and the \\"air powered\\" rotating brush attachment for denser carpets works like a charm. The attachments all work well and the adjustable suction control is really convenient when you're using the dusting brush. Best of all, it is quiet and easy to move around. Its only shortcoming is a short (17 ft) power cord. I'd buy another one without a moment of hesitation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy little machine","review":"The compact design is great for the small pick up jobs around the house.

Gabriele Ferzetti is competent as Giacomo Ferzetti. The stunning Swede Märta Torén, who left the USA after tiring of being type cast as a woman of mystery, plays the long-suffering wife of the composer and actually ages in this movie. (In real life, she died suddenly at age 31.) Nadia Gray portrays one of Puccini's lovers. The voices of Beniamino Gigli and other noted Italian opera singers of the era are heard throughout. Till a studio decides to produce a film with more depth and scope on this great Italian composer, like Columbia's SONG WITHOUT END on Franz Liszt, this French-Italian production will have to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"BADLY- VERY BADLY DUBBED FILM!","review":"I was expecting Post War Italian Cinema grandeur. I was hoping to see a gorgeous Technicolor production, with the sweep and passion of Puccini's music. Imagine my surprise and great dismay, to discover that every actor in this definitely Italian Film, was speaking American English! Badly dubbed English! How bad? You'd swear that microphones were set up on sound stages in the Bronx, or Brooklyn, Queens or New Jersey. I have nothing against those places, but honestly, why couldn't we have heard the original Italian actor's voices?? I was frantic to find a way to hear the film in Italian, thinking there might be subtitles. No such luck.I thought, \\"Is the dubbing really that irritating? Can I give it another try?\\" So I did. Less than 20 minutes later I was done. Had I known in advance that the movie is dubbed, I never would have purchased it. I'm doing the rest of you a favor in letting you know.

I like how I don't have to commit to a whole gel pack at once and can pop a blok every 10 minutes or so. I find that spacing out the intake helps keep the stomach calm as I can have a blok and a sip of water instead of gulping down a gel and then guzzling water to wash it all down.

Needed to get special tool to install and took several hours to remove old and press in new. All seemed fine until about one month after installing, the boot on one of the ball joint came out from under the retaining clip allowing dirt and sand in and grease out. Had no information on warranty, how to contact company or how to replace failed product. Not practical to remove product and return since truck will be out of commission. The process was such that now it isn't worth pursuing and won't order these again. Will order factory replacement arms/ball joint to repeat the process. Not happy about these ball joints."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great toy, not made well","review":"My children loved this toy a lot--they had lots of fun with it and two and three-year-olds especially love watching the cars go down. Younger children many need assistance as you have to line the wheels up with the track for it to work. But it was not very well made! Both the stand itself and several of the cars broke even though I supervised my children while they played with it and they did not abuse it. Other manufacturers make similar toys--I plan to replace this with another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The cars for some reason to not stay on the track.

He was fascinated with letting the cars go and watching them. The novelty wore off within a few weeks, but he still plays with it one in a while. It's not something that will keep their attention for more than a few minutes, because it only does one thing: the cars ride down the tracks.

While my then three-year old son was playing with the toy, two of the wheels fell off one of the cars. Within seconds, my 1-year old daughter grabbed a wheel and put it in her mouth. Had I not been watching, she easily could have swallowed or inhaled this wheel which can look like candy or large Cheerios to young children! We put the toy away and will not take it out until our children are all above the age of 4."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculously overpriced and not well constructed","review":"We bought this for our son thinking this would be a fun toy. Unfortunately, there's enough problems with it, that I fully regret the purchase. First off, the cars get stuck on the track, not even making it all the way down. Additionally, it's smaller than it looks. There's no way this toy is worth the 40$ purchase price. Disappointing, because it looked good on the site."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for Young and/or Autistic","review":"I got this toy for my son who love to see things drop and sway.

Wouldn't recommend this toy, unless they revamp the way it's held together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Price too High and Not well made","review":"While I have no problem spending money on a nice toy, I was slightly disappointed. This is a sort of toy you could make yourself. When I opened the box (purchased at Learning Express), it had wheels that had come unglued and was clearly cheaply manufactured in China. There was even globs of dried up glue on the bottom (not pretty!) I felt it was asking too much for what it was- should have been like 15 bucks and instead I paid 40. 2 of the cars come attached together and that's not really clear on the box either unless you look at the picture closely. Save your money for another toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible craftsmanship!!!!","review":"First of all, there is no standard to the size of the wheel widths - they have to be short enough to go in between the wooden bars and out of 8 wheel shafts, only one was the right size. 95% of the time you let a car go at the top, it gets stuck or just falls off the track. We had to saw off a portion of each wheel to make them the correct size to go down & even then sometimes they fall of the edge where they should just flip down to the next level. I paid $40 for this toy, & I would not buy it again. The homemade fix was time consuming & it's still not perfect. There are better options for this type of toy - haba has a great ball track, although it is much more expensive & aimed at a younger crowd. Find a better toy, this one stinks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rocks my Stereo","review":"CGT is an amazing trio of innovative guitar players that come from or are inspired by the Robert Fripp school of guitarrist. These live interpretations stand as a great overview of both their work and the ability to transform different styles and other's work into the trio's musical style. The three guitar arregements are clever and sometimes so good that it's almost scary. A fine example if Queen's Bohemian Rapsody... It truly blew me away the first time I hear it through my stereo. The trio is also augmented by Tony Levin (another King Crimson member with Fripp) and this provides the needed bass sound to make the trio's sound more complete.This is a band and album for those looking for challeging music in both intelectually and performance wise."},{"rating":"2","title":"good first hand account","review":"I've always enjoyed reading books written by people who were there.

I use it to clean 2 regular size rooms and a hallway and I have to bang the filter clean after each room. The so called \\"powered\\" floor wand hardly ever works b/c it runs on the suction power the machine does not have.

It is terrible on carpets (especially if you have an animal in the house).

Filters are imposibble to buy too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great on hardwoods","review":"I have a small apartment with hardwood floors, so I don't need some big and expensive canister vac to suck dust. What I bought seems to be just as good the larger, higher priced models. This thing has great suction; you'll need to clean the filters often, but even if you don't, it will still suck well. It's easy to tap them into a wastebasket, and every 8-10 runnings, you should run the filters under the water faucet. The attachments are fine. The cord rolls up into the machine, which is nice. The exhaust gets a little warm, so make sure there is enough room around the unit for air flow. If your place is larger than 1100 or 1200 sqft, you may want to get something bigger.

Didn't even have it for 1 hour."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great little vac!","review":"I selected this vacuum not even seeing a picture on the website, but it had the features I wanted and the price was right. When I received it, I was surprised at how light the box was. It's a nice, compact canister that moves around easily due to it's light weight and small size. You can even use the included strap to carry it on your shoulder. It does an excellent job on my hardwood floors and berber carpets! I love that it's bagless. The instructions say to tap the filter on the side of the trash can to get all the dust out, but i recommend doing this outside or all the dust will be airborn in the house. The HEPA filter is great, especially since I think my old vac blew as much dust into the air as it was taking in!

In this song, she touches the heart of the listener in such a way that one is comforted in knowing that they are not alone in having an unrequited love.

You will find that only the first 10 books (chapters) are included. The last three are missing. So if you want the complete Confessions, you will end up having to buy another, separate, complete version to get it all! I did a search for the Harvard Classics Vol. 7 PART 2 (since the \\"fine print\\" in the description -- which I never saw until after purchasing this volume -- shows this edition to be part 1).

The two problems I have with it are first off, the Pre-built workout has some lag time in the transitions. It is basically palaying the whole DVD which leads to my second problem, which is the whole workout is too long for me! I'd like a nice balanced 45 minute or so workout for teh pre-built one, but it's over an hour. It's easy to work around with the remote, but that is why it is 4, not five stars in my book.

In less than two hours a comprehensive description of the architecture of the museum and selected art pieces plus contemporary examples of classical music performed by the best musicians of Saint Peteresburg. The history comments of the time when the arts were created adds a most valuable pespective. This DVD is a useful complement to a short visit to this magnificent museum.Technically this DVD could be considered by itself as an art masterpiece by Vladimir Ptashchenko. In comparison to other better than average DVDs, the background sound does not shadows the well informed descriptions by the presenter and the visuals are consistenly superior. In my perception this program is food for the soul of the best class to be enjoyed many times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Money if you are an R.E.M. fan!","review":"First off, since Amazon doesn't list the tracks that are on the CD I will do it for you...1. Bittersweet Me 2. Undertow (live) 3. Wichita Lineman (live, previously unreleased) 4. New Test Leper (live in studio, acoustic)Ok, now that we have that over with, I will get on to the review. The first track is obviously from the album New Adventures In Hi-Fi. The second song is from the video Roadmovie, so if you have that (like I do) you will know what it sounds like. It is a very good live version. The third song is a new song, and is a slow and somewhat soft. It's very good in my opinion. And the fourth track is, in my opinion, the highlight of the single. This is a wonderful version of New Test Leper, which has only vocals, acoustic guitar, and organ on it. It is an incredibly beautiful version of the song.If you are an R.E.M. fan looking for more than just the albums, pick this single up. It is well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution -- track list descriptions could be inaccurate.","review":"Just ordered and received this CD, but there are only 2 songs instead of the 4 most people are describing below.

As the saying goes, the third times often the charm, and that was the case for Bogguss, who finally garnered not only long overdue airplay, but commercial success as well. It was also fortunate that this project arrived at a time when the term \\"country music\\" encompassed a wide variety of styles. Bogguss was, and never has been, country in the strictest sense--her tastes run more towards a hybrid of country, pop, and folk--she's actually very similar to early Ronstadt, if you have to categorize. No matter the category, all of Bogguss' strengths finally got noticed with what was arguably her best release yet. Among the several astute song choices, special attention must be paid to 'Outbound Plane', 'Someday Soon', and 'Letting Go',all well-deserved hits.ACES remains one of Bogguss' best records, and one of the better country-pop albums to come out of the nineties."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste!","review":"The light wont go out.

So I bought another, figuring I had just been unlucky. The next one worked just great for two weeks, and then it wouldn't go out. So I did all the same things over again: I couldn't get it to go out. Obviously I can't change batteries every 2 days, so I have to consider this product faulty and not worthy of purchase. It's a nice faucet, too; I'm really disappointed it doesn't function properly.

The Beach Boys included original tunes like \\"Little Saint Nick\\" and \\"The Man With All the Toys.\\" These tunes are now standard tunes heard during the holidays. The tune \\"Christmas Day,\\" is a very pretty song. But the highlights are the older established songs. Brian Wilson's vocal arrangements are magical. \\"White Chritmas\\" and \\"I'll be Home for Christmas\\" are beautiful renditions of these well worn tunes.

I could not have been more disappointed. As a parent, I was looking for concrete examples of mindful parenting. The book felt preachy and at times, condescending. There are other books out there that are much more helpful if you are looking for techniques to improve your parenting, such as \\"Buddhism For Mothers\\" (great for Dads too!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am in love with this book!","review":"This book is such a delight! Although it is hard to compare it to other parenting books I've read (it's very different), it is by far my favorite.

This book is worth much more than the 11ish dollars it is selling for right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Laos Cookbook - much that is new","review":"As an voracious eater of Asian food who has also travelled extensively not only in Thailand but also in Laos, I found \\"Taste of Laos\\" a delight. The 8 pages of glossary alone are worth the price of the book. The author's vingettes are very engaging and the recipes authenic Lao. I don't know of any Thai cookbooks that include traditional Lao dishes such as ant egg soup or 'Nam Lao, fresh ingredients rolled in translucent rice paper wrapers. Alan Davidson's foreword as well as the Author's \\"A Word About Lao Food\\" were very informative. All in all I would say that \\"Taste of Laos\\" is a much appreciated addition on my book shelf. I rather doubt the reader from Greenwich Village could have written this book sitting in his (or her) NY kitchen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Taste of Greenwich Village - nothing new here","review":"As an avid fan of far eastern food and having travelled extensively in Thailand I was keen to get an early copy of this new book.

Garnish with Day's talent for slapstick humor, \\"scarey bad guys\\", and an inexplicable splash of Arthur Godfry...what do you have? Belly laughs a plenty and a treasure of a classic.

My 4 and 5 yr old use it, in conjuction to the Montessori counting beads, and the math they can do is remarkable. Ciphering rocks!

I have three kids and bought this to help my daughter with math. My youngest just turned four and I don't see where it poses any danger to her. Children any younger shouldn't have one of these anyway because the purpose is for counting and math, and it's just not necessary to 2 year olds. The metal rods are plenty durable, the wood pieces are screwed together solidly. If a child breaks this, then he's a destructive kid.

This is especially true on this set, because Richard Thompson is a greater and more unique performer than arguably anyone who covers his songs here. Despite their punk roots, X and Bob Mould don't rock any harder than RT did on the originals of the songs they covered. The various folkies on the album have nothing on Richard, Linda Thompson, or Sandy Denny when it comes to great ballad singing. And so on...Be glad it's out of stock.

It broke down within the first month, it (We've only had this vacumm for only 6 months) would constantly loose power. We took it to a local dealer and we were told this is the NOT the vacumm to own. Needless to say it was fixed but broke down again a week later. Called the company and the only option given was to ship it, which takes about 8 weeks to get back. So not only did we loose the money we paid to purchase this, but now we would have to pay for shipping. BUYER BEWARE!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!

The wand that pops out is not long enough to do a decent job of cleaning anything. It tends to fall over a lot when using the attachments. The twisting handle that empties the dirt does not work. The only way to get the dirt out is to pull the large clumps out with your hand. I would never buy/recommend this product to anyone.

It worked for about two weeks after that and now it won't even turn on. We bought this vacuum because it was a good value for what we thought we were getting.

To empty the canister it takes about 30 minutes you have to turn the knob until you get fed up and then you have to get a stick or something long to push all the dirt and dust out which then goes in your face and gets you all dusty, not good if you have allergies. The hose that is for the attatchments came out of the it's so then naturally it doen't suck anything up. It's cheaply made. This all has happened in less then a year.

I bought another 4 months ago, because I figured that maybe I just had a \\"lemon\\". Yesterday, the vacuum just surged and stopped working. Of course, that was after the little plastic piece that kept the brush roller from spinning fell out of this one too. These vacuums are pieces of junk, JUNK.

I vacuumed the livingroom with my new Twister, and emptied the canister, which I found to be easy, despite the abundance of dog and cat hair in it.(2 cats, a batch of kittens and a dog that perpetually sheds!) I then pulled out my Thunder and vacuumed after the Twister. To my surprise and delight there was only the barest amount of dust in the bottom of my Thunder!!! I am almost as happy with this Twister as I was with the Thunder! I found the Twister very comfortable to push around. I am very pleased. I rated it a 4 because it is heavy (but no heavier than the Thunder was), and the hose for the attachments seems a little shorter than what I'm used to.

Although there were some good parts in this book such as when a shark attacked his boat and when he was knocked unconcious, I feel it still needs more action.

The story is about a boy named David Alspeth who is told by his uncle to drop his remains in the Ocean where land was not seen.

The night of cleaning the boat he was starving and had an encounter with an oil tanker. After starving and thirst, he found himself after a smaller storm in the Bay of Whales. The funniest thing was one of the whales popped up and shot snot in David's hair. Seeing a ship he had an opportunity to leave the Frog and get home. He refused to go, and just took some supplies and went on his own.I did not like this book because it was boring. It also did not have any humor, except for the whale snot. It also had no action.

David goes out in the Frog, and sails out where nobody can see him, then gives the sea his beloved Uncle Owen's ashes. When coming back, he encounters storms, and sharks that turn him around, and back out even farther to sea. After being so hungry, he finds land, but realizes there is no sign of civilization. He sails back out hoping to find someone, and runs into a whale research team. Then, he begins the long journey home.The Voyoge Of The Frog is a two-star book. I thought it was very boring. When there were exciting parts, he almost described them too much. There were also some disgusting chapters. If you are not into the sea, you probably will not enjoy this book, or understand much of it. That is why I rate The Voyage Of The Frog with two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"SLUGISH","review":"This book was not written for someone uninvolved with the sea. It was a dull, boring, uninteresting, slugish, and blunt book. THE VOYAGE OF THE FROG lacks action and humour. David Alspeth, the protagonist in the story, had a typical day plan. While stranded out in the ocean, he would simply wake up, drink water, try to catch fish, think, look at the ocean, and go to sleep. I think personally that Mr. Paulsen put far to many details into an already awful plot. It started when David's Uncle Owen died with the request to have his ashes scattered where no land could be seen. He did this, but was then hit by a storm that took him far from home. Drifting for days with the boat, he forms a bonding with it and matures after watching whales jump in and out of the water outside his boat. With the oppurtunity to be rescued at last, he refuses in order to stay with THE FROG, and travels home alone. It took a 141 page book to explain this small story."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Voyage of the Toad","review":"The Voyage of the Frog was about a boy named Divid trying to survive. David dumps his uncle's ashes in the ocean, but while doing this he hits a storm. The storm takes him to the middle of the Pacific Ocean. In between the begining and middle of the storm, David hits his head and gets a concussion. A few nights later, David woke up to a shark bumping the boat. The next week a tanker went by, but does not see him. The wind picks up. He finds land. When he awoke from his sleep there's whale junk on him. Then,atlast some whale watchers find him. At the end David is going to travel home.This book was a very sluggish book. I think it was a dull book because it had no humor, excitment, or action. David just woke up, drank four cups of water, looked at the ocean, or cleaned, and then went to bed. The action was very little and had no excitement at all. Plus, I didn't like the part about David reading Owen's diary. I would not reccomend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooooooring!!!","review":"The book The Voyage of the Frog is about a boy who goes out to sea to scatter his uncle's ashes. Then a storm hits and drives him far out to sea. Then he is becalmed and many things happen to him. First while he is drifting an oil tanker almost collides with him, and then he is attacked by a shark. Finally he is blown down the by the coast and a whale research ship finds him and offers to take him home. He refuses because if he were to go with them he would have to leave the Frog behind. So then he starts to sail home and the book ends. I thought this book had some action but mostly he just sat around on his boat. I also thought the ending was to sudden. I would not recommend this book to anybody because nothing ever happens and he just sits and feels sorry for himself. This book was dull and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book about a boy who is put against the forces of nature.","review":"I thought that this was a bad book. The reason was because of the books abrupt ending and how it is almost the same of Paulsens other books. The only reason I didn't give it Zero stars or one was because other than the ending this was an average book. Although it was the ending that was the biggest flaw that made me not like it very much.

I wouldnt even recommend it to the author himself, Gary Paulsen. For all of those who do read the book, you must be some person that is extremely obsessed with boats. You could also be one of those people that just has to read every book that they can find. I didn't like it, because I dont understand how a fourteen year-old is able to live on water for like two weeks with seven cans of canned goods, no radio, and no clue of where he is. I also didn't understand all the fancy talk about the boat gears and gadgets. This book is a good book for the sailor or fisherman in all of us. Some will like this book and some will not, but I surely didn't.

I was sad when I read that his Uncle Owen had cancer, so that part was emotional for me. The part about the shark is so cool because it also has excitement in it. It was just like \\"Jaws\\", the movie. I also thought that it was sad when he had to throw Owen's ashes into the sea. I thought the storms were scary. When the oil tanker came, I shuddered with fear. I thought when the wind picked up, it was so exciting. When the researchers came I was so excited. The book was great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary Adventure","review":"I thought that the book was scary because David almost drowned in a storm, he almost got bit by a shark, and he could have got killed by an oil tanker. David almost died because he didn't have a lot of food to survive. He thought he would not get home because he had cuts and scratches all over his body and he thought he couldn't sail home. I thought the book was good because it was like a adventure because he was going out to sea to put his uncle's ashes in the sea. The book was O.K and good so I give it 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"very boring book","review":"The voyage of the Frog was detaled book.

Hot water and soap is okay but does not kill all the bacteria. Bleach water disinfects but its frequent use wears down and discolors my equipment. So I thought I found the solution with steam.

Do not try to reach customer service as the line is always busy. I feel someone should be held accountable and start listening to customers who have spent a lot of money thinking they are getting a good product and service (which both lack).

Rather than just providing recipes, Bittman teaches you to cook great food. He teaches that there is no need for strict adherence to recipes. He provides the basics and explains why they are the basics. From there, the cook is encouraged to create. After spending a few months with this cookbook, I cleaned off my book shelf. Those old copies of Fanny Farmer and the Joy of Cooking - gone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"When it's mid-afternoon on a saturday, and I'm trying to decide what to cook, this is the book I grab. When I have a pound of leftover boneless chicken, this is the book I grab. The recipes are great. I love his approach of presenting a basic recipe plus 20-25 variations. We've had this book for 6 months, and given it as a gift several times also to rave reviews.Buy it, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the cookbook I refer to first","review":"As a relatively recent single person who doesn't cook a lot, I love having Mark Bittman's \\"How to Cook Everything\\" nearby for when I do feel like cooking.Everything I've wanted to make I've easily found in this large volume. What I like is his free-flowing way to the recipes. If you don't have this in the house, then try that. It works for me.My favorites are his recipes for granola, hummus and guacamole. Yes, I've made other things, but these are the easy foods that fill out my simple meals."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm a not a Cook, but these come out great!","review":"TONS of recipes, truly of every variety, and many of them are very very simple. I'm a baker, but not a cook, and this book is perfect because he explains everything. I absolutely recommend this to everyone who needs to start or add to a cookbook collection. A great 'moving out on their own' present as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have other cookbooks you like, don't buy this one.","review":"I got this as a gift, and it is an okay book. I've looked up some misc. things like how to cook barley or good proportions for a milkshake, but generally the recipes are overly simplistic, for boring, middle-American food. The author's style also tends to overpower the recipes (his constant advice to eat leftovers and freeze 5 extra lbs. of stuff really bugged me and my tiny apartment freezer). This book is just not written for the sophisticated or simply urban cook or diner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"My husband gave me this cookbook for Christmas a few years ago. I was very disappointed after looking at a few recipes and trying a couple others. These recipes don't work.I have been cooking and baking for many many years. Just looking at the recipes I knew the amounts were wrong (wrong rising agent for the amount of acid in the recipe, wrong porportion of liquid to dry ingredients, etc.), but I tried a couple anyhow. Total flop. The muffins were garbage and the cookies didn't taste good either.I can't figure out how so many people like this book. Pick any other standard cookbook before this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only If You Already Know How to Cook Everything","review":"We purchased this book and tried to several of the recipes. He follows handbooks, cookbooks and the like to a T. I know how to cook pretty well. This title is misleading; it seems it would be great for a beginner or anybody that would like to incorporate more into their repertoire, but really, if you don't know to fix mistakes in the recipes like how to fix pancake batter so they don't come out like hockey pucks , this book may make cooking seem harder than it really is. The taste of everything was just ok, nothing spectacular. Buy if you want to see someone's take on some of your faves (and then be prepared to alter the recipe), but if you are looking for something that will introduce you to mind blowing meals, this is not the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"The CD doesn't work with Macintoshes","review":"Nowhere in the review or dust jacket of this book does it reveal that the CD-ROM of this book is for Windows machines only. It does not run on Apple or MacOS systems. Really crummy."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to UNDERCOOK Everything","review":"After using this book throughout my first year of marriage, I can easily say that it's a decent, thoughtful cookbook. However, every recipe without fail has underestimated the cooking time by no less than half.It's fine once you get used to it. But, it's a major failing that has messed up more than one evening. Even if you're trying out a recipe for the first time, who wants to eat two hours late?Forewarned is forearmed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rarely find what I'm looking for . . .","review":"I get so frustrated with this book. Each time I have a whim to prepare something (usually something straightforward) I reach for this book. Granted my is a few years old and perhaps has improved. Today I wanted to make artichoke dip. When I reached for it and could not find anything it was the last straw and I decided to go write a quick review. I can't tell you how many times this has happened.The book is filled with a ton of basic information, but on the recipe side I think it is very lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Good","review":"I was enthusiastic about this book when I first scanned it at the bookstore. Later, after trying a few recipes and spending more time with it, I found it to be mediocre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recipes need changing!","review":"The person who wrote this cookbook obviously likes everything fatty and unsweetened. I found this cookbook useful only if I changed just about all the recipes by reducing the fat content by half, and doubling the amount of sugar.My daughter didn't know this and baked some cookies using the original recipe in the book. They were disgusting! They weren't at all sweet and extremely fatty. Yuck!I use the corn bread recipe all the time, it's excellent if you know what needs to be changed. Do not add any butter at all (the recipe tells you to add 2 tablespoons), and add 3/4 cup of sugar (the recipe tells you to use only 1 tablespoon)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Go-To Book","review":"I originally got this book when I first moved out on my own. I had some cooking experience which I gleaned from my mother, but with a limited spread of recipes and without much on-my-own experience.This book helped me a great deal as a beginner cook, and taught me most of the basics. Years later, I'm a much better cook, and though I rarely use this book's recipes at face value, I often reference it for a guideline to dishes that I enjoy, while adding my own touches. Also, when I'm preparing to try something new, this is generally the first book I go to, even after all this time.Other cook books have come and gone, but this one has staying power for me, earning it its five stars. A great purchase for a young adult, or even an every-day cook who just isn't very good, or who has a limited array of recipes. It is also a great reference for anyone who just wants a base to branch out from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book especially for people that don't know how to cook","review":"I will start off by saying that I had no experience in the kitchen before getting this book. I make a great peanut butter and jelly sandwich...That said, a friend gave me this book and now I actually feel like I sort of know what's going on. The book not only has recipes but tips and tricks on how to cut meat, defrost, etc. The recipes are simple in that they're easy to understand with detailed instructions. While some of the recipes are long, at least the ingredients are easy to find, not like some other cookbooks I've seen where I walk into the supermarket and they have no idea what I'm talking about."},{"rating":"2","title":"HANDS DOWN THE BEST COOKBOOK I OWN","review":"This book definitely cuts my cooking calls to mom by about 90%. It has great instructions for how to cook nearly everything. I would say that at least 95% of the recipes I have tried have been EXCELLENT. Only one I have tried out of many was a flop. It is a super reference. Also has a lot of \\"basic\\" recipes with many variations... keeps it pretty simple. If I had to choose between keeping this cookbook by itself or my next 4 favorite cookbooks and not this, I would have to pick this one by itself. A must have! Bon apetit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost everything!","review":"I got this book at a thrift store, like new. I have enjoyed browsing through it and have used several of the recipes as well and been very happy. Nice to have a solid reference for so many types of different cuisines and useful techniques. Looking forward to cooking more things from this great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book has saved my @#% more than once already","review":"Without fail, these recipes have been clear, concise (with drawings to help me make my gnocchi), and delicious. One caveat: when he tells you to use a non-stick pan...do it. My crunchy chicken curry dish was a disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst food I've ever made (and I've made some bad food!)","review":"After reading all the great reviews of this book I thought it would be a wonderful addition to my somewhat limited cookbook library. Boy, was I wrong! Granted, I've only made 6 recipes, and there are probably several thousand in this huge book, but all 6 have been horrible. Let me share my latest disaster - Summer Pudding. It sounded great. First, you spend a fortune on summer fruit such as blueberries, strawberries, raspberries (you get the drift). Then you boil them to a puree, add some sugar (so far, it really is good). But then, you pour this over white bread, put it in the refridgerator for hours, and the result is supposed to be similar to tiramasu. Ha! I don't know what miracle I was expecting to take place, but none did. In fact, it looked remarkably like liver, and tasted like... white bread soaked in what used to be good sauce! YUK! That's the last thing I'll ever make out of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not everything, but pretty useful","review":"This is the cookbook I use the most these days. The recipes are fairly contemporary and there is interesting background information on ingredients and the like. There are no color photographs, so it's not the sort of book you flip through to find something to cook. Rather, it's a good reference when you have an idea already what you want to make. The only really problem with the book is that the recipes were not completely checked for glitches and are not completely idiotproof. Sometimes steps are left out or vague language is used. I prefer \\"chem lab\\" level cookbooks that don't leave anything to doubt, with exact specifications--this book is a little loose sometimes. And occasionally an ingredient doesn't show up in the step-by-step recipe, making you guess when it should be added. However, for the most part this cookbook is quite good."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are other, better references out there if you know how to cook","review":"I don't understand why this book gets such high marks from so many. The recipes don't work, for me or my family. We're cooks. We cook all the time. We bake, we cook, we decorate and we are capable of some pretty complicated, intricate stuff. But this book and its recipes...wow. Just doesn't work for us. At all. Ever. We've had it in the house and we've tried to like it. But the proportions are off, for the spices and the baking and just about everything. I can make pudding from scratch in my sleep. But if I try the recipes in this book, I end up with liquidy mess. Far better to try other classic cookbooks, at least for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I've owned this cookbook for a couple of years now...while the recipes are not incorrect, I've found them to be very bland. I've found simpler and better tasting recipes on the back of food boxes and cans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reference, Good Recipes","review":"Whenever my daughter and I have a question about techniques or ingredients, we're the most likely to find a useful and clearly presented answer here. And while the title is overblown, the variety of recipes is amazing - kasha varnishkes to chicken cacciatore. 5 stars for the information presented, 3-4 for the recipes. A welcome tool for fledgling foodies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A novel for casual cooks","review":"I've owned this book for about a year now, and today when I realized how often I consult it for cooking and baking, I had to write a review. This cookbook offers far more than recipes! It offers basics of food preparation, suggestions and ideas for alternatives to standard recipes, some background information on where particular dishes originated, and just general helpful hints. I use this book whether I'm creating something on my own in the kitchen, trying a recipe from a friend or another cookbook, or preparing one of Mark Bittman's dishes. Today I was looking for a recipe for pizza dough, and found myself caught up in reading an entire section! The instructions are clear and concise, and the language draws in even cooks with the most casual interest. I would recommend this for anyone who enjoys food preparation - regardless of their skill level. This is a fantastic reference and cookbook, and would make a great gift!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hands down the best.","review":"I use this cookbook constantly. Even if I don't use the recipie in the book I'll still refer to this to insure that the technique is proper. (Steam bath for cheesecake, prepping certain food items, buying fresh fish, etc.)When my little sister moved in w/ her fiance I immediately knew that she would need this book and have purchased it here to give to them for their first offical Christmas together."},{"rating":"2","title":"EVERYONE SHOULD OWN THIS COOKBOOK!","review":"I FIRST SAW THIS AUTHOR ON A MARTHA STEWART SHOW WHICH IS WHAT PROMPTED ME TO BUY IT. BOY, WAS I GLAD I DID!! THIS BOOK HAS JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING IN IT (JUST AS THE TITLE SAYS). I'VE TRIED MANY NEW DISHES THAT I NEVER WOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THAT MY FAMILY AND I JUST LOVE. I BOUGHT ONE FOR MY DAUGHTER AND A FRIEND (THAT'S HOW GREAT IT IS...I'M NOT EVEN KIDDING.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"So Inclusive!","review":"I love this cookbook! Mark gives you a starting point for your dish and then gives you several variations to try. Who knew you could make basic tomato sauce and vary it 13 different ways! This is a great book for beginning cooks with plenty for those who have been cooking for years.....a great go-to book."},{"rating":"2","title":"cookbook","review":"Wonderful cookbook, especially the veggies section. Mark has such creative ideas for vegetables, I made an absolutely delicious cole slaw (sp.) from the book, and that's only one of many that I've tried so far. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"YUM!","review":"I wish everything truly was in here. My husband got an itch to try to cook some enchiladas and, unfortunately, this book didn't have such a thing in it.However, the recipes are great. If you are just getting into cooking, this a good start. Mark Bittman spends a HUGE amount of time explaining how to do everything from picking out veggies and fruits to cooking a whole chicken. There are useful diagrams and tips on changing around the recipes.This cookbook is truly the best I have so far,"},{"rating":"2","title":"A handy kitchen companion","review":"This is one of two cookbooks that should be in every kitchen. Along with the Joy of Cooking, How to Cook Everything belongs on your shelf. While it contains some good recipies for standard fare, its real strength lies in teaching the basics (how to brine a turkey, or roast a chicken, for example). I only give it four stars because it is really trying to serve the same function as The Joy of Cooking, and while it does an admirable job, nothing can surpass that classic. However, for a second opinion, How to Cook Everything deserves a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"A necessity in the kitchen.","review":"This book has inspired me to return to the kitchen. Being a practicing physician with limited free time, I had given up cooking and was mainly dependent on the microwave. HTCE sets a perfectly balanced tone-- easy preparations, low-key and enthusiastic approach, and delicious results.However, I was disappointed to see that several of the recipes in HTCE were repeated also in Bittman's Minimalist books (Minimalist Cooks Dinner, etc...) Since each of the Minimalist books costs about the same as this book, I recommend getting only HTCE and if you are curious about other recipes, borrow the Minimalist books from friends or the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most underseasoned recipes I ever made","review":"I bought this cookbook because I needed what looked like a general but slightly sophisticated cookbook to take with me to Armenia where we don't have a lot of selection in ingredients. I tried several recipes and they tasted like. . . nothing. The spaghetti bolognese sauce did not have garlic or a single herb or spice. I finally had to start putting things in it to give it SOME flavor. Compare this to the Basics cookbook recipe by the Silver Palate duo. His stir fry dishes are tasteless, too. This might be a good cookbook if one has not really attempted cooking before but it doesn't help someone who has some experience. (I don't really take umbrage with the title since it is a big thick cookbook.) The Silver Palate series or Gourmet or Bon Appetit magazines provide much more successful recipes. I'm curious if all those rave reviews came from people who just READ the cookbook rather than actually trying to make some of the recipes."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like this book...","review":"I really wanted to like this book, and I guess I do find it useful from an idea standpoint, but the truth is the food doesn't taste good. We've prepared between 10 to 15 recipes from this book and all of them disappointed. Contrast this with the less exciting but always tasty Joy of Cooking, and Joy wins every time. I wanted a sort of workhorse cookbook for everyday and I quickly realized this was not it. It went from lying open on the kitchen counter, to the bottom book on the kitchen cookbook stack (when I would thumb through it to get an idea for a dish) to being returned to the bookshelf and I'm afraid that's where it's going to stay. We had such high hopes, but thankfully, there's always our Joy of Cooking..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most comprehensive cooking guide I've seen","review":"I love to cook, and read about cooking. This book covers both. I have used this book often; for simple recipes, and more complicated. I plan to buy this book for friends and relatives- it is a staple for the kitchen."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to Cook Everything","review":"I agree with Doris Hayner. It does not have everything and very few recipes that I've wanted to try - almost none repeated. I think I would simplify it more. The variations should be more user friendly - see chicken. If I didn't have to feed a picky family I might try more recipes. The binding is already broken. Put it in a cookbook holder to avoid splashes but it is too big by half for the holder. I'm not fond of the old Joy of Cooking either for a first cookbook. Would probably prefer Good Housekeeping, if I had it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Was I Thinking","review":"I wish I had honed in on the poor reviews rather than the 4 and 5 star ones.I'm an experienced cook, but as I am getting older, I wanted to start preparing simpler, less time-consuming recipes. I see no reason simpler fare should not be delicious if made according to excellent recipes. I chose this cookbook believing it would deliver.I prepared Bittman's Baked Macaroni and Cheese, and was it awful! Besides being bland there was no color to it, much less any cheese flavor. Even salt and peppering this thing to death didn't make it edible.I wouldn't recommend this book even to someone just learning to cook. Save yourself the time, effort and expense if you're just learning your way around the kitchen and buy Betty Crocker's Cookbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"must I be lectured?","review":"I find Bittman's tone overbearing, almost untenable. Must he constantly shake his finger at me, telling me what I have to freeze, or why I have to do things exactly his way? Perhaps some people who don't know how to cook \\"everything\\" will appreciate the fingerwagger's way to prepare and cook. \\"Dice exactly according to instructions.\\" But if you know as much as a very little, you might be put off by someone who so obviously knows everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"dull as a dictionary","review":"yes, it's a good reference book but the meals are just ordinary- perhaps meals you would find at swiss chalet for example- julia child and jacques pepin's new book is excellent by comparison-"},{"rating":"1","title":"How to cook everything, except everything you want to cook!","review":"I tried to find 8 dishes I wanted to cook (2 Italian, 2 Mexican, 4 non-ethenic) and could not find a single one. 0 for 8 is not what I expected from the title.

For instance, how many teaspoons in a tablespoon? Also very helpful are the details. Bittman leaves very little to chance. Other cookbooks often take it for granted that you know hwo to mix certain ingredients, or what kind of utensils to use. Bittman makes it very clear. Beware though! I bought the book with the CD. It does not work on the Mac, and there is no indication of that on the package. The publisher says that the Windows format is the only one they use. No offer to refund the extra cost, no apologies...not very farsighted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recipes Great but the Book comes to pieces","review":"I loved this book when I first bought it. In fact I gave it to my daughter, 2 daughters-in-law and several friends. Then the BAD news. It is very poorly put together in a physical sense. It falls apart after limited usage. What a disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR THE JOY OF COOKING","review":"If you are serious about cooking, this is not the book for you. Top restaurant chefs and good amateur cooks know that excellence in cooking is the result of ingredients, technique, and presentation. The recipes in this book are over-simplified, there are very few illustrations, and very little about technique and presentation. Several of my favorite (and common) recipes were not in this book (but were found later in my \\"Joy of Cooking\\").If you know how to cook, this book provides little of value. If you don't know how to cook, the \\"Joy of Cooking\\", and several other well-known cookbooks, will be of far greater value that this pretentiously titled tome. If you want to learn professional techniques try the cookbooks of Le Cordon Bleu school of France."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HAVE","review":"THIS IS ONE OF THE GREAT ONES....CONTAINS SO MANY GREAT BASIC HINTS THAT OTHER BOOKS HAVE IGNORED.

It means that one can use the book with confidence."},{"rating":"1","title":"The food's just not great","review":"I know I am going to offend so many people who worship this guy, but I'm just not that impressed. I bought this book because I wanted to make delicious meals for my new hubby. I didn't know how to cook alot of things, but I know my way around the kitchen. I was very disappointed that out of 15 or so recipes, none had much taste. Maybe I am biased because I am from Texas and we like our food spicy - or at least flavorful - but I thought everything was too bland.Instead I recommend \\"The Ultimate Southern Living Cookbook\\". It does not claim to have nearly as many recipes, but the recipes it does have are flavorful and easy enough that novice chefs like myself can make a meal you'd be proud to serve to company or your beloved.Oh, in Bittman's credit, I think his recipes from his TV show are much better, probably because he is competing with world class chefs who inspire creativity and flavor."},{"rating":"2","title":"My fave!","review":"I love this cookbook and I've used it at least weekly since I got it, about 10 years ago. Just tonight, I made the recipe for potato pancakes (to go with his sweet-and-sour brisket recipe from NYT). And, yes, it was a pretty simple recipe: grated potatoes and onion, eggs, matzoh meal, salt and pepper. But that is exactly why I love this cookbook -- most of the recipes are simple! And Bittman always gives you enough info on technique -- like medium heat, 1/8 inch oil, 5 min. on a side for the pancakes. And they were pefect -- a friend for dinner said so! That said, there are a few stinkers in the book, such as pork chops with orange and fennel. However, they are SO many more winners, and I do appreciate Bittman's general cooking philosophy, which is good quality ingredients, simply prepared. The spine on my book is cracked and pages are falling out, so I'm sure I'll eventually get his 10th anniversary edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!!!!!","review":"Finally a cookbook that can be used! I get this book for anyone I know who is starting out or who needs to learn how to cook.

Although I enjoy baking I never learned basic everyday meal preparation skills. Mr. Bittman understands where I'm coming from. His simple explainations and everyday style (read non-gourmet) has been a great help to me when Hubby wants a break. I've been enjoying actually cooking instead of ordering out or doing \\"shake n bake.\\" Each recipe I've tried has been a success!!! Thank you Mr. Bittman for writing a cookbook for the rest of us!

And there are several useful lists (types of recipes, recipes for certain occasions) in the back of the book.

It probably won't be the last cookbook you own, but it should probably be one of the first.Like many amateur cooks, I can manage a few decent meals, but tend to shy away from recipes that I have little experience in. This is really a shame, because cooking something new is almost always fun and a good learning experience, even if it doesn't turn out quite like you imagined.Armed with the great guidance of this tome, however, I feel confident in tackling just about any meal that sounds healthy and delicious.In addition to the great recipes, the authors tone and obvious love of food and cooking comes through on every page, inspiring you to make things you haven't made before.In short, this is a great, instructive book that will have a place in my kitchen for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"#1 COOKBOOK!","review":"BEST...COOKBOOK....EVER!I use this cookbook on a daily basis, making every other cookbook I own obsolete!

Sunny's introduction is definitely worth watching. The villain (a killer) is excellent and clever, and he does well at matching wits with Sunny. How Sunny deals with this killer down to the final fight is well done. Only Sunny Deol could fit this cop role and pull it off so well, which is why he is the best.

With a concise, poetic hand, the author illuminates the spiritual and intellectual journey of a child who is beginning to piece together an understanding of the world around her, and to identify her place in it. The river is a simple, beautiful metaphor for the events that flow through the girl's life.Godden's evocative book touched my own recollections of childhood - the remarkable clarity of taste, smell, sensation, thought and feeling, the electrical insights flashing into awareness almost reflexively. Deeply affecting read, if one is quiet enough to hear all that is taking place within the simple narrative."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Simple but Challenging Novel","review":"I think it is fairly thoughtless to say that The River isn't a deep or thought-provoking read. The plot is so simple, and comes in such abrupt waves that one might not notice the amount of time the protagonist, Harriet, spends considering life, death, and our purpose here. It's richly symbolic and very subtle. The coming of age element of the story is told in a deft and beautiful way, and the ways in which the characters view life will get you thinking. Highly recommended (if you can find it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended","review":"I grew up on the Doris Day comedies of the 60's and I had no idea that Doris Day could play a dramatic part like this. She is outstanding in the role of jazz singer Ruth Etting. The songs are marvelous, especially \\"Shakin the Blues Away\\", and the movie never lags. In my opinion it's Doris Day's best movie, and although her comedies were entertaining, it's too bad she didn't get to do more movies like this one. It shows her real talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie........terrible tape!","review":"There isn't much I can add to the great reviews which I am in total agreement with. Doris Day and James Cagney give stellar performances, the story of singer Ruth Etting is great, and the music is terrific. My major problem for the 2 stars rating is the horrible quality of the picture. Filmed in CinemaScope, the VHS tape wrongly presents the movie in a full frame format. The result is a movie that is distorted, fuzzy, and missing key scene elements. For example, in one scene James Cagney is yelling over a sitting Doris Day who is heard crying but not seen. In the proper widescreen format she would have been seen sitting on the lower right side of the screen. Update: This movie is scheduled for release on DVD on April 26, 2005. Hopefully all the aforementioned problems will be corrected. Stay tuned...The DVD was just released and it's FANTASTIC...5 STARS!!! Great picture and sound!!!!!! Yeah!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Curiously sterile","review":"Some years back, I read a bio of Ruth Etting, upon whose life \\"Love Me or Leave Me\\" is based. A big singer in the 1920s, Etting married her goonish manager, and when she wanted to leave this ill-advised marriage later, he shot though did not kill her new boyfriend. Now in the wake of stories like the OJ Simpson trial or the Dorothy Stratten murder of 1980, a viewer would be very tempted to see this movie, especially as it boasts two fine stars, Cagney and Day. But something is wrong with this movie. Day is not as appealing as she usually is, somehow much colder and yet not as smart as such a woman portrayed that way is. Frankly, I kind of understood Cagney's point of view much better, and that's not really supposed to happen. \\"Love Me or Leave Me\\" disappointed me--though I didn't leave it until it was completely over, I was very far from loving it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It","review":"Great movie. Terrific story of Ruth Etting beautifully portrayed by Doris Day. Never has Miss Day sounded or looked better than in this fast paced biography of one a America's most famous singers. James Cagney, as you would expect, comes close to stealing the movie but Doris Day holds her own with a performance worthy of an Academy Award. The script is excellent and the singing of course is beautiful. Many music critics have said that only Doris Day's voice could be compared to Ella Fitzgerald's and this film proves it. Miss Day can take any song and make it sound like a classic. Her incredible interpretation of a song, combined with an amazing voice always under control is quite simply wonderful. On top of that you get great acting as well as danceing. The story is both sad and uplifting but touched with just enough humor. See this film, I think you will love it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie with a great climax","review":"the movie is classy,you hate James Cagney through out the movie but inthe climax he is so good.the dialogs are very well written specially inthe end.Doris day is good too.the DVD presents the movie well,its likebrand new.it shows why James Cagney s considered a wonderful actor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Me or Leave Me","review":"If you like music and gangsters this one I'm sure you will love.Doris Day plays the songstress Ruth Etting who's trying to make it in show business.

That amount of water lasted less than 30 minutes and the Zapper did not even finish cleaning two small round bathroom sinks.It is cute but ineffective, heavy, and just as noisy as the big steamer.

Described as an exercise in \\"harmonic disharmony\\" this 28 track disc sounds more like a junior high band concert. It might be nice if they ever get in tune with one another. Many of the tracks are quite short, barely a minute, so don't think that with 28 tracks you are getting a lot. After playing this several times (because sometimes certain music can grow on you) I offered this to friends who favored avant-garde type music. They didn't like it either and brought it back. I don't know if I dare to plunk my money down for another work by Foehn, after this experience.

This is quite possibly one of the worst-written books I've ever read. Apart from the numerous grammatical errors, the book is written like one of the adventures the author usually designs. The characters are fairly original, but the story focuses not on the cleric of Talona as the title would suggest, but on the party sent to destroy him. Overall, a disappointing story that I found very hard to enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept - really BAD writing!","review":"While I know that the FR novels are meant to entertain and not endure as legendary works of literature, I thought the writing in this book was very poor. Lines like \\"Marrec felt he could feel the cold ...\\" were very annoying and found throughout the book. The bad writing caused me to put this one aside. I often wondered if an editor spent any time at all on this novel.The concept overall was interesting and I will pick up future installments in the Priests series (the Rogues series was quite enjoyable).

There is no rock-star preening or inane pounding. Instead you have subtlety, nuance, grace and daring at every turn. The melifluous streams flow Arican, Hispanic and European, pouring forth as this one irrepressible world rhythmic cadence. The essential instrument for dance has always been percussion and it is here in spades, obviously, with enough inspiration to have you discard any concern for a top melody line and dropping you right into the essence of a groove.

They sacrificed babies to Moloch, though probably not on the scale Romans purported. The city of Tartessus in Spain was obliterated utterly by Carthaginians, as Carthage would be. But the error I can't countenance is the alleged Hamilcar's son Hanno Barca. Hamilcar's irreducible political rival at Carthage was Hanno the Great, and the two cordially hated each other.

I know this may not bug most people but I thought it was a let down. The films themselves are fine some bonus features for The V.I.P.S. would have been nice to have. Overall the films get high marks even if some are bad films... only thing lacking was Warner Bros. packaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use caution!","review":"I ordered this set a little over a month ago, but am just now getting around to watching it. I watched one of the movies for the very first time when I opened the set last night. The movie kept stopping and I had to keep ejecting and reinserting it to make it to the end of the movie. I tried to watch the second disc today,and it will not play altogether. I tried playing it in a DVD player, thinking maybe it was just my laptop (but the other movie I had just ordered off another Amazon site had played fine both times I watched it) but it would not even load on that one either. I am new to ordering videos online,so I will be sure to put them in and play them as soon as I get them now, as the four day window that I had to return them has long expired. I hope to have better luck with the sets of videos that I ordered off Amazon and have wrapped for my children under the tree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arrived earlier than approx. ship date - in great condition","review":"Arrived earlier than approx. ship date - in great condition.

The practice material is insufficiently detailed or clear to be of much use. There are far more useful books available today about learning chi gung.Apart from a few interesting stories about specific chi gung masters there is very little value to be found in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"love these shoes","review":"I bought these New Balance 844's in a 7W and they fit wonderfully. They are wore out now so I bought the New Balance 926's in a 7W. They are way too big and look like clown shoes on me. They make the bottom of my foot sore below my big toe. Heavy socks doesn't help. I want to get a new pair but I don't know what size to order. My Reebok's were always 6 1/2 W and fit fine. I don't understand why New Balance shoes don't fit the same in different models.

In live performance the band sometimes wavered between glorious Replacements-style r'n'r slop and pristine country harmony. This CD, however, is unwaveringly brilliant. There is a unity of purpose and focus in all the songs that calls to mind the Band's masterpiece second album and Imperial Bedroom-era Elvis Costello, all wrapped up in Louvin Brothers/Stanley Brothers-style close-harmony singing. Production by the Twangtrust (Steve Earle/Ray Kennedy)is spot-on, giving the disc a timeless aura that places it in the same context as the above-mentioned artists/albums. Overall, this is a disc that is woefully underdiscovered, even in the \\"alt-country/No Depression\\" community. Once discovered, however, it will probably not leave your player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get it while you can . . .","review":"This disc is great on so many levels and years later sounds as good as it did the first couple of times I heard it. The songs are slice of life in the South stories sung to great, catchy music that at times rocks, swings, twangs and harmonizes its way into your brain so that soon enough you'll be singing along. Some of the turns of phrase recall Elvis Costello without at all sounding like that's the intention, and the addition of the horn section just nails everything down. The brilliant Cold Steel Brace and Keep on Pushin' are two of the slower songs on the disc but some of the best alt-country ever released. This was one of the finest offerings ever to come out of Steve Earle's E-Squared label."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expectations Fulfilled","review":"You know what it is like.

Unfortunately, even with as much velcro as there is length-wise, it's not strong enough. After a few tugs on the fender, the velcro came loose.

We frequently drive on levy roads on our way to the mountains. Happy to say I haven't tested the hammer yet but I am glad to know they are there. Read the instructions for use. Some cars, mostly high end European have laminated side glass that you have to hit a few times in the same area. Be prepared they won't pop as quickly as regular safety glass. From what I've read, the hammer should reportedly penetrate laminated side glass. Easy to stow and a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Hammer 2-Pack","review":"The Life Hammer 2-Pack came through exactly as advertised. There are two emergency hammers in bright orange to be easier to spot. You keep these in your car in case you are in an accident and have to either cut the seat belt or smash out a window to escape. I have a set and thankfully never have had to use it and I gave this one as a gift to someone with a new car. We are both in an area of waterways on the side of the road and cars do fall into them occasionally. (An acquaintance didn't carry one and the car she was a passenger in was pushed into a river and she died because she couldn't get out.) I feel much safer for both of us having them in each pocket of the front doors in each car."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as Pictured","review":"A very high quality and easy to use product.

If you are looking for an emergency hammer, I highly recommend these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Satisfactory product","review":"I was surprise to see that the item was made in Netherland. On inspection the item seem to be well made, but upon taking it apart, I find the construction of it to be just satisfactory. The handle part is hollow, leaving it vulnerable to breaking. It did not come with any mounting hardware, which was a major disappointment. I subtracted one star for the construction, one star for the lack of mounting hardware, and 1 star for the price versus quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Quality","review":"This product has no heft to it. Why? The handle is hollow and seemingly made of cheap plastic. There are a myriad of other materials that would have made this a better life-saving tool. It is much too expensive for the cheap materials used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not do Windshields and Wimpy","review":"Disappointed at just how light weight this hammer is. No heft to it as though it came out of a kiddy play tools set.Shocked when I read the material provided and learned it does not work on windshields.Just think upside down in a gully, both doors squeezed by dirt and the only window for escape is the windshield...I am putting them in the wife and my car but am definitely looking to replace them with something of substance at the earliest. This is not a product that gives me a sense of security for an emergency situation. I tied a micro light to the handle and taped it in place, so I now have a wrist strap and light. There was no tie down location on the Life Hammer for this. The blade did cut one inch climbing webbing under tension. It may actually work on a side window. I am going to a junk yard to find out for sure.Bottom line - I want a hammer I can break a windshield with and then bang bent metal out of the way and the life hammer is not a tool for that job."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hope never to use it, but I am SO glad I have it","review":"This item gives such peace of mind! I think every car should be equipped with one. The Life Hammer has a tool to break auto glass, and near the base of the handle is a tool to cut seat belts. It is supposed to be mounted within reach of the driver, and that is my one small complaint - the shape of the hammer's container makes it hard to mount as the directions suggest. I have mine in my glovebox, which is still easily accessible and gets rid of the mounting issue. Apart from that, it's a very well designed tool and I'm thankful someone came up with it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy duty and high quality","review":"Hopefully I'll never have the opportunity to actually use one of these, but I feel secure that it would get the job done. It's hefty and appears to be well constructed. The extra peace of mind in having one of these stashed in your car is worth every penny, and it could even save your life! Would recommend this product and purchase again."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I had known before I wouldn't have bought it","review":"Uncorrect desciption.

I was a big fan of Mary Margaret Daughtridge and Jill Monroe, but after reading this book, Ms. Regina Brewer is at the very top of my list! This book isn't like those typical oversexualize romance novels. It's much much more. There's romance, tension, humor and realism to back up the great storyline. And if you're wondering, no, this is not another G.I. Jane story to boot. This is the real deal and the characters are so interesting and appealing I could not put this book down. I couldn't be happier reading this book over and over again due to the fact that it keeps you hooked chapter after chapter.

Maybe it's the mood I was in, but I didn't enjoy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing read.","review":"This book was so mediocre, it's hard to know where to start. The female protangantist wasn't quite likable. At times, she seemed too stupid to live. She's a journalist who broadcasts all the police leads that she comes across (even though this comprises the investigation of a serial killer) under the guise of \\"if I don't report it someone else will\\" - I believe this lack of morals is why everyone is disgusted with the media today. The ending was surprising - I was clearly surprised that all the loose ends would be so unbelievably tied up. Below par for Miss Robards."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I agree with the other reviewers who touched on the fact that Ms. Robards dragged the story at a snail's pace by cramming even the most insignificant of sentences full of ridiculous descriptions. Considering she took forever building up the suspense, the ending seemed outrageously short.I did like certain aspects of the plot, I even liked the main characters and their relationship development but boy did this novel just not live up to its potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Moving","review":"This is a great read if you are looking for action, romance, and suspense. The author keeps you on the edge of your chair, and the plot twists keep you guessing until the very end. The characterizations and relationships are well done, and the ghost aspects of the story are very intriguing.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"DFK","review":"This is my first book CD that I have listend to from Karen Robards and I was very disapointed. The book did not keep my attention and I thought that there was too much explainations on just everything. I do think that Joyce Bean did a wonderful job of narrating and she saved the book for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soft Porn and Silly","review":"I think what killed the book for me is when one of the characters had their hands handcuffed behind their back and yet still managed to reach into the front pocket of their pants.Soft Porn? Some of the descriptions were a bit too much, many of them focussed on Nicky's upper body. Nicky seemed to be in heat throughout most of the book!Authors - Adjectives are good when used judiciously. However using adjectives to modify other adjectives does not mean you have command of the language.This book had a variety of plot potholes that should have been patched during the final edit. Shame on you editor.Finally I would describe the ending of this book as probably the best example of deus ex machina ever.Let see, Southerners check, girlfriends with kids check, pet pigs check, island check, extended family all under one roof check, psychics check, smartass reporter from Chicago check, hunky chief of police with checkered past check.

The range is also increased with these bands. These bands give the hunting slingshot its real meaning. If put it on improperly, it's performance will be greatly hindered.

I've been reading everything i can get my hands on about her and her life. Her voice and songs are amazing and it's funny how many of her songs now that i've discovered her, i have heard many times before.This CD is wonderful and has many of the songs that i've heard as a child and now becoming extremely found of. What a joy it must have been to see this amazing tragic women in person. All of her songs are so heart felt and give me goose-bumps.

This is a wonderful album to start if you don't already have any of Piaf's recordings, because it features many of the songs that are used in the movie, with the exception of Padam Padam, which won't be missing from my collection for much longer!

Vive les Francophones!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Voice of the Sparrow","review":"\\"The Voice of the Sparrow\\" is an excellent compilation of Edith Piaf songs. This French torch singer from the 1940's who sang of prostitutes, love and the Paris slums has a strong, powerful voice as is evident in such songs as \\"Milord\\", \\"Comme Moi\\", \\"Hymne à L'Amour\\" and \\"Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien.\\" Each song is clear as a bell and makes one appreciate the richness of the French language. Though many may not understand the lyrics, the emotion Piaf projects more than makes up for it. It may even prompt you to learn this romantic language. Every Edith Piaf fan has their favorite song. My favorite is \\"L'Accordeoniste\\", a song about a prostitute who loses her lover, an accordionist, in the Second World War. However, each song on this CD is unique and wonderful in its own way. Perhaps the most famous song in this compilation is \\"Milord\\", which is about a prostitute who comforts a brokenhearted rich Englishman. I highly recommended this collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"17 great songs.","review":"Edith has such a beautiful and clear voice. You don't have to understand the language to appreciate it. It's relaxing to enjoy and listen to while driving. A good compilation of all her best known songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A haunting voice from WW2 era.","review":"I bought this as a present for my girlfriend. Edith Piaf has a very haunting voice. You'll recognize a lot of her music from WW2 movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Voice of the Sparrow","review":"I was looking for a sound more representative of Piaf in an intimate Paris nightclub performance. Too much orchestra, and recording quality was disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great","review":"As a science teacher I thought this would be a great resource. It is weak for h.s, maybe it would be good for elementary."},{"rating":"2","title":"THEY ARE SO BEAUTIFUL!!!","review":"This silverware is really pretty. I won't give it the max. 5 star rate because they are a little bit heavy for my taste. But for the value, I believe they are truly a jewel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful debut.","review":"Their 2nd album may have become more popular, but this will always be my favorite. It came out my senior year of high school, and I can't count the times I sat in my car at night, in the park with a cigarette, listening to this album. I was probably wishing she was singing to me. It's hard to think of comparisons, but if you crossed a mellow \\"Cowboy Junkies\\", with a psychedelic \\"Verve\\", you'd be pretty close. \\"Halah\\" is a great opener, and the song that made me pick this up. I actually caught the video on MTVs 120 minutes. \\"Give You My Lovin'\\" and \\"Free\\" are other favorites of mine. Their two following albums are both as great, as is \\"Hope Sandovals\\" solo album \\"Bavarian Fruit Bread\\". All of them go well with incense, rain, and candles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent Album Cover!","review":"I really wanted to like this CD, but it really is dull. I recommend any of their other albums for the casual listener (of which I am...obviously) and leave this one for die-hard fans only.

I thought I just got a lemon, but even the replacement was bad. The first song (and my favorite Mazzy Star song) had several skips and there are pops throughout the entire record. And it's not just She Hangs Brightly, my copy of So Tonight That I Might See has similiar issues. I've never had problems with records on the Plain label before, but they missed the mark on these reissues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Re-recordings","review":"This album does not contain original recordings. I compared \\"Yakety Yak\\" to the version on the \\"Stand By Me\\" Soundtrack album. THAT one has the real ORIGINAL RECORDING. This album has re-recordings from a vocal group who may contain members of the original Coasters, but it is very obvious that these are NOT the same ORIGINAL RECORDINGS. Even the album cover artwork is awful and bogus. The image has NOTHING to do with The Coasters. Don't be fooled, as I was.By the way, the aforementioned \\"Stand By Me\\" Soundtrack album is a wonderful source for a nice mix of great Oldies, with outstanding sound and TRUE ORIGINAL RECORDINGS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful way to capture the best of Christmas year by year!","review":"A great way to note those special things that happen only once a year at Christmas!

So much of this info I wish I had for all the past years but can never seem to remember or find...but that won't be the case this year and beyond!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There are much better translations out there!","review":"You really should consider other options than this particular translation. The only buyers of this book are the students she requires to buy it. Just something to put on a CV and claim sales that she generated by requiring everyone teaching a mythology course in her department (she is the department head) to put her book on the required reading lists. You're not missing anything at all by saving yourself some money and fine a free copy of the work. After all, it's a few thousand years old and I doubt homer is losing his cut of the proceeds."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE RESULTS I NEEDED!!!","review":"This is my first review on Amazon but have bought many many items. My wife is becoming a recycling guru so we started to really focusing on recycling all of our cans. Before we bought this product we were sitting the cans down and just stomping on them to do it - I CALLED IT THE CAVEMAN WAY. I purchased this product over the other ones because I did not want to mount it on the wall. It is simple to work, has a great design, and makes things so much easier. If you are looking for a can crusher that allows you to crush cans while sitting on the couch, this one will allow you to do that (don't get me wrong, I don't sit on the couch and crush cans all day long, but if I did THIS IS YOUR CRUSHER).Hope this review helps in your buying decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BOTHER..... The 4 buck version is better!","review":"This item is horrible to anchor, as well as use for anyone who isnt HULK. My children wished to crush cans for a recycling project. The design seemed great. However, the materials used were shoddy and the cans never stayed in one place. Finally, we bought a curshed at Harbor Freight for 4 bucks. It works GREAT with no flaws! I dont blame the vendor one bit. However, I have yet to receive my refund......of 36 bucks including shipping!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this can crusher","review":"Product was received in a box much larger than required. There was no packing material, no packing slip, no intallation instructions, and no installation hardware. The product is poorly designed, and you can not simply insert a can and crush as described by the manufacturer. If you put a slight crimp in the can to facilitate easier crushing, the can gets forced out the rear of the crusher and splits open (torn) creating very sharp edges. If you do not crimp the can, in most cases, when you attempt to crush it, the crushing mechanism forces the can back at you. Very poorly designed, and had I received the approriate paperwork with shipment, I would have returned for credt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing parts when received","review":"It was received with a missing part (the pin that should connect the arm and base is missing so it doesn't crush-just pushes the handle up and you cannot apply pressure). There was no broken piece in the box so it was shipped defective. I have contacted the vendor about a replacement so I will see if there is a quick resolution and follow up. As others said-it doesn't make it too much easier to crush the cans-you still need to apply a bit of pressure with your hands - but it beats using your feet and having to bend down over and over to pick them up when doing full bags."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sweet tale but a weak novel","review":"This novella is the weakest of Mark Harris's Henry Wiggens books. It is to be read by those who have to read everything in the series but compared to The Southpaw and Bang the Drum Slowly it comes up short. Weak in plot and in inventivness but strong in sugar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, bought it for a friend","review":"I bought this for a friend who does not have a computer. She loved it. She had it on vhs but wanted it on a dvd"},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange.......","review":"This set is very much a mixed bag. The first problem is that the discs are presented out of order. If you know anything about the chronology of WW2, you can figure out their correct order.Ike's son, Gen. John, provides linking intros to the \\"videos\\" as he calls them. The \\"videos\\" are actually WW2 footage with narration. I really can't tell if they used government produced documentaries, or if this is just an old television show about WW2 (similar to VICTORY AT SEA).The footage used is a mixed bag as well, some of it looks great, though. I would only recommend this for the most ardent WW2 enthusiast."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT I REALLY WANTED WAS A NEW COLLECTION OF PINKWATER'S","review":"NPR columns, particularly the ones when he was looking atbeing a person-of-size in America, but since no new ones havecome out, I picked this up as one of his most recent young adult novels. I expect much of this is autobiographical but it is very funny and wise and has a two-page reading list that I believe mayactually BE a list of the books Pinkwater read in High School. Chances are if you are even reading this review, you have already decided to buy this book. So, go ahead."},{"rating":"2","title":"I suppose I should wait until my head stops swimming...","review":"I finished reading this book not but half an hour ago, and it's one of the most amazing things i've ever read.

It is much more than a fashion book. The only lack is that it was written way back when, and it needs to be updated into 2003 color charts and the way women wear amkeup and clothing styles. This book is a classic, though.The concepts are timeless, as is the general advice.I appreciated the Christian influence of the book. Very tasteful and appropriate.I particularly likes the advice about how to dress parts of your body you want to hide. I have not seen this advice anywhere else. She looks beautiful on the cover of her book, but blue eyeshadow is definitely out of style now. Also, no one wears bow-tie secretary blouses anymore either."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.2 Prog Rockers Live","review":"Supertramp was/is one of the only bands that i like outside the hard rock/Metal genre. This cd is why. The distinct differences of the Hodgson/Davies come accross great here. The atmosphere is nice and the keyborads sound more crisp here than the studio versions. Was nice to get this and remember the late '70's with these gems. From \\"School\\" to the closing \\"Crime of the Century\\" this cd shows Supertramp in their peek. Great stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Live Concert!","review":"This is one of the greatest live album I've ever listened.

Just make sure the tub or surface is dry and they will hold your dog in place while you soap them up and rinse them off.

They do not stay on wet, dry, porcelain, linoleum, cast iron surfaces...anythinh.. I don't think I have ever been so disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! --SWITCH!","review":"I enjoy listening to this album a lot. From the start, the DJs kick off some very catchy beats and samples, and they just won't quit. Their live shows must also rock, and I definately want to see one before I die. This album contains more than just the usual beat mixing and turntable tricks. On most house music CDs, the DJ(s) would mix similar beats and styles the whole way through, but Richard \\"Humpty\\" Vission and Bad Boy Bill never mix the same beat twice, and their styles seem limitless. Anyone who does not like house music because of its repetative and monotonous nature, would probably change their mind when they hear this CD. Even though the music is repetative, the DJs keep the music changing very quickly with perfect timing, keeping the energy high all the time. I have not yet gotten bored over this CD, and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes to dance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Album Gone Bad","review":"I've had this album before and rock it hard, but I haven't touched this purchase since I got it. I was utterly disappointed. All tracks with the exception of 3 songs were only 15 - 30 sec. long. Imagine my shock when an album that originally lasted aboput two hours only lasted about 45 mins! I would have at least liked to have known that I was going to get someone's burned idea of The House Connection and not the actual album. I think this is info that should be posted in the item description. So Sad..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dated hard house CD","review":"Excellent mixing, lots of different tracks, classic hard hosue CD. BUT, a lot of the tracks are dated sounding and some have cheesy vocal samples that take away from the quality of the driving hard house sound (cheesy as in cheesy bad, not cheesy good). The sound of this CD is less energetic and more funky than other CDs. Its OK. I might have loved it in 1996, but its kind of boring now."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"Nan Goldin captures what it's like to be human in a way that no one else can.

But that should say something about it's memorability factor. I came across the book while looking for another here on Amazon and was immediately reminded of how much I loved Festival. There are so many fresh elements to this romance. For example, the hero and heroine fall in love before they ever meet face to face. Telephone calls...sexy telephone calls, allow them to get to know one another and enjoy each other's good qualities before physical factors come into play (What a nice change!!)A time-travel and romance saga is the best description for Festival.

It totally ignores the complexity of stuttering and the vast research that has been done on the subject. It shows no understanding of the stuttering experience. Readers should not get their hopes up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of Date Ideas About Stuttering","review":"According to the author, stuttering is due to the fact that the people with stutter did not think first before speaking. If they think first about what they wanted to speak then they won't stutter. This is an out of date idea. The Stutter Control Drill ask us to see a letter/numeral, saying it in your mind, saying it aloud and typing it on a typewriter or computer keyboard is a ridiculous idea of mastering the elements of fluent speech.

Good sound quality.----McCoy's studio trio sessions for Impulse--INCEPTION,REACHING FORTH,and NIGHTS OF BALLADS AND BLUES from the early 60's are all great too. His style changed after these recordings were made as his style became more chordal than single note.---- For more Charle Mariano see Shelly Manne- SWINGING SOUNDS with Stu Williamson on trumpet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great.","review":"I've had this set for about two years and everything is still working great.

Books such as Professional Dreamer, Law of Attraction, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tired Retread","review":"Not only is this book lacking an original thought, it is not even written in a sprightly fashion. The test is interrputed with trite quotes from unknown and uninteresting individuals notated by first name only, ie, \\"Annabelle\\" \\"Eva\\".If you are really interested in the laws of attraction and manifestation, read anyting by Catherine Ponder, Jerry and Esther Hicks (the Abraham people), Joe Vitale or Excuse Me Your Life is Waiting by Lynn Grabhorn."},{"rating":"1","title":"I EXPECTED MORE FROM THIS BOOK","review":"Much too simplistic and not alot of meat. Talk about many topics but not deep enough.Sometimes she says we should look for a friend in people who have same interest with us. Common sense. But I expected she will use a law of attraction to tell people how to attract great friends and people around us in our lives.Than you ask yourself a question: should you be using law of attraction or a common sense. I did not like that many pages are filled with big letters and quoatations. But that is only my opinion. She deserves a credit for a book, but she failed to deliver a message. She talks about abundance, law of attraction, and many other things but just simplistic. Not much meat inside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Money.","review":"My wife and I enjoy this book very much. Every week we select a recipe from the book for our church ' Israel Class '.It is very easy to follow the directions in the book.We stongly recommend this book to anyone serious about Jewish cooking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time to read","review":"This is the second in Lawrence Block's Matt Scudder series though it was the 3rd book to be published.As usual Block's Matt Scudder is very real with human failings, a good insight and struggling to overcome them. The plot itself is incidental to his struggles. That is what sets apart the book.A blackmailer gives Scudder an envelope with details on 3 of his blackmail victims-not to be opened until his death. The blackmailer gets fished out of the river and Scudder opens the envelope to decide which of the 'blackmailees' is the murderer.Block paints Scudder with the sardonic quality of Phillip Marlowe and the hard boiled explosiveness of Dashiell Hammett to make him one of the most memorable fictional detectives of our times- perhaps of all times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read","review":"Overall I enjoyed the book. As pointed out in another review with a slightly lower rating, Scudder demonstrates his apathy towards a morally depraved criminal but unlike the other reviewer, I don't see this as a flaw in the book, rather as a flaw in the protaganist. In fact, the subplot is Scudder attempting to define his moral code, and in a very well written manner, seemingly panicing that he may not really have one.My only criticism is that I enjoy a bit quicker moving story. Personal preference is all, but why I didn't give it five stars.If you like the darker suspense genre with great character development, this is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent early Lawrence Block Scudder mystery","review":"This was one of the earlier Scudder books by Lawrence Block and I read it as one of my first. I was most impressed and recommend it highly. Some of his books are better - the older ones are better than the newer efforts. This is early Scudder with just the right amount of alcohol comments and a hard core mystery which will delight the usual Lawrence Block fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scudder-ific!","review":"Lawrence Block, besides being the acknowledged master of the mystery form, is also a great chronicler of New York City. \\"A Time to Murder and Create\\" is a more than satisfactory mystery where Matthew Scudder, ex-cop, part-time investigator, full-time drinker tries to find the killer of his \\"friend\\" and client, \\"Spinner\\". On another level, the book is a nostalgic (for me) look at the mean streets of New York in the 1970s. Where there are now Gaps, Starbucks and Banana Republics were once dives and houses of ill-repute. I am glad all that suffering is gone but, for better and worse, those were the days of my youth.My only qualm has to do with the length; it was very short. Then again, perhaps Block was only just getting acquainted with his relatively new creation; the later Scudder novels feel and are more fleshed out. Still, this is a great piece of mystery mind-candy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As always, an excellent read.","review":"Lawrence Block's third Scudder mystery holds just as much bite today as it did over thirty years ago, and still holds its own against newer contributions to the genre. With a truly genuine idea and unpredictable plot twists, the reader is left wanting more after the last page is read. Indeed, I was unsure up to the last sentence whether another twist was going to unfold or whether Block was going to leave things as they stood. A superb addition to the Scudder series. I'll definitely buy the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prettier in person!","review":"This tie looked a little drab, but matched a lot of my wardrobe so I thought I would try it. For a buck, why not? It's MUCH prettier than it looks in the photo! The leaves are clearer and the colors brighter and sharper, but not TOO bright. It's not \\"cartoony\\" at all. My husband even asked if he could borrow it sometime! A major bargain, and I am thinking of ordering more for gifts - it's that nice of a tie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show, Format is a bust tho!","review":"This show is quite funny, and really enjoyable.Its about a boy into dating Sims who one day agrees to a demon contract and comes across a soul capture.Its quite a tale.This format of bluray (tho I'm not sure if its on the DVD copy) where at the end of each episode it goes into a black screen and plays credits of who made what , the voice actors. This really ruins the experience of watching threw the episodes on the disc. It could of been formatted better to play after the last episode on the disc instead of contently repeating it.Also the start up screen is a bit lacking, and dull. It looks like a old DVD screen, and does not take use of any bluray features at all other then the navigation.Other then that I do recommend picking this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and short","review":"Nice series.It is nice to watch this when you just want to relax a bit as this series never gets too serious or dramatic.The main characters are nice as they are a bit unique.

But for those of us who don't want to blunder into something where women are basically worthless, take note.This is a story about a boy who takes advantage of girls emotions, and often their bodies, as if it were a game. The aim of the game is to get them to fall for him head over heels, after which he dumps them and heads onto his next mark, over and over. There is a halfhearted excuse given for the boy's actions, but it doesn't ring true.What does ring true is the way this anime depicts men as senseless, ruthless players, after women for nothing but a little fleeting fun. Worse is how women in it are nothing except for game pieces, that need to be emptied of their innocence, emotion, and \\"treasure\\" before they are forgotten about."},{"rating":"2","title":"disc was not secure!!!","review":"one of my disc was not secure when it came but beside's that everything ok that's why i gave a 4 star"},{"rating":"2","title":"Textbook","review":"This book is being used for a graduate course on heaven,he'll and afterlife; great text for the class.

Shot in the very early days of his return from India, the film captures Dass apparently trying to turn a group of Caucasian drop-outs into Hindus For A Day. Dass' primary message is that Raja Yoga can give you an LSD-high without the expense and illegality. The film makers try to back that claim with low-tech attempts at psychedelic visuals that merely wind up looking ludicrous. Hippies doing shoulder stands appear no more mystical when projected upside down.Evolution of a Yogi would be good for a laugh if it wasn't for the $2.99 rental price, which is exorbitant for a 28 minute short."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very stimulating","review":"Most of the information about Astronomy was familiar to me, but it was interesting to get a refresher.

It was a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"This boat sinks!","review":"Adapted from the Off-Broadway play and filled with a solid cast of veteran character actors, this disjointed and quirky film never really gets any footing and flounders to an unspectacular ending.Many Indie films feature odd and quirky characters and situations not usually found in mainstream films --- and this is typically a good thing. Unfortunately, the pace in \\"Jack Goes Boating\\" is so slow and deliberate that any unique character traits and situations become mired in the muddy text and lack of activity.It's a shame that Philip Seymour Hoffman had to make his directoriral debut with this stinker of a film. Also, he has played the forlorn sad sack too many times and therefore has nothing we haven't seen him do before with this character of Jack. The film's title references the lead characters ability to overcome his fears and face new things in life. Regretably, after sitting through 91 minutes of this film, you won't care."},{"rating":"1","title":"...and Yaleburton takes a nap.","review":"Philip Seymour Hoffman takes his stab at directing -- and what we get is the \\"quirky yet casual\\" storytelling that typifies indie movies these days. Cheesy shot selection, ironic editing, and poor direction of actors all scream out \\"hipster\\" with each scene. Pretty painful. One extra star because it does not feature Miley Cyrus."},{"rating":"1","title":"WEIRD PREMISE","review":"Any character who is as socially dysfunctional as the one Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays in this film would not be able to work as a limo driver. The film's premise is off-putting right from the start. And then it goes downhill from there. It doesn't establish a tone - is it a comedy, is it serious, what is it? It's kind ofcreepy, actually, and I had better things to do with an hour and half of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left not knowing what to think","review":"I enjoy a good movie now and then, and when I read the plot of this movie I was looking forward to seeing it. I love romance movies, so when I read that it was about two people looking for love and being set up with each other by friends, I was excited about watching it. As I began to watch it, it became more and more difficult to keep track of the actual plot. There was a lot of going from seeing inside the thoughts of Jack to seeing what was going on while watching his thoughts. I did not appreciate the purchase of drugs or the use of them being shown in the movie. I was mostly disappointed by both the acting and the overall plot because when seeing the star cast I expected more of them. Seemed to be a C-List movie made by A-list actors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Watch on a First Date!!!","review":"Even at 84 minutes this movie was slow and boring. You would think the Director Philip Seymour Hoffman would have required the main character played by Philip Seymour Hoffman do a better job with his hair in the movie! How ironic the two male leads are doing drugs and the apply for the MTA. Wait until they fail their drug test, won't go from driving a limo to driving a bus!!! Sad as one couple are breaking up another couple are finding each other. The only comic relief was Connie telling Jack that she though his was sexy!!! I guess there is a reason this was an off-broadway play and maybe the Producers of this movie should have left it off-Broadway! In the extras they even mentioned how some plays don't make it onto film, how prophetic you are about this film. It just doesn't make it on film."},{"rating":"1","title":"DREARY","review":"I'm not sure what the other reviewers find so amusing about this film, to me it seemed very dreary and depressing. The acting is top-notch and I really liked the characters, but definitely felt the story was a major bummer.If you are a big fan of Philip Seymour Hoffman, this DVD has some extras that detail how his original play went from the stage to the screen so it might be worth adding to your collection. If you haven't seen it before, though, give it a rent before purchasing to make sure you \\"get\\" the humor. Apparently I am just not on that wavelength!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A film with Philip Seymour Hoffman written all over it","review":"Philip Seymour Hoffman makes his directorial debut with Jack Goes Boating. While watching this film it was easy to see the influence of Phillip Seymour Hoffman's personality and acting style in the characters and film's pace, mood, and message. The dialogue and characters' mannerisms are humorous at times (especially the final date scene), although the film has an overall subtle melancholy running throughout. The film moves a bit slow, with a heavy focus on dialogue and the character's emotional states and self-esteem. The entire film has that eccentric feel of New York City.If you enjoy watching Philip Seymour Hoffman in his acting roles, then you'll enjoy this film. The characters are very unique and quirky. The story has a few unexpected happenings and the final scene will make you laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than most artists, junk for sabbath though...","review":"It's an okay record but it cant compare to any of sabbaths original 8 albums or even heaven and hell or the mob rules, it is better than eternal idol. I mean its not horbbile but when you compare tony martin to OZZY, please. Ozzy wipes the floor with him easily. Its good music if you like late 80s hard rock.

I don't know, you think they're selling out on \\"Feels Good to Me.\\" That's a hypothetical question, of course."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Sabbath's 2nd best album EVER!!!!","review":"Tony Martin has done it this time. Tyr is a metal masterpiece. Buy this, I guarantee that it won't leave your CD player for months. Every song flows together perfectly in what is Sabbath's 2nd best album ever (next to Headless Cross). Many people who don't like this one probably expected it to sound like Ozzy-era Sabbath. It doesn't. It is melodic and powerful. I can't name the best tracks since every song is equally fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, Terrible album!!!","review":"Please don't waste your money on a terrible Black Sabbath album that has only 1 original member, the desperate Tony Iommi. Although the Norse mythology is attractive, the songs are poorly written."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is as bad as it gets","review":"Without a doubt, this is the worst album ever to bear the mighty Black Sabbath name. 'Feels Good to Me' was an extremely poor choice as a single. Tony Iommi can still rock and rule the doom metal world, but the songs were weak. I do not like the Tony Martin era at all, Cross Purposes is the only solid album they managed to do with Tony Martin."},{"rating":"1","title":"TYR More like TURD.","review":"C'mon people this album SUCKS! I love Sabbath and no I amnot one of those \\"If it don't have Ozzy it's not Sabbathcrying kid\\" but I just do not feel anything for this album.I like Martin,he is a very good singer and I feel The EternalIdol is a fantastic album. This however is flat too me.AnnoMundi and Valhalla are perhaps the best songs on here andthats sad for they are filler tunes at best.If you likeIommi solo projects than buy THE ETERNAL IDOL-HEADLESS CROSSand Seventh Star(though Stranger to love makes me ill)andstay away from this TURD.The fact Amazon does not sell thisanymore and you have to purchase from private dealers say'sit all.

I suggest this album to all metal fans"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disppointment..","review":"Quite a let down when you compare with other Sabbath albums..not just the ones from the Ozzy Era but also one's like Headless Cross.I have listened to it once or maybe twice since I picked it up but there's nothing that distinctly would qualify as heavy or the traditional Sabbath sound.The ones that I might say were better than the rest of the tracks were-AnnoMundi,The Battle of Tyr & Heaven in Black.This album for some reasons seems to have just come out for maybe want of a Sabbath album.I'll have to agree with the majority out here that if you're looking for a Sabbath album pick up anyone from the Ozz / Dio days or maybe go for Headless Cross(compared to this even Forbidden would sound better).Musically and lyrically speaking it's weak..almost like having a pint of beer with water..no buzz is what you get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flashes of Greatness","review":"Just flashes. Anno Mundi (4/5) being the best song here and what a great kick-off. The Sabbath Stones (3.5/5) is quite good also, but all the rest MAY grow on you, or in the case of tracks like 'Feels Good To Me' (0/5) they are throw-aways the first time you hear them. Sad too because the production is generally great. All the levels are in place, Tony sounds pretty good, it just comes down to the songs... they just don't amount to much making this more of an EP if you take out the good ones. If you are looking for life after Dio, there isn't much here. Better than Born Again for sure, but not even fit to tie Sabotages shoes."},{"rating":"1","title":"The second worst Tony Martin album","review":"I'm rating it two stars not because this album is that bad, but because, comparing it to the other Tony Martin's Sabbath albums, this is the second worst by a large margin (\\"losing\\" this distinction only to FORBIDDEN) Production values are high, but the songs and riffs are simply not memorable at all, they all mix with each other, the songs have no identity, it seems Iommi was really uninspired.Anyway, for such a low price and if you're a Sabbath completist, this is a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"working for me","review":"I have melasma from my pregnancy and this product has worked well...it's not totally faded, but I can really tell a difference in my skin.

This accounts to some degree, not necessarily completely, for his jangly--clangorous even--, nasal tone and how markedly clipped his notes are. In any case, he makes a very unpleasant sound.Despite the presence of Chico Hamilton and Ron Carter (there are no melody instruments other than Mr. Szabo's electric guitar), this record is less a jazz record than a surfer-rock record. The low point is the Sonny Bono song \\"Bang, Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)\\", an awful song even by Bono's standards. Mr. Szabo attempts to sing this one (and fails miserably), I'm very sorry to report. He also overdubs his jangly nasal guitar here, apparently oblivious to the resulting contrapuntally random cacophony.The record gets worse as it goes along, but its only cut of interest is the rambling \\"Gypsy Queen\\", and that only because Santana went on to record a much more coherent and appealing version of the tune. The background yelping doesn't help matters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. Ed","review":"These movies were great for everyone in the house to watch.

Not solely because I am a big fan of Melissa, Mario and Markie but because the movie has a different twist to it. It was very entertaining, funny, full of sassiness and romance. Of course the end it's pretty predictable but the ride was awesome. All the characters are very well written and the cast selection, I believe was excellent. As far as the Snowglobe, though I believe it to be more of the unrealistic, sappy romance that chick flicks are saturated with, I am partial to Christina's acting. This story line has been done one too many times. Nonetheless, I really enjoyed the interaction of her family. From the cast, as side from Christina, I think the best acting came from the least know actors/actresses. And come on you can not beat the 2 for 1 special.

There is just _nothing_ special about this record...it's predictable and BORING.I almost died laughing while listening to this album; the lyrics are simply absurd. Any person who is at all critical of music could not take this album seriously...All of the raving reviews must be by 15 yearolds with ears that are not mature enough to be critical.

We learn of Homer's old barbershop quartet, Mr. Burns' old teddy bear, Bobo, Marge's gambling problems, and the appeal of the phrase, \\"I didn't do it\\".As usual, this season is full of jokes that will have you rolling on the floor, and are definitely reccomended for everyone to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Simpsons Season 5","review":"I like Seymour ?

Keep it up, Fox, and don't be afraid to release the seasons even quicker!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bake him away toys!","review":"I just wanted to say this set is worth the price of admission just for the episode Cape Feare.\\"Argh...

Now it immediately jumps to the new menu.COMMENTARY is the best commentary I've ever heard on any DVD, and they do it for all the episodes. Think of that, 22 episodes at approx 22 minutes each. About 7-8 hours of commentary! You really get to know the people involved in making these, and they really do enjoy their work.The only complaint, I WISH they would make the sound 5.1, and allow put the commentators on the right/left channels, and the show in the center, so I can control the mix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing DVD Set","review":"This set has fantastic video quality, menus, extras, and episodes.

Many of the great, funny episodes are on this season. It has more laughs than previous seasons. I find that each season gets progressivly better, and this is the best set in release. If you are only going to buy one set, I reccomend this one because of the quantity and quality of the episodes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't believe it!","review":"I ordered these DVDs used from GAMESNGAMES and was wowed. I don't usually buy DVDs used because I'm wary of their condition, but I took a chance because my husband loves The Simpson's and we are on a budget. I was blown away when I opened my mailbox to see this set a full 7 days early! That NEVER happens. I was a little disappointed to see the dust jacket and inserts were missing, that was not made clear to me hence the 4 star rating, and it was an obviously loved set, but the DVDs themselves look fine. I will update my review if necessary after we watch them. I highly recommend this seller and will be buying from them again. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"best season of all time","review":"This season is not only the pinnacle of the simpson's humor, but of humor in general. I've never seen or heard such rich comedy in my life. Nothing comes close, the only things that do are obvious rip offs. Seriously, its called simpson's humor, it was invented in the early nineties, and every decent sitcom since has used it. Unfortunately now the simpson's no longer do, but that's another review for another time."},{"rating":"2","title":"keep the commentery!!!","review":"What makes all the simpson dvds so great is the commentary on every episode, it tells you so much about how each episode is made and the story behind it.

So I say just stick out the wait, that way when they come out, they'll be packed with as much extras as possible"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to Find Fabulous Product!","review":"I've been using this product for a decade and not only is it smell free after a short while, but smells good when you first spray it.

It is one of my own favorite puzzles as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing entry into history","review":"I started reading this book for the love for history. There are many facets of history, specially Indian history, that are NOT easily available. And with every page, I found something new about 'the white mughals'.When I picked up this book, I was amazed at the size of the book! However once I started reading this book, it was the history weaved in that amazed me more.. Worth reading!I have picked up William Dalrymple's next book to read.. Do watch this space for the next review on 'The Last Mughal'.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great history","review":"This is a fine book set in the period when India came under threat from Napoleon until Nelson intervened at the battle of The Nile. When young English boys were taken out to India for education prior to their careers there it is hadly surprising that some went native. But it was one thing to take a local mistress, quite another to marry a princess. A tragic love story results. The author is clearly more in sympathy with the old policy of The East India Company which banned Christian missionary activity. He regrets the changes brought about by Wilberforce and his Clapham Sect friends which changed official policy towards religion."},{"rating":"1","title":"JointMD For Mild Arthritis","review":"After using two bottles of JointMD for severe osteoarthritis throughout my body, I found little or no relief from arthritic pain.

Olivia, the heroine of the first novel is actually well written and develops the character as well as a delivers a reasonably well written series of sexual vignettes, numerous bondage/discipline scenes and some real eroticism. The second novel (Lucy) is an execrable piece of trash, again dealing with the female abduction/submission scenario. This portion of the book utilizes the time \\"honored\\" scenario of \\"humiliate, beat, rape\\" and then the \\"beat the woman, then humiliate her\\" followed by the usual violent rapine scenes. This part of the book is trash, written poorly and only worth shredding. Personally, I tossed it in the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous, Delicious & Gorgeous","review":"I've had this book for nearly 15 years....the pictures, the recipes and food are an absolute sensation!I love how the recipes are divided into seasons.

Like others mentioned, there are a few tracks that are like Bent's previous stuff and they're great but not as fantastic as some of their earlier, amazing singles. If you love the other 3 \\"released\\" cd's like I do, then this one will be the weakest of them. The first cd had some cheesy songs w/ cheesy \\"guy\\" singing but it kinda worked for me and had great beats and slide guitars & stuff in the music to make up for it. And they were just plain fun tracks inbetween absolutely amazing ones. Half this cd, which is under 50 mins., is pretty darn good and the other half is kinda crap. Where Ariels and the other cd's have me coming back for more listens, I find myself not really caring about this cd as much. I still have faith in them though- they'll come back with a better cd. -- I hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"Bent has produced some eerily beatiful tracks that I've come to love.

Great work like all previous - interesting...highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment from a fantastic group.","review":"This CD is profoundly disappointing. Gone are the wonderful, wacky, chill-out tunes like \\"Donkeys in Heaven,\\" or that song where the cat meows through it. Fully half the tracks here sound like Oasis outtakes, with a lead singer who'd be booed off a karaoke stage. Banal lyrics are repeated over and over again until you run screaming for the \\"off\\" button. Maybe three tracks are reminiscent of the Bent we know and love, but they're not worth wandering through the dross.I don't know what happened -- if, like with Wham!, the talented part of the group left -- but this is a major disappointment from a wonderful group."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF?!?","review":"This album is a total MESS...unfortunately, it can be too much of a shock when an artist evolves into something completely incomprehensible, and I most certainly DID NOT get this album at all.

This is the entire 8-volume set, wherein Mr. Spurgeon had made his insightful comments on every single verse of which David ever spoke in the Bible. Perhaps some just want the 3-volume set, which is very nice. However, upon finding out about this excellent and very reasonably priced \\"exhaustive\\" set Spurgeon wrote, I immediately ordered a set for both my pastor and myself. It's a great buy, a beautiful set of books, written by one of the most respectable and trustworthy Christian writers and scholars of the 19th century. The greater reference set of the two when you or your pastor want to delve into the depths of King David's sayings and writings.

The book I needed was Syntax, by Andrew Carnie. The Carnie text was fascinating, and gave a good enough balance of depth and translations for laymen that I was able to keep up in the class (I'm not a wiz in this subject).Analyzing English Grammar, on the other hand, barely scratched the surface. I tried to use it as a supplemental study book, for which it proved useless, and I tried to read it for fun, but the large print and shallow treatment of the material left me feeling cheated. You could overview everything covered without actually buying an entire textbook; this one is a waste of space.It's pricey, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected","review":"I was very disappointed with the Tracks and Scats Encyclopedia because of the hand drawn tracks.

His photographs are of animals, of which I am familiar, and his line drawings are of the scat and tracks; disappointing because it was for authenticity of the scat and tracks that I purchased the book. I wanted actual pictures of tracks and scat, a representation of what I would see in the field, not something I would use in a greeting card or placemat. I would not recommend this book to anyone that has spent more than 2 days out-of-doors.

Extremely low tech device.Coffee is heated and then dispersed from two small tubes. If you want to use just one leaky coffee mug be sure to place it so both the tubes will drip into the leaky coffee mug. If you want two leaky mugs of coffee then be sure to position both leaky mugs so they each get their own tube to leak from.If you want a leaky Carafe, grab hold of the cheap plastic housing, turn it over and turn the cheap plastic knob on the back.

I only wish it would have been a bit longer! You can tell Zilinsky did her research, the book is very informational. The author paints a a very realistic, grim picture in the story, not only informing us of the cruel life the prisoners live, but also the harsh realities of being an officer there. The story revolves around Tyl von Pankow, who unwillingly falls in love with the camp commander. The relationship grows very realistically and beautifully. It also focuses on his relationship with the other prisoners, particuliarly his friend, Karl. The story is written in a mature way, as well as educating the reader on the psychological aspect of war, with the captives and the captors. Definately reccomended, for fans of WWII fiction, brilliant,grown-up romance novels, or just an excellent read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly researched and badly written","review":"I am a Maltese historian focusing on this period of Mediterranean history.

The book is dedicated with gushing adoration to Mr. Pickles's father-in-law, who apparently was a modern member of that order. The afterword professes that chivalry lives on in the modern era, epitomized by the charitable works performed by the current members of the order. Mr. Pickles's personal enamour for chivalry in general and the Knights of Malta in particular cast doubt on the impartiality of his conclusions."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a joke","review":"After yawning through the first few chapters of Mr. Pickles latest attempt, I gratefully fell asleep and never picked Malta up again. Apparently Mr. Pickles fell asleep during his research for the book as well, as the number of inaccuracies in his research are astounding- I advise him to start publishing under the pseudonym \\"General Doofus\\". Don't buy this book unless you want to indulge the pocketbooks of a talentless author who spends more time pretending to be a General in lieu getting his facts straight. He should be drafted into service and sent to the front lines of any conflict we can find- then maybe he can learn to author a decent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful!","review":"I love this book.

The reader was very good however, and if she does the unabridged version I'd opt for that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous satire","review":"This book is often called biting or cynical, but what most appealed to me was its realism. It is very different from many other books written during this time period in that it doesn't get too sentimental about innocence. Amelia is in many ways the ideal woman of her day, but Thackeray sees her as a human being with weaknesses as well as virtues. Becky would normally be branded as the gold-digger or adventuress, but she has some excellent qualities which really shine through, particularly towards the end of the book. It is an enjoyable read, filled with wit and humour as it explores the ups and downs of the heroines' lives. The only slight drawback is that it is very long and sometimes convoluted (the only reason I couldn't give it 5 stars) but the conclusion for me was absolutely worth it. A classic for a reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserves its classic status","review":"This is a rich, complex epic story. As other reviewers mentioned, the main issues of the book are still relevant today. The female characters aren't that great. One is the stereotypical virtuous 19th century woman who is basically a doormat-she gets a bit tiresome. The male characters were more sympathetic. One of the best parts of the book is seeing how some characters evolve and some do not. The book does take a while to get through, but it is worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Hard to Remember This was Written in the19th Century!","review":"Who among us could not appreciate the social satire in this novel that translates perfectly to modern day? Heh. Thackeray's constant rhetorical questioning does get a little annoying at times, but that's my only complaint. If you are tired of dry, boring, altruistic, overly melodramatic, and/or maudlin novels from this era, this is the book for you. Even though times have changed considerably, Thackeray's observations on society still ring true as if they were written yesterday. You will see people you know in his characters, and perhaps, although you might not want to admit it, yourself. Becky Sharp and her \\"artful\\" ways will draw you in and you will lose sleep, but it's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a very classic book.","review":"i think this is one of my top favorites of all the classical works I've read.

I normally spent a good 4 to 6 hours a day reading on my Kindle. But this story did not motivate me to pick up my Kindle much so I read it about 1 hour each day, until I couldn't take it anymore. I was forcing myself to read this book, when normally I have to force myself to put the Kindle down. That is when I have found a good story that has grabbed me in the first few pages.

While I was immersed in Samoan every day, I used this dictionary and whatever written matter I could find for a couple of hours every day to supplement the spoken Samoan I was learning. My Samoan eventually got to be pretty good for a Palagi, and this dictionary was a great help. Faafetai tele lava ia G. B.

Dr. Reymond is a brilliant scholar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype","review":"Reymond denies Nicene orthodoxy. What more is there to say? He has obviously not studied the Fathers on the issue and cannot therefore properly discern the issues at stake. Moreover, he plays fast and loose with Calvin and his secondary quotations actually prove nothing about the eternal generation of the Son from the Father. Calvin's church sang the Nicene Creed, including the part about Christ being \\"begotten before all ages\\".Second, his understanding of the sacraments and especially the Lord's Supper were lacking. He empties out Calvin's theology of the Eucharist so that the sacrament hardly means a thing. It's a classic case of, \\"Oh, I'm not Zwinglian,\\" while he affirms actually nothing about the sacrament.Stay away from this systematic! I pray to God that this doesn't become popular in the PCA!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TO DO PENANCE","review":"Many may applaud this ballet but I cannot. After having immensely enjoyed a ballet from the Royal Opera House - ELITE SYNCOPATIONS choreographed by Kenneth Macmillan - and wanting to have a nice evening with ballets I continued selecting another one. I remembered I was not satisfied with ASCHENBRÖDEL the first time I watched it and, thinking I was perhaps wrong,I set eyes on it again confirming my first opinion. Customs and scenery of immense bad taste, choreography with rather ugly surprises, no fun but deadly boredom. The audience 'va in brodo di giuggiole' as we say in Italy and burst out in loud applause: chi si contenta gode! The orchestra does not deserve a prize for its refinement but it still remains the winner.

I was pleasantly surprised, however, by what I saw. Karl Hess and Murray Bookchin were previously unknown to me but I appreciated their perspective. The link between libertarianism and anarchism is explored and gave me something to think about. Previously, I never understood the anarchic libertarians I knew but I now have newfound respect for their perspective. That Hess associated with Murray Rothbard was a point in his favor as was the director going to a Libertarian Party convention in the late seventies when it was filmed.

Many powers are interested in this border. Each interested party is extremely tough because survival is so difficult in this area and the stakes are high. A lot of attention was given to Pakistan's ISI and the way it apparently deals with all the other sides in the conflict.The second episode showed horrible things. Little kids, particularly little girls, are at extreme risk in the remote Afghan areas. The opium traders lend money to poor farmers. When the farmers can't pay the debt, the drug traders take their daughters. And this cycle goes on and on.

While I have no problem when ICE deports criminals and in fact commend them for doing that I don't think the law should be applied as black and white.

The enemies are all silly looking clouds, blobs, or spidery things, which are still ridiculously stronger than your terrible main character.

Ignore all of the comments you read that compare them to Sonic Youth. I love Sonic Youth and they really don't sound similar to each other, at all!

The dissonant guitars made me think they were biting Sonic Youth. But after a few listens I realized that they are very different. While Sonic Youth at their best relied on distortion and improvisation, Blonde Redhead writes non-traditional and dissonant melodies and uses lots of unique time signatures. But there's not a whole lot of improv there. I'd say they had more in common with Don Caballero than Sonic Youth.If that sounds like your bag, get this record. It's wonderful, exhilarating, and totally unique. My favorite is the great drum line and cracking vocals that is track 4.And if you have a chance, see them live. They are one of the best performing bands you'll ever see."},{"rating":"2","title":"in an expression of the inexpressible","review":"i can't believe no one has reviewed this yet. quite simply put, this album is amazing. the way blonde redhead blend melodic pop craftsmanship with noise is as clever as anyone. live the band is nothing short of amazing. like the title of the album, these songs are able to express that which is beyond words, even the music is in love. new on this album is the way the put synthesizers to good use, complimenting the songs, and filling up the space left by their departed bass player (there is no bass on the album that i can hear), it brings their well-orchestrated sound to a new level. one of the best bands of the '90s, they continue to grow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Abstract rock","review":"Blonde Redhead sound great whatever they do. There are pure some indy classics here and there are abstract 7 minute investigations featuring bizarre tempos and repetetive guitar sounds. This album is (funnily enough) great to listen to, to have playing and just to realise something new everytime. Essentially though it is experimental indie with great varying vocals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very talented artist","review":"The author illustrated all her own work but this is by no means a complete work of beat terms.

Few years ago I went to a local music store in Michigan (one of those large ones that resemble a warehouse) and, not surprisingly, they did not have it. After spending about 40 minutes with a teenager attendant, full of attitude, I placed a \\"special\\" order, paying the requested 3 bucks on the spot (what if I did not come back!!). I received a postcard notice almost 4 months later that informed me that the \\"title [was] out of print\\". I was pretty bummed. Then, when Amazon started to carry music titles some time ago, out of curiousity (and based on my pleasant experience of buying books from Amazon) I searched for this title and . . .shazamm!! I received the CD few days later. No hassles, no headaches, no BS, and most importantly, they actually had it in stock!!

Not only are the school colors WRONG (hello-maybe a publishing error but come on!) but the quotes are silly and shallow. \\"Girls wear pearls..., people are preppy...\\" etc. Also, many of the author's descriptions are off the mark. Some things are accurate, however. For example, how you can always find a group you fit into, etc. If you are looking for info on Wake Forest, or any other school, don't buy these books. They are written by students and not written by professionals who interview students but actually confirm information. Get a credible guide book and go visit."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a must read","review":"A school is hard to get to know if you don't actually go there. Reading this book made me feel like I have as close a perspective as possible to that experience besides actually being enrolled at Wake Forest.

I highly recommend that anyone thinking about Wake Forest buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Introduction to Roman Paganism","review":"This book explores what we can know about Roman paganism given the paucity of sources. Conclusions are judicious, measured, yet useful. MacMullen shows us that the decline of paganism was by now means assured. He also questions (and demolishes) the whole idea of a pagan state cult--at least as we understand the idea today. The student of ancient church history will also benefit from a greater understanding of the similarities (and differences) between Christianity and paganism.

You should get this movie it's awsome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Barbara Streisand vs. The Satanic Auto","review":"A movie so bad it begs for the Mystery Science Theatre treatment. Just consider the following: Mr. Barbara Streisand as a small town sheriff, Kathleen Lloyd, with a voice more irritating than Jennifer Tilly's, as the town's most beloved teacher, Ronny Cox as a spineless alcoholic, R.D. Armstrong as a wife-beating boor and a 1965 Lincoln with tinted windows as Satan. Yes, the perfect formula for one absurdly bad, but amusing film. Satan, er, I mean the 1965 Lincoln, comes to town and immediately runs over and over and over and over John Rubinstein, and then it really gets serious. This car/Satan hates everybody. But, if like me, you'll find yourself cheering on the Lincoln, especially when it leaves the ground (yes, you read that correctly) to travel through Kathleen Lloyd's kitchen. This movie is truly a hoot. I never understood why there was never a \\"The Car, Part 2\\". Enjoy the road."},{"rating":"1","title":"Introducing a Car Even More Grotesque than the Toyota Echo","review":"An incredibly ugly, demonically possessed 1971 Lincoln Town Car terrorizes a small town community in Utah, driving over most of its inhabitants. Unfortunately it never got to the director or screenwriter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad acting and bad directing","review":"The acting is terrible in this movie, which I also blame on the director. About the only special effects in this movie is done by speeding up the film to try to give the illusion of speed, which looks terrible. This film was definitely done on a low budget and it shows. About the only thing worth watching in this film are the women who are wearing very tight pants.The overall plot is not bad though. In fact, I would like to see this film remade with some decent acting and direction, a substantial budget to create the special effects, and a little more substance added to the story.Overall, if you are bored with nothing to do, then watch this movie. Otherwise, your time and money is better spent somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can we say cheese??","review":"Automatically this movie gives off a typical seventies version of a horror movie, complete with skin tight jockey shorts, fading pastel colors and scooby doo hair doos. The beginning leads the viewer to believe that something evil is learking off in the distance, like a predator seeking it's prey. Yet how far can one go with a black car, with tinted windows who spends most of the movie gunning people down, off the roads. Never is there any evidence that someone is behind the wheel, for all the viewer knows it could be a 16 year old with a remote control out for kicks. It's VERY far fetched, and annyoing to watch, as no one is clever enough to just blow the stupid thing up, until the very end. Not to mention all the graded, loud music that sounds like someone scraping together pieces of metal...it's not enough for any true horror fan to stand for a whole hour and a half....not to mention there was never any hope for a sequel...\\"Car The Revenge??\\" Give me a break!N.C."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for a few unintended laughs.","review":"This low-budget '70s popcorn flick is worth watching for sheer camp value, but unless you're less than eight years old don't expect horror or suspense.

James Brolin plays a county sheriff's deputy who, along with the rest of his department, is virtually helpless as his turf is assaulted by a thing from hell. Whether a minor demon or old Satan himself, something drives The Car like a bat out of hell along the dusty, Arizona roads looking for innocent people to run down to satisfy its fiendish lust for killing. And why? That's what Brolin's character wants to know as well as the rest of the terrified people of Santa Ynez. So get aboard the thrill ride but watch your back and listen for the heart-stopping blare of the demonic horn just before the impact that leaves you a corpse in the road.

It took me several years to appreciate that film for what it was.Shortly thereafter a film I had never heard of played in the theatre down the street; a thriller called \\"The Car.\\" I went to see it having no idea what it was or where it was going, and it took a surreal, supernatural turn I didn't expect... so I can truly say I liked it better than \\"Star Wars.\\" That really isn't the case any more, but \\"The Car\\" is still a great little B-picture, unapologetically weird and clever enough to avoid any explanations for the bizarrerie.And The Car still looks meaner than Darth, even with his helmet on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satan's hod rod Lincoln","review":"I remember seeing this one alone late at night (in my parent's house with the big picture window facing the point where the road forks to bypass our house and car light shining into the darkened family room) when I was little and I watched most of it from under a blanket. I watched the DVD from under a blanket as well. Despite bad acting, a dumb script, and some looooong parts with no action, the movie really manages to create a sustained feeling of dread that never lets up until the (admittedly hokey) end. The cinemetography and special effects are great, and George Barris' Car is really menacing looking (See Barris TV & Movie Cars in books- it has a short section on it), and a better actor than most of the stock cast.

It succeeds in delivering popcorn devouring entertainment where today's poorly written, desperately ironic and irritatingly smug imitators utterly fail. It's a shame they never did a sequel, the possibilities which were suggested in the end credits as you see the car zooming in an urban highway setting far for the hick desert sticks used in the rest of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bringing back found memories of when I was younger","review":"I ordered this DVD. I was totally satisfied with the remastering job. The image is pristine, no risks, dots, whatever The desert/mountains footage is incredibly bright and clear. A really good digital remaster, contrary to another childhood favorite of mine, HINDENBURG (the one with George C. Scott).Like other reviews here, I saw this at the theaters at a very young age (I think I was 10/12 at the time), and it scared me the most! Seeing it right after I received it, I knew I would not get scared at all, but even so I enjoyed the movie a lot. Acting is well placed, special effects very good for a 1977 feature film, suspense well built, soundtrack very good. Yes, it is cheesy, but it worked wonderfully.I have for this film the same kind of affection I have for RACE WITH THE DEVIL (the one with Peter Fonda).I also read the book made after the screenplay. It translates well."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Devil is in the car !","review":"This is an underrated movie. Ive seen this several times & own the DVD. A car - basically the devil in the car kills people in a small western town. James Brolin is the hero. Its really not a bad little horror movie as the car runs down people on bikes,pedestrians,etc. It is tense,moody & has a few scares. The car itself succeeds in having an evil aura when you see it. Easily worth a look - but dont expect an all time classic. Still very cool and better than Trucks :)I own the Anchor Bay DVD, but you cant go wrong with way with AB or Sony"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not many movies like it","review":"The basic overview is that James Brolin is the Sheriff of a small Western town. When a mysterious car comes into town and begins to terrorize its people and kills his girlfriend. Well when this happens he goes out to lengths to stop it from killing everyone. The main question is, what or who is the car? Does it belong to Hitler? Is it a demon? Or possibly the devil himself? No one knows, but it all comes down to a slow but great ending. This movies does not rely on special effects but more of terror. There is more than a few like it but most are not well done. **** out of 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jaws on the roadway!","review":"I agree with most or all of the reviews. I also saw it when I was about 7 or 8 years old and it scared the heck out of me. After that bike rider was taken out, I never wanted to ride my bike on the roadway again. The Car was like Jaws on the roadway, just devouring people. The horn, the engine the smile on the grill, just look, you'll see it. I have the DVD and it brings back memories. My wife and I saw it together for the first time and she had trouble sleeping, she's 26 years old. Yea, the acting was bad, but not horrible, the direction was not Speilberg, but the movie has great suspense and action. The car goes right through the home and ends Kathleen LLoyds life. Good vs. Evil, simply put. Just watch it and enjoy or be scared..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silly, Silly Scary Fun","review":"In the late 70s there was an era of \\"Jaws\\" knock-offs. There was \\"Grizzly,\\" \\"Day of the Animals,\\" and \\"Claws.\\" They started to run out of places where we would feel safe. Now, it seems some kind of car is running people over. No apparent reason, no particular pattern, just splat! James Brolin is the local sherrif trying to solve what is going on. Who was driving the car? What kind of a car is it anyway? Where did he get that cool tinting? It is a silly premise, but one that most of us at one time or another has had nightmares about. Not nearly as intense as Stephen Spielberg's great chase movie \\"Duel,\\" but far less bloody than the 80s \\"The Hitcher.\\" A good terror tale that is family friendly.

But from the first scene where the demon car delibrately attacks the bicyclists, I was hooked.A few years later, I posted a description of the movie on a forum, and someone recognized it. I rented it, and, to my delight, it was indeed The Car. Yes, some of the acting is wooden, and the script a bit cliched.

This is indeed a shame because this is one of the most uniquely beautiful albums of its era. It is sonorous, complex, a rich tapestry of interwoven sound. One of the most remarkable qualities of the album and the band is their ability to juxtapose harsh, cacophonous, dissonant passages with soothing, delightful, joyous sounds, thus rendering the latter all the more beautiful. In addition to the wonderous \\"No Rain\\", the album is jam packed with tremendous songs, including \\"Dear Old Dad\\" and the unbelievably underrated \\"Holy Man\\". It is especially beautiful as driving music--there have been times when it's occupied a place of honor in my Subaru CD changer for weeks at a time.

Then someone who knew about my interest in the therapeutic use of music suggested that I listen to the song \\"Change\\" on this album, and I already owned it. I don't care about how much other people might dislike the other songs on this album.

Not sure how to start ? Look no further. Instead of buying different albums or discs trying to figure them out start here. This is the start and pretty much the best of their early work and hits. It will bring alive The Beatles and yea your going to get hooked. You'll play these songs over and over again. They say you can't ware out a CD. You can and you will with this. The only down fall is that you WILL DEMAND MORE. Dont let the heavy price get you. You will find that this is more then worth it's price and a better start then \\"1\\" or Past Masters.

Listening to the Beatles really has a feel-good quality about it. In fact all these songs are masterpieces in the history of music.My personal favourites are:I Want to Hold Your HandAll My LovingHard Day's NightTicket to RideYesterdayWe Can Work It OutNowhere ManMichellePaperback WriterEleanor RigbyYellow SubmarineDefinitely a good choice for your first Beatles combination and an intro to why the 60's generation loved the Beatles so.A good starter kit for new fans and a good piece of memorabilia for old fans revisiting the Beatles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has Three Songs from 1966","review":"For the record, the second CD in this set has three songs from 1966: 11. Paperback Writer, 12. Eleanor Rigby and 13. Yellow Submarine. The others are from 1965, covering Help! through Rubber Soul.This set is intended to represent the best of their output from each time period, not necessarily in proportion to each album. So you only hear two songs from Revolver, vs. several from Rubber Soul.Those who want more will want to purchase the original albums, anyhow.

While one can't argue with the selections included (with the possible exception of Yellow Submarine vs. one of the other songs from Revolver), one can argue that their best album (Revolver) isn't well represented at all compared to some of the other lesser b sides included (and the weak single From Me To You)."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent compilation of the Beatles' early work","review":"This compilation, originally issued in 1973 (along with the \\"1967-70\\" compilation), is an excellent introduction to the classic pop music of the Beatles. All the early hits are here for your enjoyment, along with sone of the better album tracks. If you do not own any Beatles albums and want to delve into their rich musical heritage, as a starting point these two albums make a very sensible purchase. The only minor criticism I have of this album is that EMI decided to include too many songs from the \\"Rubber Soul\\" album and not enough from \\"Revolver\\".

One thing that I had not notice since I first got the album back in the 70s is that there's no George Harrison tracks. I don't know if it was done on purpose or what. I think that if your ending in the year 1966 with songs from \\"Revolver\\" you could have added \\"Taxman\\" to the mix instead of having \\"Yellow Submarine\\" to end the album. So let me get this straight Ringo gets to sing but George is left out. They could have a least included on George Harrison song. Then again is they just wanted to stick to Lennon-McCartney tunes I'm pretty sure they could have included one that George sang.

It covers quite a bit but lacks any 1966 tracks. Still definetly worth it! Remains one of my favourites!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Prefer Red over Blue","review":"I always liked this album ever since it was released. I Prefer the Red to the Blue album simply because we get to hear the raw voices in their more formative years. Also, the concentration of most of these selections is about personal love found or lost. There is much less focus on social issues and commentary that you find on the \\"Red Album.\\" Not only does the album demonstrate their ability as performers but also you can really appreciate their gift as composers and lyricists."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Beginners Only","review":"This was the first Beatles album I can remember buying as a kid.

The Red Album was a great place to start. It really succeed as that, a starting point for the Beatles novice. Like other reviewers, I really take Capitol to task for not placing these songs on one disc. Come on, we all know that they didn't put this music on two discs to \\"preserve the integrity of the original,\\" they did it to get more money out of you! Still, a great starting point for a timeless group."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Beatles' finest days","review":"I am a 15 year old fan of the Beatles so of course I did not grow up with this music like many listeners did. But I can understand how the revolutionary music of the Beatles changed the face of rock and roll forever. They could rock on such songs as Paperback Writer and All My Loving yet their ballads such as Norwegian Wood and Yesterday are among the greatest of all time. Lennon and McCartney were truly ahead of their time, as they saw not what rock and roll was but what it could be. The Red Album shows how the Beatles rose to stardom with classic song after classic song. From the catchy tunes of From Me to You and Love Me Do to the deep lyrics of Yesterday and In My Life, this two cd set is a must for any beatles fan, young or old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good compilation","review":"This compilation is one of good ways out there to start your acquaintance with the Beatles.

This album has most of their early songs digitally remastered and at top sound quality. The one problem with Beatles is there were so many hits that they have no good greatest hits album, you have to buy all kinds of albums to get all of their good songs.

When released on vinyl the Red album was a two record set. However in the age of the compact disc,Apple/Capitol decided that they should release a 60 minute album(80 minutes of music can fit on a single CD)in a two CD set and sale it for about $32.00, when in all reality it should sale for $10-$14.

If you do not have any Beatles yet and you know you will not buy all of their CDs then get this and it's blue brother 1967-70 and you can't go wrong. This album has a special place in my heart. I got the 8-track tapes back in 1973 when they came out and played them over and over and over. IMHO these are the best songs released in the first half of the 1960s by anyone. The state of Rock n Roll was on life support when these guys hit the scene in 1964 in the USA at least. They jump started RnR all over again and the rest is history.

The mono sales exceeded anything remotely approaching stereo (which, in those days, was simply an audiophile pursuit, not the standard it is now), and the mono mixes were overseen by the Beatles themselves. For all the differences, the harmonies that coalesce on the mono recordings are worth the price of admission alone....If you have the mono box set, you can certainly burn all of these tracks onto a single CD. In the meantime, I'll talk myself into keeping the stereo version."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"red\\" and \\"blue\\" of it all?","review":"Being a big time Beatles fan since 1964.

Played my first gig when I was 14. If music is in your blood and the Buffalo Springfield, Hollies, Byrds, or a multitude of other groups was any part of your growing up in the 60's, this book is worth the time. It is extremely detailed and at times may seem boring or redundant-- but gives a behind-the-scenes, inside view of the personal relationships and problems/benefits that go along with the territory and is actually a smooth read. I've read all the books that everyone has written on this stuff---but still came away with some new insight on CSNY---- and especially the individual players that made the group. Definitely worth it and I'll read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good biography...","review":"I really enjoyed this bio; well-written, well-researched, cooperation from the subjects yet not fawning as many are when the subjects are still alive. The author brings all of the band members to life and their lives are very interesting in the way he tells about them.It was impossible not to feel for David Crosby during the time while awaiting sentencing and then being released from prison, as he was honest about his fears, his emotions, his feelings, etc...also during the period of his liver transplant.This was the first book I have read that made Joni Mitchell seem likable, I have to say. Perhaps because the band members all liked her so much, but other books I have read concerning this musical era make her out to be much more of a prima donna.

I actually put magnetic contacts on the back of coin slots on laundry machines that were getting broken into. When anyone pulls the coin slot out it automatically dials two cell phone #'s I programmed in. Caught one so far! Good reliable product (don't know about wireless accessories though) and good price. You do need to know a little about phone wiring, but the instructions do a good job of walking you through it.

The scent is strongly similar to a urinal cake and sweat(and I am not joking). You can see the hundreds of reviews on Basenotes.com for Kouros, and at least 1/3 of the reviewers acknowledge that this smells like a public restroom. Not everyone will make this association, but many people will.This is not safe to wear in public and I wouldn't recommend wearing this at least until you try a sample first.I don't want to be dogmatic and say that nobody will enjoy this.

I have looked a long time for a book that was written to help investment-minded teens get a good overview of what they can do to get started. Most are written like they are talking to a 10 year old and only cover the most basic principles.This book goes far beyond that in the Motley Fool tradition. It will give anyone, teen or adult, an excellent overview of what they can do to start investing. It covers many different ideas for getting started and goes in-depth into what you can do to jump right into doing it.I recommend this book to anyone who is serious about starting to invest and looking to get REAL information on what they can do to get started. If your sick of the kiddie stuff that is written on how to get started, then this book is exactly what you have been looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic book","review":"The book has some excellent advice for teens (or anyone really) looking to get rich. This was 1 of 4 books I purchased as a teen to learn more about finance and it far surpasses the others, especially for those of us that aren't on their own yet but want to learn what they can about eventually making the most money with the least effort. It's a nice lighthearted read, but some of the information is a little outdated from the time that it was written (apparently there was a time when DVD players cost $1000 :/). Little things aside, get this book. It'll pay for itself hundreds of times over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great advice, ho-hum packaging","review":"The advice in this book is excellent; really well done. My only criticism is that the book itself LOOKS so boring. Considering that the target audience is teenagers who are accustomed to a full assault of all of their senses, this book is very visually boring. Not a single graph or chart which I find very odd in a financial book. Not a single splash of color. Even the pages are the rough kind found in $2 romance novels. In summation, GREAT ADVICE but the lack of color and \\"wow factor\\" may turn off a teenager."},{"rating":"2","title":"Written for the Teen Investor!","review":"This is an excellent first book to give a teen who is not sure about investing as a good place to put his or her money. It is written with teens in mind and has tons of real-world examples to which teens can relate. It is a good start to get teens exciting about making their money work for them. I got it for my 16-year-old nephew who was skeptical, but is on board with taking control of his own financial future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too detailed for teens","review":"Good concept but few teens I know would have the interest to read this very detailed book.

I walked away thinking twice before wasting a dollar on frivolous things, because that same dollar when invested compounds.I disagree with the premise that the best way to start is a stock index fund, but the author is right-- it's at least a great start for people who don't know where to start!

Its function is to infiltrate Russia if the need to do so ever arises. So far, it hasn't. But when Stone debriefs a Russian defector who has offered information about Russia's position at upcoming arms reduction negotiations, he questions the defector's authenticity. Stone infiltrates Russia and impersonates a KGB officer to find the truth, enlisting the help of a prostitute and a Stalin look-alike.The Debriefing is tightly plotted, Littell's writing style is crisp, and although the characterization is one-dimensional, the story is fun. It isn't as good as his first book,The Defection of A. J. Lewinter, nor is it as enjoyable as my favorite (so far) of the Littell books,The Sisters, but this brief novel is one that fans of espionage fiction should enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Spy Novel","review":"I very much enjoy the author. And am glad to see this work being reprinted. Stone works for an elite secret intelligence arm of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. When a Soviet courier defects with secret documents it is up to Stone to verify the defectors authenticity. Stone must secretly infiltrate into Russia to confirm the facts.

This short-lived ensemble has sometimes been 'tagged' as krautrock - but 'Trip Away' is more in the bluesy psychedelic direction. Tunes that lured me in were the ten-minute title cut \\"Trip Away\\", the somewhat spine-tingling \\"Everytime\\", \\"Hopeless Love\\" (reminds me of Jefferson Airplane), \\"Lonely Love\\", \\"Clean Survival\\" and the rocking \\"Your Lovin' Man\\". Personnel: Piet Schimkat - vocals, Rolf Brockhorst - guitar, Benrd Zamulo - bass, piano & vocals and Achim Brierley - drums. Should definitely draw in serious fans of Quicksilver Messenger Service, the previously mentioned Jefferson Airplane, West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band and possibly Moby Grape."},{"rating":"2","title":"clear explanation of complex grammar","review":"After taking a few linguistics classes, I was getting somewhat tired of British authors of linguistics or advanced grammar books. Too many examples that do not apply to spoken culture in the states. However, this one is much better than the usual. It offers common sense explanations of complex English grammar, sticking to non-cultural specifics so that all the examples apply fully to either side of the pond. I am not a linguist, so the last half of this book gets hard for me to follow sometimes. In spite of that, I highly recommend this book for anyone who either finds advanced grammar hard to grasp, or those who have studied it longer and want to read some clear explanations of the underlying reasons for the established grammar of today. These concepts cannot be explained very simply, but Yule sure gives it a try while being thorough at the same time. This is a wonderful grammar book for college level grammar classes, and for future teachers."},{"rating":"2","title":"blasting concept","review":"or should i say \\"Covers\\"concept. this compilation is a variety of classic songs well covered by some of England's finest(ChaosUK). these songs come back to life with a stronger, more aggressive kick.

Unfortunately, I could not find another book on the subject that was embracing of the area of woman's life in the period between the end of the revolution and the begining of the civil war.I found no mention of the chatel placement of women in divorce or the legal rights of women, especially as toward their ownership of property.

I dont think that the author has gone through the trouble and the research to down play the SAS or the shameful recruits (Andy & Chris) but has done a commendable job in redeeming respect for late Sgt Vince Phillips (another member of the mission) who's name was disgraced by Andy & Chris in their books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convincing investigative work","review":"I always thought that the B20 story was a little bit fictitious and Michael Asher puts forward a convincing logic to his story. If you read his findings you'll start to see holes appear in McNab's and Ryan's versions. By Asher's accounts, these men have already disgraced the regiment by bad-mouthing a fallen comrade and lied about/embellished the rest.Asher goes back to the LUP, where the whole cock-up begins, and then traces the supposed journey all the way through to its conclusion by talking to local people who were present at the time. Unless the whole of the Iraqi people were there to spin a yarn, it's hard to deny that the truth is not what is in the other books. There is no disgrace in the truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Believable","review":"The level of investigative effort Asher puts into this book is extreme.

The boning that went over the \\"love handles\\" to enhance the natural waist definitely enhanced the natural waist, but the love handles grew. I have a long torso, and even I couldn't sit comforatably (especially when the boning in the front got caught on my other clothing since it stuck out so far). So if you have an average or short torso, do not buy. If you have a long torso with very little plumpness on your body, I'm sure this product will be perfect for you because it enhances cleavage well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't even wear","review":"I bought it to go under a bridesmaid dress but I couldn't even wear it because it was too bulky.

Ask your child questions about the items and what bear or Ojo would do with them.BUT...the flaps are really small. I had to wear them in for my little girl. They stick to the pages very tightly and are hard to open or see at first. Like everything else. A couple of times used and it all works much better. But for the eager reade/listener it is a bit frustriating at first.I also find the story a bit short, but hey it is bear.. he rocks and we love him no matter what.Enjoy it, it is a nice book"},{"rating":"1","title":"lid doesn't fit on with filter in place","review":"The top/lid for this tank just sits on top, but the filter that comes with this clips over the back edge of the tank (hangs inside the tank) and even at it's lowest setting still sticks up too high so the lid sits up on it, which is right in the water stream going over the filter and then the back edge of the lid and top of filter get moldy. Not to mention that the lid's lamp has never worked even though the bulb is good (we tested it) and I think it could have something to do with the huge amount of condensation that collects up there all over everything. Also, the tiny flap that you are supposed to use to put food in the tank through is very small so generally catches some of the food. The shape of the tank is pretty, and the colors are nice for kids, but it's frustrating that the parts don't fit together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best bang for your buck!!","review":"I had POTS service, and I was running a huge bill a month (includes DSL rates). I was so frustrated with this high bill that I switched to Cable modem and Packet 8 service. Even though cable modem is more expensive than DSL, I save overall, and I have better download speeds.The only problem(s) that I have are that Packet 8 does not provide names with Caller ID, and Packet8 has Pacific time on the Caller-ID, even though I live on the East coast. Minor set backs. You have to dial a 1- before all the numbers, which does not bother me at all. I make a lot of international calls, and they offer a very good rate on these as well. My wife said the quality is not good some times, but I have not noticed it. I don't mind paying the $1.50 for E911 access.Overall, I am completely satisfied with Packet8 service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable service","review":"Very easy to install and worked well for few days. Used with Comcast residential service (the only available option for me). After 2 weeks --- every 2-3 days many hours of interruption, when power LED is blinking, Link LED is solid and there is no dial tone. Customer service could not suggest anything better then powering off and on cable modem, router and adapter. This works sometimes, usually after 2-3 hours of fiddling (powering off and on all 3 devices in different sequence), but never immediately. Updating firmware does not help either. Customer service representative mentioned that \\"after internet connection is lost, adapter needs to resynchronize to SIP server\\". Why it can not resynchronize on its own without manual fiddling is beyond me. SSH sessions and slow downloads were not interrupted when phone connection is lost, so looks like there were no serious internet internet outage either as much as I'd like to blame Comcast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want a customer service nightmare?","review":"Beware, while the equipment works alright, the customer service is atrocious. I had packet8 service for several months and decided to go back to a standard landline for quality and bundling issues. I ported my number, and called the cancel my packet8 service. I believed everything was taken care of. Packet8 billed me for 5 subsequent months after the number was ported out, and even after escalating the issue to their supervisors, they refuse to give me credit for the service fees even though there was no number on the account on which to use the service.If you choose to purchase this product, you are warned, you are dealing with an unscrupulous company that is so happy with their terms and conditions that they cannot use reasoning to make a decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suprise 911 Startup Charge and Monthly Fees...","review":"Congress passed legislation requiring VOIP providers to offer 911 (Emergency) services to VOIP customers. As a result, Packet8 hit me with a $9.95 \\"upgrade fee\\" to start the 911 service and a new $1.50/month \\"E911\\" charge.I was willing to pay the $1.50/month if they would meet me halfway and waive the startup charge. I called Packet8 to see if I could somehow get the $9.95 fee waived, but they wouldn't budge. I'm stuck with a $59 disconnect fee if I don't complete the mandatory upgrade.The Packet8 phone service is reliable but if they are going to be adding fees and charges, traditional phone lines become a more attractive option.The decision to go with Packet8 is yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst customer service","review":"I have been using this just for one week and the call quality is the worst.

It is a great stress-reliever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harmless fun","review":"This calendar is a staple in our family. I run a ferret shelter for abused and hospice care ferrets, and I enjoy this calendar each year. Ferrets are wonderfully intelligent creatures that love to be played with, coached and trained. They get bored easily, and enjoy interactive playtime. There is nothing wrong about staging photos for a picture. Most of these pictures are done with treats to pose, and lots of computer manipulation anyway. So the calendars are harmless to the ferrets, and actually stimulate them through touch and handling time. Brovo to the photographer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Animal Calendar In the World!","review":"I have been a Ferret Calendar fan for years and I just got the 2005 edition.

(And that's not going to get you any women.) Men, you can read this and believe it if you want to, but recognize that you're doing so only because it makes you feel better. That doesn't mean the information in it is true. If you really want to understand why men are the way they are, you'd be better off reading The Blank Slate by Steven Pinker or The Moral Animal by Robert Wright, both of which are 5-10 years old but vastly more intelligent, and accurate, than this book. Those books don't pain a pretty picture, but at least the picture they paint is not a self-delusional one.

Men are driven to be successful so they can attract the most beautiful women. What? So men receive no intrinsic satisfaction from being the best at whatever they choose to do? There is so much simplification of this kind in this book. Men and women are complex individuals.

Only one piece of advice keep your money or buy something else with it, unless you need a musical decor for cheap smooching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I think the biggest gripe about this CD stems from a premature judgment that the recording is unoriginal, or that Loreena hasn't created anything new since \\"The Book of Secrets\\". Personally, I couldn't disagree more: my initial thought was that \\"An Ancient Muse\\" was really stunning. The greatness of it comes from the BLEND of old and new--it's true that there isn't anything different or edgy, the songs are a blend of old Loreena and something more contemporary, taking the best from older recordings like \\"The Visit\\" and \\"Parallel Dreams\\" and infusing them with the Asian beats of \\"The Mask and Mirror\\" and \\"The Book of Secrets.\\" We're led in a more cosmopolitan direction--we hear a Celtic-Asian blend, so to speak. Perhaps in the future Loreena's travels will take her in an entirely new direction, but for the time being, her music--in every one of its incarnations--is better than ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loreena McKennitt Returns","review":"After nearly 10 years, Loreena McKennitt returns to the studio. This is a lovely CD, but there is very little new music here . Yes, all of the songs are new, but she re-visits the same melodies that have served her well in the past . I have 4 of her earlier CD's, from Parallel Dreams to The Book Of Secrets and every time I listen to this CD, I keep hearing her previous songs in my head . All of the songs are well done and she has not lost her ability to present cohesive stories . It just would have been nice to hear some new melodies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ancient Muse by Loreena McKennitt","review":"This is rather interesting to listen to as at times there are songs that can catch your attention, some that one is not sure of wanting to keep listening to. Very good if one is wanting to hear Egyptian music as Loreena does a good job with that on this CD. This is a very, very good CD though her cd The Visit is my favorite one of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has Some Good Music","review":"Most reviewers like this CD; I agree it is with the purchase price if you like her music. It's probably her second or third best music (I like Secrets best)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Compared to her earlier cds, after waiting all these years, I was sorry I wasted my money. I was looking for more of her ballad type of songs and lerics. After playing it thru three times I took it out of my changer and put it on the shelf. Her voice is just as wonderful but the content of this cd sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"ancient muddle","review":"Loreena McKennitt has a marvelous voice but it's largely lost in this grab bag of Arabic instrumentals and Egyptian deedle-deedle dance hall chrome. Loreena is at her best in the haunting Penelope's Song, but track 8 is more than reminiscent of the melody in \\"Bonny Swans\\" and there is other occasional recycled music themes from earlier albums as well. Girl, having thoroughly explored middle eastern music, please may we move on? Pharoah's Daughter and others already own this niche."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Old .... Same Old","review":"I was very disappointed with this disc. After nearly ten years without recording new music, McKennitt does not give the listener much to go on. I felt most of the songs sounded tired and mournful. She surely hasn't updated her sound much. Many of the songs had long, dull introductions to them. I kept wondering when McKennitt might sing something. Her voice is still in fine form. Hopefully the next time around there will be a shorter wait with some new ideas for her music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to standard","review":"I LOVE Mckennitt's music in general, I own all her cd's her video etc. This album (long awaited as it was) is just not up to snuff. Every track sounds similar, with no unique songs that really stand out as outstanding. I was very unhappy with this recording. I hope her next effort is more reminiscent of her earlier excellent works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good luck getting this to play","review":"Evidently there is some kind of copy protection on her cds that make it near impossible to play them on your computer CD-ROM drive.All you get is a connection to her website where they advise you to right click on the drive and then click run. WRONG. Just takes you to her website and seemingly impossible to get the CD to play. I am furious at wasting money like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"An income provider for McKennitt but little value for the listener","review":"I bought this album thinking that it would be on par with her others. It is not. Disappointingly not. If you are a McKennitt fan, I am guessing that you buy her music for her expressive voice and lively music. This had very little of either to offer. The album is predominated with overused Middle Easterm melodies and offer very little voice or are melodies with a few vocal sighs. Some of the \\"songs\\" are almost totally this genre and some of the melodies are tired since she has used them exhaustingly before, but with livlier results. The predominance of music and lack of her usual freshness gave me the impression that she was just filling space to make an income on this \\"new\\" issue. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loreena McKennitt latest CD","review":"Beautiful CD in McKennitt's clear, beautiful voice and mystical style.

This may not be too far a strech from previous recordings - but it makes no difference. It is solidly beautiful. It has a more Moraccan/Meditteranean feel than previous work.

Beautiful music, wonderful lyrics - couldn't ask for better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality you can trust","review":"An Ancient Muse is what you've come to expect from Loreena Mc Kennitt.Worldly musical pursuits using authentic world musicians intertwinedwith her hauntingly beautiful voice. Although a hair below its predecessor The Book of Secrets, An Ancient Muse still deliers very evocative melodies whether they be a loud bombastic whirling dervishkind of feel in some songs or subtle celtic whispers in them. There is no \\"Mummer's Dance\\" or single on here but who says there has to be.The common complaint is that she's repeating the same CD as the last,but who says she has to reinvent the wheel with every release?Lorenna has carved her own niche and probably has such highstandards for herself it's hard to imagine a less than stellar effort from her. Bottom line, if you were a fan before this you should have no problem enjoying this. If you weren't, this won't bringyou on board."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely......","review":"When I first came about Loreena's music, it was in a movie called \\"Soldier\\". I found that the movie Soundtrack from that movie didn't have that song through someone who was seeking the same thing on Amazon. \\"The Book of Secrets\\" was the first album that I found that had the song. I also bought \\"An Ancient Muse\\" for the beautiful cross of Celtic and Arabic music that I heard. Her style is quiet and smooth and she does sing in some but has also some instrumentals that are well worth a listen. \\"Ketarichomene\\" and \\"Caravanserai\\" are beautiful pieces, evoking desert lands and starlit nights.She sings a beautiful ancient ballad in \\"Under a Phrigian Sky\\" and the \\"English Ladye and the Knight\\". A beautiful album among the many she has created."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, old fashioned style seat post.","review":"No frills seat post, intended for use with old fashioned style bicycle saddles that have cross bolt rail clamps, such as a Brooks B.72 The body has textured horizontal milling to better lock up with the seatpost clamp. The top is open, so you might want to stuff a oily rag in there or perhaps a cork, to make sure you do not get any unwarranted moisture intrusion into your frame.One nice thing about these old style seatposts and clamps, is that you can flip the clamp upside down, and end up with an extremely low overall height compared to a typical micro-adjust seatpost."},{"rating":"2","title":"An early Chris album","review":"This was Chris' second album (this is a reissue by Capitol/Liberty).

I'm not completely sure on how that reflects on the book itself. No matter where I purchased it, the story of Nick Piantanida and the Strato-Jump project is just incredible. I am not a baloonist, parachutist, or anything even remotely related, but Nick's story is inspiring no matter who you are. This is one of the best books I have read in the past year.

But as you know, in this world of wolves, you must sleep with an eye open and just a few persons are capable to accept the awful truth that can make you blind.This powerful dramatis personae will involve two women who will love him from different perspectives.

I read that the studio that released it cut the film from six hours to the length we see. They should have left it alone. The characters are fascinating. The acting is a bit over the top. Mifune can get away with chewing the scenery but some of the other actors are not as fortunate. Don't let this review turn you off. It is an engrossing film with some memorable moments!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes","review":"I love a lot of Kurosawa's films and his worst is probably better than some directors' best. But The Idiot, in my opinion, really misses its mark. The beauty, depth and humor of the original Dostoevsky novel are totally lost in this film version. (Perhaps they would be in any film version.) I found the acting of the lead character in particular, to be stilted and even a bit ridiculous. Kurosawa somehow turned a rich, dynamic and very realistic psychological exploration into a weepy melodrama. And I can't imagine the film will seem much better if you haven't read the novel. You are much better off buying the book, one of the most perfect, profound and entertaining stories ever written, and leaving this movie alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesnt really tell you about the Hulkster","review":"This book is very small and if you are a hogan fan and want to learn more about him, this is not the right book, these are things that everyone knows about Hogan!!!

Yes, perhaps the construction doesn't match the price which I do feel is a little steep, but the table gives you room, comfort and ease which is a real plus.

The dimensions are right, the base fits under the couch/bed, wherever you're sitting and for that purpose it works. However, I wouldn't advise putting anything requiring a level surface on top of it, such as a beverage or food item. At it's finished position, the top surface is not flat or level. It's more like an easel at a slight downward angle so things have a tendency to slip off. I tried adjusting both the legs and the top surface but it never achieved a steady surface level.It's fine for propping up books or magazines, but that's about it. Not worth the money as a couple of crates could do the same job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wobbly","review":"I wanted this product so I could work on my laptop while at the sofa.

I am not sure how really are the pipes in the inside, but it is really annoying to have a brand new product that is dirty. I bought two, and both were in the same dirty condition. Second the upper inclination position is quite absurd to me. You have a table to slide beneth your sofa or bed, and in that position the closest part is higher that the farthes edge. Not sure what purpose that fullfill, as to use it like that I have to invert the table... Which meand that the legs can not go under the sofa or table.

There are only a couple of drawbacks if you are planning on getting the TableMate:1)It isn't very easy to adjust the height. You have to carefully push two spring loaded pins in, slide the legs and re-align the pins to the holes. It isn't hard to do, by any means. It just isn't as easy as I hoped.2) The spill-proof rim that goes around the table surface is really hard on the wrist when using my computer.

If you're into original cyber, get \\"Solutions\\", or if you like a strange minimalist mix of lounge, cyber and ambient, get \\"Ninety Nine\\". On the other hand, if you like NIN, Lether Strip and the third generation B-grades/clones/\\"Dark Wave\\" found on some Cleopatra Records releases, this'll be right up your alley..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Ideas and Exercises! But NOT for beginner","review":"Belkadi brought us some new ideas to play the guitar with slap bass techniques; it sounds really colorful! I do have fun with the ex. of the book! However, I think this book is fit for intermediate or advanced guitar players, either. It 's too difficult for beginner to follow: firstly, the tempo of demo tracks are too fast , and the contents of the book 'd make the learners/readers confused since the technical ex. should be on page 1 instead of page 35, i think. I' d sincerely say: every learner should master all the Technical Ex. from Ch.5 and then starts Ch.1, U'd get something! Otherwise, U' ll be disappointed.So, I just give it four stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"No explanations of the technique and the examples played way too fast on the cd equals one lousy book. This is an uncommon technique so an explanation is greatly needed. The authour obviously did not care at all about anyone trying to learn this stuff, the cd sounds like he is just another show off guitar player, I wish I could get my money back for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I have seen Kevin Eubanks use this technique. He has a small section in one of his books dedicated to this. I had hoped that this book would expand on this but it does not. This book needs some pictures to explain this stuff more clearly and much more explanation, it is vague, and is not worth buying at all. It is better to save your money for a bass book that truly explains this or maybe take some lessons with a bass player. I will avoid this authors books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peice of crap","review":"It's not a coincidence that everyone on amazon hates this book.The author doesn't explain the technique AT ALL. It's more like a game of follow the leader, which is impossible.I wanted to learn proper technique and this book has NOTHING. Even the riffs he has in the book are repetitive and uninspiring.I emailed the author asking him to help me out a little and perhaps give me some tips but he failed to reply.This guy just wrote a book for the heck of it. He didn't take into consideration that he's acutally supposed to be TEACHING you. He just shows you.I learnt more slap technique from trying on my own and watching Tim Reynolds do some slap live.WORST BOOK EVER - RIP OFF"},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like this book.....","review":"I wanted to learn this stuff.

It is a bit hard to read some of the pages but it is still a great bok to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting reality-based thriller","review":"In 1998 Al-Qaida terrorists attacked the American embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam. In this book Giles Foden, who specilizes in turning African historical events into 'faction' novels, takes these attacks as the basis of a thriller in which a number of apparently unconnected stories, in which the protagonists (a Greek-American oceanologist, an intelligence veteran with only one arm, an ambitious young civil servant and and African boy whose parents are murdered) are finally all part of one big story that cost the lives of more than 200 people. Giles Foden gives a good description of the wheelings and dealings of African (and American) bureaucracy, but also a very interesting and not much known insight into the birth of Al-Qaida, when it was still an American-sponsored resistance movement in Russian-occupied Afghanistan. Not exactly an episode of history that is very fondly remembered by the American government. Definitely worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Snack!","review":"If you like chocolate and you like any of the Slim Fast muffin snack bars, you will like these. Because they are made from whole grains, they have a great texture. Although soft, there is still something to bite into, which makes it a nice experience. The chocolate chips are plentiful and well, chocolatey. This is a good choice if you are looking for a sweet treat that is pretty harmless.These have a lot more fiber than a traditional muffin, so if you are looking for \\"cake\\", you will be disappointed. These have a drier, more dense texture. But as I said above, I find this to be an asset.Like A. Neely, I also like the banana nut muffin Slim Fast snack bars. In fact, I like those even better! Hence the 4 stars for this product. I would have given it five, but relative to the banana nut muffin bars, these are a 4, at least for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warren Zevon's Third Great Album In A Row","review":"BAD LUCK STREAK IN DANCING SCHOOL is Warren Zevon's third great album in a row. Zevon had gone clean and sober for the first time when this CD was recorded, and it didn't dull his sense of humor one bit. On the title track, he examined his bad habits in a sarcastic manner which anyone with ANY addiction (drugs, alcohol, tobacco, food, caffeine) can understand, while \\"Jungle Work\\" humorously describes mercenary violence in a way that inspired me to do what I need to in order to remind myself that \\"carb\\" stands for the names of four politicians who support such actions (Cheney, Ashcroft, Rumsfeld, Bush). The other songs are all great, too, and you should pick up this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Release","review":"This release by Warren Zevon is an interesting cross section. Although it lacks some of the chart hits of earlier releases, there are still some nuggets. The title cut and opening number has an ironic twist, that Warren sings with absolute conviction. The cover of \\"A Certain Girl\\" seethes with angst, as Warren barks the lyrics. \\"Jungle Work\\" has an African rhythm chant as a chorus. \\"Play it All Night Long\\" references a familiar Southern rock anthem. Warren shares songwriting credits on \\"Jeannie Needs a Shooter\\" with Bruce, and the story differs. Some say that Bruce came up with the song title, and Warren wrote the song around it. This is a release worth owning, but not as powerful as \\"Excitable Boy\\". I recommend it as the perfect companion to get a good feel for Warren's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Play them all night long!","review":"This album did not spawn many hits as 1978's EXCITABLE BOY did. On the cover we see the late Warren Zevon,who died of lung cancer in 2003,standing inside of a dancing studio filled with beautiful female students. The only memorable song is PLAY IT ALL NIGHT LONG,which would appear on the compilation,THE BEST OF WARREN ZEVON-A QUIET NORMAL LIFE. The lyrics are pretty much silly(\\"Grandpa pissed his pants again,he don't give a damn.\\"). How about \\"Grandpa's doing sister Sally,Grandma's dying of cancer now.\\"? Isn't that silly? PIALN is a ode to Lynyrd Skynyrd and their signature song SWEET HOME ALABAMA. Another lyric from the song is \\"play that dead band's song\\". Three LS members were killed in a plane crash in the seventies. The other songs are cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"WZ's best, but they all are (except \\"Wanted\\")","review":"Snippets of what could be Warren's missing symphony mix well into ten great songs that are pure Zevon. Full of vitality, it's a great example of how absurd (\\"Gorilla, You're A Desperado\\"), beautiful (\\"Empty Handed Heart\\") or angry (\\"Play It All Night Long\\") he could be, while also including the greatest sports-related song ever, \\"Bill Lee\\". Oh, yeah, and the Toussaint cover, \\"A Certain Girl\\", rules! Hey, they all rule!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A top jazz performer","review":"Johnny Smith is absolutely fabulous he has speed,skill,and a great sound.I have played guitar for many years and he has been a major influence to me.This cd is a must have for any jazz fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Jazz Standard for Any Jazz Library!","review":"This album was the 1952 Down Beat Jazz Record of the Year and is also considered by most jazz critics to be one of the top 20 albums of all time for any jazz collection. Whether you are listening to the superlatively sweet 'Moonlight In Vermont' or the up-tempo 'Jaguar' or 'Tabu' you are treated to Johnny's virtuosity as well as the all-star talent his is accompanied by on every cut. A must for every jazz lover or serious stundent of jazz and jazz guitar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Helpful Book","review":"I cannot agree with the glowing recommendations given this book. I found this book to be very disappointing, especially given the apparent 'how-to' nature of the title. Most of the book contains a rather withering critique of the party structure & operations in the authors' community during the 2004 election. While the complaints may be valid, it crosses the line between constructive criticism and finger-pointing. The prescription for rebuilding is very general, without the detailed point-by-point guidance that an inexperienced activist might need to pull off the desired result. Also, some of the proposals are beyond the scope of a local activist to accomplish in his or her own community, as they require changes in state or Federal law. In conclusion, there are many other references I would recommend over this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally found them","review":"Nice fit. Good construction and fabrics. Fine workmanship.

It was conceived and built at the depths of the Great Depression, at the height of Art Deco and it's importance to the nation at the time is impossible to quantify. The art of the complex is arguably the most important assemblage of Art Deco artwork in the world. This book is a fantastic tribute to Rockefeller Center and all the artists and craftsman that built it. The text is highly informative, without feeling like an academic dissertation and the images are very well presented, though frankly there could have been more. I highly recommend this book to anyone with any interest in Rockefeller Center or Art Deco."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Beginners","review":"This is a very basic book on fourteen of the most influential families in pueblo pottery:From Acoma: the Chino and Lewis familiesFrom Hopi: the Nampeyo familyFrom Santa Clara: the Gutierrez and Tafoya familiesFrom San Ildefonso: the Gonzales and Martinez families.There's a family tree with each grouping, indicating the sons and daughters who are potters. The book is full of photos of pottery, mostly in black-and white, with an occasional color photo.All in all, a good basic book, worth having at a low price, but also a bit outdated, since it was written in the 1970s and updated in the 1990s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, ... for beginners","review":"This is a nice little 112-page book, if you are completely new to pueblo pottery and know absolutely nothing about the most important pueblos and kinds of pots.But if you are further along than the beginning, I'd recommend, instead, gettingFourteen Families in Pueblo Pottery, which is far longer, discusses far more potters and pueblos and has a great deal more about the origins of each community and potting style.Fortunately, my copy cost only $4, including the shipping. For me, even that was not really worth it.If you are a beginner, though, that $4 would be a very good investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A too-well kept secret","review":"Ann Reed is among my favorite singers, yet few people I know have heard of her because she prefers to stay in her native Minnesota and her music is hard too find. It's a shame. She's an excellent songwriter and quitarist with a rich, velvety voice. The songs on this album are primarily serious songs about relationships. She does these as well as anyone, with mature, never sappy, lyrics. I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because this is not my favorite of her albums. She has a wonderful sense of humor - song's on other albums include \\"Power Tools\\" (are a girl's best friend) and \\"Deep Fat Fryin' (don't do it in the nude). Her \\"Heroes\\", which lists her sheroes, is truly inspiring. This album lacks that sparkle and reminds me of a John Gorka album. It's mellow and satisfying, but doesn't knock my socks off."},{"rating":"1","title":"World Soccer, yea right","review":"There is no soccer. The teams are entirely fictional. There is no game.

Like industrial? What kind? This cd has almost all genres covered within the industrial/darkwave community. It has guitar, the techno beat, distorted vocals, a depressing mood of music, and overall, great songs. This cd is for many, but not all. It's obvious that this CD would be one of the best of this band's work, considering the songs came off of there unreleased projects before hand.

I luv it is all I can say and isn't it true that all you need is luv. I am 16 in the year 1999 and wish to say that there are few bands who have even come close to reaching as many fans or pioneering so much music as the Beatles. There are a bunch of bands that I hate and not so many that I luv. The Blue album and Red album are great listening cuz they skim gently over the evolution of the Beatles and my question is who want's to listen to 12 cds on end instead of hearing it all or most of it in 3 hours.

But it was these collections, \\"62-66\\" and \\"67-70\\" that made them accessible to me. It was like hearing a number one song, one right after the other. Thier music changed so dramatically in 6 years that a young listener can get confused with the different variations in sound. It's a little tough for some to go from \\"Love Me Do\\" to \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\".

But this is where the fun really begins.67-70 represents their studio years where they took their music to unimaginable heights(Strawberry Fields Forever, SGT PEPPER, Magical Mystery Tour) then they came crashing down(the white album, Let It Be)and went out in style(Abbey Road).Though a much better collection than 62-66(and you don't get shortchanged this time),these two sister albums represent the epitome of pop musician required listen for any musician to show them how its suppose to be done, as well as a must have for any music fan.

The idea is you choose 10...only 10...albums you would take with you if you stranded on a deserted island and these would be the ones you'd listen to until your demise. This is one of the popular ones used by cheaters (greatest hits collections aren't proper albums..it's the coward's way out of making tough choices that make the game fun to begin with) as it contains a large portion of essential rock songs of all-time.If you have NO clue who the Beatles are, this is a good one to use to decide if you'll be a fan. Most of their best material from 1967 on is here (except for the dubious inclusion of George Harrison's weak \\"Old Brown Shoe\\"...I'd rather have replaced it with \\"Piggies\\" from the \\"White Album\\" if they had to have a George song).Be forewarned, though...this is how addicts get started...4 1/2 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Once again, a great Starter kit","review":"Like I said with the review for the Red album, if you're just getting into the Beatles, no better place to start. Listen to it for the course of about 2-3 months and once you get the idea of what they're about and the direction of their music, then you can branch off onto the albums like \\"Revolver\\", \\"Sgt. Peppers\\", \\"Abbey Road\\", etc. you won't regret it for the rest of your life.If there was anything a person can do in their life, getting into the Beatles could defintely be one of the best (and smartest)choices you'll ever have to make"},{"rating":"1","title":"Country Classics","review":"I saw this product being advertized on PBS. With the video clips, it appeared much better than just sitting listening to it. O.K, it's the kind of music my parents listened too a LOT when I was a kid and I just wanted a little trip down memory lane. If you're into older country (which has it's advantages), this is for you. Some of the songs are surprisingly humorous and ALL of them tell a story worth thinking about. I knew what I was getting into when I bought it, so I can't complaint too much. Volume TWO, in my opinion, is better... If not for Glen Campbell, however, I'd probably put it away for a rainey day... Glen was absolutely great. So, incidentally, was Merle Haggard. I surprised myself liking his voice so much..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtle quintet","review":"This was Kenny Dorham's sole 5tet date with Coltrane, and he was inspired. No way complications with the pianist were going to get in the way of this unique session. KD didn't like \\"free\\" players, but it would be absurd to suggest that Cecil Taylor's \\"outside\\" harmonies would be any problem for him. Dorham made no claims as a virtuoso, but was unequivocal concerning his strong point: harmony. He felt he could deal with any harmony, whatever the changes; witness his work alongside Eric Dolphy on Andrew Hill's \\"Point of Departure\\".Louis Hayes and Chuck Israels give superb support and linkage. We find Coltrane working with the figures that would soon provide the climax of this period, with a few dates with Miles yet to come, before the quartet and My Favorite Things."},{"rating":"1","title":"pedestrian","review":"basically, a crummy album. Taylor seems to be playing in some catatonic state, perhaps in an effort to give Coltrane more room. However, the astonishing individuality one associates with these two masters is strangely absent as neither seems willing to take any chances. Kenny Dorham comes out looking the best in this set. The second and third tracks are virtually identical adding to the banality of this strange session. great Francis Wolff cover shot of trane though."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mile wide and an inch deep","review":"This book covers a tremendous amount of material, from code development, to market research, to employee relations, even how to sell your company after it becomes a success. Unfortunately, few subjects are covered in any depth, and even fewer offer any insights beyond the obvious. I will be returning this book. I suggest insteadMicro-ISV: From Vision to Reality, which is the best I've found for the coder trying to sell their software on the Web."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow, misleading chapter titles","review":"I read this book in the hope of discovering some words of wisdom regarding the marketing and development of software. Unfortunatley, the book contains very little business, selling or marketing advice that is specific to software, as opposed to any other industry.While the book talks at length about the process of developing, releasing and maintaining software, little of it is new or not obvious to anyone with even a couple of years experience in IT.Chapter eight, titled \\"Programming without Tears\\", has absolutely nothing about developing software, and instead has sections devoted to office politics, pay structures, and headhunters.The subject matter has great potential, but the book lacks insightful advice specific to the software industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome book","review":"This book is perfect for the beginner/intermediate woodworker who loves early American country furniture. All of the plans are either exact replicas or very close to the real thing. David's attention to detail is excellent. So far I've built about 7 of the pieces and am furnishing my home at a fraction of the cost of buying the real thing. I only wish he would print another volume with more projects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for the beginner","review":"This book has inspired me to excell my interrest in old American country furniture. It is so easy and well written that its truly a joy to read. The book leaves no unanswered questions on the progress of making furniture its all here in the book. I have never seen any book like it. Its like a cook book follow the receipy and you will have sucsess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent projects and commentary","review":"I found this book at the library and I marked so many projects that I knew it would be worth the investment(but it is out of print as of 3/99). Most projects are simple to build and represent utilitarian, functional design. Pictures are black and white. There are good notes and comments on the construction methods in addition to finishes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well told story","review":"While this is not the most captivating or engrossing religious fiction book that I have read, it is a very nice book that deserves a look. The book mainly follows two separate story lines, one of a candidate running for president of the United States and the sinister forces he discovers, and the other of a small group of people who work around a large city medical clinic and their personal relationships and religious discoveries. The storys and plots all come together very nicely in the end, and I think this book would be well enjoyed by many people."},{"rating":"2","title":"review for GATEKEEPER by Terry Craig","review":"This book (as well as the sequel) was so well written that I did not want to put it down till I was finished! The cast of characters are so vividly portrayed that you can easily picture them in your mind. They become so 'real' to you that you can hardly wait to see what happens to them next.Terry does an excellent job in her books, offering her readers everything from romance to suspense; action to real 'feel good' stuff, and everything in between. Yet how refreshing that all this is conveyed with good, clean, wholesome writing.The only thing that I regret is reaching the end of the books! I look so forward to reading the third book in the trilogy! And it is my sincerest hope that Terry goes on the write more books after that. She obviously has a great gift, one which I hope she will continue to share with all of us who so enjoy her work.These are definitely my kind of books! Thank you very much Terry for sharing them with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excited but sad","review":"This was a kindle edition download. I was excited to start reading it. However, about 1% into the book, it was blank...nothing until 7% of the book. I have no idea what went on in the story. I even tried erasing it from Kindle and redownloaded it from amazon. Same thing happened.Looked like a great story, but I have no idea. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put it down!","review":"Terry Craig's book is one of the better fiction novels I've read in a long time, both from the Christian and non-christian fiction wall. I would recommend it to saved and unsaved friends alike. I cannot wait until the next ones come out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Finally...","review":"A book that I can read over and over and over again and again and again and again. This is THE greatest book ever written!! Its content rivals that of the bible and the story is sheer genius. I can't wait until the movie comes out, I hope they potray the characters exactly the same way. I love this book and I wish some schools would start making this a required textbook instead of those EVILution books that make a mockery of my belief and all other christians. Buy the book and change your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best resource books available","review":"This is a \\"must\\" for every law office employee, including the lawyers! I would recommend buying this book for paralegal and secretarial departments as a skills booster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth seeking out!","review":"T.E.D Klien doesn't seem to haven't written much but whathe has written is brilliant. I guess its only his sparse output that prevents him being one of the best-known horror writers of moment. Dark Gods is a set of four equally novellas, my favourite being the one about a housewarming party that goes badly wrong (the title escapes me) but they're all equally good.Unlike other tediously formulaic horror writers (step forward Koontz, Saul, Laymon etc) this author does not rely on stereotypes and overblown descriptions of nastiness to cause chills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blonde NOT Red","review":"Pro-Smelled goodCons-Color Did not turn out red at all! My hair is now just Blonde, and less red from when I dyed it.

She is totally engrossed in the unfolding of Jane's story.Adopted Jane is one of those ageless, character filled books that you just don't forget. Daringer writes of an era, and the prejudice that exsisted towards orphans, from an age past.It's an excellent book for narration, if you home educate, and discussion - we were able to compare the adoption of a loved family member in more modern times with the process and feelings detailed in Adopted Jane.Jane's character shines through out the book and excels with the difficult end choice she must make; which home to be adopted into?If your young reader has enjoyed Understood Betsy, or Anne of Green Gables, there's a good chance that this book will resonate with them too."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was adopted and read this book as a child.","review":"I agree with Noel Piper. I have often thought about my idea that people might not like me but they could need me and that was a safer path, to be useful. I got the idea from this book. I am 60 now and this idea has stayed with me all my life. I felt Jane was right to distrust the happiness she had in the home with a friend who was like a sister. It would not have lasted. They would have gotten tired of her. Better to be needed. I am surprised that this is still in print. Sort of an older view of the world. I must say I have never forgoten it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The talent of Marina Lima","review":"Marina Lima is undoubtless the musa of the modern brazilian music. With an extrardinary musical career that goes beyond singing she manages been a powerful songwriter and producer too. Marina Lima is a must have, compelling and an essential album to anyone who loves quality and talented music. You dont need to understand what she's singing (portuguese) just feel the vibration and power of her raspy and sensual voice. Go and get your copy now, you won't regret!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mule Bluegrass","review":"We attended the MULE concert in St.Louis, MO at The Pagaent last night and it ROCKED!! Before the show opened up the band was jammin' some bluegrass music. After a few minutes it occurred to all of us that all of the songs were MULE songs done in bluegrass music style. I loved it. I went up where they were selling merchandise at the show and asked if they had this CD for sale. Unfortunately, they did not. So I hopped online at my first opportunity to see who the heck made this cd and where I could buy it. I really enjoy bluegrass anyway. This CD combines MULE, who I love, and bluegrass which I've always enjoyed. At the show I was able to listen to the cd in it's entirity and it is AWESOME!! I gave the CD a 4 star rating because the only thing better than bluegrass MULE is the REAL MULE! I recommend it to everyone! Gotta go....I'm on my way out to snag a copy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb docu about a counter-culture hero","review":"This is just superb! One and a half hours of brilliant film making about a modern day hero. Sinclair was a scapegoat for the Nixon administration but proved that if enough folk rise up against the powers that be, things can change - includes great footage from both then and now, some truly brilliant muisc [MC5, John and Yoko, Sinclair's own Jazz ensemble etc.] dynamic interviews and a wholly professional edit, this must rank as one of the year's finest documentary films. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dave Aranda-Richards only true actor in this video","review":"Very good special effects, but mediocre acting. Only true professional appears to be Governor Quincy played by Dave Aranda-Richards, and the so-called director kills him off and the acting then gets ridicoulsly bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"How I wasted 2 hours of my day.","review":"Totally stupid...........I wanted to see more of Athena Massey but there were only a few shots of her.

One of the few books that is so full of profound observations it holds up well after several re-readings. Sutphen has a talent for using few words to transmit life-changing messages of overcoming our individual blocks to happiness and fulfillment. All this and a bargain price to boot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I read the first edition of this book in graduate school as it was required reading.","review":"It is the essential primer on how beauracracies function and dysfunction in policy making and policy execution. While serving as a graqduate fellow at the Department of State I saw its principles in action countless times. It is not popular reading for the average person, but if you are part of or interact with the U.S. government this book provides invaluable insights."},{"rating":"2","title":"French magnetic Poetry kit","review":"I did not know what to expect but was thrilled with this purchase!

Great author."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book, good moral dilemma","review":"This series started out as ok/good space opera, and has moved on to something much better. I won't give away the plot, but there is a very real moral dilemma where the characters more or less accidentially start a major war that they have no choice but to continue and win, or even more lives will be lost.
